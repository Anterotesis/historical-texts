         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to keep company with the grossest sinner
(the Publicans) rather then with these; Because
<pb facs="tcp:46362:3"/>
themselves and others had so high an esteem of
them, and thought them righteous, by reason of
their grave and demure outsides, to make others
believe it was so, or rather <hi>better</hi> within, when
it was quite otherwise. He sought not Himself
nor his own glory, but the glory of his Father,
He <hi>endured the Cross,</hi> despised the shame; His
life was, to go about <hi>doing good,</hi> even to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
He would gladly have done good to the
proud Pharisees, but they could not endure him,
because he did not reverence and admire them,
(as others did) but dishonour them and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their <hi>nakedness</hi> and loathsome <hi>insides.</hi> Those
that are his servants, they in their measure, strive
to follow their Master in all good things; They
have the same <hi>spirit,</hi> Full of <hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hartedness</hi>
to all; Free and ready to do good,
they love all creatures for his sake, they can see
no creature in want, but their bowels <hi>Yearn</hi> to
help them, being much troubled, if they have
not wherewith to supply their wants.</p>
                  <p>These indeed (like their Master) can <hi>Welcome</hi>
the Crosse, yea <hi>kisse</hi> the Crosse every day, and
expect, bearing of the <hi>Crosse</hi> in every thing they
do; whether they be Actions <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi>
in their <hi>Almes</hi> or <hi>Charities</hi> to men, or
their religious <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> to God;
They in all, bear the <hi>Crosse</hi> alwaies about them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore that of the <hi>Papists</hi> (to me) is a pretty
<pb facs="tcp:46362:4"/>
Embleme of these mens lives, in this regard
(though they abuse it in an <hi>external,</hi> outward,
foolish, and Superstitious way,) but the <hi>Morral
and signification</hi> to this purpose, is (by some)
very aptly applyed: <hi>Viz.</hi> Every thing they
have to do with, or what ever they begin
or go about, The <hi>Crosse,</hi> The <hi>Crusifix</hi> (as they
call it) must be made upon it, when they <hi>rise</hi>
or when they go <hi>to bed,</hi> or whatever they do
they will not forget that; so is it very truly
and really applyed to these men, And the more
they esteem themselves <hi>Blessed;</hi> for the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
think themselves Blessed by doing it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally,
and the fewer Crosses they use, the
more (they think) are their curses.</p>
                  <p>But in this sence, I am sure tis a real
truth, That these Self-denied <hi>Little-Ones</hi>
know by experience, (then whom <hi>for any</hi> to
offend, <hi>it were far better for him, That a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
were hanged about his neck, and sunk headlong
to the bottome of the Sea)</hi> That the more of the

Hatred, but they having <hi>found the Pearl
of great price</hi> (of invalluable price) they
slight all, <hi>Sell All, for this Pearl;</hi> For they

in good earnest, as it is Prov. 4. Wisdome, <hi>is
the principal thing,</hi> therefore say they, I must
(what ever I do) get <hi>Wisdome;</hi> for all my

wilt search for it as men search <hi>for silver,</hi>
and dig for it, <hi>as for Hidd Treasures;</hi> For
(believe it) These are of infinite more value;
These are <hi>Everlasting, Eternal, Durable</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
The other are not so: But the men of
the world they esteeme <hi>silver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> and
such like, to be their Highest <hi>Riches;</hi> and
therefore all their <hi>Loves Mights</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
are to <hi>digg</hi> for them, but these souls
<pb facs="tcp:46362:5"/>
are quite contrary, and put <hi>worth</hi> upon
things of <hi>Worth</hi> indeed, <hi>The violent take this
Kingdome by force,</hi> (saith our Saviour) Nor
can it be gotten other waies; This <hi>life</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be obtained without strong <hi>Affections</hi> to
it, Not with sitting still, nor in a general
and formall road of profession, it will not
fall into our laps, nor is it gotten by pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
over a few cold prayers; but it must
be <hi>Esteemed, Prized, Loved</hi> above all things,
else it will never bee laid hold on, none
else shall ever come neare it; if any other thing
take off your Eye, or your Love from the
persuit thereof, you immediately lose the
very sight of it. He that <hi>findeth this life,</hi>
he indeed <hi>findeth life. Wisdome loveth them that
love her, and those that seek her early, shall find her,
Riches and honour are with her, yea durable Riches
and righteousness.</hi> But he that sinneth against
her, (or neglecteth her) <hi>hateth his own soul.</hi>
And this is the finall conclusion he makes;
Proverbs 8. 36. <hi>All that hate me love
death;</hi> yet know, <hi>it is the Lord that worketh
all our works in us, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These laborious Sermons do sweetly discover

are <hi>void</hi> of understanding, and to the men
of this world; but to all such (though fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with knowledge) who are without the
true knowledge of God, even to all out of

natural man receiveth not the things of the

uncapable of such Doctrines; for St. <hi>Paul</hi>
saith of such, that God <hi>will destroy the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the wise, and will bring to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the wisdom of this world?</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>And it is certain, that the profound

and <hi>seek after wisdom;</hi> that is, such as is

be preached, he is to the <hi>Iews</hi> (and most
learned men) a <hi>stumbling-block,</hi> and <hi>unto
the Gentiles foolishness.</hi> And St. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith

for Christ, and yet in all their <hi>sufferings,</hi>
went off <hi>Conquerours:</hi> these found that
<hi>pearl,</hi> slighted <hi>all,</hi> and parted <hi>with all</hi> to
get this pearl: <hi>Behold, here is the faith and
patience of the Saints,</hi> Rev. 13. 9.</p>
                  <p>And of this Author we may say, he
was one that sought after <hi>wisdom,</hi> and
found it, for he <hi>knew</hi> the <hi>merchandize</hi> of
it to be <hi>better then the merchandize of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and the gain thereof then fine gold,</hi>
Prov. 1. 4. and 8. And he would often
say, that he desired to be acquainted
with men who had <hi>experience</hi> of Christ,
rather then men of notions or speculations,
that desired to act more then to talk; and
he did in his <hi>publick</hi> preaching averr it, that
though they were never so <hi>mean, poor,</hi> and
<hi>despised</hi> by the world, yet if they were
but acquainted <hi>with such experimentall
truths</hi> as these, they were <hi>more welcome
to him</hi> then so many <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Potentates;</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:46362:9"/>
and we hope <hi>his labours</hi> of the like stamp,
will find the like <hi>welcom</hi> with such as
are <hi>experienced</hi> and <hi>practised</hi> in these <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
truths: And to such <hi>Auditors</hi> he
desired to <hi>preach</hi> to, and be acquainted
with, that he might confirm them in the
grace of God. We may say here of him,
and of such high-raised truths, as the
Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Isa. 28. 9, 10. <hi>Whom shall
we teach knowledge, and whom shall we make
to understand doctrine? those that are wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the milk, and drawn from the breasts;
for precept must be upon precept, precept upon
precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a
little and there a little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And such was the counsel of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
when any came to him, either <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi>
or full of <hi>literal knowledge,</hi> who
usually are <hi>full</hi> of questions: yet are also
very ignorant (saith he) as to <hi>Self-denial,
Annihilation</hi> and <hi>Resignation,</hi> which his
<hi>discerning spirit</hi> soon perceived in <hi>reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
with them: sometimes alledging to
them that of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that when any
Scholler <hi>came to enter himself</hi> under him,
he would <hi>enjoyn</hi> them to ask <hi>no question</hi>
in three years, so that he might teach
them <hi>as he found them able</hi> to receive; and
<pb facs="tcp:46362:9"/>
at three years end, they might <hi>then ask
him any question,</hi> but then <hi>they had none to
ask,</hi> for he had satisfied all their <hi>doubts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or suppose (said he) there were before
you as much <hi>meat</hi> as you could eat <hi>in a
moneth,</hi> if I should enjoyn you to eat it
<hi>all at a meal</hi> or two, instead of <hi>nourishing,</hi> it
would destroy you: whereas if I gave you
<hi>a moneth to eat it,</hi> taking your <hi>meals</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
and <hi>digesting</hi> them, it would do
you <hi>much</hi> good, <hi>nourish, refresh</hi> and
<hi>strengthen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And a <hi>narrow-mouthed vessel,</hi> which
holds much in the <hi>continent,</hi> you may
fill it with <hi>precious liquor,</hi> and so preserve
it, if you pour it in <hi>as it can receive:</hi> but
if ye pour in <hi>too fast,</hi> ye <hi>spil</hi> and <hi>spoil</hi> that
which hereafter <hi>may support</hi> your life:
Nor do we put <hi>young</hi> Schollers to learn
<hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> at the <hi>first entrance,</hi> but
we <hi>instil</hi> learning <hi>by degrees,</hi> as they are
able to <hi>suck</hi> in and <hi>receive:</hi> with these and
such like expressions would he perswade
them <hi>to wait with patience, till God were
pleased to reveal:</hi> and the same <hi>counsel</hi> do
we give to all who cannot be satisfied
<hi>presently</hi> with these things, but let them
<hi>read, ponder</hi> and <hi>wait;</hi> and those that
<pb facs="tcp:46362:10"/>
                     <hi>hunger and thirst shall be filled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And truly, they are but (as St.</hi> Iohn <hi>and</hi>
Ieremy <hi>say)</hi> One of a City, and two of a Tribe,
that shall come to Zion, <hi>who can attain</hi> this
salvation; <hi>few there be</hi> that enter <hi>into this
strait gate:</hi> For wide is the gate, and broad
is the way that leadeth unto destruction, and
many there be that go in thereat: but strait is
the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth
unto life, and few there be that finde it.</p>
                  <p>And in reading these Sermons, you may
observe the Author <hi>cuts his way</hi> clear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween;
First, the meer <hi>Rationalist,</hi> who
will square out God according to his own
reason, or else he is no God: and herein
also including the Formalist: and Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the <hi>Familist,</hi> who saith he lives above
Ordinances, and so hath quite left all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and by degrees hath turned licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Ranter: which are the <hi>main</hi> points
now in agitation, and the two <hi>great</hi> rocks
against which <hi>so many</hi> (either against the
<hi>one,</hi> or the <hi>other)</hi> have <hi>split</hi> their vessels in
these days: But the Author <hi>so clearly</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishes,
that he misseth <hi>both Rocks,</hi> and
carries on <hi>the truth Amain</hi> with <hi>Top-sail</hi>
against all <hi>battery</hi> and <hi>opposition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here ye shall finde <hi>the vail rent,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:46362:10"/>
the <hi>last shadows</hi> vanishing, and some <hi>Rayes</hi>
of the glory of the <hi>holiest of all</hi> appearing,
being <hi>hid from ages and generations, but
in these last times,</hi> upon the <hi>bringing in the
fulness of the Gentiles,</hi> and for the <hi>calling of
the Iews,</hi> more brightly breaking forth;
revealing the <hi>mystery</hi> of the Scriptures,
or the <hi>marrow</hi> of the true word of God,
<hi>which endureth forever:</hi> wherein the <hi>Life</hi>
and <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Holy</hi> Word is <hi>clearly</hi>
distinguished from the <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>killing</hi>
letter, <hi>comparing spiritual things with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual;</hi>
that all those <hi>errors, differences, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings</hi>
and bitter censurings, so much
broken forth of late, occasioned <hi>by rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the letter,</hi> may now <hi>vanish</hi> and make
<hi>haste</hi> before the <hi>presence</hi> of the Lord, <hi>and
the glory of his coming, whose fan is in his
hand, and he will throughly purge his floor,
and gather the wheat into his garner, but will
burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire:
And will baptize</hi> his own people <hi>with his
own Spirit, with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Howbeit, we speak wisdom <hi>onely</hi> among them
that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this
world, nor of the Princes of this world,
which comes to nought: But we speak the
wisdom of God in a <hi>MYSTERY,</hi> even the
<pb facs="tcp:46362:11"/>
hidden wisdom, which God hath ordained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world unto our glory, which none of
the princes of this world knew, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is written,</hi> Eye hath not seen, nor ear
heard, neither hath entred into the heart of
man, the things which God hath prepared
for those that love him, having revealed
them unto us by his spirit. And if in this
life onely we had hope in Christ, we were of
all men most miserable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. We
are fools for Christs sake, but ye are wise: we
are weak, but ye are strong, ye are honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but we are despised, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10. Let
no man deceive himself; if any man among
you seemeth to be wise in this world <hi>(or to
himself)</hi> let him become a fool, that he may
be wise, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. For the preaching of
the CROSSE is to them that perish foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but unto us which are saved, it is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God, <hi>verse</hi> 18. But the foolishness of God
is wiser then men, and the weakness of God is
stronger then men, <hi>verse</hi> 25. He that is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
judgeth all things, yet he himself is
judged of no man, <hi>verse</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit searcheth all things, yea
the deep things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:46362:11"/>And the anointing which you have received
of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that
any man teach you: but as the same anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
teacheth you all things, and is truth and

shall abide in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27.</p>

publishing these <hi>Sermons,</hi> so there <hi>are</hi>
also in bringing them to light <hi>now:</hi>
The time when they were preached
was in the dayes of the <hi>last</hi> Bishops,
who endeavoured <hi>the strangling</hi> of
many Truths in the birth, as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
the children of Israel, lest
they should <hi>increase</hi> and <hi>multiply,</hi> to <hi>discover and suppress</hi>
their deeds of darkness; to that end <hi>High-Commissioning</hi>
many precious and <hi>bright-shining lights,</hi> whereof this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
was in the number, laying (as their manner was)
many <hi>foul things to</hi> their charge, <hi>which they never knew</hi>
(as <hi>David</hi> said of himself, by his enemies) <hi>thereby</hi> making
a great <hi>noise</hi> to amuze the people, in medling with
such men, and to colour their wicked <hi>designes</hi> (for the
suppression of <hi>light, and men of light)</hi> as if they were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>foul Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>foul life,</hi> or both; and though they
could <hi>prove nothing</hi> against them, yet keeping them in
their Courts, <hi>if possible,</hi> to <hi>aw</hi> and <hi>vex</hi> them, if they could
not <hi>suppress</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>The Author hereof being spotless in either, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
since God <hi>in a special and extraordinary manner</hi> appeared
to him, <hi>in him,</hi> in his <hi>latter</hi> dayes; for he conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 4. 17, 18.<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 17, 18.</note> that in the dayes of his
former ignorance and vanity, he walked <hi>as other Gentiles,</hi>
and as men <hi>living without God in the world, in the vanity
of his mind, having his understanding darkened, being
<pb facs="tcp:46362:18"/>
alienated from the life of God, because of the blindness of
his heart;</hi> which no doubt our merciful and <hi>ready-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning</hi>
God had forgiven, though men could not, or
would not forget, which he regarded <hi>not much,</hi> God
speaking <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>on</hi> to his soul.</p>
                  <p>But afterward he desired <hi>nothing more</hi> then to <hi>bring in</hi>
others, to see what <hi>he saw,</hi> and to enjoy what he <hi>enjoyed,</hi>
and to clear truth to them in either respect; he often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>averring,</hi> as to others, so to the <hi>Publisher</hi> hereof,
that his trouble was not for <hi>self-sufferings,</hi> but that truth
should be <hi>any way</hi> obstructed or defamed through him.</p>
                  <p>And he having once obtained of their Court, to refer
the accusations in either kind, but especially for <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
and for <hi>Conventicles</hi> (as they called them) kept
by him: <hi>to reason out</hi> his judgement, and what he had
delivered, with four Bishops, <hi>members</hi> thereof, or any
three of them: <hi>In this</hi> he rejoyced so, as in <hi>nothing more,</hi>
so he exprest (and we judge, and not without good
ground) he taking abundance of <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>travel</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this meeting; and several times procured <hi>two,</hi> but
never could get three of them together <hi>to confer</hi> with, and
to give an account of <hi>whatever</hi> had been delivered by
him, which That he might vindicate Truth much
<hi>hungred</hi> and <hi>thirsted</hi> for; what the cause may be of such
backwardness <hi>in them,</hi> we leave to others to judge of.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>it may be</hi> if they would have met, they might have
learned that <hi>which they</hi> never knew: For as <hi>truth</hi> is
strongest, so God had wonderfully <hi>come into him,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
himself by him, in his late years, and made him (as
it were) a <hi>Sampson,</hi> against the <hi>numerous</hi> Philistims, and
a <hi>David</hi> against the <hi>huge</hi> and mighty <hi>Goliahs</hi> of those
times: for <hi>even then,</hi> in his dayes, some of his <hi>acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>

following or hearing of him, except they came with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

and deportment, and fit to <hi>accompany</hi> such: so
he was also <hi>familiar</hi> even with the <hi>meanest,</hi> and if <hi>willing</hi>
to be <hi>taught,</hi> he was as willing to <hi>instruct</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> them;
and they were (upon this account) more welcome to him
then Lords or Princes, imitating the humble carriage of
his Lord and Master; he not thinking it any disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to accompany with the worst and lowest of men,
so he might do them good; for (he knew) he was not

                  </p>
                  <p>Insomuch, that those who were about him, either in
sickness or health, would often say, they gat more <hi>good
instruction</hi> from him <hi>in discourse,</hi> then by many <hi>Sermons</hi> of
other mens, he being still <hi>forward,</hi> if they were <hi>backward,</hi>
to take occasions <hi>to communicate</hi> some <hi>Divine</hi> truths, so
that he won their attention to hearken to him; as Christ
did <hi>Maries,</hi> who <hi>chose that better part,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 10. 42.</note> which should
never be taken from her: And when they were <hi>backward</hi>
to enquire of him, he would <hi>move them</hi> to ask him questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if they had any doubts or questions to propound
then; for (saith he) when I am <hi>gone,</hi> many will <hi>miss me;</hi>
therefore I desire you would make use of me, and get
what you can by me while I am here; and the more you
so do, the more welcome; but Christ, I know, will be
a Teacher to those that are his. He was also a man of a
<hi>choise, couragious</hi> and <hi>discerning</hi> spirit, endowed with <hi>skill</hi>
and <hi>depth of learniag,</hi> judgement and experience to <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi>
what God had (though but of late) revealed to him,
(as he often would say) <hi>affirming,</hi> he was <hi>now</hi> ashamed of
his <hi>former knowledge,</hi> expressions and <hi>preachings,</hi> even
since he <hi>commenced</hi> Dr. in Divinity; although he was
known to be <hi>a very</hi> great Scholar, and as good a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,

Jesus Christ, &amp; the Scriptures, more then <hi>Grammatically,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND therefore I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
and I much wonder at; That
<hi>precious</hi> Book lately printed, which
it may be, <hi>many of you</hi> have not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of, being Sermons prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by Dr. <hi>Everard,</hi> called <hi>Gospel-Treasures ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;</hi>
wherein, he among other Divine things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
this point in several of his Sermons, most
<hi>Divinely</hi> and <hi>Elegantly;</hi> and I could not <hi>but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it to you,</hi> having my self found so much
<hi>sweetness</hi> in it; and I wonder much at the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venliness</hi>
and <hi>sweetness</hi> of his spirit; for to me it
is <hi>as clear</hi> a piece as any I know extant; Setting
forth (as to this particular) the <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>deep</hi>
condescention of the Son of God, being God
<hi>equal with his Father,</hi> yet to stoop <hi>lower</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath</hi>
the unexpressible <hi>misery</hi> of man, to bring
him up again. He there shewing, that herein lay
<pb facs="tcp:46362:26"/>
the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>unconceivable</hi> sufferings of Christ,
far beyond his <hi>external</hi> sufferings of <hi>whipping, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling,
spitting upon, crowning with Thorns</hi> or his
<hi>crucifying</hi> upon the Cross, and the like; all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>far below</hi> and not worth the <hi>naming</hi> the
same day with <hi>these</hi> sufferings. And shewing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
how <hi>these things</hi> are to be also in <hi>every</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
And that this <hi>Liberty</hi> purchased by Christ,
is not to <hi>encourage</hi> the flesh, or to purchase <hi>liberty</hi>
for it; but 'tis for the <hi>inward</hi> man, and the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi>
And how, he once having such a <hi>principle</hi> of
life, he <hi>cannot</hi> give way to <hi>sin,</hi> but sin is <hi>his bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage;</hi>
and how the power of Christ <hi>in him</hi> slayes
all <hi>fleshly</hi> actings in the love of them; And that
all things <hi>of man</hi> shall be <hi>slain</hi> and <hi>crucified</hi> in
him by <hi>the death</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of God; And that
<hi>these are the things</hi> which shall be <hi>burnt up</hi> for
ever and ever <hi>with unquenchable fire.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
many self-wise <hi>Professors</hi> in the world are
<hi>offended</hi> at the Book, and stick not to <hi>asperse</hi> and
<hi>belye</hi> it with their <hi>common</hi> slanders of <hi>Error</hi> and
<hi>Heterodoxal</hi> opinions and the like: Yet we know
<hi>the World</hi> can do no other, but will belye <hi>the
Truth,</hi> as it alwayes hath done: And the <hi>more</hi>
Divine any truth is, the more they oppose it;
Why? Because the <hi>Light</hi> thereof <hi>Condemns</hi> their
Darkness, Sin, and Ignorance, and their Practices:
And they are not able to <hi>stand</hi> in, or <hi>bear</hi> the
Light thereof: For either they must <hi>Condemn</hi> the
Truth to <hi>justifie</hi> themselves, or else <hi>Condem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>
by the <hi>Truth,</hi> which they <hi>can never do,</hi> till
they are <hi>overcome</hi> and <hi>Captivated</hi> by the <hi>Truth.</hi>

                     <p>First, The nature of <hi>Fire is</hi> to <hi>burn: Fire</hi> cannot
<hi>burn it self;</hi> take notice of that, fire cannot <hi>burn</hi>
fire, but <hi>all things else</hi> it will burn and consume:

the day of his coming, &amp; who shall stand when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth?
for he is like refiners fire, and like fullers
sope?</hi> Christ is this fire; and let me tell you this
<hi>burning</hi> and <hi>consuming</hi> is for your <hi>good;</hi> it is that
out of the <hi>old ashes of the old man</hi> you may have
a <hi>new life,</hi>

                        </gap>, hath it <hi>burnt up thy OLD heaven and thy

and a <hi>new earth? 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 7.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 7.</note> Nay further, let me
aske thee, hath it thrown <hi>all thy gods in the fire?</hi>
hath it burnt up <hi>all</hi> thy idols? yet I tell ye, <hi>this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46362:30"/>
burning</hi> is not unto <hi>death,</hi> but unto <hi>life,</hi> as Christ
said of <hi>Lazarus, This sickness is not unto death;</hi> but
be sure that as the Lord Jesus Christ burneth up,<note place="margin">Joh. 11.</note>
and <hi>woundeth,</hi> so he <hi>healeth</hi> and maketh <hi>alive</hi>
again: <hi>I would and I heal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, the work of fire is <hi>to heat;</hi> so Christ
after he hath destroyed and <hi>burnt up</hi> all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
then he breathes into us a gentle <hi>warmth</hi>
and <hi>heat</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> Spirit to cherish and revive us
again, that so we may no longer <hi>live our own lives,</hi>
but the life of Christ.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The nature of fire is to <hi>give light:</hi>
when <hi>That day dawns</hi> to us that <hi>Christ comes into
the soul,</hi> we shall find, He brings <hi>light</hi> with him,
and this is called <hi>Christs day.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isaiah. 20. 3. and Joel 2. 10.</note> Our first <hi>day</hi> is our
<hi>own day,</hi> that is, <hi>a day of darkness, a day of gloomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and thick clouds;</hi> but the day of the Lord is
<hi>a terrible day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our flesh trembleth for fear of thee,
for who shall abide the day of thy coming, and who
shall stand when thou appearest? for thou art like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finers
fire and like fullers sope.</hi> When Christ comes
into the soul, <hi>he comes</hi> not onely with light to
discover, but <hi>like fire</hi> to burn up <hi>all that building</hi>
that we have made to our selves, and that <hi>we
have raised</hi> by our own power, and breathes
warmly and gently, by <hi>his</hi> Spirit, his <hi>own</hi> life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
by <hi>degrees</hi> he brings <hi>a glorious light</hi> into the
soul;<note place="margin">Acts 26. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>He then turns us from darkness to light, from
the power of Satan unto God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And all this is done <hi>by one and the same act in
God,</hi> although those acts be <hi>divers</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> in
the creature; that is, <hi>the same act in God,</hi> which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46362:31"/>
comes to the <hi>obstinate</hi> and <hi>perverse,</hi> and <hi>hardens</hi>
them; which comes to the <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>meek</hi> and
<hi>softens</hi> them; <hi>the same act in him, Hardens, and
Softens,</hi> as the <hi>Sun</hi> doth <hi>wax</hi> and <hi>clay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That same God which was <hi>darkness</hi> at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> was <hi>light</hi> in the top of the
<hi>Mount:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 19. 16.</note> He is <hi>the same God in himself to all,</hi> but
he works <hi>diversly</hi> in regard of the creatures; He is
the same God in a <hi>frozen</hi> and hard heart, as he is in
a repenting and <hi>bleeding</hi> soul; but to the one he
appears not, <hi>but in wrath and vengeance,</hi> ready to
take <hi>revenge</hi> on them for their sins; but to the
other he appears <hi>in mercy and love, and marries
himself to them,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hos. 2. 19.</note> he communicates <hi>to them</hi> his
sweet loves, and their wills are swallowed up in
his; and these <hi>onely</hi> are they that can say in truth,
<hi>Not my will, but thine be done;</hi> but the other, they
cannot forsake themselves,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 39.</note> their own will, their
own ends: but this is but by the way.</p>
                     <p>And this you see in brief, what the fire is; <hi>Our
God is a consuming fire.</hi> But now what is the salt?<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 29.</note> I
know it is divers wayes taken and expounded: Some take it to be wisdom and discretion in
speech; and for proof they cite that place of the
Apostle, <hi>Let your speech be alwayes gracious, seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with salt;</hi> for so <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>A wise man may
hold up his head before Princes;</hi> and they give this
reason,<note place="margin">Col. 4. 6.</note> As salt keeps things from stinking, so doth
wisdom so salt and season a mans words,<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 21.</note> that his
words may not be unsavoury to wise men,<note place="margin">Eccl. 8. 1.</note> so that
he is not <hi>laught to scorn.</hi> Others take it for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and sincerity in life and conversation; as our

Saviour saith, <hi>Ye are the salt of the earth,</hi> Mat. 5.

and seasons them with <hi>salt,</hi> and makes them <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury</hi>
to God and to men.</p>
                     <p>But to be short, and without <hi>any more</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
(that we may come to the <hi>matter</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
The <hi>fire</hi> and the <hi>salt</hi> are both one, and that is
Christ himself as I have told you; He is the <hi>fire:</hi>
so, He is the <hi>salt;</hi> as the Apostle saith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11.
<hi>Both he that sanctifyeth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>and they who are sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
are all one:</hi> So Jesus Christ he is <hi>the fire</hi> that
salteth, and <hi>the salt wherewith</hi> it <hi>salteth,</hi> as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
in the verse before the Text.</p>
                     <p>Indeed I confess, the Apostles also were called
<hi>Salt,</hi> Mat. 5. 13.<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Ye are the Salt of the earth</hi> (saith
Christ himself) not that they were the <hi>Salt</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or the <hi>salt</hi> indeed, but they were those
which <hi>uttered</hi> the salt; they <hi>taught</hi> salt, (as I may
say) and where rath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:46362:32"/>
those which <hi>sold</hi> and uttered <hi>the true salt,</hi>
(which is <hi>CHRIST)</hi> to the world: But I say of
them, as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 4, 5.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 4. 5.</note>
                        <hi>While one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am

                        <hi>or were you baptized in the name of
Paul?</hi> So say I, were the Apostles <hi>crucified</hi> for
you? are they those that <hi>suffered</hi> for you, and
<hi>redeemed</hi> you? are they those that are the <hi>Salt,
Life, Strength</hi> and <hi>Support</hi> to you? no, no, for
themselves had need of <hi>salting;</hi> therefore they
were not <hi>The Salt,</hi> but they were the <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
or <hi>Ministers</hi> which Christ used <hi>to convey</hi> to
us <hi>the true Salt,</hi> and in no other regard were they
called <hi>The salt of the</hi> earth.</p>
                     <p>And again, Christ saith (in the same sense)
<hi>Mat. 5. 14. Ye are the light of the world;</hi> and again

that <hi>which is his Sons</hi> own action <hi>and</hi> work in you;
<hi>else</hi> they stink and are abominable <hi>in his eyes; he
will not,</hi> he cannot regard <hi>them:</hi> The sacrifices of
the wicked are an abomination to him. <hi>The Devil
made as true, and as large a</hi> Confession <hi>of Christ, as
any man can do; look upon the</hi> words, <hi>and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
him that spake them, <hi>and you would think
they were</hi> the words of a Saint; O thou Iesus of

<hi>confession</hi> was without salt; <hi>it was not from a

from</hi> some self-ends. <hi>Therefore I have</hi> observed,
<hi>that the Devil (where he is worshipped) to</hi> imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<hi>God, hath brought in, in all his Sacrifices,</hi>
the use of salt: nay, so eminently <hi>true is this, that
as the Devils cry out and attest unto him, though
against their wills: so by their practice we may
note, that under</hi> salt, <hi>was hidden that great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
and secret of all Religion, by their great care</hi>
to use salt, <hi>thereby to</hi> imitate <hi>the worship of God,

                     <p>In this regard (salt having such an healing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
for all wounds, poisons, diseases) Christ is
<hi>more truly salt</hi> to the soul, then <hi>salt</hi> is to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;

When he was here upon earth in the flesh, <hi>no

No alas, this is the way to <hi>destroy</hi> your selves;

<hi>but when he pleaseth to discover himself, then
it follows in the next verse,</hi> At the brightness

and coals of fire: <hi>then the Lord was seen
and heard,</hi> for he thundred in the heaven, and the

                        <hi>He it is</hi> that turneth the Nations of the
world upside down; it was at his rebuke, at the
blast of the breath of his nostrils that the earth
shook, and trembled, and coals were kindled by it.
<hi>So also he saw that it was God</hi> who sent from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
out of heaven, his holy place, and took him out
of his troubles, out of many waters, and delivered
him from his strong enemy, and he brought him out
into a large place, <hi>and so goes on in that 18.

                     <p>Now that I may come to <hi>unfold</hi> and <hi>unlock</hi> those

                     <p>1 What manner of knowledge this is, that
the Apostle so <hi>Highly sets it up even above all
knowledge,</hi> so that <hi>he himself</hi> was contented to
be <hi>accounted nothing,</hi> so he could but <hi>gain</hi> more
of that among them, or bring them to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it?</p>
                     <p>2 What is the subject of this knowledge?
that is, Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>3 What it is to know Jesus Christ crucified?
(as it is here meant.)</p>
                     <p>

Christ</hi> Externally, <hi>nor to know him so</hi> Crucified:
<hi>No, though they had been</hi> eye-witnesses <hi>of it, yet
this</hi> knowledge <hi>was nothing: for (sayes the
Apostle)</hi> Henceforth know we no man any more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the flesh,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 16.</note> no, though we had known the LORD
CHRIST himself: <hi>Yet I know, if I should</hi> ask
<hi>any of you; or take you</hi> one <hi>by</hi> one <hi>and ask you,
If you knew Jesus Christ? You would presently</hi>
answer <hi>me to this, and tell me a</hi> large story, <hi>that
this was your</hi> faith, <hi>and that you did</hi> confidently
<hi>believe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Math. 1.</note> That in the fulness of time God sent an

that he wrought many miracles, and taught such
doctrine that many wondered at the gracious words
that proceeded out of his mouth. <hi>And at last,</hi> he was
apprehended, examined, scourged, buffeted, spit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto
him that dyed for them. Wherefore <hi>(saith he in

Christ wrought in thy heart, by the power of himself.</hi>
Even like unto Flowers or Herbs, or any other
thing that grows on the ground by the <hi>heat</hi> and
<hi>power</hi> of the Sun: if there be not something com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to them from the Sun, that is of the
Suns <hi>own nature,</hi> they grow not at all, but they
wither and dye; if the Sun <hi>warm</hi> them not and
comfort them, they grow not, but dye. So if there
be not in every one of us something of Jesus Christ
that is of his <hi>own nature, the same mind, the same
quickning Spirit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 15.</note> the same disposition, and the same
<hi>new nature,</hi> something of his own <hi>off-spring,</hi> we
are but in a dead and perishing condition; all that
ever we know otherwise, is meer <hi>folly</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard;
be their knowledge never so excellent and
glorious to those <hi>who have</hi> not Jesus Christ in
them.</p>

                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:46362:54"/>As that wicked Pope said when he had shewed
such a vast treasure of riches, See (saith he) <hi>how
that Fable of Iesus Christ hath inriched me:</hi> So to
these men, what ever they talk of Jesus Christ and
of the knowledge of him, to <hi>them</hi> the true Christ is
a <hi>meer fable, a meer tale:</hi> as he thought outwardly
to inrich him, so they think this Fable of a <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Christ</hi> hath and will enrich their souls. But
except we know Christ feelingly, experimentally,
so that he <hi>lives</hi> within us <hi>spiritually,</hi> his own <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
life, insomuch that whatever any man hath
known in the <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>History</hi> of him, that he
know the same within him, as truly done actually
in <hi>his own soul,</hi> as ever Christ did any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him in the days of his <hi>flesh,</hi> else it profit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
And to find all that ever you <hi>read</hi> of him
to be <hi>verified</hi> in you experimentally: It is not
Jesus Christ without us can do us any good; he
is no <hi>Christ, to us,</hi> all his actions are in <hi>vain,</hi> to us,
they are all as a <hi>meer tale,</hi> a meer <hi>song,</hi> to us. As
one of the Fathers said, It was not that Christ that
the Virgin <hi>Mary carryed in her womb,</hi> that did
save her, but <hi>that Christ</hi> that she carried in her
heart.</p>
                     <p>And our Saviours own words express as much,
<hi>Not blessed is the womb that bare thee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>and the
paps that thou hast sucked; but blessed are they that
hear the word of God and kept it.</hi> They that would
have any benefit by Jesus Christ, <hi>they must have
him in their hearts, Born within them:</hi> not only
to know that Christ was born at <hi>Bethlehem, but
born in them,</hi> and not to know onely that Christ
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46362:55"/>
dyed <hi>at such a time,</hi> so many years ago; this will
do you no good, except you experimentally <hi>find</hi>
and <hi>feel,</hi> how he is <hi>crucified, dead,</hi> and <hi>buried</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you.</p>
                     <p>Let no man (what ever he be) delude you, and
make you believe that any other Christ will save
you. Let no man <hi>upon pain of the salvation and
damnation of his soul,</hi> once dare to think <hi>that any
other Christ</hi> will do him any good; and that he
experimentally feel Jesus Christ <hi>risen again</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him; and all other <hi>actions</hi> that ever he did,
that still <hi>he finds him doing</hi> the same in him: as
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>My beloved, of whom I travel in

<hi>that he was conceived in the womb of a Virgin,</hi> but
that thou art <hi>that virgin,</hi> and that he is <hi>more truly

brought forth within thee; when thou beginnest
to see and feel all those <hi>Mighty, powerful, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful</hi>
actions <hi>done in thee,</hi> which thou <hi>readest</hi> he

                        <hi>and to day, and the same
for ever:</hi> There is not <hi>one Christ</hi> without us,

                     <p>Beloved, you know it is said of <hi>Abraham,</hi> He

for any comfort by Iesus Christ, we must see <hi>his
day</hi> also. The Jews <hi>saw the day of Christ</hi> in the

<hi>Abraham</hi> did: Thou must as really, <hi>yea, more
really and more truly</hi> See Christs day, then the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46362:56"/>
Jews;<note place="margin">John 8. 56.</note> for sayes Christ, <hi>Abraham saw my day, and
rejoyced;</hi> and in the same manner <hi>shall all</hi> that
ever shall taste of heaven, <hi>See, The same day of
Christ.</hi> Did the Jews see the <hi>day</hi> of Christ in the
<hi>flesh?</hi> did they see him <hi>work</hi> miracles? opening
the <hi>eyes</hi> of the <hi>blind,</hi> yea, of those <hi>born blind,</hi> and
curing the <hi>deaf,</hi> and the <hi>lame,</hi> and the <hi>dumb:</hi>
why (as if our Saviour should have said) you <hi>think</hi>
you see <hi>my day?</hi> but if you see me <hi>but externally,</hi>
doing this action, you see not <hi>my day: Abraham</hi>
that lived so many hundred years ago, <hi>he saw my
day truly,</hi> and <hi>rejoyced:</hi> He saw me do <hi>all</hi> these
works in <hi>himself;</hi> he did <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really</hi> see me
cast out devils, raise the dead, open blind eyes,
heal and cure all the diseases of his soul; he saw
me to be the Messiah and Saviour to himself and
in himself; he <hi>saw my day</hi> better then you, and
<hi>rejoyced to see me</hi> do all these <hi>mighty</hi> works
in him: and <hi>the self-same day</hi> must we see, if
ever we come to be <hi>partakers of Iesus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> and of the
Divine nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> saw not <hi>his day</hi> (as some think) so
much by way of prophesie, as it is commonly
taken and expounded, that he was <hi>the Messiah</hi>
that <hi>should come</hi> into the world: but he (besides
this) saw <hi>done in himself,</hi> that which he did when
he came in the flesh: And so <hi>Abraham</hi> saw my
day, He saw me <hi>conceived, born, brought up;</hi> yea
he saw me <hi>apprehended, scourged, crucified;</hi> He
saw me <hi>dead, and buried, and risen again,</hi> and all
in himself: This was <hi>a true,</hi> a real, a <hi>saving</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christs day. To see it by way of prophesie,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46362:56"/>
was <hi>far below</hi> this seeing; that was a seeing
did <hi>Abraham</hi> (nor will do you) little good: If
it were meant <hi>of that kind</hi> of seeing, <hi>the Iews saw
Christ better then</hi> Abraham; for they saw him
<hi>actually, personally,</hi> but that was a <hi>fruitless
seeing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore if you will see Christ <hi>gloriously,</hi> as
the <hi>Great and Mighty</hi> Saviour, we must see him
such a Saviour,<note place="margin">Isa. 9. 6, 7.</note> as we may say of him, <hi>Unto us a
Son is born, unto us a child is given: ye shall call
his name Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God,
the everlasting father, and the Prince of Peace, and
the Government shall be upon his shoulders:</hi> And
all this I find and feel in my own soul; and in me,
and to me is all this done.</p>
                     <p>But Beloved, <hi>give me leave,</hi> that you may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
me, <hi>if it shall please God</hi> to open your

are kept close from ages, and from generations:</hi> I
will in the plainest manner that I can, <hi>shew you</hi>
how Jesus Christ is said to be <hi>in you:</hi> that is, when
he <hi>so</hi> begins to <hi>arise</hi> in you,<note place="margin">Mark 1. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>that his fame spreads
far and near,</hi> when he shews his own actions in
you: for know this, <hi>Christ is alwayes in you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> he
is at <hi>no time</hi> absent; as soon as ever ye began to
have a <hi>being,</hi> he was in you in regard of himself,
though you saw him not, because he is <hi>Infinite;</hi>
For, That which is <hi>infinite,</hi> is in all places, it is
<hi>excluded</hi> out of <hi>no</hi> place: for if any <hi>place,</hi> if any
<hi>creature</hi> were without <hi>him,</hi> he were not <hi>infinite:</hi>
And because he is <hi>infinite, he is equally present</hi>
in all places <hi>at once,</hi> and in all places alike: he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46362:57"/>
cannot be <hi>more</hi> in one place then another; for if
he should, he could not be <hi>infinite:</hi> and because
he is infinite, he is <hi>all-present</hi> in <hi>all places</hi> at
once.</p>
                     <p>These things are out of all question, and known
by every one <hi>that understands</hi> any thing: I think
none will <hi>deny</hi> them. He is as well in a <hi>dead</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
branch, as in a <hi>green</hi> flourishing tree; but
in the <hi>living branch</hi> we see him <hi>grow</hi> and put
forth <hi>his life:</hi> And so likewise he is in the deadest,
rottenest member that is, as well as in the <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest</hi>
Christian: But here is the difference; in
the one we <hi>see</hi> him not, we see not his life and
fruit, but he is in <hi>such a member</hi> as dead; dead to
him, and dead (in appearance) to others, yea,
that member is,<note place="margin">Jude 12.</note> as it were, <hi>twice dead and pulled
up by the roots,</hi> as the Apostle saith, <hi>and fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to be condemned to the fire:</hi> For Jesus
Christ, although he be in <hi>them,</hi> as much as in the
<hi>living</hi> bought, yet <hi>to them</hi> he is dead and buried,
and <hi>lives</hi> not in them, and to them.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>give me leave,</hi> and I will shew you in
some particular <hi>actions</hi> that Christ <hi>did</hi> and <hi>doth,</hi>
when He begins <hi>to live</hi> in a man; for till He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to shew the <hi>actions</hi> of life, He is, as if he were
not there. I will onely <hi>touch</hi> upon some of his
<hi>actions,</hi> which may be as a <hi>key</hi> to open and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the <hi>meaning</hi> of all the rest: for it is <hi>impossible</hi>
to speak <hi>of all the actions that he did and doth; for
the whole world were not able to contain that which
might be written of him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>John</hi> ult. &amp; ult.</note>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46362:57"/>
and down working daily,</hi> and <hi>doing</hi> good internally
and spiritually in the <hi>souls</hi> of men.</p>
                     <p>But the first <hi>motive</hi> that induceth, shews and
perswades us that Christ is <hi>alive</hi> in us, is his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</hi>
which you know in the <hi>dayes of his flesh</hi>
was first proclaimed <hi>by one</hi> Angel, and afterwards
by a <hi>whole quire</hi> of Angels.</p>
                     <p>When God hath sent this <hi>One</hi> Angel (or Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger)

                     <p>As when the Sun shines, you know it shews all

man is in the state of unregeneration, he can see
nothing above himself: but if it be any thing that
leads him <hi>to the love of himself,</hi> that he can see:
Heaven is <hi>welcome</hi> to him out of a <hi>self-love,</hi> and so

Christ in himself cannot grow <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>less,</hi> or

                        <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 20.</note> This is
to have Christ <hi>come</hi> into the soul; because before

there: But he being (I say) once come into the
soul, for we must make use of such expressions for

were cripple from the mothers womb, so that
they could not set <hi>one foot</hi> forward in his wayes,

                        <hi>till they come to a perfect stature,

                        <hi>and fulfil the desires of

may see in our selves the <hi>several effects of all those

is that <hi>crucifying,</hi> that all the external crucifyings
and deaths in the world <hi>are not sufficient</hi> to figure

consisted the sufferings of Christ, even as the

trampled upon and crucified <hi>both literally and

sufferings indeed,</hi> far beyond his bodily whipping,

brought into the world with us, <hi>Any thing that is</hi>
[US or [I] <hi>lives,</hi> Christ is whipt, his mouth is

as <hi>Reason</hi> lives, Christ is dead: As long as
our own <hi>Wills</hi> live, Christ is crucified: As long
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46362:72"/>
as our own <hi>knowledge</hi> lives, he is dead. He may
<hi>knock</hi> and <hi>knock</hi> long enough at the door of our
hearts, but we will not <hi>hear,</hi> we will not <hi>open</hi> to
him, &amp; he is as one dead to us, &amp; we dead <hi>to him.</hi>
Our ears are onely open, to hear the voice of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
&amp; the voice of flesh and self. Oh! here is <hi>a way</hi>
how thou shalt be made rich; Here is <hi>away</hi> how
thou shalt come to be Honourable; we are deaf,
except it be to these things: Oh! here is <hi>a way</hi>
how thou shalt come to be esteemed a wise man,
a Famous Professor; How thou shalt be set up,
and esteemed, and <hi>every</hi> one shall <hi>speak</hi> Well of
thee, People shall flock to thee for <hi>Counsel,</hi>
and thou shalt he The <hi>onely man</hi> in the
City.</p>
                     <p>Oh beloved, Let me tell you while we hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and are <hi>Taken</hi> with such things as these, Now
is Jesus Christ, <hi>whipt, blind-folded, crowned with
thorns, and smote on the mouth, made to carry his
Cross, crucified, dead, and buried, and a heavy stone
rolled upon him,</hi> that he may never rise again.
Now is Jesus Christ Taken, Apprehended with
a strong guard, carryed from one judgement-seat
to another; And every lust cryes, <hi>Crucifie him,
Crucifie him;</hi> they are all willing, and give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that he shall be <hi>condemned,</hi> that so <hi>THEY</hi>
may still <hi>live</hi> and <hi>rule;</hi> for They know, His <hi>life</hi>
is their <hi>death:</hi> Therefore he is now taken for the
<hi>Grand</hi> Transgressour; and why? Because He hath
broken the Laws of <hi>flesh and blood,</hi> therefore
<hi>Crucify him, Away with him,</hi> It is pity he should
live. The Innocent is hereby <hi>taken and led Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:46362:72"/>
and he that was <hi>Righteous in all he did,</hi> is now
taken <hi>for a Wicked man</hi> and a Sinner.</p>
                     <p>My beloved, <hi>Herein Lies</hi> The life of the
Scriptures; Yet do not think that I go about to
deny the Letter: I hope I shall stand in justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof to <hi>the death,</hi> that those things were
<hi>Externally</hi> and <hi>Literally acted.</hi> But this I say
still, Let us not be content with the Letter <hi>Only;</hi>
Friends, Bear me Record, I say, They were All,
Actually and Really done in the flesh; but yet I
also say, <hi>They were To Teach us,</hi> That the same
things are Alwayes In doing: I am so far from
having such a thought (as some ignorantly charge
me) as if I would make all the Scripture a Fable,
and meerly <hi>Allegorical,</hi> and no such things done:
that I wish from my soul, Cursed be those lips,
and <hi>for ever</hi> be the <hi>sealed up,</hi> even with the wrath
of <hi>Eternal fire,</hi> that shall deny in the least, the
truth of the Letter.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, Christ was conceived in us as
soon as ever we were born, as I said before, Nay
as soon as ever we had A Being; Nay it was <hi>He</hi>
that created us, and gave us Our Being: But now,
This we must know and believe, <hi>Christ was born
in us</hi> at our first Being; But that is not enough
(as to us) But He must be manifested IN US,
and that is, To be <hi>Born</hi> again. We condemn those
Cursed Jews, that apprehended our Lord and
Saviour, and put him to death; And we condemn
<hi>Iudas</hi> for betraying him; And we condemn the
Souldiers that nailed him to the <hi>Cross,</hi> and that
pierced <hi>his blessed</hi> Side with a <hi>spear:</hi> Oh! we

may be thus in a creature, if Jesus Christ <hi>in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>

may have <hi>their part</hi> in these <hi>external</hi> Powers,

are but <hi>Literal</hi> and <hi>low,</hi> and <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>childish:</hi> but
let us mind such a Kingdom, wherein if we have
but <hi>the least part,</hi> the <hi>least share,</hi> that if we be <hi>but
Door-keepers, then we are Happy</hi> for ever, and
shall never <hi>perish,</hi> neither in this world, nor in

                     <p>And <hi>let</hi> us look upon all those Scriptures they
alledge, as fulfilled to the Church <hi>spiritually</hi> in

And then whether that <hi>come about</hi> they speak of

literally, either for the pulling down of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
the Pope externally, or for the <hi>thousand
years</hi> of Christs <hi>Personal</hi> Reign, yet we are not
Here to Rest, in the external fulfilling of them,
but <hi>plus ultra,</hi> let us look beyond all these things:
These things may be, and yet Christ not exalted

if they be not done <hi>in thee,</hi> and <hi>in me;</hi> what is all

                     </p>
                     <p>But I will hold my self at this time rather to the
point in hand, concerning Christ being crucified
<hi>IN</hi> man; for to look upon <hi>those actions</hi> and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
only as to be fulfilled <hi>externally,</hi> is but a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46362:76"/>
Christ <hi>after the flesh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 16.</note> and to please the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man; of which the Apostle saith, <hi>Hence forth
I will know no man after the flesh; no though I had
know Christ after the flesh, yet henceforth will I
knew him no more:</hi> Of our hope and belief in this
kind of <hi>fulfilling</hi> the Scriptures <hi>spiritually,</hi> we are
sure we <hi>need not,</hi> nay we <hi>shall not</hi> be <hi>ashamed,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are sure we shall not be <hi>disappointed:</hi>
This is the <hi>body,</hi> The <hi>Substance:</hi> the other is but

                     </p>
                     <p>And those actions being done <hi>Spiritually,</hi> they
are more truly done then those that are done
<hi>Temporally</hi> and <hi>corporally:</hi> for if he did suffer then
in the time that he lived upon earth, in the daies
of his flesh (as he did) He suffers now herein,
<hi>more truly and really;</hi> for that <hi>suffering</hi> was but
the <hi>shadow</hi> of these sufferings. These are The Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<hi>indeed,</hi> His other sufferings, are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<hi>The Name of sufferings</hi> to these. Yet be sure,
The Godhead cannot suffer, by no means: And
therefore if God in you have brought the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Christ to this, to see all these things to
be <hi>within you,</hi> And to suffer with him <hi>Internally,</hi>
then is your knowledge right; <hi>Sufferings with
Christ in the outward man</hi> are nothing to these
sufferings, namely thus: <hi>for a man to lay down his
own will,</hi> to cross himself, to forsake and Empty
Himself (as Christ did) herein lie the Great
and unconceivable sufferings of Christ, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
sets them down in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 4.<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 4.</note> He that was

<hi>to be abased and trampled on</hi> by his own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
Herein was Sufferings indeed: Herein
lies The MYSTERIE of the Gospel of Christ;
His other sufferings, or any External sufferings in
the Saints are not worthy to be named the

                     <p>For, If once you come to these sufferings, then,
down with parts, down with our own excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and endowments both of nature and grace:
<hi>(Babel</hi> within us must bethrown down) then shall
we come to be <hi>nothings</hi> in our own esteem: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

Your <hi>Redemption</hi> draweth nigh; That you may

He observes no rules but his own will and fancy;
He behaves himself Rudely and Unmannerly:
but the other, he observes himself and his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,

<hi>The One</hi> sees him, and <hi>Trembles</hi> before

he may do what he list. But if so be, That the
King please to discover himself to this man, and

when he was going to suffer, <hi>but weep for
your selves and for your children:</hi> as if he should

away with all your thousands of tears, were they

                        </p>
                        <p>Beloved, These are not those sufferings the
Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 13.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 13.</note> Where he
bids us <hi>rejoyce in as much as ye are made partakers
of the sufferings of Christ:</hi> to suffer with and for
Christ, are other <hi>kind of sufferings</hi> then these,
which I shall hereafter come to unfold to you.
But saith he, <hi>weep for your selves, and for your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:</hi>
that is, for those bitter calamities that are
coming upon you, the cause whereof is bred in
you, and you see it not; <hi>weep</hi> for that, <hi>lament</hi> for
that.</p>
                        <p>But secondly, some (as I said) go farther then
this; they suffer as Christ did <hi>actually</hi> with and for
him, and as he commands (as they think) <hi>in
shame,</hi> in <hi>reproch,</hi> in <hi>imprisonment,</hi> in <hi>loss of
goods, houses, lands, wife, children;</hi> yea in loss of
<hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>life</hi> it self.</p>
                        <p>But though they think it is for him, and they
pretend and seem to suffer <hi>for</hi> and <hi>with him;</hi> yet
it is not for him, but for themselves: nay not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so, but many are come so far, that they do not
onely suffer these things, suffer <hi>poverty,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
of <hi>houses, lands, wives, children, good name,
liberty, life:</hi> but they may and also do take <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
in suffering with him and for him: This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they may do, but how do they do it? they
suffer indeed willingly and cheerfully, and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly:
<hi>Willingly,</hi> as it may accomplish <hi>ends to
themselves,</hi> and <hi>ends of their own;</hi> but they suffer
not for <hi>his will sake.</hi>

                           <pb n="124" facs="tcp:46362:90"/>They may thus suffer, because this is a <hi>way</hi>
(as they think) to bring about <hi>their own</hi> happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
so that though they suffer <hi>willingly,</hi> and
may rejoyce in it, yet it is but as of necessity, that
seeing there is <hi>no other way to heaven</hi> but by suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
and by undergoing the cross: but yet <hi>withal,</hi>
they <hi>grudge, and think hardly of God,</hi> they <hi>accuse</hi>
him of <hi>severity</hi> and <hi>cruelty,</hi> and think he is <hi>a Hard
Master:</hi> and they accuse the Law also of <hi>severity</hi>
and <hi>difficulty;</hi> they could wish <hi>the way</hi> had been
<hi>easier</hi> and <hi>smoother,</hi> without such <hi>crosses,</hi> and such
<hi>hard</hi> self-denyal; they would that God would
have more <hi>pleased</hi> them, and are ready to direct
him a <hi>better way,</hi> as they think: There is indeed
in them <hi>a willingness</hi> to <hi>suffer</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> things being
<hi>as they are,</hi> but they do not suffer <hi>freely,</hi> they do
not <hi>choose</hi> to have them so as they are; their <hi>wills</hi>
and Gods <hi>jarr;</hi> They like not <hi>in themselves</hi> the
<hi>Cross</hi> of Christ, they wish God had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
then to make their <hi>way</hi> to heaven so <hi>Rough;</hi>
They do his Commands, but they do them as a
hard and sore Task: These do indeed (as one
says) <hi>carry the cross,</hi> but they do not <hi>follow</hi> Christ:
and of both these <hi>sufferers</hi> Christ saith, <hi>Non novi
vos,</hi> I know you not: And though all these be

                        <p>And to this purpose I told you the last sabbath,

                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Indifferency</hi> to all things, to all <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi>
whether to <hi>riches</hi> or <hi>poverty,</hi> to <hi>honour</hi> or

these things are farr short of these spiritual suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
These are a thousand-fold more hard to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe;

were better endure any, nay all those sufferings,
Nay that a Milstone were hanged about his neck,
and He dragged to the bottom of the sea, then
not to have his part in these sufferings, for they
are <hi>happy sufferings.</hi>

                        <p>Beloved, lest <hi>these things,</hi> and the <hi>difficulty</hi> of

                        <p>Therefore before I proceed any further, Let

                           <p>The first is this, That God is in you, although

                              </gap>ists
in the body of Man, you can discourse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and delineate plainly the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> of
them.</p>
                           <p>And as <hi>Iohn</hi> said concerning Christ, <hi>There is
one in the midst of you whom you know not, Ioh.</hi> 1.
26.<note place="margin">John 1. 26.</note> I say so of you, there is one <hi>among</hi> you, and
yet alas, you <hi>see him</hi> not, you <hi>know him</hi> not: and

                              <hi>By my name Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
was I known unto your fathers: but by my
name</hi> Jehovah <hi>was I not known unto them.</hi> I was
the <hi>same</hi> then, but by that <hi>name</hi> they knew me
not. So God is <hi>the same</hi> in himself, but he is not
<hi>manifested</hi> to thee, nor in thee; that is, he lives
not <hi>in thee</hi> (as to thee), to thy sight and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                           <p>So likewise the Patriarchs and Prophets before
Christ, they knew him but not as we do now;
they knew him by the name <hi>MESSIAH</hi> to
<hi>come,</hi> and by <hi>the promised seed,</hi> and to be <hi>He in
whom all Nations should be blessed;</hi> by these names
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:46362:95"/>
they knew him then; but not by the <hi>Messiah</hi>
come, The <hi>Messiah</hi> born, the <hi>Messiah</hi> crucified,
the <hi>Messiah</hi> risen again, the <hi>Messiah</hi> ascended. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
saith Christ, <hi>desired to see my day, and he
saw it and was glad. Ioh.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">John 8.</note> He saw it fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years before, but not as we see it.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>these things</hi> are somewhat <hi>too high,</hi> and you
cannot conceive (it may be) what I mean by
these <hi>expressions.</hi> But I shall come lower to your
capacities, and shall make you acquainted with
these hidden things, and make them familiar to
you.</p>

<hi>He Hid himself</hi> (as he thought) from God: And

And, to destroy these, shall go and cut off all the

a while they grow the ranker, and the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:

<hi>a high steep mountain</hi> or <hi>bulwark,</hi> upon which
stood <hi>Elephants,</hi> so that they were <hi>in such a strait,</hi>
they knew not what to do; for if they killed,
they should kill <hi>more of their own Army,</hi> then of
their Enemies; For, if they killed the Elephants
that stood in the front, their <hi>heavy bodies</hi> would
tumble down upon them and kill them: So say
I, I fear that in killing of <hi>sin, sin hath killed thee:</hi>
Are not <hi>all</hi> thy <hi>good deeds fallen upon thine own

the more of this he hath, <hi>the more strong, and the

                           <hi>let none of these
things happen to thee:</hi> but this Text I have now
read unto you, withstands all these <hi>wishes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;</hi>
In plain words, If ye <hi>suffer</hi> with Christ, <hi>then</hi>
shall ye be <hi>glorified</hi> with him; if ye suffer not
with him, there is no hope of glory, no hope of
reigning, no hope of the crown. Therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
us to look for <hi>sufferings;</hi> we must make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of being <hi>sufferers,</hi> and of being <hi>such kind of
sufferers</hi> as may claim a part in Christs sufferings:
for there be many sufferers in the world, yet
have no part with Christ.</p>
                        <p>Moreover it may be, We never were <hi>whipt</hi>
with Christ, never <hi>poor</hi> with Christ, never <hi>crucified</hi>
with Christ, never <hi>imprisoned</hi> with Christ; we
were never called as the Apostle saith, to <hi>resist
unto bloud,</hi> how then can we claim a part of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Christ? therefore we must labour to find
out <hi>such a condition</hi> wherein we may claim a part
in Christs sufferings, and then we may also in his
Throne and Glory.</p>
                        <p>We must therefore suffer, as the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
Christs sufferings, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 6, 7, 8.</note> we must first
empty our selves as Christ did; and,</p>

                           <pb n="169" facs="tcp:46362:112"/>Secondly, We must humble our selves as he
did; fot he being <hi>God equal with his Father,</hi> yet

                        <p>The seventh name is [the Devil:] In Scripture:
we find very little said, of what God is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in his essence, because that is too high for us,
those words we are not able to hear, nor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,

what God is to us, and what he is in his effects

to us; so is the Essence of the Devil;
and we find very little, yea much less said of him

without us could do us no hurt, till gotten

little or nothing of the essence of the Devil; But
as he is in his workings and effects; and therein
we daily find him <hi>too much,</hi> and too rife amongst

                        <p>Again, Secondly he accuses Man unto God, as

                           <note place="margin">Job 1. 8, 9.</note> Satan answered, <hi>Doth Iob serve

and he will curse thee as <hi>fast</hi> as he now blesseth

                        <p>Again, Thirdly, he accuses Man unto man. <hi>From
whence comes all strife, and debates, and contention?</hi>
is not he the cause? as the Apostle saith, <hi>from

Rather then the Devil will accuse himself,
he will accuse <hi>Man,</hi> yea the Scripture, Nay God
himself: if any thing go against him, then all is
lyes, <hi>the Man lyes, the Book lyes, the Scripture lyes,

                           <q>If so be that we suffer with him, that
we may be also glorified together.</q>
                        </epigraph>
                        <p>I Reduced all the sufferings with Christ, into
these two comprehensive words:
<list>
                              <item>He emptied himself,</item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>And</hi> he humbled himself.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>As I then told you, God doth not require at
every mans hand to be <hi>poor,</hi> to be <hi>despised,</hi> and to
suffer <hi>calumny,</hi> to forsake <hi>houses</hi> and <hi>lands,</hi> and wife
and <hi>children:</hi> but whosoever suffers with Christ in
these two things; <hi>In being Emptied and Humbled</hi>
as Christ was, he shall find <hi>sufferings enough;</hi> He
will say, he hath suffered heavy burthens, heavy
afflictions, rending and tearing crosses: for a
man is to empty himself of <hi>all his moral endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of all his good education, of all his wisdom,
of all his Religion and Graces, so that he must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a fool to be made wise</hi> as God would have
him:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 27.</note> To renounce all his own <hi>affections,</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his own <hi>desires,</hi> to resist his own <hi>will:</hi> these
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:46362:120"/>
must be all thrown down, and we to behave our
selves, even <hi>in our hearts,</hi> and from our very souls
as <hi>truly humble</hi> as a <hi>little child,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 27. and Mar. 9. 36.</note> or as the <hi>basest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

to become all to all: <hi>Your humble servant,</hi>
is a base complement in all men, save in this
Emptied man; but he can truly say so.</p>
                        <p>Then we came to those six steps which did
shew us, wherein this suffering with CHRIST
consisted.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> In Condemnation of our selves.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Abdication,</hi> or <hi>forsaking all things</hi>
whatsoever that may seem good, and to be de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for our own selves.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Indifferency to all things,</hi> Psal. 39. 9.<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 9.</note>
                           <hi>I held my tongue, and spake nothing</hi> (saith <hi>David)
because thou didst it:</hi> If God send foul weather, <hi>I
held my tongue,</hi> for thou didst it: if God send fair
weather, I held my tongue; if he send <hi>sickness,</hi> if he
send <hi>health,</hi> I held my tongue, <hi>and said nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou didst it,</hi> Saith this Man: <hi>I am contented,</hi>
whether he make me <hi>merry,</hi> or make me <hi>sad, all
please me,</hi> because thou dost it.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>Conformity to</hi> CHRIST <hi>in all things,</hi>
Taking Him as Our Pattern.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>Deiformity,</hi> that is, when God <hi>doth all
in us,</hi> He <hi>speaks in us, He hears in us:</hi> so that we
no longer <hi>think, speak,</hi> nor <hi>hear,</hi> nor do any
thing, but He altogether.</p>
                        <p>In these six things consists our suffering with
Christ: and these are such sufferings, as there is
<hi>none</hi> like them: you may conceive of <hi>terrible
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46362:121"/>
sufferings,</hi> of <hi>Rackings,</hi> of <hi>Breakings of bones,</hi> of
<hi>Tearing apieces with wild horses,</hi> of being <hi>flayed
alive:</hi> but yet these sufferings are a thousand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<hi>more hard</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi> to overcome, as those
that have the knowledge <hi>and experience thereof</hi>
can witness; and as our Saviour saith in another
case,<note place="margin">
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Rather then a man should offend one of these
little ones, it were better for him that a milstone
were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into
the depth of the sea:</hi> And I say, these are such kind
of sufferings, <hi>that it were better for a man that a
milstone were hanged about his neck, and he were
drowned in the midst of the sea,</hi> then not to have
<hi>his part</hi> in these sufferings; for these are <hi>happy
sufferings,</hi>

sufferings, but not to flesh and bloud. But to the

weight of Glory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But as I have told you, when we should come
to ascend these six steps, and we thought to have
gone on in a quiet calm way, and to have shewen
you <hi>Davids</hi> feet to have gone up to this throne,
or rather <hi>Davids</hi> wings, that we might fly up thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and be at rest: <hi>Oh that I had the wings of a
Dove!</hi> But we found it was very difficult, and
not to be attained by natural power; for it is a
supernatural work, nature opposes it: for there
we found the Great, And not Naked, but Armed
Porter, standing in the very gate, at the very foot
of them:<note place="margin">Mark 3. 27.</note>
                           <hi>viz. The strong man, Armed,</hi> there

                           <hi>I said in mine heart,
go to now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore
enjoy pleasure: and behold this also is vanity.</hi> And
as <hi>Peter</hi> said to Christ, <hi>Master, favour thy self, none
of these things shall happen to thee:</hi> therefore
whoever means <hi>to ascend</hi> any one of these <hi>steps,
must get</hi> this Giant <hi>removed,</hi> and that wicked one
revealed, that he may be consumed; He that will
be a <hi>warriour</hi> must not mind pleasure, nor fear
<hi>death.</hi> You know, <hi>David</hi> complained that he
was <hi>compassed</hi> about with enemies <hi>on every side:</hi>
So that <hi>The fat bulls of Bashan environed</hi> him,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 12.<note place="margin">Psal. 22. 12.</note> and that his <hi>feet stuck fast</hi> in the
mire, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 2.<note place="margin">Psal. 69. 2.</note> but let me tell you, <hi>all here
present</hi> at this time, have <hi>as great reason</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of those things, as ever <hi>David</hi> had.</p>
                        <p>And because you might <hi>know</hi> this enemy that
hinders us, I shewed unto you, what this <hi>Strong
man</hi> was called, and opened <hi>divers</hi> names by which
he is set out to us, and pourtraied before us:</p>
                        <p>As<list>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46362:122"/>
to the ninth, and so to the rest. This enemy is
such an one, that if you do not <hi>continually</hi> watch,
and stand <hi>in fear</hi> of him, you shall be sure <hi>to feel
him:</hi> and though he hath <hi>many</hi> names, (yea as
<hi>many</hi> names as a Jesuit, that hath one name for
one shire, and another for another, for every
County one) But that is, <hi>for our capacity</hi> that he
is set out by several names: God could have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him <hi>one</hi> name that might have set out fully
his nature: but <hi>who could have understood him?</hi>
for <hi>we</hi> are not <hi>able</hi> to hear God in his <hi>own</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,

him, <hi>and live.</hi>

                        <p>As the children of <hi>Israel</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> they

                        <p>The Armour of this, is, <hi>Necessity to love our

your selves, such a necessity did I never read of
in all the Scriptures:<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 37.</note> I read of a necessity <hi>to love

this is a <hi>Necessity</hi> indeed:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 16.</note> Serve this Necessity
and then ye need take no care for loving your

and then ye shall do well enough, yea best of all.</p>
                        <p>The seventeenth name is. <hi>Our own will,</hi> and
this goes far with us: we think we do great acts,

to <hi>constancy</hi> in fasting, and set duties of prayer, and
the like,<note place="margin">Isa. 58. 3.</note> as <hi>Isa. 58. 3. Wherefore have we fasted,

be we do but our <hi>own will:</hi> all the while we do
not Gods <hi>will</hi> in it; we do them, because they
are <hi>agreeable</hi> to our selves, to our <hi>own mind,</hi> And
according to our education and company we sort

<hi>praise</hi> with men of <hi>that rank:</hi> here is no self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,

                        <p>And his Armour is, Opinion of our Own Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,
And a strong conceit of doing good: And
say they, if our own Will will <hi>bring</hi> about the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>so many good actions,</hi> in such an <hi>holy manner,</hi>
how can this be evil? I must be brief, the time

                        <p>The eighteenth name is <hi>Error:</hi> There is no
man <hi>Evil,</hi> by his own will; no man would be
evil, no man <hi>chooses</hi> evil; but he chooses it by the
error of his will, his will being <hi>misguided:</hi> it
comes to him under the notion of a <hi>good,</hi> before
he chooses it: for no man doth evil <hi>purposely</hi> as
evil, but he to himself makes it <hi>A good,</hi> before he
doth it, <hi>in his apprehension,</hi> and that he ought to
do it: yea, even <hi>mad men,</hi> whom <hi>we would think
did evil purposely,</hi> yet they do apprehend <hi>a good</hi>
                           <pb n="202" facs="tcp:46362:129"/>
in the evil <hi>they do:</hi> even <hi>such mad men</hi> are we all;
And, if we should do otherwise, we must <hi>strip</hi> our
selves out of this Armour which Errour hath on,
which is An opinion of our own Goodness, and
<hi>to love the praise of the world:</hi> we seek not to
<hi>please</hi> God, but to <hi>please the world;</hi> we mind not
what God commands, but what men <hi>say</hi> is good
and <hi>commendable:</hi> we are not of <hi>Davids</hi> mind,
to make Gods word <hi>A light unto our feet,</hi>

and we run after it with great <hi>pleasure</hi> and
<hi>delight,</hi> so that it may lead us <hi>any whither:</hi> And

shall become of <hi>them</hi> that never suffer any of <hi>these</hi>
things and yet do suffer with Christ? therefore I
told you wherein every one <hi>must suffer</hi> with
Christ, if they will be <hi>glorified</hi> with him: and
that is in two things,
<list>
                              <item>1 In Emptying of himself.</item>
                              <item>2 In humbling himself.</item>
                           </list>
If we imitate him in these, though we are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>to the former,</hi> it is no matter, so we be <hi>ready
in affection,</hi> and are in preparation to suffer them,
if we be called to them: for those two are <hi>the
Original of Christs sufferings,</hi> the foundation, the
<hi>root,</hi> The Fountain: all His other (outward and
external sufferings) are but the effects, the leaves,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46362:130"/>
and the fruit. From these two do <hi>all the rest
stream and flow,</hi> as from the Spring, their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and Well-Head.</p>
                        <p>Well then, This <hi>Ground-work</hi> and <hi>Corner-stone</hi>
being laid, Let me tell you it will bear All, it
will bear any <hi>building</hi> God shall rear upon it:
and wanting this foundation, though we suffer all
poverty, all disgrace, all tortures that can be
named, yet we suffer not with Christ: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they will not, nor cannot bring you to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with him; And Again let me tell you, <hi>The
least mite of sufferings,</hi> though it be <hi>never so smal,</hi>
yea as small as the two mites (being but <hi>half a
farthing</hi> the poor widow offered) coming from
this <hi>foundation</hi> and <hi>fountain,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Mar. 12. 42.</note> it is <hi>great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
in Gods sight, for it is from God and of God:
when as all tortures, name what you can, are
not regarded by him without they come from
this foundation and Principle.</p>
                        <p>And as I told you, there be six degrees in these
sufferings, or six steps, Typified by the six steps
that led unto <hi>Solomons</hi> Throne. These six steps
we must ascend before we can <hi>sit down</hi> in the
Throne of rest, peace and perfection; having
overcome all our enemies, and having brought all
into subjection, and that all things are <hi>put under</hi>
Christs feet, and that he rules in the midst of his
enemies:<note place="margin">Ps. 110. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>And made his Enemies his Footstool.</hi>

destroyed.</item>
                              <item>2. <hi>Annihilation of our selves,</hi> reducing ourselves

and bring it again to nothing.</item>
                              <item>3. <hi>Abdication,</hi> or <hi>for saking all,</hi> resigning up all

                              <item>4. <hi>Indifferency,</hi> to be equally disposed to every
thing; to want, and riches, to cold weather and

<hi>can be</hi> better ordered then it is, <hi>All being done</hi>
according to his will.</item>

                           <pb n="209" facs="tcp:46362:132"/>The Scripture then makes mention of three
sorts of men that are Judges: the first are, Carnal
men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 3. For we know the law
is spiritual:</hi> but I am Carnal, sold under sin. For
ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you
envyings and strifes, and divisions, are not ye
<hi>carnal, and walk as men?</hi> that are led <hi>meerly</hi>
by carnal and fleshly sense,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 3.</note> given up onely to
please their appetites and fleshly desires, they see
no farther, and their aim is no higher.</p>
                        <p>The second sort are <hi>Animales,</hi> reasonable men,
and they are such as are <hi>more refined,</hi> of a higher
and more sublime nature; even those that mind
the intellectual part, <hi>their souls;</hi> And these <hi>reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,</hi>
or <hi>rational men,</hi> as we call them, being gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by reason; there they rest, and there they are
satisfied: for let a man but shew a reason for what
he does, and who will condemn him? But neither
of these have <hi>the wisdom that is from above;</hi> for
all this wisdom is <hi>but earthly, fleshly, and devillish,
Iam.</hi> 3. 15.<note place="margin">James 3. 15.</note> Can it be expected that <hi>either of these
two</hi> will judge themselves? will carnal fleshli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
judge carnality? no, it approves it, <hi>it justifies
it:</hi> or will reason condemn reason? how can it
overthrow it self? it is impossible; <hi>a Kingdom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
against it self, it cannot stand:</hi> but yet, the
rational man doth judge and condemn,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 23.</note> and sits
as Judge oftentimes over the actions of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
man.</p>
                        <p>But there is a third sort of men,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note>

<hi>Spiritual</hi> men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 15.</note> 
                           <hi>Brethren,

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46362:133"/>
restore such an one in the spirit of meekness, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
thy self, left thou also be tempted. But he
that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is
judged of no man.</hi> And This <hi>MAN</hi> judgeth both
these; the <hi>Spiritual man, Omnia judicat, judgeth
all things:</hi> we esteem little of the <hi>carnal man,</hi>
every one condemns him: but we highly esteem of
the <hi>rational man,</hi> because he is guided by reason,
and doth all things that reason guides him to: he
minds not his body onely; it is reason he should
regard that; but he regards his soul too, and That
above his body: he knows he hath an <hi>Eternal
soul,</hi> and therefore <hi>it behoves him,</hi> and he hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to look for <hi>an estate</hi> and well-being for it; and
who can now judge, who is able to blame this
man? can any man do better?</p>
                        <p>But now comes the <hi>spiritual man,</hi> and he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>all things</hi> when he comes:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 15.</note> he judgeth and
condemneth the very <hi>best</hi> and <hi>highest</hi> actions of
this <hi>reasonable man,</hi> and tells him that his <hi>very

praying,<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>his sacrifices are an abomination.</hi>

                        <p>In the two former men, we could not find such a
judge; but here comes <hi>ONE</hi> who indeed is <hi>no man,</hi>
nor any part of man, but the <hi>Son of God</hi> himself,
he comes now into the soul: <hi>the spirit of God</hi> he is
the judge; this <hi>spiritual man,</hi> this Christ being <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
in the soul,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> this word being <hi>spoken</hi> in the soul:
for Christ is the <hi>Word spoken;</hi> It comes and sayes,
<hi>Reason,</hi> for all thou art so set up, and esteemed
<hi>amongst men;</hi> yet thou art a fool: and <hi>Reason</hi>
sayes again, that God is a fool. But let me tell

you, God is capable to understand Reasons wayes,
but Reason cannot understand Gods ways.</p>
                        <p>And beloved, God and Man have been a long

and again Reason sayes, God, thou art a fool: But
now <hi>Reason</hi> must be condemned; <hi>Reason</hi> must be

when <hi>Israel</hi> was carried Captive? No, not onely
so; those were all but types <hi>of the Captivity of the

fallen down and worshipped it; yet thou hast
done worse: for thou hast given <hi>thy heart</hi> to
them; And I tell thee <hi>that therein</hi> As the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites

and say, O Lord, <hi>Other Lords besides thee have

defend it self; yet hear God speak in thee, hear
<hi>what His well-beloved Son</hi> saith in thee, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that thou art, as the truth is, <hi>Guilty</hi> of the
breach of this Commandement; and that the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of sin is death, hell, and eternal damnation;</hi>
and this confession from the heart, and from a
true sight, is a sure means and way that thy spirit
may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 5.</note> This

him:</hi> Nay, if these two foundations be laid; It
matters not whether <hi>we be called</hi> to suffer in the

a fit disposition and willingness to suffer <hi>therein
also</hi> if God please: but suffering in these two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
<hi>In Emptying our selves, and humbling our
selves</hi> as Christ did, we do suffer with Christ, and
shall Reign with him. For all other sufferings,
let them be what they will, are nothing to these,
or without these; yea, the external and bodily
torments of hell are <hi>below</hi> these sufferings. It may
be we are <hi>far</hi> from the sufferings of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

we have bur three Deep Groanes, or sighs to

you shall see cause <hi>enough</hi> of condemnation: then
you will see so much in your selves, that you will
have no wisdom nor leisure left to judge other
men: if you did but see <hi>the true resemblance</hi> of
your selves; you could do <hi>nothing</hi> else but be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

could do nothing but lay all the <hi>Bitter curses</hi> you

praises, which formerly you have so much sought
for.</p>
                        <p>It may be we have read and heard the Ten
Commandments over and over a thousand times;
but that is not enough: But as the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
an ear in an ear; so we must have an eye
in an eye:<note place="margin">Rev. 2. ult.</note> 
                           <hi>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear;</hi>
and, <hi>He that hath eyes to see, let him see.</hi> I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to you the sins of the first Commandement;
from which I know you will free your selves most
in; you think That <hi>of all the rest,</hi> you are most
free from having other Gods: you were taught
That from your <hi>Cradle, Thou shalt have no other
Gods but me:</hi> But (as I then shewed you) you

that do worship any other god (as all of us do)
some make their belly their god, some pleaure
their god, some profit their god, some credit
and praise their god, and these we obey, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and fear, and love: Whatever it was that
drew you from obeying Gods Commandments;
was it for pleasure, was it for honour, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
else: consider what you have done; you
have made them your gods, and done more then
bowed your knee to them; so that as often as
thou hast said the Ten Commandments, so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
hast thou dissembled with God, and rebelled
against that which thine own mouth hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged:
And I doubt I may say of you, as
the Prophet said of <hi>Israel,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 28.</note> 
                           <hi>So many Cities, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Gods:</hi> Shall I say, so many men so many Gods?
Nay, so many <hi>LUSTS</hi> so many <hi>Gods:</hi> And those
that have <hi>many Gods,</hi> have no <hi>God:</hi> This is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
acknowledged, for even among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
there was not one learned and wise man but
did confess there was a God, and that there could
not be any more then one God: although they
gave several names to the <hi>divine power</hi> in several
creatures, for the Apprehension of the ignorant,
and called them Gods, yet they knew that God
was but <hi>one.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take therefore that <hi>sacred spotless</hi> Law, open
it, and look upon it, view thy self well, and it
will shew thee clearly all thy Gods. Do but look
upon the actions of this <hi>very</hi> day, nay since you
came into this place, and see if there hath not
been <hi>matter</hi> enough to cause this work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demation:
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46362:141"/>
Besides, consider this seriously, you
are not <hi>represented</hi> to God as doing of <hi>one</hi> action,
but according to the Tenor of your lives: thou
art not <hi>presented</hi> to God as thou art <hi>dying,</hi> when
thy mouth is <hi>full of holy words,</hi> nor as thou art <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
any good action: not as thou art sitting in the
Church at thy prayers, not as thou art hearing a
Sermon, not as thou art relieving the Poor, &amp;c.
but all thy whole life, <hi>every minute</hi> being always

                        <p>Nay, farther consider, that not onely all thy

and that thou <hi>seriously</hi> confess, That hell was not
made in vain, but that it was justly made, And for
thee: and that it were just and righteous that
God should cast thee thither; nay not onely so,
but that <hi>you feel</hi> your souls in the <hi>Bitter agonies</hi> of

seized upon you; then there were hope, That

                        <p>BEloved, I will trust your memories for that
which I have delivered before out of these
words, and come immediately to the second of
these six steps, which I have laid down: the first
being <hi>Condemnation of our selves;</hi> the second is
<hi>Annihilation,</hi> bringing or reducing our selves to
just nothing.</p>
                        <p>Mistake not (for your own sakes) I do not mean
to be <hi>really nothing</hi> at all, of no substance, that is
more then any earthly power can do, more then
Potentates or Kings can do; they may attempt
such a thing, but their arm can onely reach to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision</hi>
or <hi>separation</hi> of soul and body,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 28.</note> and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Elements one from another; they
may <hi>grind</hi> us to powder, they may <hi>burn</hi> us to ashes;
and when they have so done, cast the ashes into
the river, as in some case <hi>they may</hi> justly do: but
they cannot make us <hi>nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> for the same power
that <hi>Creates,</hi> can onely <hi>Annihilate;</hi> for every thing
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:46362:144"/>
retires to its own proper place: every thing to
its element; the <hi>water</hi> to his, the <hi>fire</hi> to his, the
<hi>air</hi> to his, the <hi>earth</hi> to his; so that when I tell you
of making your selves nothing, I do not mean
you should destroy your selves, but I speak of such
a <hi>making nothing</hi> and destroying, as that you keep
<hi>all your members;</hi> such a making nothing as <hi>Iob</hi>
complains of himself, <hi>ch.</hi> 16. 12.<note place="margin">Job 16. 12.</note> 
                           <hi>I was at ease and
he hath broken me asunder; he hath taken me by
the neck and hath shaken me to pieces, and hath set
me up for his mark; he cleaveth my reins asunder,
and poureth my gall upon the ground. Iob</hi> there
complains that he was broken to pieces, and yet
<hi>Iob</hi> had all his joynts and all his members: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that which I mean is the turning of a mans
self into dust and powder <hi>before God,</hi> to be emptie
in our selves, to be Nothing, <hi>less then nothing</hi> in
our own esteem; that all those huge <hi>bulwarks</hi> that
we have raised in our souls of our <hi>somethingness,</hi>
and of our <hi>own</hi> esteem, may be all laid flat to the
ground, and brought to nothing; as <hi>Abraham

<hi>take the childrens bread,</hi> and cast it unto <hi>dogs;</hi> and
I shall express my meaning briefly.</p>
                        <p>All that thou callest <hi>[I,]</hi> All that <hi>selfness,</hi> All
that arrogancy, <hi>propriety</hi> that thou hast taken to
<hi>thy self,</hi> all this must <hi>be</hi> brought <hi>to</hi> nothing; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
creates in us <hi>Iness</hi> or <hi>Selfness,</hi> this is <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
&amp; cinis Dust,</hi> and <hi>Ashes,</hi> and Vanity; for take
away these, and we are glorious creatures, the
workmanship of God himself: but these things,
<hi>Iness</hi> and <hi>Selfness,</hi> being let in, These, these things
make us deformed; this is that makes us like the
Devil himself; for take from him this <hi>(I) I am
something,</hi> and take away <hi>[Selfness]</hi> I will have
<hi>mine own will,</hi> and I will be <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> and
take away <hi>[Propriety]</hi> I will have, and I will enjoy
something to my self and for my self: and then
the Devil himself is a <hi>glorious Angel;</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
then left, but what is good; all things were
at first <hi>very good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is true, That Man at the best, is but created
of the dust of the earth: but what is he, and what
a case is he in, when sin enters into him? I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there are thousands at this instant in Hell,
that do wish from their souls, that they were or
could be reduced to nothing at all. But that man
that is reduced in this sense to nothing, and hath

                        <p>But Oh happy, thrice happy are those men that

of his sweet and dear Saviour Jesus Christ, who

one hours joy, one hours enjoyment of <hi>sure, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi>
peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, which

of this <hi>ravishing contentment,</hi> then to have
all the honour, all the riches, all the attendants,
or whatever the world could afford them, though
for ever: And if the scales <hi>of ignorance which now

it so; and <hi>till then you will never believe me:</hi> nay,
though one should rise from the dead, and affirm
these things,<note place="margin">Luke 16. ult.</note> you can look on them but as empty
words, wind and shadows.</p>
                        <p>Yet let me tell you, O Beloved! were <hi>your eyes
but opened,</hi> you would be <hi>so in love</hi> with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46362:146"/>
                           <hi>nothing could keep you from it:</hi> you would
not say, as the sluggard in the <hi>Proverbs, There is a
Lion in the way:</hi> no, no, your souls would be
<hi>restless</hi> till you <hi>attain</hi> thereto: I beseech you exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
your souls, and try them whether you are
<hi>in this condition</hi> or you are not: let not things hang
wavering,<note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 21.</note> and weigh down <hi>neither side: If God be
God follow him; if Baal be God follow him:</hi> you
will be <hi>hankering</hi> towards heaven, and fain you
would be saved; but till you be brought to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
Resolution, to take it <hi>by violence,</hi> there is
no obtaining.</p>
                        <p>Consider this man in two things:</p>
                        <p>1 Consider, what ever God gives, he arrogates
nothing to himself, and counts himself not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of any thing; neither can he rejoyce in it, as
his own, but as given from God.</p>
                        <p>2 What ever <hi>Lesson</hi> God sets this man to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
he ascribes the whole power and strength
of it <hi>to God onely,</hi> attributing <hi>no power to himself,</hi>
while he doth it; yet he doth it not, but God in
him: Or if he avoid any sin, he confesseth it was
by no <hi>power,</hi> no <hi>watchfulness,</hi> no <hi>wariness</hi> of his
own whereby he did it: for herein is the <hi>misery</hi>
of all, that man will not acknowledge but <hi>some
power</hi> he hath of his own, he can do <hi>something</hi> of
himself: And herein was the sin of <hi>Adam, not so
much in eating an Apple,</hi> but that <hi>Adam</hi> would
have and appropriate <hi>a power</hi> to himself: he would
be something without God; for if <hi>Adam</hi> had taken
seven Apples, it had been nothing, setting self-will
aside, and aiming at self pleasing, against the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:46362:147"/>
Command of God: But <hi>Adam</hi> would have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in himself, he would have <hi>his own will,</hi> he would
have an essence of his own; this was that which
ruined him, and so also all his posterity to this day
and for ever.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly Consider, This man, he takes <hi>all well</hi>
that God doth; whether he give to him, or take
from him, all is one <hi>to him;</hi> he is never troubled,
<hi>he suffers no rending in his soul</hi> in leaving them:
neither <hi>rejoyces in the getting of them;</hi> for he knows
they are Gods, and they are <hi>due to him,</hi> whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he shall call for them: As <hi>an honest</hi> man that
knows a sum of money <hi>is due,</hi> he having it ready,
he had as live the owner had it as himself; for he
cannot account it his own, he cannot boast and
pride himself in that which is none of his own:
This is that we call <hi>Reducing our selves</hi> to <hi>nothing,</hi>
To <hi>just nothing;</hi> so that here we have set before
you A lively Statue and Portraiure of a <hi>sequeste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
man</hi> which hath lost all that ever he hath in
this world.</p>
                        <p>1 He receives all as from God, and looks on
them as <hi>none of his own,</hi> and he not worthy of the
least mercy, being <hi>less</hi> then the <hi>least,</hi> as <hi>Iacob</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10.<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 10.</note> not in word onely, but really
he is so in his own <hi>esteem.</hi> Not worth the ground
he goes upon, as we say.</p>
                        <p>And then secondly, he uses them all to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, and not to the satisfaction of the
flesh, and his own will and lusts, but distributes
them as God commands: And if he have <hi>Wife,
Children, Honours, Riches, &amp;c.</hi> he sets not <hi>his heart</hi>
on them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="239" facs="tcp:46362:147"/>And thirdly, I should have shewed you, but I
forgot, he is as glad and rejoyces as much in the
good of others, as in his own good: he is not
contented to enjoy plenty himself, or any good
temporal or spiritual, but he would have others
enjoy the like, and is willing to communicate to
them.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, he is ready to part with them <hi>willingly</hi>
when ever God calls for them.</p>
                        <p>And lastly, Because, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> saith to <hi>Iob,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Job 15. 11.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>consolations</hi> of God seem <hi>no small thing
to him,</hi> therefore he is indifferent in all these
things; so God take not his holy Spirit from him,
and those inward joyes and refreshings <hi>from his
own presence,</hi> he cares not; let him take from him
else what he will: Now what is it (think you) that
this man feareth, that hath thus overcome, and is
set down with Christ in his throne? he cannot so
much as fear death, for he dyes dayly: And <hi>what</hi>
do you think now can <hi>separate</hi> this man from the
<hi>love of Iesus Christ?</hi> what <hi>can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>inder him from
boasting and triumphing?</hi> though not of or in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
but as the Apostle doth, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8. 35, 36, 37, 38,
39.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 35, &amp;c.</note> 
                           <hi>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine,
or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (as it is written, For
thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as sheep for the slaughter:) nay in all these things
we are more then conquerors, through him that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us: for I am perswaded that neither death, nor
life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:46362:148"/>
depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate
us from the love of God which is in Christ Iesus our
Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So much concerning that; we come to the
third, that is <hi>Forsaking all things:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of what degree and condition soever, though
not <hi>actually,</hi> it may be we are not called to that,
but yet to forsake them alwayes in affection, to be
alwayes in <hi>readiness</hi> to forsake All, if God cal to it:
Many think they have done this, &amp; they are ready
to say with <hi>Peter,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 27.</note> 
                           <hi>Mat. 19. 27. Lo master, we have
forsaken al:</hi> but <hi>Peter</hi> was deceived, he had forsaken
very little; and I doubt by that time <hi>we</hi> are tryed,

                        <p>And you may remember we compared these
sufferings with Christ to those six steps, which are
the six steps that led up to <hi>Solomons</hi> Throne (to

                        <p>1. Was <hi>To</hi> abhor in our selves all those sins
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46362:153"/>
and defilements that we are guilty of: which we
called <hi>Condemnation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second was, <hi>To</hi> beat our selves <hi>to dust,</hi> to
just Nothing, which we called <hi>Annihilation,</hi> yea,
to less then <hi>Nothing</hi> and <hi>vanity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third was, <hi>Willingness to forsake all,</hi> to <hi>Sell
All</hi> for Christ; which we called <hi>Resignation:</hi>
That is, To be alwayes in affection and readiness,
till GOD call us to action.</p>
                        <p>The fourth was, <hi>Indifferency;</hi> which we are
now to come to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to stand equally affected to all
conditions: <hi>Faith</hi> being the ground, as I told
you the last day, Believing undoubtedly, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be <hi>better done</hi> then what is <hi>done,</hi> God
doing All. We have a pattern set us of this, by
the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> He was <hi>come to this,</hi> Ephes. 4.

                           <hi>I have learned,</hi> saith he, <hi>Implying,</hi> That

it; but now I am grown to be a good Scholar
in it, <hi>That is, in what estate soever I am, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:
and now I can do all things through Christ that
strengthens me;</hi> I know Now, but not till now, <hi>Both
how to be abased, and I know how to abound; Every
where and in all things I am instructed, both to be
full, and to be hungry, to abound and suffer need,</hi>

(saith he) which implies, that there is a secret in
Gods school, which cannot be attained at the first
entrance, and by Beginners: but when we are
well entred and exercised therein, we may know
how too look <hi>with a smooth face</hi> upon all chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:

the world doth,</hi> but to do whatever <hi>He wills,</hi> And
to suffer <hi>whatever</hi> He Wills, this is <hi>Their meat</hi>
and <hi>Their drink:</hi> and as the Apostle sayes, I
count it not in any case <hi>expedient to consult</hi> with
flesh and blood; surely in this case it is not onely
<hi>not expedient,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Col. 6. 12.</note> but altogether <hi>unlawful;</hi> for how
tart is this to <hi>flesh and blood,</hi> To tell a man
when he is to go a journey he must be <hi>alike</hi> pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and <hi>alike</hi> thankful, and he must neither desire
<hi>fair</hi> weather, nor <hi>foul?</hi> To tell a man that is at
<hi>Sea,</hi> He must neither desire a <hi>wind</hi> with him, nor
against him? To tell a man that expects a <hi>harvest,</hi>
he must neither desire a <hi>good</hi> harvest nor a <hi>bad;
Sunshine</hi> nor <hi>Rain?</hi> To tell a man that is <hi>Naked,</hi>
that clothes and no clothes must be all one to
him? To tell a poor man, That money or no
money must be all one? To tell a man that is
sick, that pain and ease, health and sickness, must
be all one to him; Labour and pleasure, Ease and
suffering, Liberty and Imprisonment, Glory and
Infamy, All this must be alike to him? How can
<hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> indure <hi>this</hi> Doctrine, if we <hi>consult</hi>
with it? And therefore, He that Means to
practise this, must not at all consult with flesh and
blood: As the Apostle saith, <hi>I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but I assure you they are <hi>rich Iewels</hi> taken out of

Things that I have <hi>long, long,</hi> debated in my own

durst deliver it to you as a message from my

                        <p>But Beloved, if you for all this do count these
things Foolishness, Gods Spirit will, And doth,
call you Fools; Do not do by me as the <hi>Gerge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens</hi>
did by Christ; because he did but onely se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
them from their swine, <hi>they went out to

coasts,</hi> Notwithstanding all the good he might
have done them, in his miracles, And in curing
them and their diseases: they <hi>slight</hi> all this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had lost their swine: So, Because I
desire to separate you and your <hi>swinishness</hi>
asunder, you and your <hi>beastliness</hi> asunder, you and
your <hi>earthliness</hi> asunder, you care not for it, what
ever good and <hi>benefit</hi> this may be to the <hi>healing</hi>
and <hi>curing</hi> of your souls; And if I do <hi>cast pearles
before swine, And they turn again and all to rent me,</hi>
I cannot help it; The Lord hath opened my
mouth wide towards you. And I beseech him <hi>to
open</hi> All <hi>our Hearts,</hi> As he did <hi>Lydia's.</hi> But to the
<hi>Old man</hi> this Doctrine is very Harsh, and flesh

And no wonder though a body <hi>made</hi> and <hi>bred</hi> of,

and with these carnal things, as it is, I say no
wonder though nothing please it, and relish with

That we may be Thus <hi>moulded to Gods will,</hi> That
we may be as pliable to his will, As <hi>wax is to the

Then All shall be <hi>at peace;</hi> Then shall there be
<hi>no more war</hi> between God and us; Then we shall
have <hi>Endless</hi> peace: As in the <hi>Revelation</hi> a 1000

                        <p>Now he that hath attained the practice of this

far as we come short, <hi>when we desire any thing,</hi> and
God gives it not, Then we fall at wars with God,
And censure his <hi>proceedings,</hi> Having <hi>Harsh
thoughts</hi> of Him.</p>
                        <p>The Apostle <hi>Iude</hi> among all the grievous sins
that he speaks of, He reckons up <hi>Murmurers,

and he brings the example of <hi>Corah,</hi> whom the

There is enough can say <hi>blessed be his name</hi>

And as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he had shewed the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the house of the Lord to the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors;
the Prophet comes and <hi>denounces</hi> Gods
judgement against him, <hi>Esay</hi> 39. 8. and told him
that the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> should come and carry
away <hi>all those things:</hi> he answers, <hi>the word of the
Lord is good which thou hast spoken:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Isa. 39. 8.</note> so where is the
man that when God causes any to carry away
<hi>those things</hi> which we esteem, can say, <hi>The word
of the Lord is good?</hi> This is that we should labour
for: for if once we could attain to this, <hi>that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

<hi>that we do,</hi> should displease God.</p>
                        <p>But alas,<note place="margin">Job 11. 12.</note> alas, Vain Man would be wise, and

<hi>we should do,</hi> to subscribe and <hi>set to</hi> our faith and

belief, that <hi>what ever</hi> happens and comes to pass,
<hi>Is the best,</hi> yea better, then if it should happen
otherwise; Until we come to this, or so far as we
come short of it, We are meer Lucifers, meer
Devils: for <hi>we are not content</hi> with Gods govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and we <hi>mislike</hi> what he doth; and we would

to our own: But untill we come to this, <hi>to
esteem</hi> Gods government to be best, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>quietly</hi> submit to it, or choose it: for so long
as we apprehend a thing to be <hi>Evil,</hi> we cannot
choose but <hi>hate it;</hi> for it is natural to us, <hi>To hate
and abhor</hi> that which hurts us, and <hi>to love that</hi>
which does us good.</p>
                        <p>Hence it is that the husbandman when he hath
<hi>bad weather,</hi> that destroyes his hopes of his crop,
if he apprehend this to <hi>be evil,</hi> he cannot love him
that is the cause of it: and so the <hi>Mariner</hi> if he
apprehends that a contrary wind is evil for him,
how can he love God who is the cause thereof?
So likewise, if a man thinks it an evil to lose his
father, or mother, or wife, or children, or goods,

cause of all this. As <hi>Iobs</hi> wife says to her husband,
<hi>Doest thou still remain in thine integrity? Curse

<hi>bless God that curses thee?</hi> This is a maxime too

or <hi>Rebaptized:</hi> according to that promise
of God, <hi>Isa. 62. 2. Thou shalt be called by a new

<hi>first</hi> name was, <hi>Quod vult homo,</hi> what <hi>Man would,</hi>
what <hi>Self</hi> would, what <hi>flesh</hi> would: If ye ask how
he lived? how he willed? how he desired? The
answer must be, After <hi>the will</hi> of man, after <hi>the
will</hi> of the flesh; but now his name is <hi>Quod vult
Deus,</hi> What God would; He lives no more that
old life, now he <hi>lives, wills, desires, affects</hi> after
the <hi>will of God:</hi> Ask him now, how he wills? he
will tell you, He desires <hi>no more</hi> his own will
should be done, but that <hi>Gods will may be done in
all things;</hi> Now, he no longer <hi>retires</hi> to his own
wisdom, to his own <hi>directions</hi> in any case; but

                        <p>Just as a man that is travelling in a strange

good land, and desirable, and how they

History to us? But that, in this history, and so in
all other Promises, we may see, They are made
to us: Let me tell you, In this very history,
There is a <hi>good land</hi> promised to us, as well as to

our murmurings, and unbeliefe, and still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news

yet, He is a <hi>God</hi> Rich in mercy, <hi>Slow to

these <hi>doubtful</hi> distrustful spirits <hi>can ever enter</hi> this

<hi>this desired Land;</hi> for, <hi>Those enemies</hi> (as I then
shewed) which I named in part before, they must
not onely be fought withal,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 7.</note> but they must be
overcome: <hi>These Goliahs must be</hi> slain, and be
<hi>beheaded</hi> before ever ye can triumph in the
Dance, with the <hi>Minstrels</hi> and the <hi>Damsels:</hi> Nay
let me tell you, God hath <hi>solemnly sworn in his

                        <hi>These shall never enter into
His Rest:</hi> but <hi>To him that overcometh,</hi> will I
grant <hi>to sit with me in my Throne,</hi> even <hi>as I also
overcame,</hi> and am set down <hi>in my Fathers Throne,

is it that ye have no faith? if ye look upon your
selves indeed, ye are but <hi>as Grashopers</hi> to these

this spiritual <hi>Canaan, this Heavenly Rest,</hi> is freely
promised by God, <hi>not for anything in you:</hi> Say not
in your hearts, as the Lord saith to the Israelites,
<hi>Because we are better,</hi> or <hi>because we are stronger</hi>
then the Nations about us,<note place="margin">Deut. 7. 8.</note> we have done, or
shall do <hi>All these things:</hi> but <hi>because the Lord
loved you,</hi> and he would do it for <hi>his own Name
sake:</hi> Therefore, Onely <hi>Believe,</hi> and none <hi>of all
these things</hi> shall stand in your way: <hi>These dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements</hi>
shall be as meat, and <hi>Strength</hi> to
you: <hi>This inheritance</hi> is not gotten or obtained
<hi>by our strength,</hi> or <hi>our righteousness:</hi> but it is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
by his Sons <hi>Own bloud,</hi> and the work is
<hi>carried on</hi> by his <hi>Own strength;</hi> Onely believe:
If ye can but <hi>trust</hi> to this, if ye can <hi>but Rely and
Rowl</hi> your selves on Him, be sure <hi>you shall enter
This Rest,</hi> and possess <hi>This Good Land:</hi> And the
way to it, is onely by being sensible of our own
<hi>unworthiness and weakness,</hi> and likewise of his

                        <hi>Love and power</hi> Relying thereupon: <hi>These souls
shall enter,</hi> and these onely.</p>
                     <p>My Brethren, Then <hi>of all things</hi> take heed, <hi>or
rather,</hi> The Lord <hi>give you watchfulness against
this great sin of Unbelief.</hi> Infidelity and unbelief
is <hi>the first and main</hi> thing to be overcome in
the way of Christianity. Unbelief excludes us
from this Rest: Therefore it is <hi>That He who is an
unbeliever cannot inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> All

utterly, and <hi>Cuts off</hi> from the Kingdome of

that there is nothing <hi>so high</hi> but he shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it; nor nothing <hi>so strong,</hi> but he shall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

it, Then shall we <hi>go on</hi> couragiously and victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously:
<hi>Our own strength or our own weakness</hi> shall

                     </p>
                     <p>But now let us go on; These things I could
not but touch at, lying so in our way. After that
these Israelites had entred, and had partly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
and conquered this Land, and had got it
into their own possession, They began <hi>to divide</hi>
the Land, to every Tribe <hi>His lot of inheritance:</hi>
To <hi>Caleb (Ioshua</hi> being made Governour) he gave
<hi>Hebron,</hi> which he took upon him to subdue and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:46362:168"/>
to finish the conquest; for Here and there The
Enemy <hi>had some strong holds:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Josh. 14. 9.</note> So that <hi>Cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

took <hi>Hebron</hi> for his inheritance, <hi>And he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took,</hi>
He and his friends to assist him, that if he
could overcome it, he should have it <hi>to him and his</hi>
for ever; if he could not, he should <hi>lose</hi> it: And
passing along, he came to this City, <hi>Kiriathsepher;</hi>
&amp; It being a City <hi>very strong,</hi> &amp; yet of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for him, he much desired it: <hi>Caleb makes a
stand,</hi> &amp; proclaims, <hi>That whosoever smiteth this Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riathsepher,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Josh. 15. 16.</note>
                        <hi>and taketh it,</hi> he promiseth <hi>to give him
his daughter Achsah</hi> to wife: it seems Beloved, She
was One <hi>very Amiable,</hi> and to be desired <hi>for her
Comeliness and Beauty,</hi> One <hi>worth having;</hi> and
therefore he propounds Her <hi>as a Great</hi> and full
Reward to whosoever taketh it: as it is in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
read: <hi>And Caleb said, Whoever smiteth Kiriath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sepher,
and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah
my daughter to wife.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We come now to divide the words: There is
in these two verses, two things:</p>
                     <p>1. Onus, <hi>the work,</hi> the burthen, whosoever smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
Kiriathsepher and taketh it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And secondly, Here is</hi> Honos, <hi>the gift,</hi> or the
Reward, <hi>or the honour,</hi> To him will I give Achsah
my daughter to wife.</p>
                     <p>But now let us consider, what is all this to us?
what is <hi>Caleb</hi> to us? or <hi>what have we to do with</hi>
the smiting or taking <hi>Kiriathsepher?</hi> or what
shal we <hi>be the better</hi> for <hi>Achsah, Calebs</hi> daughter?</p>
                     <q>I have here, you know, even now, read <hi>the first
and second Lesson</hi> part of this 15.<note place="margin">Josh. 15.</note> of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and

the other out of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> I may boldly say, <hi>One
answers to the other,</hi> like the two Cherubims, This
looks forward to that Chapter in the <hi>Corinthians;</hi>
and that looks back to this; The one is the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the other. But it may be you will say
to me, That is <hi>very strange,</hi> we see no such thing:
what is this Chapter to that, or that to this? for
S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us there, <hi>That the letter kils, but the
Spirit gives life;</hi> and <hi>that They are Ministers not
of the letter, but of the Spirit:</hi> And likewise, he
speaks there of the two <hi>Tables</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and
compares it with the <hi>Glorious dispensations</hi> of the
Gospel, as being far more glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ious: If there
was <hi>so much glory</hi> at the <hi>Promulgation</hi> of the
Law, which was written but <hi>in Tables of Stone,</hi>
and to be <hi>abrogated,</hi> and was also but the <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of death:</hi> much more <hi>glorious</hi> is the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the Spirit,</hi> written by the <hi>finger</hi> of
God <hi>himself</hi> in the <hi>Tables</hi> of our <hi>hearts</hi> for <hi>even
that which was made glorious, had no glory by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of that which excelleth in glory:</hi> And <hi>Moses,</hi> He
put on a <hi>vail,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 13.</note> else the people could not <hi>behold</hi>
Him nor <hi>Hear</hi> him; Which <hi>vail</hi> is still upon the

                           </gap>nds</hi> are still blinded by reason
of <hi>that vail,</hi> which is <hi>still</hi> upon the heart, while
we are <hi>under the law:</hi> for to this day <hi>remaineth</hi>
still the same <hi>vail,</hi> untaken away, <hi>In the reading
the old Testament,</hi> which vail <hi>is done away in
Christ.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>But to all this I redudce onely <hi>This part</hi> of this
Chapter now read, to <hi>unfold</hi> and <hi>interpret</hi> all this:
And for the present I have made <hi>choise</hi> of these
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46362:169"/>
two Verses, to give light to that <hi>whole</hi> Chapter;
and that Chapter is the Exposition of this, as I
before said: O how like is my text, and every
part thereof, to those New washed sheep! <hi>Cant.</hi>
4. 2.<note place="margin">Cant. 4. 2.</note>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Of which two Verses, I shall say</hi> as Abigal
said of Nabal, <hi>when</hi> David <hi>came to destroy him,</hi>
Regard not this son of Belial, and let not my Lord
be angry, Nabal is his name, and so is he: <hi>So I
may say of this Text,</hi> as their Names are, so are
They.</p>
                     <p>Here is <hi>Kiriathsepher,</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> and <hi>Othniel,</hi>
and <hi>Achsah:</hi> We will see what <hi>Secrets</hi> and <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
The holy Spirit <hi>hath Couched</hi> under these
vails: For as they are in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> they express no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to us: but Read them in <hi>English</hi> and take
off their vail, and you may see <hi>what honey will
come out of the mouth of the eater,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Judg. 14. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>and out of the

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What then is</hi> Kiriathsepher? <hi>In Hebrew it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies</hi>
The City of the Book, or the City of the
Letter.</p>
                     <p>We will first interpret them to you <hi>into English,</hi>
and then we shall come to shew you <hi>what they
are, To every one of us:</hi> for it is the office of the
Ministers of the new Testament, To strive <hi>To
take off the Vail,</hi> that every one may come to see
<hi>His own face</hi> in the Scriptures, as a man seeth <hi>His
natural face in a glass.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the next place, <hi>What is Achsah?</hi> In Hebrew
it signifies. <hi>The Rending of the vail.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="284" facs="tcp:46362:170"/>And then, what signifies <hi>Caleb?</hi> In the Hebrew
it is as much as to say, <hi>My heart,</hi> or <hi>a perfect heart,</hi>
or <hi>a good heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And what then is <hi>Othniel?</hi> In Hebrew it is,
<hi>Gods good time,</hi> or <hi>The Lords fit Opportunity.</hi>
                     </p>

and taketh it, to him will I give Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sah
my daughter to wife: And Othniel the son of
Kenaz the brother of Caleb took it, and he gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him Achsah his daughter to wife;</hi> and so on: But
in English it is to be read thus, And my heart said,
or a good heart said, That whosoever smiteth
and taketh the City of the Letter, to him will I
give the Tearing or Rending of the vail: And
<hi>Othniel</hi> took it, as being Gods fit time or oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
and he married <hi>Achsah;</hi> that is, enjoyed
the Rending of the vail, and thereby had the
blessing possessed by <hi>Achsah; viz.</hi> by this Vail
being Rent, and possessed both the upper <hi>springs</hi>
and the nether <hi>springs.</hi> To him that obtains <hi>This
rending of the vail,</hi> to him shall be given the

                        <note place="margin">Answ.</note> for I must tell you that <hi>not

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46362:170"/>
Testament,</hi> from the first of <hi>Genesis,</hi> to the last of
the Prophets there runs <hi>an Allegory, a Mystery, a
Secret Woof in the Web of the Letter,</hi> as I may so call
it, which if you have not <hi>the skill and Art</hi> to know
it, that so <hi>you may eye it</hi> and see it <hi>through the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
(for it is hid and covered with the letter) I
will be bold to say it <hi>you have not the Marrow,</hi>
the life of the Scriptures; in the justification of
which <hi>I dare</hi> live and die: I deny not the history
of the word, <hi>It is really true, undeniably, most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
true:</hi> bear me record: for certain, it is true
both of this particular Scripture and so of the rest;
I say, <hi>Caleb</hi> did say so, and <hi>Kiriathsepher</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by <hi>Othniel,</hi> and he did marry <hi>Achsah:</hi> these
things were <hi>really, and literally and externally</hi>
acted. And so the History of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all
the rest: but I cannot stand now to instance as I
would, though I could shew you <hi>clearely</hi> How
the Mystery is <hi>hid,</hi> and <hi>couched</hi> and <hi>interwoven</hi> in
the letter. But to touch upon the History of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi>
He had two sons, <hi>The One</hi> the son of the
<hi>bond-woman; The Other</hi> the son of the <hi>free woman:</hi>
And there was <hi>A mount Sinai,</hi> and <hi>A mount Sion,</hi>
as the Apostle <hi>Paul alludes to it:</hi> and shews us
<hi>Thy mystery</hi> of those things: and tells us plainly,
<hi>Those things are</hi> an Allegory, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24.<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 24, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>Which
things are an Allegory,</hi> saith he; <hi>for these are the
two Covenants, the one from Mount Sinai, which
gendereth to bondage which is Hagar, and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to Ierusalem which now is, and is in bondage
with her children: but Ierusalem which is above is
free, which is the mother of us all; and as he that
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46362:171"/>
was born after the flesh, persecuted him that was
born after the Spirit, even so it is now:</hi> and so
he goes on, shewing what the Holy Ghost <hi>Pointed
out</hi> in that History, because he would not have
them, <hi>Rest in the Letter,</hi> but search for the Spirit,
<hi>The life,</hi> and the mystery: So neither do <hi>I deny,
nor diminish</hi> the least <hi>title</hi> from the letter: but
the Apostle, and so I, <hi>would bring</hi> the history
home <hi>to our selves,</hi> to our own particulars:
For what are <hi>these histories</hi> to us? what
good is it to us, that there was <hi>Amount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi>
and A <hi>mount Sion?</hi> and that <hi>Abraham</hi>
had two sons, the <hi>One</hi> by the bond-woman, the
<hi>Other</hi> by the free-woman? but <hi>He would</hi> shew
and teach us, That the son of the bond-woman <hi>in
us,</hi> which is the <hi>Son of fear,</hi> should be cast out;
and the son of the free-woman, that is, the <hi>Son of
love,</hi> should inherit: so always reserving the
<hi>Truth of the Letter,</hi> yet not losing the sense and
the meaning. But if we rest and <hi>dwell</hi> on the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or on the history, and so <hi>onely take it as an
history,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 6. 63.</note> and not see our own selves in it and by it:
then that <hi>History,</hi> that Letter <hi>kills:</hi> but it is the
<hi>Spirit</hi> onely that gives life, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Mind and
the meaning;</hi> for there is no Scripture but is as a
glass to behold our own <hi>faces,</hi> our own <hi>Hearts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So, he that shall read the second and third
chapters of <hi>Genesis:</hi> where we read of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
speaking to,<note place="margin">Gen. ch. 2. 3.</note> and beguiling our mother <hi>Eve;</hi>
and of <hi>Eves</hi> tempting her Husband, and so <hi>both
came into the transgression:</hi> But now let us not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
read this <hi>speculatievly,</hi> and so let it pass; but let
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:46362:171"/>
us consider how this Scripture is fulfilled <hi>in us,</hi> see
how our <hi>own condition</hi> is there related, as <hi>well</hi> as
our first parents; let us come to the <hi>woof;</hi> this is
but the out-side, <hi>the Letter;</hi> what is the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
truth in them? for there is no part of holy
Writ but is fulfilled <hi>alwaies</hi> in all times, in every
part thereof, and in every member of the
Church; or In the enemies of the Church at one
time or other: alwayes the same things are in
<hi>doing</hi> throughout all ages.</p>
                     <p>As I take it, the meaning is, <hi>The Serpents</hi> there
speaking to <hi>Eve;</hi> His first setting upon her, solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
and seducing her: It shews that Satans
method in the soul of every man, is first to set
upon the <hi>inferior part</hi> of man, the <hi>affections,</hi> which
are soonest overcome: as S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes of <hi>Eve, the
woman was first in the transgression,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 14.</note> thereby under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
(as I conceive) the <hi>affections,</hi> unto
which and by which The Serpent is every day
whispering <hi>Treason,</hi> and suggesting <hi>Treachery</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the soul against God. The lower <hi>parts</hi> of the
soul <hi>first hearken,</hi> and they being overcome, then
they as <hi>Eve,</hi> set upon <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, the Will
and Understanding, and the higher powers of the
soul, whereby <hi>both the Woman and the Man</hi> came
into the transgression. Understanding the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
thus, <hi>As fulfilled within us,</hi> we make them
our own; hereby the word is made a <hi>Living word</hi>
and <hi>Endureth for ever,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> saith. Those that
<hi>see and feel</hi> the Scriptures Thus fulfilled In them,
They have found <hi>The Pearl of the Scriptures,</hi> for

because it is written in <hi>Gen.</hi> but because I have felt
it, and seen it written &amp; fulfilled in mine own soul:
for Thus God is pleased, for our capacities and

of this inward work within us, by <hi>external repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations</hi>
to our understanding; that so we may
comprehend <hi>Those things,</hi> that are so far above us;

then let us <hi>Throw away the Letter;</hi> if God hath

But, The Letter is said to kill, not that it doth so

                     <p>Though the <hi>Letter</hi> contain in it Life and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
as the Oyster-shell doth the Oyster, and
as the shell of the Cocal doth the meat; and ye
cannot have the Oyster without the shell; Yet
you <hi>see,</hi> you cannot have the meat neither, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
you crack and break the shell.</p>
                     <p>As for instance, If you give me <hi>[Beef or Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;]</hi>
there is in them both meat for nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and also excrements: buu who can say
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46362:175"/>
(when he looks on either) <hi>This is the meat,</hi> and
This is the <hi>Nutriment,</hi> and this Other is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements,
and this is that which goes into the
draught, and is good for nothing. Yet you know,
The <hi>stomach</hi> will sever these, and divide to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>their proper way and places,</hi> and to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
uses; and a <hi>skilful Physician</hi> which knows
the body, the arteries, and the veins, and all the
parts <hi>how they lie,</hi> he knows how nature disposes
of all these things, and knows both the things and
the causes.</p>
                     <p>And so likewise in <hi>Physick,</hi> ye can have no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
without excrements: though ye cannot <hi>see
the virtue,</hi> and the Life, and the Spirits; yet <hi>ye
may see</hi> the effects: and though in meat you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see the nourishment; yet you may see <hi>the
thing nourished</hi> by it. So we cannot have the true
word of God without the letter: God could not
(as I may so say) considering our state as we are,
he could not give us meat or Physick by the
word, but by the Letter: And although it be not
the <hi>Physicians intent</hi> to give excrements, <hi>but onely
Physick;</hi> and we do not eat meat <hi>for the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                     <p>So my Brethren, <hi>we</hi> being of <hi>so low a nature and

as <hi>the excrements:</hi> But, if you take the <hi>Carnal

go no further then the Pharisees.</p>
                     <p>The Jews and the Pharisees, before Christ
came, they were so literal, sensual and carnal,
they thought that whosoever did not break <hi>the
letter</hi> of the Ten Commandments; If they did
nothing against <hi>the Outward, Literal letter,</hi> they
thought themselves blameless. As in the seventh
Commandment, They thought If they had not

tells them,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>He that looks on a woman, and lusts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

did not lay hands on their brother to murther
him, they thought they had gone <hi>a great way</hi>
in keeping that Command; but our Saviour
goes further then every eye can see, and saith,

                        <hi>He that is angry with his brother without cause, is

and those that are come no further, they are still

there are <hi>Too, too many</hi> such children, who think

have said, how far men may go herein, and yet
<hi>know nothing</hi> to salvation.</p>
                     <p>As we said, <hi>The children of Israel,</hi> how expert
were they in the Scriptures, so as they thought
<hi>themselves the strictest observers</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:
yet you see how our Saviour under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>values
<hi>all their knowledge and strictness:</hi> And
now seeing it is fallen in our way, we will touch
upon <hi>each Commandment briefly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Israelites they thought, if they observed
<hi>the litteral</hi> Ten Commandments, there was <hi>no
more</hi> required. As in the first Commandment,
<hi>if he worshipped either Sun, Moon, or Stars, or any
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:46362:176"/>
creature,</hi> then he thought he should <hi>dye the
death;</hi> but if they never bowed to any creature
in a way of worship, then they were innocent:
But, This they might do, and be never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for saith the Apostle, <hi>The end of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
is love, out of a pure heart, and faith
unfeigned.</hi> To have any thing in the world for thy
God, <hi>Either to love or fear,</hi> so that it draws away
the <hi>love and fear of thy Creator, that thing</hi> is to
thee a God, and thou givest it that worship,
fear and love that is due <hi>onely</hi> to God. So far as
<hi>any creature</hi> hath caused thee <hi>to offend</hi> thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
thou hast broken this Commandment. If
either riches, or beauty, or honour, or promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath weighed down thy love <hi>from obeying</hi> God
Almighty, thou hast <hi>set it</hi> in the room of God,
<hi>and cast Him behind thy back,</hi>

<hi>God loves Carvers better then Painters;</hi> It may be,
The strangeness of the expression will cause you

my intentions in so saying.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> Why sir, what do you mean?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Ile tell you; Carvers you know <hi>in their
work,</hi> they <hi>lessen, cut, pare, and take away;</hi> but
Painters they do not so; but they <hi>adde</hi> in their
work, they put colour here and there; So this is
that I mean; God loves those <hi>that seek him in
poverty,</hi> in a way of emptiness and self-nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
And as for those that seek him <hi>in riches
and greatness, and in high things, in mens esteem,</hi>
they go farther and farther from him. The Virgin
<hi>Mary</hi> found it so in experience,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 48, &amp;c.</note> when she said, <hi>The
hungry he fills with good things, and the rich
he sendeth empty away: he hath regarded the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingness
of his handmaid, he hath brought down the
mighty, and exalted them of low degree, and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the proud in the imagination of their hearts:</hi>
If you would find God, <hi>It</hi> must be, by lessening
your selves, and taking the creature quite out of
your way. And, if you would think of God, to find
Him you must not imagine <hi>Him</hi> under any form,
but cast away from you, all that ever you can
say, or think; for God is nothing that we can say,
name or imagine.</p>
                     <p>And therefore if you speak of any thing, or
think of any thing, <hi>either in the heaven above, or
in the earth beneath,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exo. 2. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>or in the water under the
earth,</hi> and think him like it, though it be never so
glorious; yea, ten thousand times <hi>brighter</hi> then
the Sun: yet in this <hi>you commit Idolatry,</hi> and make
to your self, <hi>A graven, or a formed image:</hi> All is
one; for God <hi>infinitely transcends</hi> all our thoughts
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46362:177"/>
and imaginations: yea <hi>all the thoughts</hi> of all the
Angels in heaven; for none can comprehend
God, but God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>imself; Therefore <hi>herein</hi> you
belye God, for <hi>he is</hi> none of all those things, nor
like <hi>any of those things</hi> we imagine. For you know
<hi>He speakes falsely</hi> as well He that sayes less then
the truth, as he that sayes more then the truth:
As in your <hi>publick</hi> oaths, they are given in this
form, <hi>Thou shalt speak the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth:</hi> So that, he that speaks
<hi>less</hi> then the truth, or <hi>more</hi> then the truth, speaks
not <hi>the truth;</hi> and he that speaks not the truth,
<hi>speaks a lye:</hi> So he that thinks or speaks that
which comes <hi>short</hi> of God, and sayes <hi>such an one</hi>
is the Almighty, He <hi>belyes him,</hi> and hath broken
the second Commandment.</p>
                     <p>But he that shall <hi>Take away</hi> whatsoever is
competible to any creature <hi>whatsoever,</hi> He comes
<hi>nearest</hi> to God; For, whatever is competible or
agreeable to any creature, <hi>Is All but Accidents:</hi>
and so <hi>The creature blindes us,</hi> and hides God
from us: though God <hi>be in every creature,</hi> and
as much in <hi>one</hi> creature as in another, yet <hi>These
Accidents</hi> in the creatures hide God from us:
And those to whom Christ hath manifested the
Father, They in whom <hi>Christ dwells,</hi> they know
<hi>that Christ is in them,</hi> and in every creature; but
<hi>Reprobates</hi> know it not,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note> as the Apostle saith,
<hi>Know ye not that Iesus Christ is in you, except ye be

Reprobates,</hi> they know it, and are sensible of it:
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46362:178"/>
Christ hath manifested himself <hi>to be in them,</hi> by

hath <hi>so Endeared</hi> and won over their hearts to
him, so that they esteem him <hi>Dearer,</hi> and more

Him: As <hi>Dionysius</hi> in his book of Mystical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,

                     <p>Those that go about to find God <hi>this way,</hi> in
the way of poverty, and taking away, <hi>they</hi> shall

to find him in the way of adding or inlarging, <hi>or
setting any creature before them</hi> to resemble God,
God hides himself the more, and <hi>goes farther off</hi>

<hi>that makes an Image,</hi> and falls down and worships

or affirms, <hi>That God is like any thing in

God?</hi> We murther God? God forbid. Yes, Ile tell

                        <note place="margin">Amos 2 13.</note>
ye have so pressed him down under your sins, that

whensover <hi>ye apprehend not God Merciful</hi> and

and that you will not deny; neither can you deny
this, <hi>as much as lyes in you</hi> You Murder God.</p>

love it, but do <hi>so long</hi> Hate it: As <hi>David</hi> in
all his Psalms praises God <hi>For His Mercy,</hi> for his
Goodness, and for His loving-kindness: whatever
it be that comes under any other apprehension,
we hate it, resist it, fight against it: But <hi>David</hi> He
praised God for his afflictions, for corrections,
even when God made him to smart; but that
was never till he found <hi>kindness and mercy in it,</hi> and
that he saw <hi>it was good for him:</hi> if any thing come
upon us, <hi>that we cannot account</hi> a mercy to have it
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:46362:182"/>
so, we cannot praise God for it. If we think when
God hath taken away any thing we enjoy, be it
wife, children, friends, health, liberty, houses,
lands, or any thing else that we prize and love, if
we think this evil to us, So long we can never
<hi>praise God for it:</hi> if we do not Account <hi>What ever
falls to us</hi> a mercy, and be glad of it, yea a greater
mercy to want what we desire then to have it, this
man <hi>so far</hi> hates God.</p>
                     <p>He that murmurs and thinks, That God at any
time doth not well nay doth not alwayes the best,
<hi>this man</hi> hates God. This was that sin that God so

                     <p>

by this means, <hi>the spirit of man is defiled, and goes

                     <p>All those excellencies and beauties in the

there is a spiritual <hi>Theft;</hi> and besides, you know

                        <hi>He shall never perish,</hi> neither in

                     <p>And I may in brief <hi>touch</hi> at the spirituality of
<hi>the ninth Commandment:</hi> For <hi>the time</hi> is so far
spent, and <hi>my own ability</hi> to speak, that I must
leave the tenth to some other time; And, But
that I made haste, I would have spoken more
largely to <hi>some</hi> of the former; but according to
that <hi>impulse</hi> of the spirit, <hi>within</hi> at this present,
you have had my thoughts: <hi>Thou shalt not bear
false witness against thy neighbour:</hi> The letter of
it, is against thy neighbour; which I say still,
must not be neglected, yet <hi>not rested in:</hi> The
spirit of it is, That we should not <hi>bear false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of God: Thou professest thy self to be <hi>a
Christian,</hi> and a servant, <hi>A child to God,</hi> and that
he is <hi>Thy Lord,</hi> Thy master, <hi>Thy father,</hi> Thy
God, <hi>Thou</hi> being one <hi>of his houshold,</hi> thou shouldst
labour <hi>To Credit</hi> and Honour Him to whom thou
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:46362:186"/>
belongest; <hi>To report to the world</hi> in our lives and
conversation, <hi>the Holiness and Purity</hi> of our God
and our father:<note place="margin">Joshua 24. 19.</note> Because He is <hi>Holy and Pure,</hi>
And <hi>loveth righteousness and Hateth iniquity.</hi> And
so all his servants ought to do, Thereby to bear
<hi>True witness</hi> to the world of our God; for else
they will say, as the proverb is, <hi>Like servant, like
Master,</hi> like Child, like Father. If you live other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
you break this Ninth Command, And <hi>bear
false witness</hi> to the world of thy Holy and Pure
God.</p>
                     <p>In all these I have taken the more pains, that
so you may see, that when you have <hi>learned</hi> a
Catechism, or the Bible by Heart, or that you
are able to answer, or speak to any point in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
acording to the Letter, and the <hi>Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Sense,</hi> and have got <hi>The letter of it</hi> without

<hi>The Substance,</hi> The Life and the Marrow:
you have but attained onely <hi>The Shell and the
Husk,</hi> and not the Meat nor the Kernel.</p>
                     <p>So then, <hi>by this time</hi> I hope you are come to
see, <hi>How</hi> this letter must be <hi>struck,</hi> How this

the way to make it unto us <hi>Debir,</hi> that is, <hi>The Word;</hi>
for it is never <hi>The word</hi> unto Us before: As you
may see in the Verse before my Text.</p>
                     <p>This City before it was <hi>smitten,</hi> it was called

                     <p>For this Book of the <hi>Bible,</hi> As it consists of

<hi>One word</hi> or syllable till they be read, and that
makes them words: And if a Book be <hi>written or
printed</hi> in English, Hebrew, or French, &amp;c. It is
the knowledge of him that reads makes them
<hi>words:</hi> For if an ignorant man look <hi>on them</hi> they
are nothing: So the Scriptures when they are
read they are made <hi>words,</hi> yet still the mind and
the mysterie lies hid, though the <hi>external sense</hi> be
understood; And <hi>The Acquired, Natural parts,
will Reach This sense;</hi> but the true and Hidden
Sense the Natural man cannot come at, As the
Apostle saith:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>The natural man perceiveth not the
things of God, for they are foolishness unto him: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed can he, because they are spiritually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And besides, if the natural man <hi>should perceive</hi>
the things of God, they are riddles, they <hi>are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishness

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:46362:187"/>
are perfect;</hi> to those onely that are <hi>immediately</hi>
taught of God: so then it is clear, this book of
the Letter must not onely be read, but <hi>Smitten</hi>
by <hi>Othniel,</hi> before you can find <hi>Gods Word.</hi> For
<hi>Gods Word</hi> as it is his Word, <hi>is not</hi> for every <hi>eye
to read,</hi> but onely for those to <hi>whom it is Given,</hi>
as our Saviour sayes in another case,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 10, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>To you it is
given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God;
but to them it is not given, because in seeing they
see not, and in hearing hear not, neither do they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.</hi>
They have not received <hi>power from

<hi>the pure water of life,</hi> clear as chrystal, <hi>proceeding
from the Throne of God and of the Lamb, Rev.</hi> 22. 1.<note place="margin">Rev. 22. 1.</note>
Tis not that <hi>Water,</hi> or that sense that proceeds
from the <hi>Universities,</hi> or any the acquired parts
or powers of Man, but it must be freely given
out by God himself, and seldome to the learned
Scribes and Pharisees, or to the great Princes of
the World; but to the <hi>despised,</hi> to the <hi>Off-scourings</hi>
to poor Fishermen and the like; that <hi>the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
might be convinced, that <hi>the power</hi> is of

                     </p>
                     <p>For this book of the Bible is, But the <hi>Letter to

                     <p>The <hi>Letter</hi> never binds <hi>The strong man,</hi> it never
conquers the will, and a mans <hi>Own Self;</hi> it never
makes a man to deny the World, To rejoyce in
the Cross, To <hi>sell</hi> all, and follow Christ. If the
<hi>letters</hi> or the <hi>Grammatical</hi> sense were the word of
God, Christ would never have so often condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and expressed <hi>so many</hi> woes against the
Scribes and Pharisees: for, who took <hi>moe pains</hi>
in them then they? who had them, or observed
them outwardly, <hi>more</hi> exactly? and <hi>for That,</hi>
The people had them in <hi>High</hi> Honour and great
<hi>Esteem:</hi> yet Christ He condemns all their <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>learning, holiness, parts, &amp;c.</hi> for they
sought not after the <hi>minde of Christ</hi> in them: if
they had known <hi>the Word of God,</hi> they would
have known <hi>him</hi> who was <hi>The Word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Literal Scriptures were the Word of
God, why doth the holy Ghost so often say, <hi>He
that hath ears to hear let him hear?</hi> And why
doth the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> say,<note place="margin">Isa. 6. 9, 10</note> 
                        <hi>That hearing they may

hear and not understand: and seeing they might see
and not perceive? make the heart of this people fat,
their ears dull, and their eyes heavy, lest they
should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears,
and understand with their hearts, and be converted,
and I should heal them:</hi> This is spoken, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of <hi>those</hi> that are ignorant, but <hi>of those</hi> that
are <hi>very knowing,</hi> and very much <hi>conceited</hi> of their
<hi>much knowing;</hi> and yet their knowledge, and gifts,
and <hi>Precise Holiness</hi> according to the Letter, is
but a stumbling-block and an occasion of their
<hi>falling,</hi> death, and destruction; and Thus to
<hi>know</hi> all things, is but to be <hi>ignorant</hi> of all things:
And God accounts <hi>these knowing men</hi> among the
number of those <hi>the world accounts</hi> The onely
Prophane; and he esteems them farther off the
Kingdom of God, <hi>Then Theeves and Harlots;</hi>

though they think they are possest of them, and

kiss their own hands; that is, they much set up
their own wills, their own wisdom, and their
own carnal reason, and cover themselves with
fig-leaves, as <hi>Adam</hi> did; whereby also they are
come to that pass (that as I said before) they
are ready to teach God knowledge, and <hi>To bring

                     <p>The word of God is <hi>Pure, High, Holy, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
Powerful, Reviving, Quickning, Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allizing,</hi>
But the Letter is not onely dead in all
these regards: But killing and destructive in that
sense formerly exprest, If you live and dye <hi>with
this word;</hi> I mean, the letter of the word, and the
<hi>Grammatical External sense,</hi> which <hi>These men
call</hi> the word of God: All is nothing, If you have
it <hi>exactly</hi> by heart, that you have it as ready at
your fingers ends, to apply it to all occasions, as

God,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> this is <hi>but bodily labour, and bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,</hi>
as the Apostle calls it, <hi>which profiteth nothing:</hi>
this is <hi>but the flesh,</hi> this is <hi>but mans teaching;</hi> the
Spirit of it, <hi>The WORD of God [Debir]</hi> you never
yet found: But yet as I said, let us not say; If
the Spirit be all, then what do we with the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
Let us then cast it away: No, no, by no
means; the letter is of use, to regulate the flesh,
and the outward man <hi>in bodily exercises:</hi> But I
say, it reaches not <hi>the inward man,</hi> and the heart.
That must be, <hi>That bread which</hi> the Father
<hi>giveth;</hi> which comes <hi>down</hi> from Heaven: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Moses,</hi> nor the knowledge of the whole

which is in the same proportion, done <hi>in us</hi> spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually.</p>
                     <p>And therefore this is that I advise still, <hi>Be sure
still, To maintain</hi> the letter of the word <hi>Undefiled,
Untouched, Uncorrupted:</hi> And let <hi>his tongue</hi> cleave
to, and <hi>for ever Rot</hi> in his mouth, <hi>That goes about</hi>
to abrogate the Letter; for without the letter
you cannot have the Spirit: even as we cannot
have <hi>Meat and Nutriment,</hi> but you must have
necessarily <hi>dung and excrements:</hi> and if you cast
away the <hi>Excrements,</hi> you cast away <hi>The Meat</hi>
with it: Not that the Letter is <hi>dung and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
as of it self, or killing, or dead; but <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally</hi>
made so, to us, and to all those, who crack

from it.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is said, <hi>My heart,</hi> or a <hi>Good heart,</hi>
a <hi>Caleb</hi> must set us a work, and an <hi>Othniel</hi> must

the flesh: I say a <hi>Caleb</hi> must smite <hi>this City,</hi> and
not <hi>a heart</hi> that seeks for <hi>liberty</hi> to satisfie its

there be too many, that would cast away the

the Letter and spare not: nay, I counsel, ye, Take
it, and Tear it, And <hi>Rend it all to pieces,</hi> as we do

                     <p>Nor do I bid you, do it as of your selves, <hi>by

we gave you a brief Epitome of the History of
<hi>Moses</hi> his sending the twelve Spies to discover

and view the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whereof <hi>Ioshua</hi>
and <hi>Caleb</hi> were two of the twelve: and they bring
news <hi>of the goodness of the Land</hi> with the other
Ten, which Ten, All but <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> they
brought up an <hi>Evil report,</hi> though they All con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
the Land was <hi>Excellent and good,</hi> and
abounded in plenty of all things,<note place="margin">Numb. 13. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>flowing with milk
and honey:</hi> yet they said it was impossible to get
it, or conquer it: for the men were <hi>mighty,</hi> sons
of <hi>Anack, Giants,</hi> and the walls <hi>Thick and high:</hi>
The people hearing this, <hi>began to murmur:</hi> Then
<hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua</hi> standing up, they <hi>clear the slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and encourage the people; and <hi>for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi>
and saith of theirs, they two onely entred
the <hi>Land;</hi> all the rest, being about Six hundred
thousand that murmured, <hi>died in the Wilderness,</hi>
and not one entred the Land.</p>
                     <p>And as we related the History, we raised some
observations, and endeavoured to bring <hi>the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
home to our selves, and shewed <hi>how these
things</hi> were daily in <hi>fulfilling</hi> spiritually and really
<hi>within us.</hi> Then we came to our Text, where I
also told you, that this Text as I have now read
it, It is <hi>Hebrew;</hi> and reading it but as it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
is still Hebrew.</p>
                     <p>But (as I then told you) we may not, nor

So may I say of this History and the rest of the

                     <p>The Letter is not this <hi>sealed book;</hi> for every

                     <p>Concerning <hi>Onus,</hi> the burden, I intimated, that
it is not sufficient <hi>To Read the Scriptures;</hi> No
though we could say all the Bible without Book,

nothing</hi> to salvation: If they would read the whole

                        <hi>neither in this world nor in the

<hi>The Nourishment,</hi> and the life, and the <hi>spirit of it</hi>

then the stomach <hi>separates</hi> the One and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>The Vertue and the Excrement,</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides

but never crack it, <hi>never break it,</hi> though they
seem so to do, and <hi>make you believe they</hi> expound
it, and give you the sense and the vertue: yet how
shallow, how <hi>literal,</hi> how humane, how low, how
sensual and carnal <hi>do they</hi> make the Word to be?
even your Rabbies, your Doctors, your <hi>great</hi>
Schollars; Which shews, If that God himself, if
the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah, If the Root of

                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 16.</note> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle

they neither desire nor <hi>know</hi> any better food: and
as their <hi>meat is,</hi> so are <hi>they,</hi> carnal and fleshly,

                     <p>Therefore I charge you in the name of God,
and <hi>as ever</hi> ye hope for heaven, or think to see
Gods face, <hi>learn,</hi> yet I know it is not in your
power <hi>to learn;</hi> but this I say, To shew what you
<hi>should be,</hi> and <hi>what you must be</hi> if ever you enter
<hi>into the Kingdom of God:</hi> learn henceforward I
say, Not to keep this Book in your houses <hi>onely,</hi>
and in your heads; <hi>But to BREAK the body of
Christ,</hi> that you may eat of the <hi>True bread;</hi> saith
our Lord, <hi>This is my body which is BROKEN for
you.</hi> Learn <hi>to smite the rock,</hi> that you may get
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:46362:198"/>
the <hi>pure water of life, running from under the Throne
of God and the Lamb, In the new Ierusalem;</hi> and not
<hi>outwardly</hi> to touch it <hi>onely;</hi> for <hi>that</hi> will do thee
<hi>no more good</hi> then if thou hadst <hi>Touched</hi> the body
of Christ when he was upon earth: yet many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
<hi>to see him,</hi> and rejoyced to see him, and <hi>To
converse</hi> with him, and <hi>Touch</hi> him; and so it is
now, and alwayes hath been in all ages <hi>with most
Professours</hi> in regard of the Letter and <hi>Externals</hi>
of the Word: Christs body does us <hi>no good,</hi> except
his body be broken, and his <hi>blood shed</hi> for us. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will the water you draw out of the Letter do
you any more good, <hi>for your souls,</hi> then that water
the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> drew out of <hi>Iacobs</hi> well,
And He that <hi>drinketh</hi> of that, shall <hi>Thirst again:</hi>
But <hi>He that drinketh of the Water</hi> that Christ
giveth, <hi>He shall never Thirst, and It shall be IN
HIM An Everlasting Well of water, Springing
up to Everlasting Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us Ministers and All others learn <hi>Rightly</hi>
to divide the <hi>word of truth,</hi> and not take <hi>the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi>
alone, but <hi>Outside and Inside</hi> together: and
then you shall find what it is, To <hi>marry Achsah,</hi>
and to have <hi>The Rending of the Vail.</hi> What it is
to have The Upper <hi>Springs</hi> And the Nether
<hi>Springs</hi> given you, as your JOINTURE.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let no man</hi> for Any thing that I have said, <hi>think
to undervalue</hi> the Letter, and to <hi>trample</hi> it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot
as <hi>Excrements and Prophane:</hi> For though
this be <hi>The Shell,</hi> The Outside, yet it is the Shell
and it is the <hi>Outside:</hi> but this is that I still say,
There is something within of more price, of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46362:198"/>
                        <hi>greater value;</hi> Thus far prize it, In that God
hath (by this means) given us the Kernel: In
the <hi>Shell</hi> is the kernel to be found, and <hi>without
the shell</hi> ye cannot have the kernel: As we can
never <hi>see LIFE,</hi> but we must see it in a <hi>mortal
thing</hi> That lives; so, The Ever blessed <hi>Sweet and
eternal Truth,</hi> is in the Letter <hi>Hid,</hi> as life is in <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,</hi>
and as <hi>fire</hi> in a thing <hi>fired;</hi> for True Fire,
The Element of Fire ye can never see: And
<hi>Truth</hi> is as an Oyster <hi>in the shell,</hi> fast shut up,
which shell must be <hi>forced open,</hi> before you can
have <hi>the meat:</hi> And he that doth <hi>thus</hi> by the
letter, <hi>shall have</hi> the meat, the vail <hi>Rent for him;</hi>
he shall have <hi>the priveledge</hi> to pry into <hi>the secrets</hi>
of my God, and <hi>he</hi> shall enter <hi>into his High and
Holy place.</hi>

and in truth <hi>most men</hi> are ignorant of Gods

black letters to be <hi>The word of God:</hi> you are

<hi>English,</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Hebrew?</hi> can we

or if he did, <hi>These Letters</hi> cannot be

speaks to them,</hi> And they hear <hi>him</hi> when they read
<hi>the letter:</hi> You are deceived in this, <hi>The letter</hi>
doth but bear Witness to the truth; Christ is <hi>the
Truth,</hi> and the letter <hi>gives Testimony</hi> to him: See
what the Evangelist sayes <hi>The Word is,</hi> Joh. 1.<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>In
the beginning was the word</hi> (Bibleswere not then)
<hi>and the word was God;</hi> This is <hi>That Word,</hi> so mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
both in the old and new Testament, To
which, all their Sacrifices and Prophesies <hi>pointed
to,</hi> in shadows; but the Substance of them is
Christ; as the Apostle saith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>The Law
is but a</hi> Shadow <hi>of good</hi> things <hi>to come:</hi> But
Christ he is <hi>The Word,</hi> He is <hi>The Truth,</hi> He is
<hi>those good things</hi> promised <hi>throughout</hi> All the
Scriptures. The letter is but <hi>the Shadow, the
Signes; the BODY and</hi> Substance <hi>is Iesus Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if it be so, then let me say thus much
more to you, <hi>Never any man ever yet Saw the
Truth, nor ever any man Heard the truth, nor
ever read the truth:</hi> Those that onely read <hi>the

                        <pb n="349" facs="tcp:46362:202"/>
is the word, and <hi>the word is the Spirit:</hi> It is the
Spirit <hi>That discerns</hi> the word through the letter,
and it is <hi>the Spirit</hi> that applyes it, where ever it
works; it is the Spirit onely that knows the
truth, And tis the Spirit onely, <hi>that fructifies and
thrives by it</hi> and lives in it. The word heard or
read, is but <hi>the Bark, the Outside, the Sheath, the
Lanthorn:</hi> but <hi>the Sap, the Life, the Sword, the
Light,</hi> that is within: And this is, Onely Christ
<hi>Co-Essential</hi> with the Father: This is <hi>that word
which</hi> the Scripture speaks of, which is able to
<hi>make the man of God perfect;</hi> for as the Apostle
saith,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. ult.</note> 
                        <hi>The Law made nothing perfect, but the
bringing in of a better hope did;</hi> for do you what
you can;<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 19.</note> yea, <hi>keep the whole Law,</hi> according to
the letter, yet <hi>this</hi> cannot make us <hi>perfect:</hi> But
<hi>this word, this truth</hi> we now unfold, is the <hi>Sure,
the real, the true, the eternal</hi> word, against which
<hi>The gates of hell shall never be able to prevail:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note>
Have ye what ye can of the letter, except ye have
also Christ, the substance thereof, <hi>the letter</hi> will
but deceive you; for you have but the shadow,
and therefore you must needs be deceived, for
you to think you have <hi>the substance,</hi> when you
have <hi>but the shadow:</hi> It is not <hi>any outward thing</hi>
we can do, will do us <hi>any good;</hi> it is the Spirit,

                     <p>When ye came to the Tabernacle, there was
first,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 1.</note> as I told you, <hi>A worldly sanctuary,</hi> as the
Apostle sets them down, <hi>Heb. 9. 1. And therein
was Ordinances and Divine service;</hi> for so the
Apostle calls it in the first verse. <hi>And therein was
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:46362:210"/>
the Candlesticks, and the table, and the Shew-bread,
and thither came the Priests, and did their office;
there was sacrifices and offerings for themselves,
and all the people;</hi> And All they could learn
there, was but <hi>worldly</hi> and <hi>external</hi> Ordinances,
<hi>bodily worships,</hi> which concerned not <hi>the heart</hi>
and the inward man; But, if they offered such
and such <hi>External</hi> things as was required, this
was all: But into the second Vail within the
Holie of Holies, <hi>thither the High Priest must
come but once a year,</hi> (for we shall onely at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
touch at those particulars mentioned there
by the Apostle) And first, There was <hi>the golden
Censer,</hi> which typified <hi>Christs offering the prayers
of the Saints,</hi> as it is exprest <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. there is an
Angel which had the <hi>Golden Censer,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 8. 3.</note> and there
was given him <hi>much Incense,</hi> that he should offer
it <hi>with the prayers of the Saints</hi> upon the golden
Altar; which Angel is Jesus Christ, <hi>the Angel
of the Covenant:</hi> shewing unto us <hi>thus much,</hi>
that he is <hi>the Mediator between God and man,</hi>
for whose sake all our services are <hi>accepted:</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is accepted <hi>from us</hi> with the Father, <hi>But
what his Son doth</hi> in us: Be they never <hi>such</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

                        <p>I Will not <hi>much contend</hi> with them that will
have <hi>The Tree of Knowledge of Good and
Evil,</hi> as it is Recorded in <hi>Sacred</hi> Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
to be A Natural Tree, Planted by
God in Paradise, And of such A <hi>Nature,</hi> That
whosoever did Eat of it, should have <hi>their Eyes
opened</hi> against themselves, and so to be made <hi>As
Gods,</hi> To know <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil;</hi> It may be, God
would <hi>Admonish</hi> Adam both <hi>Inwardly</hi> and <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,</hi>
of what He did <hi>Inwardly,</hi> and in His
Heart, either Forbid or <hi>Teach</hi> him; <hi>That</hi> He
would likewise <hi>for the greater Evidence,</hi> Set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
His <hi>Outward</hi> eyes; But I desire withall, that
they will <hi>grant</hi> This, that What was <hi>Outwardly
done,</hi> The Same also happened <hi>Inwardly,</hi> in the
heart of <hi>Adam;</hi> That he was there <hi>Tempted</hi> by
the <hi>SEED</hi> of the <hi>Serpent;</hi> To make <hi>some Account</hi>
and <hi>Reckoning</hi> of his <hi>own Wisdom Will</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi>
and not to <hi>Submit</hi> Himself unto God, As <hi>Void
of all Name, Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Work;</hi> But to be
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:46362:218"/>
                           <hi>SOMETHING</hi> of himself, And There are Two
Causes that move me <hi>to think</hi> so. The First is
this, Because the Promise is, That <hi>the seed of the
Woman should Bruise the Head of the Serpent;</hi>
Now, We read of no <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Living</hi> Serpent
whose head was so Bruised, by that <hi>Seed;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
say I, As the <hi>Spiritual Seed</hi> of the Woman,
was in <hi>Adams Heart,</hi> So likewise <hi>was the Serpents
Seed;</hi> For Man indeed was made Good, Not
<hi>of the Substance of God,</hi> But out <hi>f Nothing:</hi> And
therefore, He Alwayes <hi>Turns Himself</hi> from God
and Inclineth to <hi>His own NOTHING</hi> and <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
For, I call, The <hi>Devil, Sin, Death</hi> and <hi>Hell,
NOTHING:</hi> As many of the Ancient Fathers
have done, and especially <hi>Taulerus</hi> For, God Never
Created <hi>Them,</hi> But they are A <hi>NON-ENTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY,</hi>
A <hi>NOT-BEING,</hi> which is Contrary, And
Perfectly oposite to <hi>ENTITY</hi> and <hi>BEING.</hi> And
Peradventure, this was <hi>the Devil</hi> that dwelt in
<hi>Adam,</hi> and Seduced Him, As well as in <hi>Lucifer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The other <hi>Cause</hi> is this, That the Scriptures
likewise Witness That, <hi>The City of God,</hi> And <hi>The
Heavenly Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>The Kingdom of God,</hi> is
a Paradise <hi>Within Us;</hi> And further; that God and
His <hi>Almighty Word,</hi> Is Our Paradise, The <hi>Tree
of Life,</hi> The <hi>Temple.</hi> Where we <hi>Dwell, Walk,
Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Pray;</hi> As we likewise are <hi>His
Temple</hi> and <hi>Paradise:</hi> And, That <hi>The BEAST</hi>
Spoken of in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> Which the <hi>Whole</hi>
World, <hi>Great and Smal,</hi> Do At This Day
<hi>Worship</hi> in their Hearts As likewise, <hi>The Tree of
Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> is <hi>Within Us.</hi> For,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:46362:218"/>
All the Whole <hi>Exterior</hi> World, or Whatsoever
either <hi>is,</hi> Or is <hi>done</hi> Outwardly, are but Onely
<hi>An Accident,</hi> and <hi>A Figure,</hi> Signifying The <hi>Truth</hi>
of the thing And, The <hi>Internal</hi> Nature. And
therefore There is <hi>Nothing</hi> True, of whatsoever
is <hi>Seen</hi> with our <hi>Eyes;</hi> For the Figure <hi>and Fashion
of this world must pass away</hi> and Perish, As being
<hi>Nothing else</hi> but a certain <hi>Imaginary</hi> world, And
The Figure of the <hi>World</hi> That is <hi>True, Right,
Eternal,</hi> and <hi>subsisting of it Self.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Consequently, all things, which in the <hi>Bible</hi>
were done <hi>Externally</hi> and <hi>Signifyingly,</hi> must
again <hi>be done</hi> and <hi>again,</hi> brought to pass <hi>After
their Manner;</hi> And, All the History of the Bible,
All <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, and in Summe, the
Whole Scriptures <hi>Do,</hi> To This Day, <hi>Stand in
Force,</hi> And are <hi>Continually</hi> Accomplished and
<hi>Fulfilled,</hi> Internally, and Spiritually. All things
are <hi>By Christ</hi> Translated, <hi>into the Truth,</hi> And
it must needs be, That All the Prophesies which
God spake, <hi>From the beginning of the world, by
the Mouth of his Holy Ones</hi> must still be <hi>Called
back, Reiterated,</hi> or Done <hi>over again;</hi> therefore
that <hi>Shadow</hi> or that Tree, Was and is Nothing
else in the Truth, But the <hi>Nature, Will, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
and <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Adam; Of This</hi> He should
not <hi>Have Eaten, This</hi> He should not have <hi>Ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed</hi>
or <hi>Arrogated To</hi> Himself; But Rather, To
be <hi>Free,</hi> and <hi>Freely</hi> Subject To God, and not
to have <hi>Known</hi> anything, But <hi>What</hi> God <hi>Knew</hi>
In Him, Nor to have <hi>Done</hi> any thing, But <hi>What</hi>
God Did in Him; Nor, to have <hi>spoken</hi> any
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:46362:219"/>
thing, But <hi>What</hi> God <hi>Spake</hi> in Him, and so forth
in the rest.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To the End That God,</hi> Without any Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment,
<hi>Might have</hi> Exercised <hi>His</hi> Almighty
Kingdom, Will, Nature <hi>and</hi> Power, <hi>In Him: But</hi>
Himself <hi>should have been utterly</hi> Void <hi>of all</hi>
Knowledge, Will, <hi>or</hi> Nature, <hi>And not have</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated
<hi>any of These,</hi> As Proper <hi>to Himself:
This</hi> Pleased <hi>God,</hi> This <hi>was</hi> That <hi>Which He</hi>
Commanded, <hi>And what He</hi> would <hi>have had</hi>
Done.</p>
                        <p>To this <hi>Interpretation agreeth</hi> GERMANE
DIVINITY, which <hi>Resolves</hi> That this Tree in
the substance thereof is Nothing else, But <hi>our
Own Will,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> of which Alone In all
the <hi>Earthy</hi> Paradise of this <hi>Wide World</hi> of our
Hearts, We Ought <hi>not to Eat;</hi> But to <hi>Account</hi> it
as <hi>Forbidden,</hi> Except we will also <hi>Eat</hi> of <hi>Death</hi>
and <hi>Destruction.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now then, As soon as <hi>Adam Fell,</hi> and did
<hi>Eat</hi> of This <hi>Tree,</hi> The <hi>TREE,</hi> was <hi>Immediately</hi>
Planted, <hi>in His Mind,</hi> And afterward <hi>Derived,</hi>
into <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Branches</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> thereof, So that
As, the Same <hi>Word, Precept,</hi> and <hi>Forbidding</hi> was
Common <hi>to all,</hi> So is <hi>The same</hi> Fall. All We
which are <hi>In Adam</hi> Have now, <hi>Eaten of Death,</hi>
and haue <hi>Received</hi> from the Serpent, This <hi>Undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested</hi>
Poyson: <hi>Of an ill Bird, an ill Egge.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence, it may easily be <hi>perceived,</hi> How,
Every Man is His Own <hi>Greatest</hi> Enemy; And
what he ought <hi>to think of Himself,</hi> Of his Own
<hi>Will, Understanding, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:46362:219"/>
it is the <hi>Counsel, Seed, Wisdom, Knowledge</hi>
and <hi>Head</hi> of the Serpent, Which must <hi>By Christ,</hi>
be <hi>Bruised</hi> In us; I say, it must needs be, That
(As in the Old Testament was <hi>Signified</hi> by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
and in the New One by Baptisme)
<hi>All things</hi> which we have <hi>By Nature</hi> and <hi>Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
from <hi>Adam</hi> Must <hi>Dye,</hi> That we may <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn</hi>
and <hi>Put off</hi> All Things, Even as we would do,
The Devil, And <hi>Death</hi> it self, <hi>viz.</hi> Our own <hi>Will,
Prudence, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> Wherewith
as with <hi>Figleaves</hi> Our <hi>Adam,</hi> doth <hi>Vainly</hi> seek to
Hide Himself; For that is <hi>SIN,</hi> and the <hi>Sting</hi> of
Death; Namely, To <hi>Eat</hi> of This <hi>Tree,</hi> And to
<hi>Arrogate</hi> to a Mans Self, His own <hi>Wisdom, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
Will, Nature,</hi> or <hi>Himself.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But Alas for Woe, <hi>Who knowes This,</hi> Who
thinks of it? Who is it That is <hi>Displeased</hi> with
his Own <hi>Will, Understanding</hi> or <hi>Wisdom,</hi> Oh
when shall we <hi>forsake</hi> them? Every Man De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights

His Mind, Sweetly, and <hi>Contentedly</hi> therein, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing</hi>
upon His Own <hi>Knowledge, Understanding,</hi>
and the like. The <hi>Tree</hi> is <hi>Fair</hi> to be <hi>looked</hi> upon,

The <hi>World;</hi> And shewed him a <hi>Way</hi> whereby he

God, <hi>Who cannot Hate Us,</hi> Ever deals <hi>Mercifully</hi>
with Us, Howsoever he <hi>handleth</hi> Us, If we would

In the <hi>True Paradise (i. e.)</hi> In <hi>Adams Heart;</hi>
As There is, <hi>The Tree of Knowledge of Good and

God and the Devil are, Even so are These <hi>Two

That the <hi>One</hi> brings Life, <hi>The Other Death.</hi> And
therefore <hi>It is Impossible,</hi> That whoso Eates

A <hi>Separation.</hi> For who so <hi>Eats</hi> of the <hi>Tree

that <hi>Greedily Swallowes down,</hi> and <hi>Devoureth</hi>
Humane and Diabolical <hi>VVisdom,</hi> He Is already

As Elsewhere The Scripture <hi>Speaketh,</hi> Of <hi>Eating</hi>

<hi>Believe,</hi> To <hi>Know</hi> God, and the like.</p>
                        <p>As likewise, it is <hi>All one,</hi> to Be in <hi>Adam,</hi> To

is he that Adores not Himself, and saith to his Own

Thou art My God, In thee I Hope, In thee I Trust?
They do not, I grant, say thus with their mouth, but their
Whole life, and their Idolatrizing mind saith as much
by their deeds.</p>
                        <p>Here, Here it is, that all Mortal men deny God, and

why do they not leave <hi>Vengeance</hi> to God?<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 35.</note> Why are

making no account of his Commandements? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do they labour Night and Day to Get and Heap up
Riches? Truly all this is because they believe not That
God hath any care of them, or will or can Revenge for
them; And therefore it is necessary that they Help and
Revenge themselves; Otherwise they might look long
enough unto Gods Hand, but be overcome and starve
before Roasted <hi>Geese</hi> flye into their mouthes (as they

And they might be killed ten times over, and they
might all beg their bread if they will have ought to do
with God and truth in good earnest: No, they must not
be wanting to themselves, but make their own Markets,
by Lying, Deceiving, Cousening, and Usury. This, This
they are assured will do them good and inrich them.
Whereas his commandments would come too late for
to Help them, and fail them at most need, and the Word
of God is an insufficient Help in Adversity; Therefore it

to take men off from admiring such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities:
or rather to take an advantage by
them, and thereby <hi>improving</hi> them, to raise
up the mind to real Glories, which have so

                        <p>AS this Psalm was undoubtedly <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids,</hi>
so it is more then probable
the <hi>occasion</hi> of penning it (as you
may see at the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ginning thereof)
was upon the <hi>removing of the Ark</hi>
to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the City of <hi>David,</hi> from the house
of <hi>Abinadab, 2 Sam.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.</note> At which time <hi>David</hi>
with the rest of the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> played on
all manner of Instruments, and danced before
the Ark: Whereupon <hi>Michal</hi> his wife <hi>Sauls</hi>
daughter <hi>despised him for a fool:</hi> An extasie of
joy <hi>seizing upon his spirit,</hi> he enjoying so much
of God in it, caused him to <hi>leap</hi> and <hi>dance</hi> before
it: She hereupon takes upon her to reprove,
<hi>censure,</hi> and <hi>revile</hi> him, and in her heart <hi>scorned</hi>
him, sayes the text, <hi>v.</hi> 16.<note place="margin">V. 16.</note> But <hi>David</hi> being <hi>lifted
up,</hi> filled with <hi>divine</hi> joy, <hi>slighted her,</hi> and told

                        </p>
                        <p>And the reason of this <hi>conjecture,</hi> is, because
this Psalm begins with that very Proverb that
was <hi>appointed</hi> to be said at the <hi>rising</hi> of the Ark
out of its place, Num. 10. 25.<note place="margin">Num. 10. 25.</note>

                        <p>Now I say, <hi>Chariots</hi> were used in two regards:
As the <hi>great men and Princes of the Earth</hi> (besides
that common use for ease) they had them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for their <hi>state</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> and those were for
<hi>triumph;</hi> or else for <hi>terror</hi> and <hi>dreadfulness,</hi> and
those were for <hi>warre.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some Chariots were drawn with two horses,
some with 4, some with 6 or else for the more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46362:229"/>
glory, they were sometimes drawn with men:
So also as Chariots were to several ends, so they
were of divers fashions; some were made of
<hi>wood,</hi> and some of <hi>Iron,</hi> and some were made
<hi>with Hooks,</hi> according to their several <hi>uses</hi> and
<hi>Ends</hi> for which they were.</p>
                        <p>So our great God, when he will appear in</p>
                        <p>Triumph,
or
Terror,</p>

18. 10, 11. <hi>He made darkness his secret place, and
his pavilion round about him were dark waters and

down, and darkness was under his feet.</hi> Tis true, he
fills Heaven and Earth, but in the Earth <hi>we</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see him so <hi>open</hi> and <hi>manifest:</hi> Sometimes

God was both <hi>the cloud</hi> and the <hi>fire</hi> that went

                        <p>Yet let me tell you, no man can see God <hi>as
he is,</hi> not in his <hi>Essence;</hi> no not the Angels in

<hi>that,</hi> nor ever shall be; but then the scales of
<hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>blindness</hi> shall fall from our eyes,
and then we shall see his <hi>Influence</hi> into all
Creatures, and how this infinite God Flowes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46362:234"/>
into them all, as the river of Thames or the
Sea, by its streams it flows into all the adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to their capacity, &amp; not according to their

to set out God to you) but something in a way
of resemblance, I say after this manner doth the
Almighty Flow into all his Creatures, into

                        </p>
                        <p>For if God should <hi>fill</hi> his creatures, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate

he should destroy his <hi>creatures:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Exod. 33. 20.</note> As to <hi>Moses,</hi>
God shewed him as much as <hi>a creature</hi> could <hi>see

had been <hi>blinded</hi> &amp; <hi>undone</hi> by it: for <hi>things</hi> may
be as well <hi>invisible</hi> by <hi>too much</hi> light, as by <hi>too

the Sun, if it should <hi>shine unto us in that excess</hi> of

we should <hi>see nothing</hi> at all. But whatever <hi>we see
not of God now,</hi> while we are in the world, it is
not for <hi>want</hi> of light in God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note> but for want of
light in us, because <hi>the thick scales</hi> and the <hi>thick

the <hi>accidents</hi> and <hi>matter</hi> that <hi>clothes</hi> God in the

                        </p>
                        <p>For if we ask <hi>the Sea,</hi> or the <hi>Winds,</hi> or <hi>Beasts,</hi>

of him: for thou art now <hi>a hidden God</hi> from our

the <hi>action, motion</hi> and <hi>being</hi> of every creature; yet
God <hi>himself</hi> is a <hi>hidden</hi> &amp; a <hi>close</hi> God. As <hi>Iacob</hi>

                        <p>Take home <hi>this truth</hi> with you, and the Lord

<hi>how little so ever it be,</hi> it is <hi>the house of God,</hi> and

but they think they have an <hi>Essence</hi> and

of</hi> God, and at a <hi>distance</hi> from him (as indeed

It may be when you have <hi>thought</hi> of God you
would resemble him to some glorious thing,

you have <hi>thought</hi> of him to <hi>resemble</hi> him by;
so, it may be you have <hi>sometime</hi> thought him to
be [Sweet] but he is not <hi>sweet,</hi> as we conceive

nor of <hi>Honey,</hi> nor any such thing: he is not the

these have their <hi>pleasantness, light and sweetness;</hi>
and whatever <hi>excellency</hi> any creature hath, he
is not that thing (as some have foolishly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited)
because God is in them, therefore they
are Gods &amp;c. this declares in such much igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

him from the love of God which is in Christ
Iesus our Lord:</hi> For nothing <hi>hinders</hi> or <hi>separates</hi>
us from Christ in this case but these things:
Although I know many men <hi>say</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> in a

a truth, but <hi>too general</hi> a truth: But this is a

                        <p>For were it not for the <hi>vail</hi> of Accidents that

but those things, <hi>those Accidents</hi> removed from

<hi>mover;</hi> nay, where any thing hath a <hi>Being,</hi> a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
he is <hi>the Being of that Being,</hi> the <hi>Substance
of that Substance,</hi> (if we may call any thing <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
or <hi>Being</hi> but God.) For he is the Motion

<hi>They see</hi> that the Lord is among them <hi>as in

<hi>thousands of Angels:</hi> that is, they are <hi>innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
infinite, immense:</hi> And I think that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
is best and most agreeable to the
<hi>manner</hi> of the Scriptures <hi>expressions,</hi> and to the
<hi>meaning</hi> of the word here used, and <hi>elsewhere:</hi>
For the Hebrew word <hi>Ribboth</hi> signifies ten

that <hi>hint</hi> before expressed.</p>
                        <p>Then the Chariots of God are numberless,
that is, no man can <hi>number</hi> them; not but that
God can <hi>number them,</hi> and call them all by their
<hi>names,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> sayes of the Stars, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 4.<note place="margin">Ps. 147. 4.</note>
for any <hi>number</hi> that can be numbered, is but
like the <hi>number of the Beast, Rev.</hi> 13. 18. which
is according to <hi>the number of a man:</hi> but God
numbereth <hi>all things:</hi> for as he made all things

in <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>measure,</hi> so in <hi>number, Wisd,</hi> 11. 17.<note place="margin">Wisd. 11. 17.</note>
Suppose as great a <hi>number</hi> as can be <hi>numbered,</hi> as

is beyond all thought, and <hi>to us</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to number them. If all the words that
ever I spake, or ever shall speak, were <hi>unmbered:</hi>
if the <hi>minutes</hi> that are past since the world

                           </hi> but himself is the <hi>plot,</hi> the <hi>stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,</hi>
the <hi>measure of all;</hi> and the <hi>measure, scales,</hi>

not</hi> according to the <hi>number</hi> of a man, nor he
<hi>weighs not</hi> as man <hi>weighs.</hi> It sufficeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the number of his Chariots are as
the number of his wayes, both in <hi>difficulty</hi>

                        <p>Beloved, I will propound it very briefly to
you in two things, or two Scriptures, wherein
ye may a little have a <hi>glimpse</hi> of God, and
a <hi>smal scantling</hi> of God, and of God Almighties
Arithmetick: and if this <hi>smal scantling</hi> and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>glimpse</hi> be so wonderful, what is his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?
what is himself? what is his Essence
and glorious Being?</p>
                        <p>One shall be from that which <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Ps.</hi>
90. 4.<note place="margin">Ps. 90. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>A thousand years with God are but as yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
or as one day: there is no succession of
time with him. In a thousand years (you know)
are 365000 dayes, and all this time is to God
but as one day is to us: Then who can number
<hi>dayes</hi> with God? so who can number Gods An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
his Armies and his Chariots? they are to
us <hi>infinite,</hi> and <hi>numberless</hi> as to men; we must
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46362:242"/>
not nor cannot number them, no, <hi>not according
to the number of a man:</hi> As we must not <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
God by mans <hi>measure,</hi> so God numbers
not by mans number, nor measures not by

expressed under any <hi>Name</hi> or <hi>Attribute,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
him not as <hi>you</hi> apprehend of that <hi>Attribute;</hi>
but as <hi>infinitely</hi> beyond it, as the <hi>Ocean</hi> to the

                        </p>
                        <p>Beloved, when we think of God, we must go
backward from our <hi>first principles</hi> that were <hi>born</hi>
with us, or <hi>instilled</hi> into us by our <hi>Teachers,</hi> or
acquired by our <hi>industry,</hi> and <hi>unlearn</hi> what we
have been learning so <hi>long,</hi> or rather transcend
and forget and forsake all <hi>that</hi> knowledge of
him: we must be stript from all carnal appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of God, so as to <hi>measure</hi> him by any
thing we can <hi>comprehend.</hi> And to teach us this
<hi>Arithmetick,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Isa. 28. 10.</note> we had need <hi>have line upon line,

we can learn <hi>these things:</hi> for they are farre

                        <p>As all the wayes of God are <hi>unknowable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable,
Rom.</hi> 11. 33.<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> so all the Armies of God
are unsearchable, unknowable: and the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots
of God are all <hi>the wayes</hi> of God. And
both Chariots and Wayes are his Creatures:
God hath his wayes in all his Creatures: his
goings <hi>forth</hi> and <hi>workings</hi> in all the Creatures,
are but <hi>the goings forth</hi> of himself; they are but
the <hi>displayings</hi> of his own <hi>wisdom, power</hi> and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46362:243"/>
                           <hi>greatness. Be hmoth</hi> is called <hi>The Prince of the

is, he is <hi>infinitely</hi> so as <hi>he is:</hi> If he be called <hi>[good]</hi>

Being, &amp; he only hath a Being: for if any thing
else hath a <hi>being,</hi> he cannot be <hi>infinite;</hi> All things
but God, are but <hi>shadows, bubbles,</hi> soon vanish,

there is no <hi>power</hi> nor <hi>wisdom, &amp;c.</hi> but onely his,

                        <p>But for all this, I know, and methinks I hear
your <hi>murmuring</hi> thoughts still; for all this you

these things, or else we would not complain,

not <hi>lowe</hi> nor complain.</p>
                        <p>I answer, Indeed that may be, that you are
without them.</p>
                        <p>1. It may be you are not of the <hi>family</hi> of your

                        <p>And let not me think, because there are so

one species, cannot be known by any one individual:</hi>
And so Gods Church <hi>is a glorious Church,</hi> taken
not as being in any one member, but <hi>in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
body:</hi> As the <hi>perfections</hi> of a man cannot be
known <hi>by any one man;</hi> for if one man have <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
another hath <hi>sobriety;</hi> if one hath <hi>patience,</hi>
another man hath <hi>temperance;</hi> so that the <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Church</hi> cannot be known <hi>by any one
member,</hi> be it <hi>never so excellent:</hi> If <hi>Abraham</hi> hath
faith, <hi>Iob hath</hi> patience; if <hi>Ioseph</hi> hath <hi>chastness,
Moses</hi> hath <hi>meekness,</hi> &amp;c. so that as you must not
look for the perfections of a man <hi>in one man;</hi>
for, if one be <hi>as fair</hi> as <hi>Absalom,</hi> another is as
<hi>proper</hi> as <hi>Saul:</hi> if one hath <hi>proportion,</hi> another
hath <hi>sobriety, &amp;c.</hi> so neither must we look to
see <hi>the admirable perfection</hi> of the Spouse of
Christ,<note place="margin">Cant. 4. 7.</note> that is all <hi>fair,</hi> and hath no <hi>spot,</hi> by one
member; neither by all that are now living
upon the earth, or that were; but look upon
all that ever <hi>were, are, and shall be,</hi> and adde to
them <hi>their Head</hi> [Christ] and then it is <hi>a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Church</hi> indeed, and in her no spot at all;
So though every creature <hi>express God;</hi> One, one
attribute: another, another: and they speak his
praise wonderfully; yet they come infinitely
shorr of him: and though altogether they say
<hi>somewhat,</hi> yet <hi>not the tenth part of him:</hi> not the
tenth part of his <hi>Iustice,</hi> not the tenth part of
his <hi>patience</hi> not the tenth part of his <hi>Mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> &amp;c.
<hi>One is sent</hi> to deliver <hi>a message</hi> of his love, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>a message</hi> of his justice, another <hi>a message</hi> of
his patience, another <hi>a message</hi> of his liberality

and bounty, all of several <hi>errands;</hi> and whatever

<hi>above the form;</hi> but in the Angels above,
<hi>form</hi> prevails over the <hi>matter;</hi> for <hi>if our forms</hi>
were not <hi>bounded</hi> and <hi>fastned</hi> to the earth, <hi>by
their matter,</hi> even <hi>we</hi> should be <hi>as the Angels of
God:</hi> so that we should no sooner <hi>think</hi> or <hi>desire</hi>
to be in any place, were it <hi>never</hi> so far off, but
we should <hi>immediately</hi> be there; for, <hi>how soon</hi>
can my spirit convey it self in thought <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of miles?</hi> but my body <hi>cannot be there,</hi> but
by <hi>times</hi> and <hi>succession of gradation,</hi> and by <hi>steps.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The reason is, because the form <hi>is imprisoned</hi>
in the matter; earth goes to earth, and <hi>ashes</hi> to
<hi>ashes,</hi> and <hi>dust</hi> to <hi>dust,</hi> naturally, because it is
its center: but the spirit <hi>goes upward</hi> naturally;
the higher <hi>we go</hi> from the earth, the more <hi>pure</hi>
the elements; and the <hi>nearer</hi> the earth, the
more <hi>gross,</hi> the more <hi>dull,</hi> the more <hi>sad</hi> and
<hi>lumpish;</hi> it is impossible that a heavy body
should hang in the air; for every thing <hi>tends</hi> and
<hi>bend</hi> to his center; if it be a heavy body, it will
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46362:251"/>
fall <hi>downward;</hi> the water <hi>is purer</hi> then the <hi>earth,</hi>
the <hi>air</hi> then the <hi>water,</hi> the <hi>light</hi> then the <hi>air,</hi> the
<hi>fire</hi> then the <hi>light,</hi> and so <hi>more and more</hi> spiritual,
till you come <hi>to him,</hi> who is <hi>All</hi> Spiritual, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
it <hi>self.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And for those Angels are <hi>out of our sight,</hi>
which are said to be in heaven, you know there
are <hi>degrees of them;</hi> some are <hi>Angels,</hi> some <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels,</hi>
some <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and some <hi>Seraphims;</hi>

                           </gap> therefore if you have <hi>observed</hi> it, if ever ye
saw Angels <hi>pictured,</hi> they were drawn with <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
bodies,</hi> from head to foot, but yet to shew
they are above a man, and more spirit, therefore
they have alwayes <hi>wings,</hi> which shew that they
are above us in their Nature, and are <hi>carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
our element,;</hi> but <hi>Arch-angels</hi> they are
pictured <hi>with half bodies,</hi> cut off at the middle,
<hi>with wings:</hi> shewing that they are <hi>further off</hi>
from matter; but <hi>Cherubims</hi> they have <hi>faces one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with wings,</hi> shewing that they are <hi>further off
then all</hi> these: but <hi>Seraphims</hi> they are <hi>pictured</hi> as
it were, without any form or matter at all,
onely with <hi>a kind of fiery flame,</hi> or <hi>yellowishness:</hi>
Therefore now of these Angels that are <hi>above
us,</hi> we can say little of them; because men
being in Nature below, and they <hi>above our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
Even as if we should ask <hi>a Toad,</hi> what
man is? it could say <hi>nothing,</hi> because it is in a

there is nothing of <hi>Fortune,</hi> but all <hi>comes</hi> and

the name of <hi>Fortune</hi> is an <hi>Idle,</hi> a <hi>Heathenish,</hi> and
<hi>a wicked</hi> word, taking it as the word <hi>imports;</hi>
for nothing comes by <hi>Chance or Fortune,</hi> but tis
God that guides all; And yet knowing the right
use of that word it may be <hi>used;</hi> for it is used in
the Scriptures: saith <hi>Solomon; For Time and
chance,</hi> or fortune (for 'tis the same) <hi>happeneth to
all things;</hi> Though it <hi>first arose</hi> from an evil
<hi>ground</hi> &amp; from the Heathens, who because there
were <hi>such cross events</hi> in the world, that when
a business was brought to the heads and period,
yet one thing or other oftentimes came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>the cup &amp; the lip;</hi> (as we say,) and quite
turned all about: now hereat they were <hi>so
amazed</hi> and at their wits end, they could not
tell how this should come to pass, except there
was a God call'd [Forune] and therefore they
sacrificed to him; But I say the <hi>ground</hi> and
<hi>mis-use</hi> being forgotten, it may come in time
to be <hi>lawful</hi> to use it, at least by such who know
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46362:255"/>
how to use it. But what it imports is wicked,
and is condemned by this Doctrine as abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
                        <p>We poor creatures stand and wonder at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>events</hi> in the world; here now God calls all
the creatures <hi>Fools;</hi> for instance: When two
dear friends, that have been long apart, not
having seen one another in twenty or fourty
years, he one falls to come in some great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
his dear friend chanceth to come at <hi>a very
instant,</hi> and saves his life: here now we stand
and wonder; it is no wounder at all, if we eye
God; ye are herein but <hi>fools</hi> and <hi>blinde:</hi> Again,
for example if you see me strike <hi>these two hands</hi>
together, if you saw not my body <hi>that guides</hi>
these, we may wonder at it; but what wonder
is it, if you see me strike these two togther? <hi>so</hi>
far as you are blind and <hi>see not God,</hi> so far ye
wonder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is as easie with God to do any of
these things, as for me to make my hands <hi>meet.</hi>
I can also by the power and guidance of the
soul that is in me, lay my finger <hi>in the darkest
night,</hi> upon any place about me; why? because
my soul within me guides it: so it is as easie
for God in any case, he being (as it were) <hi>the soul</hi>
of the creatures, can cause the creatures to do
whatever is his <hi>Will to have done, both in Heaven
and earth and in the Seas,</hi> as David saith.</p>
                        <p>Thus I have spoken to you of this <hi>our Immense,
Unknown, Unexpressible</hi> Great <hi>God;</hi> But O my
Beloved, I have spoken but <hi>according to man</hi> all
this while, infinitey short of him himself; and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46362:255"/>
therefore never <hi>scanty</hi> or circumscribe God by
these things I have said; for he is this, and he is
<hi>infinitly</hi> more: for if men <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and
<hi>Cherubims</hi> &amp; <hi>Seraphims</hi> should all <hi>joyn</hi> together,

could conceive or relate, yet <hi>look further,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
still; for when they have said what they
can, they have said <hi>nothing</hi> in comparison of
<hi>what he is:</hi> As if a man should come from some

and should immediately go back and say, he

Even so when Men and Angels, and

have neither <hi>related</hi> nor <hi>seen</hi> any more then the
<hi>Out-coasts,</hi> the <hi>Suburbs</hi> of this <hi>our</hi> great God,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46362:256"/>
or of his <hi>Kingdom, Glory</hi> and <hi>Majesty;</hi> I say
when we have <hi>written</hi> and <hi>spoken</hi> to the utmost,
even <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and all <hi>Creatures,</hi> put <hi>all</hi>
together, all that <hi>ever</hi> they can <hi>do</hi> or <hi>say,</hi> They
all speak <hi>infinitely,</hi> infinitely short of him; they
<hi>all</hi> can shew you but the Cockle-Shels, and the
<hi>Pibble-stones</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom Glory</hi> and <hi>Majesty:</hi>
they can describe <hi>nothing</hi> in comparison of
<hi>what</hi> God is. They have not seen the City with

with twelve manner of precious stones:
and the twelve gates of several pearls, and the
streets of the City Transparent as Chrystal. And
the Glory of God and of the lamb, are the light

                        <p>O then, let us <hi>learn</hi> to give him the <hi>Glory,</hi> the

                        <p>Ye may observe in the words (yet rather for

<list>
                              <item>1 The first is her Request, <hi>Tell me,</hi> she is in a
doubt, and cannot be satisfied, therefore she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to be taught.</item>
                              <item>2 The Adjuration, or the <hi>Poise</hi> or weight she
hangs upon her request; it is not slight, weak,
cold, or perfunctory: but she is violent in her
request,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 12.</note> &amp; follows him with strong arguments,
<hi>Oh thou whom my soul loveth;</hi> she <hi>offers violence to
the Kingdom of God:</hi> to say the truth, she doth
as it were <hi>commit a Rape</hi> upon the Kingdome
of God.</item>
                              <item>3 The Matter of her Request, and that is
double, she would know <hi>where he feeds, &amp; where
he rests at noon.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>4 <hi>The Reason of all this, why she would be
taught</hi> where he rests, and where he feeds: for why
should I be as those that turn aside by the flocks of
thy companions?</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>1 For her Request, <hi>Tell me, teach me;</hi> think it
not strange that this Spouse who is so great and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46362:260"/>
familiar with her Husband and Lord, that <hi>thi
Spouse</hi> doth desire to be taught of him: neither
look upon her as guilty of curiosity or imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies;
Although she <hi>wants</hi> for no instruction,
but is acquainted with <hi>all the counsel of God,</hi> and
she knows all things, for she hath received <hi>an
unction from the holy One,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 27.</note> which abideth within
her, and <hi>she knows all things;</hi> yet here she is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
that <hi>she wants something.</hi> In such <hi>passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
speeches</hi> as these, so full of raptures of love,
ye must not look for method, for they excel &amp;
fly above the regiment of reason, truth it is, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
is the Art of reason, but passions are either
above reason or beneath it; but here above it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>David</hi> was a man taught of God, and though
wiser</p>
                        <p>Then either<list>
                              <item>1 His Enemies,</item>
                              <item>2 His Teachers,</item>
                              <item>3 His Elders.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet he cryes, <hi>teach me</hi> notwithstanding, which
shews that the teachings of God are far above
Nature and Reason: for they are but like the
Sun, which when it shines, shews all beneath
it, but hides all above it. This admirable and
glorious Spouse of the Lamb, she desires to be
taught of her Lord: And she doth it not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missely,</hi>
as if she cared not whether she sped or
no; but <hi>zealously, earnesty;</hi> tell me, <hi>Oh thou
whom my soul loveth:</hi> she so presseth her suit, as
if she would not be satisfied with out grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it: <hi>tell me,</hi> she would (for all her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46362:261"/>
still <hi>know</hi> more, that so she might <hi>do</hi>
more:<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note> she would have her <hi>light shine before men,</hi>
that they may magnifie &amp; <hi>glorifie</hi> her Spouse &amp;
Husband. Hence take notice of the nature of
the <hi>fire of Love;</hi> when Jesus Christ hath <hi>once kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
it in the heart, it is never satisfied: still <hi>feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
&amp; ever <hi>hungry;</hi> still she <hi>wonders</hi> at the glory
&amp; <hi>beauty</hi> of God, and of her Spouse, and is never
satisfied with enjoying of him; she sees his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
sweetness and glory in every thing, &amp;
desires more and more <hi>to see it</hi> and <hi>taste</hi> it; still
he <hi>fils her,</hi> and still she <hi>wonders</hi> at him: <hi>Oh how
excellent is thy name in all the earth,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psal. 8. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>who hast set thy
glory above the Heavens!</hi> she never thinks she
hath enough, and that she needs no more, as it
is <hi>too great a fault</hi> in these <hi>self-wise</hi> dayes: but
like <hi>David</hi> she cries, <hi>O teach me,</hi> Oh direct me, <hi>Oh
lead me,</hi> so that I may draw nearer &amp; nearer to
thee! she answers the desire of God, <hi>Oh that
there was such a heart in this people to seek after me,</hi>

                           <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi>

for take the Commandements; first the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of the second Table: if a man <hi>love
father and mother,</hi> let him dishonour them if <hi>he
can:</hi> And so the next, <hi>Thou shalt not kill:</hi> if he
love <hi>the creatures,</hi> and his <hi>brethren,</hi> he is so far
from offering <hi>violence</hi> to any, that he will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>lay</hi> down his own life; And so the seventh,
<hi>if he love all,</hi> he will not <hi>take the members of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and make them the members of an harlot;</hi>
And <hi>love</hi> will make him in stead of <hi>stealing from
any,</hi> to give <hi>plenteously</hi> and <hi>willingly:</hi> and to be
so far from <hi>coveting</hi> and taking away, that he
will rather adde what he can; and <hi>love</hi> can <hi>bear
no false witness:</hi> nor covet any thing which is
his Neighbours. And so likewise for the first
Table, he that <hi>loves God,</hi> he knows him to be <hi>so
full</hi> and <hi>satisfying,</hi> that he never need make him
more gods; he knows that if the world were
ten thousand times larger and pleasanter then
it is, he knows that God he is <hi>so full,</hi> that he is
<hi>sufficient</hi> for all; neither <hi>can he make Images, to</hi>
worship them, nor to put him in remembrance
of him, for he hath an apprehension of him
beyond all manner of <hi>Images,</hi> the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a glasse to him, he knows no Image can
resemble him; as God said to <hi>Moses, Thou shalt

can he swear, and blaspheme, and prophane his

God had taken seven to himself, and given him

                        <p>Examine your selves by these things: Is the

                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 42. when the

observe and mind the <hi>wife</hi> of Jesus Christ, his
Church and Spouse, <hi>the dearly beloved of his soul:</hi>
being professions of <hi>dearness,</hi> and intimateness
of <hi>love</hi> to his <hi>wife,</hi> and of his <hi>wives</hi> to him, &amp; do
but set forth the <hi>unexpressible</hi> and reciprocal

The Letter is but a <hi>dead</hi> resemblance, or <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
of the <hi>life</hi> within; as of <hi>good things</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
so evil threatned. It speaks of <hi>devouring fire,</hi>
and <hi>everlasting burnings, Isa.</hi> 33. 14.<note place="margin">Isa. 30. 33 &amp; 56. 24.</note> and of the
<hi>Tophet prepared of old, and of the worm that never
dyeth,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Mar. 5. 44</note> 
                           <hi>and of weeping and gnashing of teeth;</hi> and all
these are but resemblances and shadows of the
terrors of the Almighty; the thing it self is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
beyond these expressions. As I have read
of some who of old time kept for their security
<hi>fierce</hi> dogs within the House, and were wont to
have <hi>without</hi> doors upon the wall, <hi>a painted Dog</hi>
with this Caution, <hi>Cave, Cave Canem, Beware,
Beware the Dog.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And I have read of some <hi>ignorant</hi> people that
would place <hi>burning Lamps</hi> made of <hi>combustible
matter</hi> mixt with oil in the <hi>Sepulchres</hi> of their
friends, and have likewise pourtraied fire
on the <hi>stones</hi> on the <hi>outside</hi> to shew there was
fire within. So the outward Letter is but the
<hi>picture,</hi> the resemblance of the truth <hi>within:</hi>
that is but the Literal, Historical sense: the
<hi>life,</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> is another thing: Jesus Christ is the
<hi>Spirit and Life,</hi> he is the <hi>fire:</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 35.<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 35.</note>
Christ saith of <hi>Iohn, He was a burning and a shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
light:</hi> that was, <hi>so far</hi> as Christ did shine and
give <hi>light</hi> in him and by him.</p>
                        <p>As true fire is <hi>infinitely</hi> unspeakably
beyond the <hi>shadow, resemblance,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation</hi>
both in <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>splendour,</hi> so is
the truth beyond the Letter. And as a
<hi>living</hi> Dog is more then a painted or a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46362:268"/>
                           <hi>dead</hi> Dog, for they bite not at all, but the Dog

some are so <hi>full,</hi> their Omers <hi>run over,</hi> they are

men they are <hi>wiser then Daniel.</hi> They, if they
had been but with God at the Creation, they
could have directed him to have done many
things wiser then he hath done; they would
have shewed him a better way, and in their
prayers they are still teaching God what to do;
but there are none of these things in Christs
Spouse: this is not <hi>her voice,</hi> but in all her <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi>
and at <hi>all times,</hi> yea till the world <hi>shall be
no more,</hi> she cries, <hi>Tell me, Teach me.</hi>

                        <p>Let us <hi>dread</hi> the sentence of the Church of

is nothing so pleasing to the ears of God, as this

<hi>any man living:</hi> therefore let us examine how

any thing else; if thou canst not examine it <hi>by it

shall know them.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 16.</note> How <hi>much</hi> hath thy <hi>love increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>

<hi>twice dead, and pulled up by the roots:</hi> for if thou be
<hi>rooted</hi> in him,<note place="margin">Jude 12.</note> thou canst not (if thou wouldst)
but bring forth fruit. What ever prayers come
from a <hi>soul</hi> that can <hi>truly say</hi> it loves God: <hi>from
this root,</hi> I may boldly say, <hi>it never returns</hi> in vain:
if it can say, <hi>Oh thou whom my soul loveth,</hi> thou art
my God, and I will love thee: I would not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
adultery</hi> with any creature; but my love is
taken off all, and is <hi>towards thee:</hi> then is <hi>Gods
love shed abroad in thy heart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But we will <hi>go on</hi> to the next, to <hi>the Spouses
request, Tell me:</hi> what? <hi>where thou feedest;</hi> it is
a strange speech now at this time, that Christ
should eat: yet it is a true speech, and a real
question, not imaginative, but real; not a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive,
but a substantive. It is true he did eat
when he was upon earth, you will say: but he
eats not now:</p>
                        <p>For your answer, and for your better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of this, take this short Theory:</p>
                        <p>They that conceive Christ according to the short
time of 33 years (that he lived upon earth) or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
they do limit and circumcise, <hi>as I may say,</hi>
and cut short the vastness of his greatness.</p>
                        <p>Yet it is very true he lived 33 years upon
earth: and <hi>One</hi> only <hi>merit</hi> of his, One action that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46362:269"/>
he performed at that time, was sufficient to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
for the sins of <hi>all the world</hi> abundantly, and
to perfect the work of Redemption: considering
<hi>what person</hi> he was, <hi>viz.</hi> God equal with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp; that he emptied himself of all his glory,
&amp; took upon him the <hi>form of a Servant,</hi> &amp; made
himself of no <hi>reputation:</hi> and One action <hi>from
him</hi> was sufficient: this you will not deny:</p>
                        <p>And therefore in all the Scripture you may
observe, that <hi>from the very instant of the Creation,</hi>
the second person in Trinity took upon him a
<hi>body:</hi> he had a body from the beginning, from
the <hi>first</hi> man, and shall have a body to the <hi>last
man:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psa. 79.</note> as <hi>David</hi> saith of him, a <hi>Body</hi> hast thou
prepared <hi>me;</hi> consider of this, and compare it
with the Scriptures, and see if this be not <hi>more
agreeable unto the vastness of the largness</hi> of Christ,
then to <hi>confine his body</hi> onely to the short time
of 33 years. He it is that <hi>suffers</hi> in man, in the
<hi>first man,</hi> and shall suffer <hi>in the last man;</hi> from
the time of his <hi>suffering</hi> in the first righteous
<hi>Abel,</hi> to the last, to the last righteous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 24.</note>
from the time of <hi>taking his Kingdom</hi> of
his Father, till the time that he shall <hi>render
up the Kingdom</hi> to his Father, it is he that
suffers.</p>
                        <p>I know when at any time ye hear of
Christs <hi>Body,</hi> and of his <hi>sufferings,</hi> you
presently <hi>fly</hi> to that <hi>short time</hi> that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon Earth, to those 33 <hi>years</hi> that he
was <hi>visibly</hi> seen to <hi>walk</hi> upon Earth: and
I doubt <hi>many Divines</hi> intend <hi>no less</hi> when
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46362:270"/>
they speak of <hi>his sufferings,</hi> they presently have
recourse to that time, and to <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and
<hi>Herod,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> and the <hi>Iews,</hi> and intend no more; but
Beloved, Christ is <hi>yesterday, and to day, and the
same for ever:</hi> Christ suffers now as much as he
did then, and before that, as much as he doth
now, for while any of his members suffers, he
suffers. I appeal to you, examine <hi>this truth,</hi>
whether this be not <hi>more agreeable to truth,</hi> and
to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to acknowledge this <hi>Vast</hi> Larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, then <hi>to narrow</hi> and <hi>scant</hi> his body
to that short time? for if ye say he wrought
our redemption, and satisfied Gods wrath in
those whole thirty three years, then you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
your selves; for none <hi>can deny,</hi> but <hi>any
one</hi> of his actions <hi>alon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>
                           </hi> considered, was <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
sufficient:</hi> and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith,
<hi>That he did fill up in his body the measure of the
sufferings of Christ:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 10.</note> and certainly he that thus
suffered in him, doth still, and shall do so to the
<hi>end</hi> of the world.</p>
                        <p>And so I say, concerning <hi>this request</hi> of the
Spouse to Christ, it is a <hi>strange</hi> question, if ye
consider it <hi>according to</hi> the three &amp; thirty years
he was on earth, in the dayes of <hi>Herod,</hi> for to
ask him where he fed? and where he rested?
we know <hi>in that regard,</hi> where he fed, and
where he rested at that time; but she asks where
he feeds <hi>now,</hi> and where he rests now, to the
very very <hi>last day,</hi> and from the <hi>first day;</hi> this is
the Spouse <hi>her question,</hi> where he feeds, and
where he feeds at noon? But by the way God
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46362:270"/>
forbid, <hi>that we</hi> should go about <hi>to deny</hi> Christs
coming in the flesh; for he did come in the
flesh; and whatever the Scripture saith <hi>he did in
the flesh,</hi> is really <hi>undeniably</hi> true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>let his tongue</hi>
cleave to the <hi>roof</hi> of his mouth that shall deny
it: But yet <hi>give me leave</hi> to tell you, that is but
<hi>the History,</hi> there is <hi>a mystery</hi> in all the <hi>words,</hi>
there is a <hi>symbolical</hi> truth <hi>hid</hi> in them, that is

☞For Answer hereunto, we must consider Christ
<hi>as a Body,</hi> not as any one <hi>particular</hi> member:
for a member cannot suffer without the body:
for if a member be cut off from the body, all
actions cease in that member; and where there
is no life or action, there can be <hi>no suffering:</hi>
separate the action (which is the <hi>effect</hi> of life)
from the body, or the life which is the cause of
action, &amp; the body is not capable of suffering:
So in Christ, consider <hi>the body compleat,</hi> and so
Christ suffers <hi>still,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Col. 1. 15. &amp;c.</note> and hath need <hi>of Rest:</hi> As he
is in every creature, so he is called <hi>The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of all the works of God:</hi> and he indeed is <hi>All
Things,</hi> and so he is at rest, and cannot suffer.</p>
                        <p>Here is a great mystery, Beloved, that Christ
should be <hi>in the Creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and yet <hi>be at Rest;</hi> that
he should be in the <hi>Variation</hi> and <hi>Alteration</hi> of
things in the world, and yet <hi>He not vary;</hi> that
He should be <hi>the substance</hi> of things changed,
and yet He not changed. I will shew you it in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46362:272"/>
an example. The <hi>light</hi> and <hi>heat</hi> of the Sun
comes through the ayre: now you know, the
<hi>wind</hi> and the <hi>ayre</hi> is subject to change, <hi>nothing
more:</hi> it is changed and turned every way; and
yet the sun, though it do come through the
ayre, <hi>is the same,</hi> it is not <hi>moved,</hi> nor <hi>changed:</hi>
though they suffer <hi>an alteration,</hi> yet <hi>it suffers
none.</hi> Wonder not then (if such a thing may
come to be <hi>in a Creature,</hi> as the Sun is) that he
that is the Lord of all Creatures, should be <hi>so,</hi>
and infinitely more: No marvel <hi>though he</hi> can
turn them <hi>upside</hi> down as he pleases,<note place="margin">Psal. 102. 27.</note> and <hi>vary</hi>
and <hi>alter</hi> them as the wind; <hi>They all shall wax old
as doth a garment; they shall perish, but thou shalt
endure; as a vesture thou shalt change them, and they
shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy
years never end;</hi> that is, they shall all <hi>purifie</hi> and
<hi>corrupt,</hi> but thou art the same, thou changest
not: Dear freinds now we have answered you
where He rests. <hi>Iesus Christ blessed for ever,</hi> he

till we see and behold him being united to
Him. And if once we <hi>see</hi> him, we cannot but
love him; and this love brings thee into union
with God: Now love is the <hi>knot</hi> that must <hi>unite</hi>

and this knot being once <hi>knit,</hi> it is <hi>knit for ever:</hi>
for we being <hi>knit</hi> and <hi>made</hi> one with him, we
<hi>can never</hi> be lost; but <hi>so long</hi> as God <hi>lives,</hi> so long
shall you:<note place="margin">Mar. 10. 9.</note> Here are Christs words <hi>verified, That

but if to the <hi>creature</hi> you <hi>joyn your selves,</hi>
God never made that <hi>conjunction,</hi> God never

thou hast full <hi>right</hi> and <hi>title</hi> to him, and to all his

the <hi>joynture</hi> of eternal happiness was not made

a Branch in the root.</p>
                        <p>Beloved, it is <hi>to the Church</hi> that Christ
makes <hi>all his promises;</hi> still to the Church;
still to his Spouse; and it is not to any
visible Church neither, or an Assembly
of men and women, as particular and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from his body; but to the <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible</hi>
Congregation of Saints, which are <hi>his

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46362:277"/>
the promises made, and upon no other account
can any one promise be claimed; Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
let not <hi>the Church</hi> be an odious name to
you, as it is <hi>too too much:</hi> nor let not <hi>every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

                        </p>
                        <p>Now, if a man be knit to Jesus Christ by this
knot of love, I will tell you what will follow:
Love, <hi>you know,</hi> suffers not a man <hi>to be his own,</hi>
but he hath <hi>given up himself</hi> to the thing <hi>loved,</hi>
and that <hi>rules him,</hi> and <hi>it he obeys:</hi> So this soul
once knit to Christ by this knot of love, then he
cannot commit adultery with any creature; he
is no longer his own: and therefore whenever
ye find in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and there read of the <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous
love</hi> of that whore that waits <hi>in the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>

                              </gap>,</hi> or the
like: the intention of the holy Ghost is to set
forth unto us <hi>the adulterous love of the soul,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Prov. 6. 26.</note> and
<hi>how our love</hi> is carried away from Christ:<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 7, &amp;c.</note> The

                        <p>And <hi>this love</hi> is diversly called in Scripture;
sometimes it is called <hi>hope,</hi> and sometimes <hi>fear,</hi>
somtimes <hi>trust</hi> &amp;c. according to the several <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
it is exercised upon; As <hi>the Attributes of God</hi>

                           <hi>Mercy,</hi> sometimes <hi>Anger,</hi> sometimes
<hi>love;</hi> not that there are <hi>so many</hi> several things
in God: but <hi>all</hi> these are <hi>one act</hi> in God: As
the Sun, it causes one <hi>colour</hi> in the <hi>Rose,</hi> another
in the <hi>Nettle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and it causes the <hi>Carrion</hi> to <hi>stink,</hi>
and the <hi>Rose</hi> to smell <hi>sweet;</hi> yet one and the same
thing in the <hi>Sun</hi> doth all, but it <hi>works to
the several objects</hi> it meets with: so it is One and
the same act in Religion, which is that, which
<hi>joyns &amp; unites us</hi> to our Creator, yet <hi>distinguished</hi>
by <hi>divers</hi> names, as <hi>Hope, Faith, Fear, Love, Trust,</hi>
yet all one thing in the soul: As, when it looks
upon the promises of God, then it is called <hi>Faith:</hi>
when it apprehends him to be a just revenging
God, and that <hi>it apprehends</hi> that he is angry, then
it is called <hi>Fear:</hi> and when it beholds the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
and loving face of God in Jesus Christ,
then it is called <hi>Love:</hi> again, when it Beholds
the promises, and apprehends God to be <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
then it is called <hi>Hope</hi> &amp;c. and therefore ye
are not to apprehend these things, as several in
God, or in your selves, but as <hi>One.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet I pray, do not mistake me, that because
I say <hi>Love is the cord that unites us</hi> to God, do not
think that I exclude <hi>Hope</hi> or <hi>Fear,</hi> or <hi>Trust,</hi> or
<hi>Faith,</hi> or any other grace: do not think that I
undervalue the rest; far be it from me; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this I say, <hi>Love</hi> doth knit the band <hi>more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,</hi>
and more feelingly <hi>to us:</hi> And <hi>in all</hi> this we
must not ascribe any good, any power to our
selves: whoever he be, he must acknowledge
himself <hi>an unprofitable servant:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luk. 9. 13.</note> and that <hi>the

                        <p>But if thou hast <hi>set thy seal</hi> to the creatures,
and that they have stolen away thy heart, and
thou art in love with them, and knit to them,
made one with them, then when thou comest

                     <p>IN a little corner of <hi>Asia</hi> were these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote: The words I have
<hi>now read,</hi> are as <hi>David</hi> sayes of the blessed man,

such are these <hi>words,</hi> and all the words of God:
they have not onely a <hi>dead Letter,</hi> but they have
a <hi>living sense:</hi> this Tree bears fruit in all Ages,
in all times, As our Saviour Christ sayes, <hi>what
I say to you, I say to all men:</hi> the words of God
are so spoken and meant, that they are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true of that man, that time, in that place, in
that age, in which they were spoken; but they
are true and concern <hi>as much</hi> all men, all ages,

                     <p>But if ye shall say to me as the Apostle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christ from the Grave,</hi> or to fetch him <hi>down</hi>
from Heaven? <hi>behold he is nigh thee, even in thy
heart, &amp;c.</hi> Behold, I am he, whom God hath

God now <hi>read</hi> to you, to open to you these
<hi>sweet</hi> promises of mercy and grace: but it <hi>will be
so</hi> onely to those whose eyes are open to see
them so: the promise here made, is large: <hi>I
will give him to eat Hidden Manna:</hi> but it is

of the hidden Manna?</hi> then ye must be <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers:</hi>
he that overcometh shall <hi>eat.</hi> But
give me leave a little to <hi>wave</hi> the condition:
the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> saith,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>That there are three, that

bare record on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the
Blood; and these three agree in one.</hi> So say I,
here is both a <hi>condition</hi> and a <hi>promise,</hi> and they
both <hi>agree</hi> in one: A man cannot <hi>eat</hi> except he
<hi>Overcome:</hi> neither can he <hi>Overcome</hi> except he
Eats: therefore let no man think he can <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi>
except he <hi>eat</hi> this <hi>hidden Manna:</hi> and he
that eateth doth <hi>Overcome:</hi> as Christ tells the
Disciples,<note place="margin">Joh. 15. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>without me ye can do nothing:</hi> so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ye eat this <hi>hidden Manna</hi> ye can <hi>do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
ye can never overcome, for in eating
this <hi>hidden Manna</hi> we get strength to <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come:</hi>
and as we eat, we overcome; and as
we overcome, we eat: <hi>this</hi> was your vow made
in Baptisme, to <hi>renounce the Devil and all his
works, and to fight manfully under Christs Banner
against sin, the World the Flesh, and the Devil:</hi>
thou hast there <hi>given up thy name to Christ,</hi> and
hast <hi>bid defiance</hi> to Satan, as much as in thee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
and hast said, <hi>I renounce</hi> thee Satan: and
<hi>I will be one</hi> of thy Souldiers, O Lord Christ.</p>
                     <p>There is no man that hath prepared his
heart to seek God, but he shall be <hi>sure to find</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
<hi>enough,</hi> he shall have <hi>temptations</hi> to
wrastle with, and to overcome. <hi>David</hi> sayes
that he found his <hi>enemies</hi> innumerable,<note place="margin">Ps. 118. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Psal.
118. they compassed him on every side, and came
about him all like Bees:</hi> and the Lord himself
tells us, <hi>that all the imaginations of mans heart are

thou hast no enemies? Then let no man say, if
I found any enemies, I would fight with them:

for I may say to thee,<note place="margin">Judges 16. 12.</note> as <hi>Delilah</hi> to <hi>Sampson,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise,
<hi>the Philistines be upon thee,</hi> there be <hi>enemies</hi>

                     <p>But that you may understand <hi>this Text,</hi> I will
lay down three things which will be <hi>necessary</hi>
to unfold it.</p>
                     <p>The first is this: All these seven promises
made here to the seven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi>
though they be diversly exprest, yet it is all one
thing: suppose they be promises <hi>of eating</hi> of
the tree of <hi>life in the midst of the Paradise of
God:</hi> or promises that we <hi>shall not be hurt of the
second death,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 2. &amp; 3.</note> or that we shal have the <hi>crown of life,</hi>
or of the <hi>white stone with the new name in it,</hi> or of
<hi>ruling the Nations with a rod of iron,</hi> or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<hi>the bright morning Star:</hi> All these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
they are <hi>one and the same</hi> thing: and they
are pronounced by one and the same Spirit; and
let <hi>him that hath an ear,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cha. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 29.</note> 
                        <hi>hear what the Spirit saith
unto the Churches:</hi> wheresoever Christ shall be,
there shall his members be also: and every
member shall have a full and plentiful part,
there shall be <hi>nothing</hi> wanting to them, they
shall all have a <hi>satisfying</hi> part, they shall be all
as branches that are nourished with one and
the same root: the same <hi>sap</hi> goes thorow the
whole body that is in the root: And, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
priviledge or benefit Christ hath, they shall
all receive of his fulness,<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>grace for grace,</hi> they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46362:281"/>
shall all be made <hi>partakers of all</hi> the vertues of
the <hi>head:</hi> but notwithstanding all these promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
we are never the better without we have
Christ, they are all <hi>blanks</hi> without him, all
<hi>unsavoury:</hi> it is he that seasons all: Yea, trust
as long as thou canst, and <hi>believe</hi> as much as thou
wilt, without Christ thou canst never come
unto him: God himself is nothing <hi>to us</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Christ: As every <hi>Iubar and Beam of
light</hi> that comes from the Sun, they are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the body of the Sun, but they are
not <hi>communicated</hi> to us but by those Jubars and
beams that come from the Sun: so God is like
the Sun, and whatever good, benefit or bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
we have, it comes from God: but all
<hi>these</hi> are <hi>included</hi> in God himself: and there is
no creature can partake of any good from him,
but by his Son Christ, in those <hi>Iubars</hi> of light,
that communicates them to us: This light
had never come to us, but for those <hi>beams:</hi> so
God the Father cannot communicate himself
to any creature but by the Son, he is <hi>the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of every Creature:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. 1. 15.</note> he came being <hi>sent</hi>
from the father: yet God the Father is not a
day,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> not a minute Ancienter then his Son:
Christ he is called <hi>The word spoken,</hi> in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes;
As he is <hi>unspoken,</hi> so he is <hi>the word with
God</hi> in the bosome of his Father, and <hi>this word
is God, as Iohn</hi> 1. 1.<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 1.</note> but being once spoken and
<hi>utered,</hi> he is the <hi>first begotten of God in every
creature.</hi> The <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> in every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
from whom alone we receive <hi>grace for
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46362:281"/>
grace;</hi> all the goodness and fulness of God is
<hi>poured</hi> upon the head of this <hi>Aaron,</hi> which runs
down not only to <hi>his beard,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psa. 133. 4</note> but to <hi>all the skirts of
his garments,</hi> to all his members; God himself
<hi>in himself</hi> to the creature is nothing without
Christ: He cannot possibly be communicated
but <hi>by</hi> and <hi>through</hi> Christ.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, All these promises to the seven
Churches they imply that which hath its <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
in this life, and <hi>perfected</hi> in the life to
come; saith our Saviour, <hi>the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is within you;</hi> if ye find not the Kingdom of
God and the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> within you,<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 21</note>
and in this world, be assured ye shall <hi>never find</hi>
it in the world to come; <hi>He that denyes me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men, him will I deny before my father which is
in Heaven:</hi> he that enjoys me not in <hi>this
world,</hi> he shall never enjoy me <hi>hereafter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The poor dejected and oppressed soul, it
longs to taste Christ here: nothing will satisfie
him but to <hi>taste and eat</hi> Christ here: for if he
<hi>eat him not</hi> here, he knows he shall not <hi>hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
as David</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Psa. 42. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>My soul thirsteth for God,
even for the living God: when shall I come before
God?</hi> What to do? Psal. 27. 4.<note place="margin">Psa. 27. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>To see his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to taste of his goodness:</hi> if you see not
God <hi>here,</hi> ye shall never see Him <hi>hereafter.</hi>
Christ will ask thee as he did the Discsples, <hi>how
many loaves have ye?</hi> when ye come <hi>to dye,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 34.</note>
what Angels food have ye to feed on? what
Hidden <hi>Manna? How many loaves</hi> of that? if
ye must say, <hi>none</hi> Lord, what a heavy answer will
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46362:282"/>
this be to you? but if thou hast <hi>any,</hi> if but two
loaves, if but a little oil in thy Lamp, he will
then <hi>multiply</hi> thy loaves and that <hi>little oyl: the
barrel of meal,</hi> and <hi>that cruse of oyl</hi> shall never
fail:<note place="margin">2 King. 4.</note> And he will say, <hi>come thou good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
servant,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 21</note> thou hast been faithful in a little, I
will now multiply thy reward: Come now, I will
feed thee to <hi>eternity:</hi> If Christ shall say to thee,
How much peace have you? if thou canst but
say, here is <hi>a little</hi> Lord: Christ will say come,
come, I will <hi>multiply</hi> and <hi>increase that peace</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely:
what <hi>love</hi> hast thou? if thou hast but
<hi>any,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 19.</note> though but as much as a <hi>grain of mustard
seed,</hi> come, saith our Lord, I will cause it to
grow and <hi>increase,</hi> and become a <hi>mighty tree,</hi>
so that the <hi>fowls of the air shall build their nests
therein.</hi> That is, I will <hi>enlarge</hi> it as <hi>my self</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely:
And which way soever else a man
seeks for <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> he shall <hi>never</hi> find it:
for, as all the Creatures, so all the action and
motion of the Creatures come out from him,
and <hi>they can never rest</hi> till they return into him
again: and therefore he is called <hi>the God of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
which signifies <hi>Rest:</hi> in him there is <hi>Rest,</hi>
and <hi>no where else.</hi> The soul is the <hi>breath</hi> of
God, and it is impossible that it should have a
<hi>rest for the sole of her foot</hi> till it return, and <hi>this
blessed Noah</hi> put forth his hand and <hi>take her</hi> in
again.<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Lay up treasure for your selves in heaven:</hi>
would you have treasure hereafter? ye must
<hi>treasure it up</hi> while ye are on earth, that ye may
have the <hi>reward</hi> and the <hi>wages</hi> hereafter: ye must
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46362:282"/>
                        <hi>receive</hi> here the <hi>pledge,</hi> the <hi>Hire:</hi> The Portion
and the reward comes hereafter. <hi>Your fathers</hi>
(saith our Saviour) <hi>have eaten Manna and are
dead:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 49.</note> but <hi>blessed is he that eats Manna in the
Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> he that feels Gods love <hi>shed
abroad</hi>
in his heart here, shall find that <hi>love</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
<hi>thirty, sixty, an hundred-fold in the life to
come:</hi> here ye <hi>feed</hi> but are not <hi>filled,</hi> but then
you shall be <hi>satisfied.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, All these <hi>seven promises</hi> that are
here made to the seven Churches, there is not
one <hi>word</hi> to be taken according to the Letter:
but think not strange of such sayings: be not
<hi>startled,</hi> I would onely quicken up your <hi>attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
I undervalue not the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but desire
to give them <hi>all due honour:</hi> for do you think
that you shall be Pillars in Heaven, or that you
shall <hi>eat trees,</hi> or the <hi>fruit</hi> of trees there? or
that ye shall have <hi>rods of iron</hi> in your hand, or
that ye shall be <hi>burning stars?</hi> or as it is in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 3</note>
                        <hi>He that converteth a soul shall shine like the
Stars?</hi> I say there is <hi>not one word true according
to the Letter:</hi> yet I say, in all the words that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Christ <hi>spake,</hi> or that is written in this <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
blessed</hi> Book of God, they are <hi>all</hi> true;
there is not the least <hi>tincture,</hi> not the <hi>least allay
of untruth:</hi> I say, every <hi>word,</hi> every <hi>syllable,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<hi>letter</hi> is true: <hi>bear me witness,</hi> you are <hi>my
record:</hi> but they are <hi>true</hi> as he intended them
<hi>that spake them:</hi> they are <hi>true</hi> as God <hi>meant</hi>
them, not <hi>as men will have them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As when Christ says,<note place="margin">Joh. 15. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>my Father is an husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:46362:283"/>
do you think, or are you so <hi>childish</hi> to think
that God <hi>is a husbandman?</hi> and Christ sayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>I am the vine, and ye the branches:</hi> will you
have <hi>this to be</hi> literally spoken? Go to, I will
speak a <hi>paradox</hi> to you, but I willl <hi>unfold it.</hi> It
is impossible for any man either to speak <hi>a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
truth, or to hear a precise truth;</hi> for a precise
truth, or to speak <hi>precisely,</hi> is to speak <hi>at once</hi>
the truth, that is, the <hi>whole truth,</hi> and nothing
but the <hi>truth:</hi> as for example, if I tell you this
is a <hi>Church,</hi> this is not a <hi>precise truth:</hi> for in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>it is a Church,</hi> I neither tell you whether it
be built of <hi>wood,</hi> or <hi>stone,</hi> or <hi>brick:</hi> I neither
tell you it is <hi>little</hi> or <hi>great:</hi> I neither tell you
whether it <hi>be high</hi> or <hi>low, &amp;c.</hi> which I not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
do not tell you <hi>the whole truth:</hi> Or, if I
tell you I saw a man, I tell not his age nor <hi>sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
nor <hi>complexion,</hi> nor <hi>kindred,</hi> nor <hi>riches, nor
bigness, &amp;c.</hi> which is not the <hi>whole truth.</hi> I
shall unfold this to you, these similies <hi>I use</hi> for
your good: God onely is <hi>able</hi> to speak <hi>such</hi> a
truth, A Precise Truth <hi>at once,</hi> in one word, as
shall include all this: God could have spoken
<hi>such a word</hi> as should have included the <hi>whole
truth</hi> in one word: but where should he have
found <hi>Auditors</hi> that were able to have heard
him? where had been our <hi>ears to have heard
such a word?</hi> or our understandings to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it?
you know a great noise <hi>deafs</hi> us,
and abundance of light <hi>blinds</hi> us: if there be
<hi>too much</hi> light, it may as well <hi>blind</hi> a man as
<hi>too little:</hi>
now you know <hi>truth</hi> is the <hi>object</hi> of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46362:283"/>
understanding, as <hi>light</hi> is of <hi>sight:</hi> so if there be
an <hi>excessive truth</hi> spoken to us, it destroyes, it
<hi>splits the understanding:</hi> as the people of <hi>Israel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exo. 3. 9.</note>
they were <hi>not able</hi> to hear God speak, but they
must <hi>dye</hi> for it: and <hi>Moses</hi> himself complains
that he was <hi>afraid</hi> and <hi>trembled:</hi> we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to hear God <hi>speak:</hi> if he should speak to us
(as he would, if we could hear) he should speak
us all to pieces, he should <hi>speak</hi> us to nothing;
Oh <hi>let not God speak to us lest we dye!</hi> We should
cry out,<note place="margin">Exo. 20. 19.</note> Oh do not speak to us as thou art <hi>in thy
self,</hi> for we are men: but <hi>let Moses speak to us,</hi> and
we will <hi>hear him:</hi> O Lord speak to us <hi>as men,</hi> as
we are able to <hi>hear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beloved, the not knowing of <hi>this truth,</hi> and
our <hi>receiving</hi> the word, and understanding it <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Letter,</hi> hath the been the ground
of <hi>all the Errours,</hi> of all the <hi>schisms,</hi> of all the
<hi>rents</hi> in this poor <hi>Church</hi> of ours. But to go
further, and to give you a little <hi>further light,</hi> I
know the Scripture in the <hi>Letter</hi> speaks of <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
reprobation,</hi> and <hi>predestination:</hi> But if we
take it <hi>according to men,</hi> we are much deceived.
As for example, when I say <hi>this man</hi> is like <hi>such
another man,</hi> And though he may be so <hi>in some
things,</hi> yet not <hi>in all:</hi> and <hi>far be it from us</hi> to
think, because God speaks according to the
<hi>manner</hi> of men, that therefore we conclude <hi>his
wayes are like our wayes,</hi> or <hi>his thoughts like our
thoughts:</hi> but whatever God sayes of himself,
those are sentences and expressions spoken but
by way of similitude to make us <hi>understand,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 55. 8, &amp;c.</note> and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46362:284"/>
not that we should think that the <hi>almighty, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi>
God to be like <hi>weak,</hi> man: so when he
speaks of <hi>any</hi> of these things, of <hi>election,</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,</hi> or his <hi>foreknowledge,</hi> there is indeed
such a <hi>kind of thing</hi> in God 'tis true: but it is
<hi>true</hi> as God intends it, and not otherwise.</p>
                     <p>It is said also that God made <hi>a Covenant,</hi> and
the Scripture speaks of Gods <hi>knowledge:</hi> but do
you think that Gods <hi>Covenants</hi> are like the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of men,</hi>
or his knowledge like means?
God forbid: and wo be unto that man that
takes it contrary to Gods intent and <hi>meaning:</hi>
so also we read of Gods <hi>hatred</hi> and of Gods
<hi>love:</hi> but his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>hatred</hi> is not like mens
<hi>love</hi> and <hi>hatred: Are my wayes like your wayes, or
my thoughts like your thoughts?</hi> As if he should
say, will you wrest my <hi>word,</hi> and take it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your own ways? will you take me
according to my <hi>literal</hi> words? away, away,
<hi>As high as the Heaven is above the Earth, so high
are my thoughts above your thoughts:</hi> And when
God sayes <hi>he repented,</hi> doest thou think that he
repents as man repents? <hi>He does repent,</hi> it is
true: but according to his own <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
not according to thine. Alas, alas, we
<hi>poor, ignorant, low, narrow-spirited</hi> creatures, as
we are not able to <hi>comprehend</hi> God, so neither
can we Gods <hi>word:</hi> we can see but a <hi>glympse</hi>
and a little <hi>glimmering</hi> of the Truths of God:
As <hi>Elias,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 King. 19. 12.</note> he could not apprehend God, nor <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
him</hi> neither in the <hi>thunder</hi> nor in the
<hi>lightning,</hi> nor in the <hi>mighty rushing,</hi> nor in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46362:284"/>
                        <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>re,</hi> though God was in them all; but when
God came in a <hi>still, soft</hi> voice, then he could
<hi>apprehend</hi> God, <hi>heard</hi> him and <hi>saw</hi> him; and
then he came to <hi>see</hi> that God was also as <hi>much</hi>
in all the rest, though he saw him not: but he
being (as also we) of a <hi>low, soft,</hi> and <hi>tender</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and <hi>so much children</hi> that he could not <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure</hi>
to <hi>hear</hi> the <hi>mighty</hi> God, but in a <hi>still, soft</hi> and
<hi>tender</hi> voice; the <hi>thunder</hi> and the <hi>fire</hi> and the
<hi>mighty rushing</hi> is too terrible, too destructive to
our weak natures. For in God there all things
<hi>coincide,</hi> even <hi>contradictories</hi> coincide in him, as
<hi>the Vision of God shews</hi> at large in some Chapters.</p>
                     <p>So when God promiseth here, <hi>To him that
overcometh, will I give him to eat of the hidden
Manna,</hi> we must not take Gods meaning accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Letter,</hi> nor think it was, or is that
<hi>Manna</hi> that God rained from Heaven, <hi>Num.</hi> 10.
But by that expression he would win us to <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
the <hi>heavenlyness,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Num. 10.</note> and <hi>excellency,</hi> and the <hi>rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and the <hi>welcomness</hi> of that Manna that <hi>feeds</hi>
the soul, and what <hi>spiritual</hi> food is. How wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

                     <p>O lack! I am but <hi>newly</hi> entred into my Text,

But this <hi>sin</hi> how evil soever, and
however <hi>threatned</hi> here and elsewhere in the
Scriptures, is hardly esteemed <hi>any sin</hi> at all;
ye cannot perswade men of <hi>the Evilness</hi>
thereof; but you are ready to <hi>think</hi> and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46362:286"/>
                        <hi>charge</hi> us, that we <hi>Church-men</hi> are strange

fight against them: for our parts we find
very few covetous; some indeed are <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Drunkards, Adulterers, Lyars, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaners</hi>
of the Sabbath; these they can <hi>see</hi>
and <hi>acknowledge</hi> to be sins, and would have
us preach against them; but to keep such a
stir about Covetousness, they think is a <hi>vain</hi>
thing, and <hi>time lost;</hi> for either they are but <hi>few</hi>
that are so, or else tis not <hi>so great</hi> a sin as you
make for; or else you call <hi>that</hi> Covetousness,
which is not.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, I confess, other sins <hi>wear</hi> the Devils
<hi>Cognizance</hi> and <hi>Livery</hi> openly, but this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

                     <p>For <hi>this sin</hi> is generally <hi>in credit</hi> in the world,

so it should seem, they esteem it <hi>the main

shew: In brief, it excludes all love and fear of

of our neighbours good, and so breaks the
whole Law: it will make him <hi>Oppress, Cozen,

In short, it will make a man <hi>turn his back</hi>

<hi>Salvation;</hi> as is there <hi>exprest,</hi> and in the

                        <hi>The love of money is the root of
all evil, which while some have coveted after, have
erred from the faith, and pierced themselves
through with many sorrows:</hi> It is such a <hi>sin,</hi> that
if ever God <hi>touch</hi> the heart <hi>about it,</hi> it will <hi>pierce
through with many sorrows,</hi> before ever <hi>they can
forsake it:</hi> for saith he, <hi>They that will be rich fall
into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish
and hurtful lusts, which drown men in perdition and
destruction:</hi> It is such <hi>a subtil</hi> snate, so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
<hi>contrived,</hi> and so full of fair <hi>pretences,</hi> that
let a man be <hi>once in love</hi> with money, he knows

Covetousness to be <hi>an inordinate desire of

But I conceive this is <hi>somewhat too favourably</hi>

It is Covetousness to desire more then is

of Covetousness: which consists in two
things:</p>
                     <p>1. To be covetous, is to let our desires run
out to seek eagerly after, beyond what is <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi>
to the preservation of nature, in its own
kinde, and not to stand <hi>indifferently</hi> affected in
the use of lawful means, whether God will

                     <p>2. An <hi>inordinate love</hi> of that a man <hi>hath,</hi>

                     <p>In Sum, I conceive Covetousness, <hi>is an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
desire and endeavor after these outward things,
without the bounds of sufficieny,</hi> in the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of nature in its own kinde, as I said.</p>

<hi>to himself,</hi> that he may confess himself guilty;
as,</p>
                     <p>1. In his course of <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>walking,</hi> and <hi>act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
their time,</hi> their <hi>lives</hi> and their <hi>actings</hi> are
<hi>wholly</hi> taken up in <hi>buying</hi> and <hi>selling,</hi> in <hi>traffick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>trading</hi> and <hi>reaching</hi> which way to <hi>grow
rich,</hi> and <hi>get more;</hi> all their thoughts and words,
and all their <hi>mights</hi> and <hi>endeavors</hi> run in <hi>this
channel:</hi> Here they are in their own ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as a <hi>fish</hi> in the water: here their hearts <hi>run
out</hi> freely, and never regard their <hi>immortal
souls:</hi> just like them of the old world, <hi>Luke</hi>
17. 26, 27.<note place="margin">Luke 17, 26, 27.</note> 
                        <hi>They eat, they drank, they
married, they were given in marriage:</hi>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:46362:289"/>
and this was all they <hi>minded,</hi> they never thought
of their end, <hi>till the flood came and destroyed them
all:</hi> So do they; O how eager, and how full of
<hi>contrivances</hi> to adde <hi>house</hi> to <hi>house,</hi> and <hi>bag</hi> to
<hi>bag,</hi> and <hi>land</hi> to <hi>land,</hi> and never think <hi>how
soon</hi> death may <hi>seize,</hi> and <hi>snatch</hi> them away.
And then <hi>what fruit have ye</hi> of all those things
<hi>you so pursued?</hi> you have onely <hi>heaped</hi> together
<hi>sorrows,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 21.</note> and <hi>snares,</hi> and <hi>darts</hi> to pierce <hi>through

                     <p>And it may be, for all this toil, you could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>attain</hi> what you sought: but adventured <hi>to
lay out</hi> your precious and immortal souls to
pursue after that which is (when attained) <hi>but
vanity;</hi>

                        <hi>And much lighter then vanity,</hi> if not <hi>sure</hi>
to attain it.</p>
                     <p>The second Symptome whereby you may
<hi>know</hi> this <hi>man,</hi> and so know <hi>your selves,</hi> is <hi>his
company;</hi> they still <hi>associate</hi> with such company
as is <hi>like</hi> themselves: and they are <hi>the onely men</hi>
for wisdom <hi>with them,</hi> and all others they make
them either <hi>their Prey, by circumventing and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-reaching
them,</hi> or else, they make others
<hi>their laughing-stocks:</hi> he is their fool to make
them merry, who neglects <hi>such a Price in their

unseen, and in their opinion but <hi>air, emptiness,</hi>
and <hi>vain things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third Symptome is <hi>his breath;</hi> he smells
<hi>of that he</hi> is made of: he is like <hi>a dying man,</hi> his
breath is <hi>strong,</hi> and <hi>savours</hi> earthly, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 31.<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 31.</note>

with <hi>this sin</hi> of Covetousness? surely it shews,
that Christ and this sin, <hi>in the love of it,</hi> cannot
<hi>cohabit</hi> together: if Christ be there, this sin <hi>must
abandon;</hi> if this be retained, Christ is <hi>there a</hi>
stranger: And the reason is, <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi>
may <hi>better</hi> stand with a sin <hi>once acted,</hi> or oftner,
so it be not <hi>habitual,</hi> although it be <hi>gross</hi> and

with <hi>an habitual Covetousness;</hi> for where that
<hi>sin</hi> is, it can scarce be <hi>other then customary</hi> and
<hi>habitual:</hi> Therefore <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam. 12. 3. did
so abominate this sin,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 3, &amp;c.</note> that he challenged all
<hi>Israel to charge him with it,</hi> though he was their

                     <p>There was <hi>a pattern</hi> for Kings and Rulers, and

Some sins are peculiar to the place of Kings,
They having gotten so much power in their
hands, they would be <hi>Monarhs</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol,
whose assertion is, <hi>That they owe account
of their actions to none but God alone;</hi> and they
want not for <hi>flatterers</hi> and <hi>Sycophants</hi> to preach
such Doctrine in their ears, <hi>That no power on
earth ought to call them to Account,</hi> for that they
are <hi>above the law:</hi> and then Covetousness will
make them, Make their <hi>lusts</hi> their <hi>Law,</hi> and
they <hi>will have</hi> what they <hi>will have,</hi> right or
wrong; but in this Nation they have been still
curbed and kept off from <hi>this Absolute power,</hi> by
one means or other. You know what <hi>Iezebel</hi>
said to <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 Kings 21. 7.<note place="margin">1 King. 21. 7.</note> when he would
fain have taken from <hi>Naboth</hi> his vineyard, but
the Law manacled and restrained him: what,
saith <hi>Iezebel, Dost thou now govern the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Israel, and art so cast down for this thing,
and wilt fast and eat no bread? up and eat, and be
of good chear, I will give thee the vineyard of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both:</hi>
And when the Law would not give it
him, she devised <hi>a wicked device,</hi> causing two
sons of Belial, <hi>Knights of the Post,</hi> to swear blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
against him, and so confiscate not onely
his vineyard, but his whole estate. Covetousness
will cause <hi>even Kings</hi> to do this, and what not,
if they have but Power enough?</p>
                        <p>2. Some sins are more peculiar to Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as Ambition, Pride, desire of Honours
and Preferments, boasting of their great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent;
yet there is none of all these but is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46362:300"/>
spiced and mixed, if not grounded and bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on this general sin of Covetousness, for to
uphold themselves in their state: <hi>Thy Princes

                           <head>REMEDIES.</head>
                           <p>THE first means I would commend to you,
whereby this rooted and prevailing <hi>sin</hi> may be
<hi>overcome,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 4</note> is by <hi>Faith;</hi> as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi>
                              <pb n="164" facs="tcp:46362:310"/>
5. 4. <hi>This is the victory that overcometh the world,
even our faith:</hi> To learn, <hi>To cease</hi> from living by
sense, and to live upon God. Our Saviour useth
many arguments to this end, to destroy this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness</hi>
and carking care, and sends us in the
6.<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 26.</note> of <hi>Matthew,</hi> the latter end, to the <hi>fowls of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
to learn of them; they <hi>neither reap, nor carry
into barns, yet your heavenly father feedeth them:</hi>
and to learn how <hi>the Lillies of the field grow,
which neither Labor nor spin,</hi> yet <hi>Solomon in all his
glory was not arrayed like one of these.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, If the Lord would teach thee <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
in the use of them,</hi> to use them with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and with weaned affections, <hi>to use them as
if thou usedst them not; and they that buy, as though
they possessed not,</hi> &amp;c. Using them onely for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment
and necessity sake; <hi>to use this world,
as not abusing it, because the fashion of this world
passeth away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 30.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 30.</note> and therefore to live
here <hi>without carefulness:</hi> This would be a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
means to bring you <hi>out of love</hi> with this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
hateful</hi> Monster, <hi>Covetousness.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>Temperance</hi> in the desire of them;
be not too much affected with them, rejoyce
not overmuch in them, do not overvalue them;
but labor to see how vain and empty these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things are, and that there is <hi>nothing in
them</hi> to satisfie or feed thy soul, which must be
fed with <hi>Heavenly Manna,</hi> and not with World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
trash.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, Another means is, <hi>Freedom from
that false conceit that men generally have of them,</hi>
                              <pb n="165" facs="tcp:46362:310"/>
viz. That they are <hi>full of content</hi> and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for none ever found them so: The best
<hi>Happiness</hi> that is in them, is not, in having
much of them, but in doing much good with
them; and this will bring the owners there of
<hi>the greatest comfort;</hi> though men in these days
cannot <hi>as yet</hi> be brought to think so; but the
time is coming when they shall be esteemed as
they are, <hi>Empty and vain things:</hi> God will bring
men to be more like himself; who being <hi>rich,</hi>
delights infinitely to communicate of his <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
and <hi>Goodness</hi> to his creatures, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to those united and made one with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, With <hi>Moses</hi> before thou goest <hi>out
of this world,</hi> go climb up to Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> and
take a view of the promised Land; learn to have
a sight, and be acquainted with the pleasures of
Gods <hi>Right hand;</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Psal. 16. 11.</note> for all these things are but
those of his <hi>Left;</hi> he gives them <hi>most plentifully</hi>
to those, that (at the consummation of all
things) shall stand on his left hand; And let me
tell you, There is little, very little of the love
of God in them; yea, no love at all, <hi>without
the other:</hi> These means, if it please God <hi>to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you</hi> to use them <hi>in good earnest,</hi> with a <hi>strong</hi>
and <hi>eager</hi> desire to be freed from this <hi>ugly</hi> Fiend
Covetousness; then will Hee without doubt
drive him <hi>out of you,</hi> and <hi>dispossess</hi> him from his
<hi>strong holds</hi> within you.</p>
                           <p>And Lastly, Let us <hi>commend</hi> all these <hi>Helps,
Means</hi> and <hi>Remedies,</hi> and all that we have said
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46362:311"/>
to the Lord <hi>by Prayer,</hi> resigning up our own
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>wisdom</hi> to God alone, who must <hi>by
his own power</hi> cast him <hi>out,</hi> or he will never stir
out of you, but keep his POSSESSION,
till he hath <hi>dispossessed</hi> us of all our Comfort,
Joy, and Happiness.</p>
                           <p>SOME things in this Sermon also
very much offended the Bishops,
and heightned his Charge in the High
Commission: The Reader may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
wherein, without particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</p>

                     <p>BEloved, we have here <hi>sung a Psalm,</hi> but if
we have not <hi>understood</hi> what we have
<hi>sung,</hi> we have but <hi>prated</hi> like Parrots: for
there is a threefold singing;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> there is a <hi>sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with understanding;</hi> as the Apostle
commands, To sing with the <hi>heart,</hi> and with
<hi>understanding:</hi> sing with the heart; that is,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46362:312"/>
                        <hi>sing with zeal;</hi> but as the Apostle saith, <hi>They
have zeal, but not acording to knowledge:</hi> For
a man may <hi>sing with his lips,</hi> and sing with
<hi>zeal,</hi> but yet not <hi>according to knowledge</hi> not
with <hi>understanding;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 2.</note> if we understand not <hi>what
we sing,</hi> we exalt not God in our hearts by our
singing. I do not mean <hi>such</hi> as say they know
not what, but they may know the litteral
<hi>meaning,</hi> and sing <hi>with zeal</hi> too, and with their
Spirit: but their eyes are not open to see <hi>The
spiritual mystery</hi> of the words: As here in this
<hi>Psalm,</hi> here be many things <hi>easie to be understood,</hi>
they are clear to every eye; as when <hi>David</hi>
doth exhort <hi>King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, Old men</hi> and
<hi>Babes</hi> to praise god: this is easie to be done and
we know the meaning as soon as we look on
it: but here are some things again that are
hard, and obscure, and they are two.</p>
                     <p>First, In that <hi>David</hi> doth exhort <hi>dumb, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable</hi>
and senseless <hi>Creatures</hi> to praise
God, such as cannot hear, at least cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand:
Doth the Holy Chost in the Gospel
bid us <hi>avoid impertinent</hi> speeches,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 7.</note> and <hi>vain repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,</hi>
and shall we think he will use them
himself? no, no. But,</p>
                     <p>Secondly Not onely doth he call upon <hi>these
creatures;</hi> but also he calls upon <hi>the deeps,</hi> and
the <hi>seas</hi> to <hi>praise God:</hi> These two things are
hard to be conceived.</p>
                     <p>But to give you some Reasons:</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> The first Reason may be this why <hi>David</hi> cals
upon <hi>the unreasonable Creatures</hi> to perform this
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46362:312"/>
duty: he doth his duty like <hi>a faithful</hi> Preacher,
whether they will hear or no that he preaches
to, yet he will discharge his own soul: a true
Preacher, he <hi>speaks the truth,</hi> and calls upon
them <hi>to hear,</hi> though his Auditors sleep, and
regard it not: so likewise doth <hi>David</hi> in this
sense, with these creatures; he doth his duty,
and calls upon them to do it, though they <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand</hi>
not, though they <hi>comprehend</hi> it not.</p>
                     <p>The second Reason may be this;<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> He doth it
craftily, by way of pollcy, to incite others to
perform this duty, that if <hi>such creatures as they</hi>
ought to do <hi>this</hi> then those that are above them
<hi>in degree,</hi> they have more cause, and may be
<hi>ashamed</hi> to neglect it: as an ill-governed master,
though he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tay himself at home, yet he will
<hi>send his servants to Church:</hi> so <hi>David</hi> being <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious</hi>
of his own <hi>neglect,</hi> yet he calls upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
not to be <hi>slack</hi> and <hi>negligent;</hi> though he
came infinitely short of that he should do, yet
he shews his own desire to perform this duty.</p>
                     <p>But if these Reasons will not satisfie <hi>you,</hi>
Though they have done Others,<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> a third Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
may be this, to set forth the sweet harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that is among all Gods creatures; <hi>To shew</hi>
how that all the creatures being Gods <hi>family,</hi>
do with <hi>One consent,</hi> speak and preach <hi>aloud</hi>
Gods praise; and therefore he calls upon <hi>some</hi>
above him, some below him, on both sides
him, <hi>every where,</hi> to speak Gods praise; for
every one in their place, degree, and calling
shew forth, though in <hi>a dumb</hi> sense and way,
<hi>Their Creators praise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:46362:313"/>
Or Fourthly and Lastly,<note place="margin">Reas. 4.</note> which I think to be
a good Reason: <hi>zeal</hi> makes men speak and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things <hi>impossible;</hi> the fire of zeal it will so
transport him, that it will make him speak
things <hi>unreasonable, impossible:</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> in his
zeal desired God for the safety of <hi>Israel to blot
his name out of his book,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> wished him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>Anathema Maranatha, accursed or separate
from Christ,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>for his bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>rens salvation:</hi> which
was a thing impossible, it could not be: But I
think <hi>David</hi> doth not <hi>intend</hi> this here; <hi>for he
calls for nothing</hi> but that which is done, and
therefore possible; for <hi>No creature can turn out
of the way of His praise;</hi> for he is not only <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
in their <hi>graces;</hi> but even also as much in
their <hi>sins</hi> and <hi>rebellions</hi> against him: though
men should <hi>spit their malice</hi> and their blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in the <hi>very face</hi> of God their maker, yet
<hi>they hurt not him,</hi> they cannot touch him, nor
his sacred glory; his praise shall <hi>as well</hi> and <hi>as
much</hi> every whit <hi>arise</hi> from their <hi>confusion,</hi> as
from their <hi>salvation;</hi> the hurt is their own,
not his.</p>
                     <p>And now to shew you how the dumb and
deaf <hi>creatures</hi> sing praise to God, as God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of <hi>Iob,</hi> when <hi>he thought</hi> as we, that
man onely praises God, <hi>Iob</hi> 38. 7.<note place="margin">Ioh. 38. 7.</note> saith God,
<hi>Where wert thou, when the morning Stars sang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</hi>
God says there they <hi>Shouted</hi> and <hi>Sung;</hi> did not
you heat them, did they not <hi>sing</hi> and <hi>shout</hi> in
your ears? it is no matter, they did in his
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46362:313"/>
and to him they sang <hi>melodiously,</hi> and <hi>Aloud,</hi>
and he understands <hi>their</hi> voice, and their <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi>
though we understand not how they do
praise him: As in a tree, it is the nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to grow and flourish in the <hi>spring,</hi> and in
<hi>Autumn</hi> the leaves fall, and the sap <hi>returns</hi> to
the root; Gods will is as well accomplished
in this tree, as in a man; for these <hi>visible</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were made of <hi>invisible;</hi> and that which
is <hi>invisible</hi> praised him <hi>before, and that praises
him still;</hi> for all the creatures, the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi>
and <hi>Stars,</hi> yea the whole Creation, they all sing
sweetly and make <hi>a melodious</hi> praise, wherein
he is infinitely delighted; as <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.<note place="margin">Psal. 19. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>The
heavens declare the glory of God, and the earth
sheweth his handy-work:</hi> And the Song of the
three Children, <hi>O all ye works of God, bless the
Lord, praise him and magnifie him for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is in all these dumb, and insensible,
and unreasonable creatures, A proper kind of
<hi>Religion;</hi> God gives to every one according to
their place, degree, nature and calling, A <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi>
and <hi>accordingly</hi> he will require of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
if he gives the <hi>gift of prophesie,</hi> we must
<hi>prophesie</hi> according to <hi>the measure of faith:</hi> as
in the <hi>University,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 6.</note> we do not expect those parts
and abilities in <hi>young beginners,</hi> and <hi>Sizars,</hi> that
we expect in those that are of longer standing;
Then by the way it is no wonder, though God
give to those <hi>that sit at the Helm</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi>
more eminent and larger gifts, then he gives to
those that are below, in lower offices; I may say
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46362:314"/>
even these unreasonable creatures have a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<hi>in their way,</hi> according to <hi>Gods</hi> will; We
see <hi>God</hi> ascribes moral vertues to them;<note place="margin">Prov. 6. 6.</note> As in
the <hi>Proverbs, Go to the Pismire, thou sluggard; she
provideth in summer for the Winter;</hi> &amp; in <hi>Isai.</hi> 1. 3.<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 3.</note>
                        <hi>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Ass his Masters
crib, but my people have not known me, saith the
Lord:</hi> and in the Evangelists it is, <hi>He rebuketh
the windes and sea,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mar. 4. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>and they Obey him:</hi> Here are
moral vertues in them; care and providence
in the <hi>Pismire;</hi> thankfulness in the <hi>Ox</hi> and <hi>Ass,</hi>
to them that feed them; we see they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their owner, and there is obedience
even in the Seas. Nay every Creature doth its
duty but onely MAN.</p>
                     <p>We will now also see if we can find out their
Religion. Religion consists of four parts; All
Religion I say may be reduced to four heads.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>The first is, <hi>A Creed,</hi> what we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>A Petition,</hi> what we are to pray for.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>A Decalogue,</hi> what we are to do.</item>
                        <item>And Lastly, <hi>A Sacrifice,</hi> what we are to
give.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Now let us see how all these are <hi>competible</hi> to
all these creatures. First, For their <hi>Creed,</hi>
what they believe, what faith they have; it is
true, they cannot speak as we do, yet they
speak in their kind, and as they are able: We
require no more of children then they are <hi>able,</hi>
neither doth <hi>God</hi> of his Creatures: and so these
creatures do in their kind both <hi>speak</hi> and <hi>believe</hi>
                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:46362:314"/>
(this is an undeniable <hi>maxime,</hi>) That there is a
<hi>God;</hi> for who can look upon <hi>an effect,</hi> but he must
needs have recourse to <hi>the cause?</hi> there can be
no <hi>effect</hi> without a cause; if we see <hi>a thing made,</hi>
we know it hath a Maker; and if we look upon
the creature in this kind, <hi>as an Effect,</hi> it plainly
speaks a cause; so that, we can look upon
no creature, but we must inquire after <hi>God;</hi>
There is no attribute ascribed to <hi>God,</hi> but all the
creatures <hi>speak it,</hi> and <hi>confess</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>As first (to speak of some of his Attributes) for
instance, <hi>God is one Simple Essence;</hi> this <hi>unity</hi>
is testified and declared <hi>by the Creatures,</hi> that
God is one, and can be no more; for if there
were more then <hi>one</hi> Creator of them, then the
one would destroy, confouud, and <hi>overthrow</hi>
the other; for, if they be Two, either they
must be <hi>equal,</hi> or not <hi>equal;</hi> if they be <hi>not equal,</hi>
then the one is <hi>greater then the other,</hi> and the
greater will overcome the lesser; and if they
be <hi>equal,</hi> then there must be bounds and limits
<hi>set,</hi> how far <hi>the Ones</hi> dominion must <hi>reach,</hi> and
how far <hi>the other:</hi> but this to affirm, is most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and ridiculous.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They all testifie that <hi>God</hi> is good,
and if <hi>good,</hi> and the onely goodness, goodness
<hi>it self,</hi> then likewise he must be <hi>Truth, Entity
and Being;</hi> for all these are <hi>one:</hi> Whatever is
one, is <hi>God;</hi> whatever is truth, is <hi>God;</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is good, is <hi>God;</hi> whatever is <hi>Entity</hi> and
<hi>Being,</hi> is <hi>God;</hi> for in saying he is good, or in
saying, He is any of these; He is all these:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46362:315"/>
for these are terms <hi>convertible;</hi> if he be good,
then he is Truth, Entity and Being; and if he
be truth, entity and being, then he is good;
these are all one: and so of any of the rest. And,
if there be <hi>A goodness in the</hi> creatures, then what
is He who is the fountain, that gives all these
<hi>their goodness?</hi> These are but the <hi>Chanels</hi> that
run from the <hi>Fountain</hi> and <hi>Head;</hi> but it so falls
out in the world, and is so common, that many,
yea most men are so taken up with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness
of the <hi>streames</hi> that come <hi>from him,</hi>
that they are <hi>drowned in them:</hi> he gives us these
outward comforts, that <hi>they</hi> may draw <hi>our eyes</hi>
to him that bestows them, that so we may be in
love with him, not them. But in our way to
him we fall in love <hi>with the creatures:</hi> he
lets down these cords <hi>to draw us up to him,</hi> &amp; we
<hi>hang our selves</hi> with these cords: as those that
came a woing to <hi>Penelope,</hi> many, yea most of
them fell in love with the <hi>Handmaids</hi> that
were appointed to lead them to her, and so
never saw <hi>the Mistress;</hi> So do we fall in
love with the <hi>servants,</hi> The <hi>Handmaids</hi> of God,
The creatures, and we make them The <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress;</hi>
whereas we should never rest till we
come by these servants and Handmaids, to the

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46362:315"/>
when we behold and see the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi>
and <hi>Stars,</hi> and the glorious <hi>Firmament,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
choose but ask, whose <hi>light</hi> is this? and
they presently tell us Their Belief, That they
are <hi>All The works of His hands:</hi> There is no
creature but testifies the <hi>Goodness,</hi> the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Excellency</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> of him: You may
say, these indeed <hi>in themselves</hi> are glorious
creatures; but say withal, <hi>Where is</hi> He that
enlightens them, and makes them so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
Oh! What and How glorious is He
that thus <hi>shines</hi> in them, and <hi>through</hi> them?
And as they All testifie the glory of their
Creator, so they All suffer him to be <hi>their Lord
and Ruler:</hi> Every thing <hi>is contented</hi> to stand in
his place, and be obedient to him; the beasts
they are appointed <hi>for food</hi> to man, as other
things are <hi>for beasts,</hi> every one <hi>increasing</hi> and
yielding their <hi>sweetness</hi> and <hi>fatness</hi> to the next
creature <hi>above them;</hi> and this they do willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>without grudging.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, <hi>All these creatures,</hi> though they do speak
[God] yet that they say of Him <hi>it is nothing</hi> in
comparison of him: Though they say <hi>something,</hi>
yet they all say <hi>not All</hi> of him: but in us there
<hi>is such a deal of ignorance,</hi> (which I was about
to say was the <hi>greatest sin</hi>) that we are so far
from using them as we should, <hi>making</hi> them
serviceable to us, and keeping them in their
place, that we are rather <hi>serviceable</hi> to them,
and are their servants, and we make them
<hi>Masters;</hi> we are sooner turned <hi>into their kind,</hi>
then they into ours.

And the creatures, though they <hi>speak</hi> God,
and speak aloud of him; yet <hi>know</hi> this, they still
cry <hi>Plus ultra, plus ultra,</hi> there is more behinde

<hi>Look Beyond us</hi> for we All are <hi>Nothing Nothing,</hi>
to Him who made us and gave us to be What
we are: And we all speak infinitely short of <hi>Him.</hi>
As when I see This Church, or House, I know
he was <hi>a workman</hi> that built it, yet I know not
All of him; I neither knew <hi>what age</hi> he was of,
nor <hi>what means</hi> he had, but that he was a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
this his works do tell me: So in the
works of Creation, when I look upon any of
the creatures, I must needs acknowledge he
was a Rare workman, and a wise, that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

Of Praise and Adoration: As I told you,
every creature praises <hi>God; the work</hi> praises <hi>the
workman,</hi> and every creature praises <hi>God,</hi> I and
with a loud voyce: But whoever heard and
understood <hi>the noise</hi> and the language of the

But even All these praise <hi>God Aloud,</hi> and <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth

                        <hi>The eyes of all

one anothers <hi>complaints,</hi> one anothers

                        <hi>unto him,</hi> but yet in such a language as <hi>God

this belongs onely <hi>to us,</hi> because they need

True it is, they have not <hi>that reason</hi> that we
have; and therfore they have not so exact A
Decalogue; Yet, God hath power even <hi>to
break</hi> this exact Law: yea man also may, if
God give him <hi>a dispensation:</hi> and then if he
break <hi>any of these Laws,</hi> it is no sin: as God

kill him</hi> in his intention;<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 2.</note> and <hi>he had killed him,</hi>
had not the Angel staid his hand; and it was

and circumcision is that of the heart, in the
spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of
men, but of God:</hi> So say I of saving knowledge;
He that sees the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the Scripture, he
hath the <hi>true knowledge</hi> of the Scripture: He
is not taught of God, that knows only the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the Flesh of the Scripture: but true

of the Letter: and though men may <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Therefore we may observe also what Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
the Apostle preferres; not the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the <hi>Letter,</hi> but the Ministers of the

he having made us <hi>able Ministers of the New
Testament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit; for
the Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life:</hi> all
the knowledge of the <hi>history</hi> is but as the Law

of the <hi>Mystery,</hi> And Marrow, That giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
life.</p>
                     <p>But you will say to me,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> 
                        <hi>How doth the Letter
kill?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> By <hi>resting therein,</hi> and not seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the <hi>marrow,</hi> the <hi>food</hi> and the <hi>life;</hi> but
contenting our selves with the knowledge of
the History and outside: but because I have at
other times <hi>unfolded</hi> this unto you, I shall here
pass it by, and come to the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Mystery</hi>
of our Text in hand.</p>
                     <p>So then, it resteth (This premised) being
That we may safely conclude <hi>even</hi> thus much,
that as our Saviour was typisied by <hi>others</hi> who
went before him; he was the <hi>Substance</hi> of all
those <hi>Shadows,</hi> both of persons and things:
even so Christ Jesus himself, he is the <hi>resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi>
and type of himself; his <hi>outward, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
and <hi>visible</hi> actions in the flesh, were a type
of his <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>internall</hi> actions in the souls
of all Believers, He being their <hi>life</hi> and <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;</hi>
they being before <hi>but dead men</hi> in <hi>Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes</hi>
and <hi>sins,</hi> untill his actions be their <hi>life</hi>
and <hi>Regeneration.</hi> So likewise, as <hi>his life</hi> was
Typical, and resembled himself; so in regard
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46362:327"/>
of his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>crucifying:</hi> whatever he suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>externally</hi> in the flesh, it shews how he is
<hi>internally crucifyed</hi> daily, even to the end of the
world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6.<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Seeing they crucifie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Son of God a fresh, and put him to an
open shame:</hi> So likewise for all his other <hi>actions</hi>
and <hi>passages</hi> related of him; as his <hi>Nativity,</hi> it
held out <hi>our spiritual</hi> birth, and Christ his being
born in <hi>the soul;</hi> as the Apostle expresseth it,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19.<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>My beloved of whom I travel in birth,
till Christ be formed, or brought forth in you.</hi>
So also in his Circumcision, is held forth our
<hi>Spiritual</hi> Circumcision:<note place="margin">Col. 2. 11.</note> as in that of <hi>Col. 2 11.
Ye are compleat in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in whom also ye are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
with the circumcision made without hands, in
putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the
circumcision of Christ, &amp;c.</hi> So also for <hi>holiness</hi>
of life: Christs holiness shew us, what <hi>holiness</hi>
shall be in them that are <hi>his</hi> children and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 16.<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note>

your father which is in Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So also for his outward Teaching, it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to us, that all His people should be <hi>taught
of God;</hi> he himself would be the true Teacher

An outward dead faith, to believe onely in an

he will not slight nor cast away these means or

searcheth all things, yea, the</hi> DEEP <hi>things of

he himself is judged of no man: for who hath

the Apostle, in that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. expostulates,
concerning the <hi>Hidden Mystery</hi> of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,

                     </p>
                     <p>He that is taught these things, hath the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries

and the grace of God was upon him:</hi> Here you
may see the reason, and what Christ meant
when he said, <hi>Mat. 19. 14. Suffer little children to
come unto me,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 19. 14.</note>

tis forbid, that any <hi>Dwarf</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi>
should approch to offer sacrifice to God. How
shall we <hi>reconcile</hi> Gods Commandment and
Christ his practise? Truly thus, I suppose Christ
in that saying, holds forth by little children,
such as are in an <hi>humble, meek, lowly,</hi> and in a
<hi>growing</hi> condition, and coming on to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for saith he, <hi>He that receiveth not the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

But for Dwarfs, whose growth is <hi>stinted,</hi>

of new light, or a new Birth, or that any should

searched out the judgment of most Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;
Have Epitomized the quintessence of all
their judgments; and shall we tell these men of
new light? they cry <hi>New lights</hi> are old <hi>Errors:</hi> Do

                     <p>You see our Saviour <hi>grew up in wisdom and
stature, and the grace of God was with him, being
filled therewith:</hi> He stood not at a stay but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased;
he grew from the Law to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
he submitted to the Law in all things, and
<hi>fulfilled all righteousness;</hi> but he rested not in
the Law, but grew up to the Gospel; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
at Circumcision, and submitted to the
Law, and was <hi>obedient, even unto death:</hi>
and he rested not there neither, but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<hi>ascended</hi> and rose again to Life and
Glory: So S. <hi>Paul</hi> to avoid <hi>offence,</hi> because of
some that were <hi>weak in the faith,</hi> he circumcised
<hi>Timothy,</hi> Acts 16. 3.<note place="margin">Act. 16. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>because of the Iews, for they

he saith,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Circumcision is nothing, nor uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
but a new creature.</hi> And again, when
<hi>Paul</hi> saw that they began <hi>to rest upon Baptism,</hi> he
slighted it, and <hi>undervalues</hi> it; when men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46362:333"/>
to make the <hi>Shadow</hi> the <hi>Substance,</hi> or the

being rightly used, he practised and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them himself: So they be but used as
<hi>Means,</hi> and <hi>Schoolmasters,</hi> and <hi>Tutors</hi> to bring
us to Christ; But if they instead of bringing
us to him, keep and bar us from him, away
with them: If we begin to admire them, and

themselves,</hi> though appointed by Christ
<hi>himself,</hi> to be our Saviours, we are to slight
them, and disesteem them in that regard, as
<hi>Paul</hi> did the holy Law it self,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> in that Epistle
to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and elsewhere: For all these
Ordinances <hi>are</hi> for no other use, but that they
may be as <hi>steps</hi> to him, &amp; as <hi>guides</hi> to him who is
the truth and the substance: nay <hi>Paul</hi> went so
high, that he not onely undervalued the <hi>Law,</hi>
or <hi>Ordinances,</hi> or <hi>Duties,</hi> if they hindred from
Christ, but he attempted to draw aside, and
undervalued and slighted the very Person and
Body of Jesus Christ, in that case; If men rest
in any outward priviledge or enjoyment, they
keep us <hi>from</hi> Christ.</p>
                     <p>Beloved, be not offended, see what himself

enough: but he boldly addes, <hi>Yea, although
we have known Christ after the flesh, yet henceforth
know we him no more:</hi> as if he should say, tell

                     <p>And so likewise to instance <hi>in Baptism,</hi> which
some think is come in the room of <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi>
Well let it be so, we will not contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that, Christ removing that <hi>burthensom</hi> and
<hi>legal</hi> Ordinance: but for Christ the substance we
ought and must contend for to the utmost: yet
some there are that would have Baptism admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
after such manner that it is as burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
yea more burthensom to some then Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision:
you know what I mean: as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
the unseasonableness of weather some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
&amp; the <hi>weaknes</hi> and <hi>sicknes</hi> of some bodies;
besides, that of Circumcision was onely for the

is; with many other reasons too long to
stand upon; therefore more burthensom then
Circumcision: they speak of plunging over head
and ears, as if it were an absolute injunction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom. 6. 4. Buried with him
in Baptism,</hi> therefore they must be <hi>plunged:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truly, there is a great deal of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

need; for Baptism is but a <hi>type</hi> and <hi>shadow</hi> of
the true Baptism: and I conceive (and to me
its clear) that the Apostle there sets the <hi>shadow</hi>
against the <hi>substance;</hi> one to set out the other:
for Christs Baptism was <hi>his humbling himself,</hi>
and <hi>emptying himself,</hi> and submitting to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will, in his whole <hi>Passions and sufferings,</hi>
which is the thing Baptism holds forth; For to
<hi>Zebedees</hi> children, when they desired <hi>to sit one on
his right hand,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 22</note> 
                        <hi>and the other on his left:</hi> (he saith)
<hi>Can you be baptized with the Baptism wherewith I
must be baptized?</hi> intimating that they were not
<hi>able</hi> to pass through such <hi>a sea of sufferings</hi> as he
was to pass through; they not knowing what
they said, or what Christ meant, they answered,
<hi>We are:</hi> They thought submitting to Baptism
was but <hi>a small thing;</hi> neither indeed was it, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it onely as external.</p>
                     <p>But because the Apostle saith, <hi>Buried with him
in or by Baptism,</hi> therefore a great deal <hi>ado</hi> there
hath been in several ages of the Church <hi>by some,</hi>
affirming Baptism is no Baptism, except they
be <hi>plunged</hi> or <hi>ducked</hi> under water; a very <hi>childish</hi>
and weak conclusion, without any true ground:
yet mistake me not, I do not say <hi>childish,</hi> in
regard of the <hi>Appointment,</hi> but in regard of
<hi>Resting</hi> and <hi>dwelling</hi> therein, and not going on
toward perfection it <hi>self.</hi> And truly with
some men, herein lies the <hi>top</hi> or <hi>quintessence</hi>
of their Religion, making such ado a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Shadows,</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> and <hi>Resemblances,</hi>
while they let the <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Substance,</hi> and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:46362:335"/>
the <hi>Thing</hi> pass; and regard it not; forasmuch as
they are so <hi>zealous</hi> and <hi>hot</hi> about <hi>Forms:</hi> but if
they are by any <hi>drawn</hi> up to speak of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
they are as men <hi>lost, cold</hi> and <hi>heartless:</hi>
which is a plain <hi>evidence</hi> to me, that they prefer
the <hi>Shadow</hi> before <hi>the Substance,</hi> being meerly
exercised about <hi>childish things,</hi> and are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to <hi>come up</hi> to the Truth, to the <hi>Excellencies</hi>
and <hi>Glories of</hi> what Baptism,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 31.</note> and other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
signifie: And there is no telling them
of <hi>a more excellent way,</hi> as the Apostle saith:
They see all excellencies in the <hi>Shadow,</hi> none
in the <hi>Substance:</hi> Whereabouts (think you) is
these mens Religion and truth of Grace?</p>
                     <p>Truly, my Friends, this <hi>sticking</hi> in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is that which hath been <hi>the bane</hi> of all
growth in Religion, and an occasion of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>disputes</hi> and <hi>differences</hi> therein, which I do
not wonder at; for <hi>Children</hi> can do no other
then <hi>quarrel</hi> about trifles, and things of no
great worth: Not that the soul should <hi>slight</hi> or
<hi>undervalue</hi> Ordinances, or any other duty. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
I am fain to use this <hi>caution</hi> the oftner,
because ye are so subject to <hi>catch</hi> and <hi>carp:</hi> I
say, Let all those things have their due <hi>time,
place</hi> and <hi>esteem:</hi> but to <hi>rest</hi> in these, is the
worm, the Gourd: But this I say, when the
soul <hi>by</hi> these Ordinances (or <hi>in</hi> these, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you will name) shall come to see and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
God <hi>Her Portion;</hi> when she is in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit

the mark, the Price of the high calling of God

I may boldly say, whats <hi>Duties?</hi> whats <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances?</hi>
whats Christ in <hi>the flesh?</hi> I beseech

may <hi>censure</hi> and <hi>revile a soul</hi> that may say
indeed and in truth, he is above these: What

                        <note place="margin">2 Cor, 12. 4.</note> I grant
also Beloved, that the most <hi>elevated, triumphing,</hi>
and <hi>most raised</hi> soul, lives not always in this
condition; these <hi>things,</hi> and these <hi>raptures,</hi> and
these <hi>embraces</hi> come but seldom; and the soul
comes to fall lower, and have <hi>more use</hi> of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances:
but she uses them as <hi>Handmaids,</hi> so as
to <hi>conduct</hi> her to her <hi>Beloved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beloved, I would have you <hi>ponder</hi> these
things well: If ye set up <hi>Ordinances, &amp;c.</hi> so as
to <hi>build</hi> and <hi>Rest</hi> in them, ye do make Idols of
them; or at the best, you play the <hi>Babes</hi> and the
<hi>Children</hi> with them, by <hi>Resting always on such
Crutches</hi> and <hi>Go-bies,</hi> and never come to be
<hi>Yong-men,</hi> much less as <hi>Fathers</hi> in Christ; <hi>Paul,</hi>
and <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> they would have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<hi>enjoyed</hi> those <hi>Raptures: Paul</hi> in the third

                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:46362:336"/>
But the one had a <hi>prick in the flesh,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
came <hi>down again from the Mount;</hi> and in
these <hi>declinations,</hi> and <hi>lower enjoyments,</hi> I would
not for a world forbid men to use <hi>means,</hi> not
onely in regard of <hi>themselves,</hi> but of <hi>others,</hi> who
may (by those) come to have <hi>the same enjoyments,</hi>
making them no more but <hi>means,</hi> and not the
end.</p>
                     <p>And so much <hi>more</hi> I will say, to <hi>satisfie</hi> you,
that I have great cause to <hi>mistrust</hi> those spirits,
whether they come the right way to God,
or into such <hi>Raptures,</hi> that leap into them on a
<hi>sudden,</hi> without use of means or Ordinances,
But out of a <hi>Blinde</hi> and <hi>Prophane</hi> condition,
come suddenly into these enjoyments: for God
doth <hi>usually</hi> make use of these means; yet I
may not limit, nor direct, nor circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the Soveraign Almighty: yet usually
<hi>faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word
preached:</hi> But herein lies the <hi>general</hi> abuse of
these <hi>truths,</hi> and of these <hi>enjoyments;</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some may and do come thus to enjoy
God, and forsake <hi>Ordinances</hi> at a season, at the
<hi>very</hi> time of such <hi>enjoyments,</hi> therefore some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gotten this <hi>in notion,</hi> have presumptuously
affirmed that they are above these, and so far
abuse themselves, and shew an ill example to
others,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.</note> that they have quite <hi>forsaken the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi>
and the use of any Ordinances.</p>
                     <p>Beloved, all these things <hi>are an offence,</hi> and
hereby many a soul by this delusion of Satan,
drowns it self in <hi>perdition:</hi> And yet I may say

more then all this, and say <hi>properly too,</hi> he that

                        </hi>
is most properly taken, and is a truth, though
much abused; <hi>viz.</hi> That man hath not <hi>his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
his <hi>Life</hi> in them; this man <hi>lives</hi> above Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances:
I do not say he must <hi>forsake all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi>
as men take it <hi>usually:</hi> But to have our

                        <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note>
and against this Doctrine <hi>the gates of hell shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                     </p>
                     <p>And this I will say more, those that come
into such pretended enjoyments in this <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi>
way, that <hi>for the most part</hi> they never
hold on in a Christian course, but abusing <hi>this
light,</hi> run out into <hi>fleshly</hi> liberty: But the right
<hi>enjoyment</hi> of God, is such <hi>a hedge</hi> to a man, that
he cannot but love God, and seek to <hi>honour</hi> him
with all his <hi>might.</hi> But I conceive <hi>all these
things</hi> are but to <hi>lead</hi> us to Jesus Christ; and

                     <p>Concerning Baptism, we see <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced,

Christ of no effect:</hi> All these things, were they
never so high in esteem among the <hi>Famousest</hi>
Teachers and Professors, he laid them aside,
and <hi>undervalued</hi> them; If <hi>Baptism</hi> be set in the

though in a true observation of it, or of
the Lords Supper, according to Christs rule, or
in <hi>Fellowships</hi> or <hi>Gatherings</hi> together, then we
make Idols of them and set them in the <hi>room</hi> of
Christ: and Christ the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> is
<hi>slighted</hi> and <hi>neglected.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So also, you know, that at the beginning of
the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, when it was <hi>weak,</hi> and
in its <hi>infancy,</hi> and could not digest <hi>strong meat,</hi>
the Apostles by consultation <hi>fed them with milk,</hi>
and such Doctrine as they were <hi>able to bear:</hi> And
all was to this end, that they might use such
things as Help to shew them Jesus Christ: as
<hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28, 29.<note place="margin">Act. 15. 28, 29.</note> 
                        <hi>It seemed good to the holy Spirit, &amp;
to us, to lay upon you no other burthen then these ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
things, That ye abstain from things offered
to Idols, and from blood, and from things strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
&amp;c. if you keep your selves from these things,
ye shall do well: Fare ye well.</hi> Now in these things,
according to the present <hi>infancy</hi> and <hi>weakness</hi> of
that Church,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 22.</note> did as <hi>Pauls practise</hi> was; <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
weak to the weak and became all to all, that he
might win some;</hi> They saw they could not <hi>bear</hi>
taking away and removing <hi>all things</hi> at once,
and so drew them on <hi>with cords of love,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence</hi>
in things indifferent: It was as much as
they <hi>at that time</hi> could bear, to remove that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46362:337"/>
                        <hi>commanded Ordinance</hi> of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
and because others began to <hi>press</hi> it as a
thing of <hi>necessity,</hi> therefore they in wisdom <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move</hi>
it, laying no such <hi>injunction</hi> on them, and
this they tell them <hi>they shall do well to observe:</hi>
But after this, when they had been <hi>exercised</hi>
more in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and they began to see these
things were but <hi>Pedagogies, Paul</hi> adventured to
<hi>wave</hi> these things, as being <hi>things</hi> which are not
the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Substance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore he incourages the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
not to stand upon such things, in that 1 <hi>Cor,</hi>
8. 7.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Howbeit there is not in every man that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
for some with confidence of the Idol, unto this
hour eat it as a thing offered unto an Idol; and their
conscience being weak is defiled: For</hi> (saith he in
the Verses before) <hi>An Idol is nothing, and there is
none other but one God:</hi> Therefore although it
be <hi>meat</hi> left at the <hi>Idol Sacrifices,</hi> the meat is the
same afterward which it was before; the Idol
<hi>defileth</hi> not the meat, for it is nothing: And
therefore in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 25.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 25.</note> (saith he) <hi>Whatever is
sold in the Shambles, that eat, asking no question
for conscience sake:</hi> Why? there he gives the
same reason again; <hi>For the earth is the Lords,
and the fulness thereof:</hi> I might draw out
<hi>this point</hi> to many more <hi>particulars,</hi> wherein
many are <hi>misled</hi> in these days; as concerning
<hi>eating of blood,</hi> and using of <hi>Temples</hi> or <hi>Places</hi>
dedicated to Idols, I hope I need give no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Solution</hi> at present, but that Answer that
there the Apostle doth, <hi>An Idol is nothing in the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46362:338"/>
world; there is none other but one God: The earth
is the Lords, and the fulness thereof:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I say, eat and use what is prepared for
you, <hi>making no question for conscience sake:</hi>
But through the weakness and childishness
of many, there hath been <hi>great contest</hi> about
things of this <hi>nature:</hi> And if it be evil to prefer
the <hi>handmaid</hi> before the <hi>Mistris,</hi> and the <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi>
before the <hi>Substance,</hi> even <hi>of things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:</hi>
much more to prefer these things of
such <hi>indifferency</hi> before the <hi>Substance,</hi> which are
to be laid <hi>aside</hi> as we grow stronger (which we
are not to do by the things absolutely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded)
but to use them, and not <hi>abuse</hi>
them; to use them, and not <hi>build</hi> on them, or
Rest in them.</p>
                     <p>And as it is in things of this nature, so it is in
the general estate of all Christians: First, they
are <hi>servants, and under the yoke,</hi> before they come
to be <hi>Sons;</hi> but when once <hi>the true Heir comes</hi> to
age, then <hi>cast out the bond-woman, and her son:</hi> as
the Apostle alledgeth that of <hi>Abraham</hi> for this
very purpose; not that they do <hi>cast away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi>
according to the Law, but that they
do it upon another <hi>account,</hi> even from <hi>love:</hi>
Then tis no longer a <hi>yoke,</hi> but according to
that promise, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 33.<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 33.</note> 
                        <hi>I will write my Law
in their heart;</hi> and so they obey out of love, and
not for <hi>fear:</hi> There was a time when the <hi>highest</hi>

not him who is not as tall as thy self; but let
us in whatever we reprove them, pity them,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46362:338"/>
and pray for them, knowing it was once thine
own condition; onely when men are <hi>self-wise</hi>
and <hi>conceited,</hi> and think themselves to be
great and something, when they are nothing,
these deserve <hi>a more severe</hi> reproof, according
to that of the Apostle <hi>Iude,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jude 22, 23.</note> verse 22, 23. <hi>Of

save with fear, pulling, or snatching them out of the
fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> carries this point <hi>high,</hi>
and saith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Gal. 4. I, 2</note> the beginning; and applies it
to Christ himself: <hi>Now I say, that the heir as long
as he is under age, differeth nothing from a servant,
though he be Lord of all; but is under Tutors and
Governors, until the time apppointed of the Father:
even so we, when we were in bondage, under the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the world; but when the fulness of time was
come, God sent forth his Son made under the Law,
to redeem those that were under the Law, that we
might receive the adoption of sons:</hi> And Christ
himself saith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 35.<note place="margin">Joh. 8. 35.</note> 
                        <hi>The servant abideth
not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi>
But what is it to be <hi>a servant?</hi> and what a
<hi>Son?</hi> Christ answers it himself, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 15.<note place="margin">Joh. 15. 15</note>
                        <hi>Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant

you friends; for all things which I have heard of
my Father, I have made known unto you; and ye
are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

but if you be <hi>Friends</hi> or <hi>Sons</hi> (its all one)

you shall <hi>abide in the house for ever:</hi> The inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

yours; you shall not onely have the external

the glory, the pleasure and delight of
those Commands: that is, you shall not onely
have the Letter, but the Life, and shall know
whatever the Lord doth; you shall not always
be servants, but shall grow up to be <hi>sons:</hi> and if
ye grow not, you may well question your
selves, whether ye shall ever come to the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
or no. But I say, look to your selves
therefore in the name of Jesus Christ; for I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
boldly in his name, <hi>That faith which is not
a growing faith, is not a true faith:</hi> If your faith
and light be the same as it was many years ago,
that you have onely an <hi>external</hi> faith, and <hi>your

Christ is not your Teacher, and that he grows

There is nothing in the world is barren; and

methods of Satan in men, to make men to <hi>stand</hi>
still, &amp; not to <hi>grow;</hi> for he can be content to let
men have a <hi>Religion,</hi> and a supposed true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and to use <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> and <hi>Rules
of worship,</hi> &amp; to be <hi>content</hi> in them: but if he can
keep them from growing, as <hi>he</hi> may very easily
for all the use of them, his Kingdom is never
like to be <hi>by them</hi> much shaken: Therefore as
he sometimes <hi>tempteth</hi> men to despair by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>children</hi> to measure themselves according
to the <hi>rules</hi> of the <hi>Perfect:</hi> so more often to <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi>
and blessing themselves in an <hi>unsound</hi>
condition, by making those that <hi>think</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
strong men, yet still to <hi>measure</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by children, that because <hi>some</hi> or <hi>many</hi>
are <hi>weaker</hi> and <hi>darker</hi> then they, therefore
themselves are <hi>grown</hi> men, and <hi>tall</hi> Christians:
This is no other but Satans <hi>method,</hi> that though
they have a <hi>Religion,</hi> yet they shall be never the
better for it.</p>
                        <p>2. Another reason why I would commend
the <hi>knowledge</hi> and consideration of this point,
is, for fear lest <hi>some</hi> being deceived in their
own <hi>judgments,</hi> they should also <hi>deceive you,</hi>
making you to rest upon <hi>a reed of Egypt, which
will deceive</hi> and destroy you: And whilst they
never <hi>leave the Doctrine of the Beginnings of

they have <hi>little</hi> or <hi>none</hi> but what they have

<hi>degrees of grace,</hi> and proportions of <hi>faith,</hi> so
they should be <hi>preferred</hi> according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

way now is, to prefer the <hi>smaller matters of

to say, they are more excellent; if not in word,
yet in practice: As</p>

as <hi>hearing, praying, receiving the Sacrament, &amp;c.</hi>
when as these are but <hi>poor</hi> things without the
<hi>truth</hi> and <hi>substance:</hi> these are but <hi>The Beginnings
of Christ,</hi> and to rest in these is but to be <hi>always</hi>
children: As if you should bid a Taylor make
a garment <hi>for a man,</hi> and he should take measure
<hi>by a childe;</hi> and if he be to make a garment <hi>for
a childe,</hi> to take measure <hi>by a man:</hi> what a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
were this? Therefore in all the
ages and degrees of Christians, we must observe
what things, and what <hi>garments</hi> best fit them;
that garment that will fit <hi>a child,</hi> wil not a <hi>man:</hi>
&amp; that which will fit a <hi>man,</hi> will not fit a <hi>child;</hi>
therefore there must be consideration had, to
distinguish <hi>times</hi> &amp; <hi>seasons:</hi> Under the Law they
were led by <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>visible</hi> things, <hi>riches,</hi> and

                           <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>prosperity,</hi> and <hi>health</hi> and <hi>long life</hi>
and such childish things: And are not most

are still under the <hi>Paedagogie</hi> of the Law, &amp; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>prosperity,</hi> and are led <hi>by these things?</hi> And
these are the <hi>chief</hi> things they seek, and make
petition to God for: which indeed we do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to <hi>children,</hi> to draw them on to a use of
prayer: but this <hi>garment,</hi> though it may fit a
<hi>childe,</hi> yet it will not a grown man in Christ.</p>
                        <p>But they are to <hi>seek first the Kingdom of God,</hi>
and to rest quietly in the <hi>will</hi> of God, whether
these things shall <hi>be added or no: When I was a

as a childe,</hi>

                           <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I prayed as a childe; <hi>but
when I came to be a man, I put away childish things:</hi>
Those that are come to be grown men in
Christ, for these outward things they are <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi>
they see no such <hi>excellency</hi> in them, as all
<hi>worldly</hi> men do, and even as children in Christ
may <hi>through their weakness</hi> do the same: But
let us now <hi>put away childish things,</hi> and be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to lie <hi>crying</hi> and <hi>whining,</hi> and <hi>begging</hi> for
Bables and Rattles, for riches, and honour, and
beauty, and favour of great men and such like
things: how unseemly is it <hi>for a man</hi> to cry or
strive for childrens things, O that I had such a
<hi>Preferment!</hi> and good Lord, let me have such a
<hi>place;</hi> let me have such a <hi>house;</hi> I must have
such <hi>a purchase</hi> of Land; Oh that I had my
<hi>health</hi> again, my <hi>wealth</hi> again; not but that
these <hi>prayers</hi> are lawful; but to seek these

things in our <hi>chief</hi> desires, so that if you had

and as quiet as <hi>Lambs:</hi> let who will look
after the souls portion and inheritance. Truly
Friends, <hi>after all these things do the Gentiles seek;</hi>
All the men of the world <hi>gape</hi> for these things,
and see <hi>an excellency</hi> in nothing else; but these
men that are grown up in Christianity, I tell
you worldly men <hi>prize them not so much,</hi> but

<hi>doing good:</hi> They dare not direct God what to
do in such things;<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 16.</note> but say with a holy resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
even, Father <hi>as it seemeth good in thy sight;</hi>
and <hi>Thy will, not mine be done:</hi> He dare not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
a will to himself in any of these things;
they can but <hi>say</hi> at most, give us <hi>this day our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

done;</hi> The chief <hi>end,</hi> and <hi>Aim</hi> of his prayer is,
submission to, and rejoycing in the <hi>will of God;</hi>

as it is a blasphemy against a most <hi>divine</hi>
truth of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note> which yet <hi>the gates of Hell shall

know and have heard the slander of the multitude;
fear was on every side, while they took coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
together against me, they devised to take away
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46362:342"/>
my life: I was a reproch among mine enemies;
yea, my familiar acquaintance spake against me,
and I was a fear unto them, and they fled from
me: I am forgotten as a dead man out of

I would have you rightly <hi>understand me,</hi> but I

shall not enter seriously now upon the point:
but by the way, I would have you <hi>all</hi> know, if
God please, In brief,</p>
                        <p>1. I Affirm, from my soul, I never denied
prayer for temporal blessings (<hi>if I did,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ps. 137. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>let my
tongue cleave to my mouth</hi>) Pray for them, I say,
for all temporal blessings heartily; for I know,
that even your Graces, Faith, Hope, &amp;c. as had,
and done, and enjoyed in time, are temporal;
but these tend and relate to a <hi>better</hi> life, and to
<hi>eternity,</hi> and so are to be <hi>prized</hi> and looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But for outward blessings, or temporal bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
<hi>which you call Riches, Honor, Houses, Lands,
Wives, Children, Friends, Health, Beauty, Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>someness,
Long life;</hi> &amp;c. these are the things we
differ about: and the doubt is, we know not
what is a BLESSING, and what is not; you call
that a <hi>blessing</hi> oftentimes which God and his
truth calls a <hi>curse;</hi> and contrary, that a curse,
which God calls a blessing: Physick, though it
be <hi>bitter</hi> and <hi>unpleasing</hi> to the <hi>palate,</hi> yet <hi>tis for
your health;</hi> when that which is <hi>sweet</hi> and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to the disease, <hi>turns</hi> to destruction.</p>
                        <p>Ile tell you in brief whats a blessing, and
whats <hi>held forth</hi> by those <hi>promises</hi> made to the
<hi>children</hi> of <hi>Israel;</hi> indeed because they were
<hi>children,</hi> they took them <hi>literally; viz.</hi> All
those Promises in the 28.<note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> of <hi>Deuteronomie,
Blessed shalt thou be in the City, and blessed in the
field; blessed in the fruit of the body, thy cattel and
thy ground; blessed in thy basket, and in thy
store; blessed in thy going out and coming in, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46362:343"/>
in all thou puttest thy hand unto:</hi> Let me now tell
you, that which is held out to us there in those
outward blessings; <hi>The blessing is, viz.</hi> To enjoy
God in all, above all, and in the <hi>want</hi> of all:
and when thou canst say with <hi>David,</hi> when all
<hi>forsake</hi> thee: <hi>Make thy face to shine upon thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,

<hi>David,</hi> thou art right; there was a man <hi>who
knew the mystery</hi> of <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. he knew what a

                        <p>2. I affirm, I never denyed <hi>children</hi> to do <hi>as
children;</hi> they may and must do so, because they
are <hi>weak,</hi> and cannot go; let them have <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carts,</hi>
and <hi>Holdbies,</hi> we hope they will come to
be <hi>men</hi> in time, and then they will <hi>forsake</hi> all
those things, in <hi>affection</hi> alwayes, and in <hi>action</hi>
too, except it be (as I before said) for <hi>necessity</hi>
and <hi>charity:</hi> But if they will <hi>remain</hi> alwayes
weak, and for all the means and helps they have,
yet thrive not, I say in such cases, our <hi>cost</hi> and
<hi>labour</hi> is ill bestowed: And sometimes, some
children are so froward to those that would
use <hi>extraordinary</hi> means to strengthen their
limbs, that they may be out of hand, that they
will <hi>fight</hi> and <hi>kick</hi> with those that would do
them good: And our Saviours counsel is,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 6.</note>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46362:344"/>

and faithfulness, and not keeping back any
part of Gods counsel, have been <hi>ill-rewarded,</hi>
rent and torn for their <hi>faithful counsel:</hi> and it
hath therefore been the <hi>Serpentine</hi> Wisdom
of others, <hi>to hide their talent in a napkin,</hi> that
so they might <hi>avoid the cross of Christ,</hi> and sleep
in a whole Skin.</p>
                        <p>I remember a speech of <hi>R. Moses More Nevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim,
part 3. chap. 34. Legem accommodatam esse
ad totam gentem communiter, non ad singulos;</hi> the
Law is fitted for the people in <hi>generall,</hi> for all
the Nation, and not for particular persons only:
There was and is many a good man, who wants
those outward things, when those that are evil
have them in abundance, as well then as now:
And shall we then say and conclude, the word
or promises are not true? no, God forbid, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth shall pass away before one tittle of his
word shall fail,</hi> Mat. 5.<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 18.</note> Therefore, I say, <hi>they</hi> in
the old Testament, and also we now, mistake,
because by <hi>Moses</hi> was promised the <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
and the <hi>Land</hi> flowing with milk and honey,
temporal peace, multitude of children, bodily
health; these were in themselves temporal
blessings; but they figured out <hi>spiritual,</hi> because
these were promised but to the <hi>old</hi> man, under
the old <hi>Law;</hi> and those that look no farther
now under the Gospel, what are they better
then the old Jews, and the CHILDREN
of <hi>Israel?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. I affirm, I have alwayes holden it a <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi>

thing (especially of late years) <hi>to press God</hi>
with <hi>particulars</hi> of temporal things, as of <hi>health,
wealth, honour, &amp;c.</hi> but to leave <hi>all those things</hi> to
the will of God, walking on in our <hi>duties</hi> and
<hi>calling,</hi> and leave the <hi>success</hi> to him: But while
we are in our <hi>childish</hi> condition, we are still
telling God in this regard, <hi>what he shall do for us,</hi>
and how he shall govern the world, and when
we would have fair weather, and when rain, and
when a fair wind, and so every man would
serve his own turn; and then I pray thee, <hi>if thy
will</hi> be done, who shall take care of thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?
tis no matter, though <hi>thousands miscarry</hi>
and fail of <hi>those things;</hi> so thou hast them it
matters not: What kind of prayers (do you
think) are these? dost thou in <hi>thy self</hi> think,
God were <hi>wise</hi> if he should answer thy prayers?
that which is for thee (as thou thinkest) is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
multitudes of others, and who shall seek
their good? that wind that serves thy design,
is as much opposite for others: And therefore
my advice is, be very tender how you <hi>press</hi> the
infinite wisdom of the Almighty; Who when he
will bless, he will turn crosses and evil things
(as thou esteemest them) to be the greatest
blessings; and therefore let the Almighty <hi>Alone</hi>
in governing the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Earth,</hi> by his
power and wisdom; he hath <hi>upheld, supported,
preserved</hi> and <hi>ordered</hi> the heavens and the earth
to our knowledge, almost these six thousand
years well enough, and Ile warrant thee he
will do it still, <hi>without thy care or direction: Who

hath taught him?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I remember a speech of <hi>Bernard, Longe a Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
animus qui in oratione, &amp;c.</hi> That mind is farre
from God or Heaven, which in prayer <hi>is full of
earthly</hi> requests: And I say, for the most part,
men are mistaken both in <hi>the nature</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of
prayer, which is first to ask things according to
the will of God, and our end ought to be God,
and <hi>the things</hi> of God, in which our happiness
is involved.</p>
                        <p>4. I affirm, it is certainly more excellent <hi>to
seek the Kingdom of heaven and the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thereof,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Mat. 6. ult.</note> then to trouble God and our selves
with <hi>wordly</hi> requests: I say still, <hi>distingue tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora,</hi>
distinguish of seasons: there is a time
when we may take more liberty, because we
know no better, and we think it a great <hi>deal</hi> of
Religion, that we will <hi>acknowledge</hi> God, and
will come to him for temporal blessings: but
as the Apostle saith, <hi>Behold, I shew you a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
way;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 31.</note> 
                           <hi>covet after the best gifts:</hi> Then doth
God best accept thy prayer, when thou onely
seekest him for himself, and not when thou
seekest any other thing by or through him:
this will declare what thou lovest him for,
whether for thy self or himself: what thou
most <hi>lovest,</hi> what thou most earnestly prayest
for, and what thou most weepest for, when
wanting that thou most <hi>lovedst</hi> when thou
hadst it: but to all true believers, both in this,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46362:345"/>
as in all thinigs, God is their end, their chief
love, &amp;c. and therefore tis him they seek to
enjoy above all things; Although it be with the
loss of all things, <hi>Him</hi> they esteem <hi>Portion</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                        <p>And to conclude, I affirm, as it is said of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishai,</hi>
2 Sam. 23. 19<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23. 19.</note>. there were three most <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi>
among the <hi>thirty,</hi> but <hi>Abishai</hi> was the
most honourable of the three; therefore they
chose him their Captain: And so say I, prayer is
honourable in its <hi>time &amp; season,</hi> and seeking for
temporal blessings, according to the <hi>will of God,</hi>
but <hi>more honourable,</hi> in seeking graces to adot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>
the <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>inward man:</hi> but when in prayer
we seek God for himself, having so much <hi>love</hi>
to him, such strong desires after him, that we
<hi>forget</hi> and <hi>lose our selves,</hi> and mind onely <hi>him</hi>
as our <hi>chief</hi> end: then say I, let <hi>Abishai,</hi> let <hi>That
Prayer</hi> be Captain; for that hath done the <hi>most
honourable</hi> of all the <hi>chosen</hi> Worthies, the other
have done <hi>worthily,</hi> but this is <hi>the more Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
of all the <hi>three:</hi> for if we had time we might
shew you that there can no <hi>prayer</hi> do more
worthily then this; for it answers first to the
Lords Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 17. Secondly to Christs
Prayer, immediately before he suffered, <hi>Iohn</hi>
17. Self-denialls in his resignation to the will
of his Father, and love to his Flock, Disciples
and Members; A most <hi>ravishing</hi> prayer, and
such a prayer as no man ever prayed; but <hi>time</hi>
will not suffer me now to open any thing about
it. Thirdly, <hi>this</hi> prayer is most agreeable to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:46362:346"/>
the example of the Apostles: who under-valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the world to enjoy the life of Christ, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that they esteemed his Cross their
Throne, and his sufferings their Crown. So
that by all this we have said, you may <hi>examine</hi>
your <hi>prayers,</hi> of what <hi>excellency</hi> they be; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of your <hi>prayers,</hi> whether
they be of <hi>Flesh</hi> or <hi>spirit;</hi> whether in them you
seek God or your <hi>selves:</hi> And with the words
of the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. I conclude all,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 6.</note> for this
time, seeing God hath <hi>put it</hi> into your <hi>heart</hi> to
seek him and to <hi>worship</hi> him, <hi>Let it not be in the
Oldness of the Letter, but in the Newness of the
Spirit. So be it.</hi>

this (I hope) is not strange <hi>to you,</hi> for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<hi>Paul</hi> reciting some of these Actions, saith
plainly 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">1 Cor 10.</note> that they were but <hi>Figures</hi>
to teach us; and applies many of the passages:
and what the Apostle saith of some <hi>of them, I</hi>
may be bold <hi>by the same spirit</hi> to say <hi>of the
whole,</hi> that they were all done in <hi>Figures.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But little doth any man here think, that he
is <hi>in Egypt,</hi> and that he <hi>Toils under Pharaoh,</hi> and
that <hi>Pharaohs Taskmasters</hi> use them <hi>roughly,</hi> and
<hi>abuse</hi> them: little do they <hi>think</hi> that they are
<hi>Brick-makers:</hi> when we are <hi>yet</hi> in the Kingdom
of <hi>darkness,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 2</note> and are <hi>governed</hi> by the Prince of
<hi>darkness, by the Prince that ruleth in the ayre,
the spirit that now worketh in the children of diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;</hi>
what do you think, are we not then
worser then <hi>slaves</hi> under <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> I,
And a more <hi>real slavery</hi> then the Israelites un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent?
and are we not then <hi>imployed</hi> in his
work, and in making <hi>Brick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and <hi>Morter</hi> to <hi>raise
Temples,</hi> to set up <hi>Antichrist</hi> in to <hi>worship, serve</hi>
and <hi>adore,</hi> as doth <hi>all the world?</hi> And Truly, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one here present <hi>doth the same:</hi> But he that
will <hi>marry Achsah, Calebs</hi> daughter, as I had
occasion to shew you upon that Text, he must
<hi>smite Kiriathsepher, the City of the Letter.</hi> The
Letter of <hi>Scripture</hi> reveals nothing which will
be <hi>saving to us,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Joshua 15 15, 26.</note> it is the Spirit that must <hi>do us
good;</hi> to him shall be given <hi>Achsah,</hi> which by
interpretation is, <hi>The Rending of the Vail:</hi> As it
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:46362:348"/>
was at our Saviours Passiou: so, to this man <hi>The
Vail of the Temple shall be rent,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Mark 15. 38.</note> 
                           <hi>from the Top to the
Bottom;</hi> And he shall <hi>Have</hi> the Secrets, and
<hi>See the Secrets</hi> of God Almighty: but this <hi>He
cannot have,</hi> unless he <hi>strike</hi> the Letter, and smite
the waters, and divide them, else there is no
word of God <hi>for us,</hi> for the word lies <hi>hid,</hi> and no
man <hi>findeth it,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Exo. 14. 16.</note> but he only that <hi>smiteth Kiriath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sepher,
The City of the Letter,</hi> that it may be to
him <hi>Debir,</hi> [The Word] for that City (as I then
told you) out of <hi>Ioshua</hi> 15. 15, 16.<note place="margin">Josh. 15. 15, 16.</note> before it was
smitten by <hi>Othinel,</hi> That is, <hi>The Lords sit time</hi> or
<hi>opportunity</hi> (who took the City) it was called
<hi>Kiriathsepher,</hi> but being once <hi>Smitten,</hi> then it
was <hi>Debir,</hi> and not before: So, if we rest in the
Letter of the Word, either of the old or new
Testaments, we <hi>shall never come</hi> to make it <hi>Debir</hi>
to us, it is still the words of <hi>a book sealed up to us,</hi>
and <hi>resting</hi> therein, the letter in stead <hi>of saving
us,</hi> it will <hi>destroy us:</hi> for so saith the Apostle,
<hi>The Letter kills,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 6</note> 
                           <hi>but the Spirit gives life:</hi> if we rest
in the Letter, and think that, Or external obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
or obedience thereunto, will save us,
we are <hi>deceived,</hi> without caring and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to get that word <hi>which lasts for ever:</hi> the
history <hi>lasts not for ever;</hi> those things <hi>then done,</hi>
are <hi>done and past,</hi> but <hi>that very word lasts for ever
(i. e.)</hi> is still <hi>in doing,</hi> and concerns <hi>as much</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<hi>time,</hi> every <hi>age, sex</hi> and <hi>degree,</hi> as well as

look for true bread, true food: <hi>thousands</hi> have

meat indeed, and drink indeed, Bread from

6. Beloved, all other knowledge, let it be <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so esteemed</hi> in the world, by whomsoever,
<hi>Perishes a man</hi> if he Rest therein: As if I give a
Boy <hi>Oysters,</hi> and tell him there is <hi>meat</hi> that
will nourish him; but <hi>if he know not how</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the <hi>shell,</hi> but onely <hi>licks</hi> the outside of the
<hi>shell,</hi> and he <hi>thereby</hi> not coming at the meat, it
<hi>starves him:</hi> did not I say true, when I told
him, <hi>There was meat</hi> to <hi>feed him?</hi> and do I not
say true likewise, in saying, <hi>the Oyster killed him?</hi>
for the shell <hi>killed him,</hi> because he could not
come at <hi>the nourishment</hi> for the shell: in the same
<hi>sense,</hi> The Word, though it be full to the brim
of <hi>precious liquor,</hi> and <hi>Heavenly dainties,</hi> yet if a
man be <hi>taken up</hi> in the outside, <hi>in the shell of the
word,</hi> and never <hi>crack</hi> the shell, <hi>very fitly</hi> may
the Holy Ghost say, <hi>The Letter kills;</hi> Nay, he
that goes <hi>no further,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6</note> and rests on that, <hi>goes no
further,</hi> sees <hi>no more</hi> then the very <hi>Devils:</hi> for
they (by long custom and experience) have
gotten whatever <hi>can be known</hi> in the history, far
beyond any <hi>man</hi> upon earth.</p>
                        <p>And therefore he whose faith hath brought
him <hi>no farther</hi> then to believe <hi>in an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Christ,</hi> in that Christ that was <hi>born</hi> at <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi>

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46362:349"/>
                           <hi>wrought miracles,</hi> and was <hi>crucified, dead</hi> and <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,</hi>
and rose again, &amp;c. This man, <hi>The Letter
kills him;</hi> he knows no more, nay not so much
as the Devils themselves know and believe;
nay, I say, herein the Devils outstrip thee; the
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>so far</hi> from accounting <hi>this</hi>
any thing, that he <hi>slights</hi> the knowing <hi>any man</hi>
after the slesh;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 16.</note> 
                           <hi>Henceforth know we no man,</hi>
saith he, <hi>after the flesh; no, though we had known
Christ, yet henceforth know we him no more:</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 16.</note>
that if he had <hi>known</hi> and <hi>seen</hi> exactly
what <hi>Christ did,</hi> what <hi>he said,</hi> how <hi>he lived,</hi> how
<hi>he dyed,</hi> and how <hi>he rose</hi> again, <hi>all is</hi> nothing;
henceforth <hi>we will know him no more</hi> after this
manner; No, no, but <hi>let me know</hi> all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
his <hi>death, his life, his miracles, his passion, his
resurrection,</hi> all within me; let me know and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
them in my self: if we know him
thus, this is knowledge <hi>worth prizing indeed,</hi>
this is worth Boasting of, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 16.</note> 
                           <hi>Christ

the Jews at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) other then <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,</hi>
but <hi>in us,</hi> I must finde that he hath been
<hi>born</hi> and <hi>brought up</hi> in me, that he hath <hi>put all
the Doctors to silence</hi> within me, that he hath
<hi>wrought</hi> all his miracles in <hi>me,</hi> opened my <hi>eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi>
                           <pb n="237" facs="tcp:46362:349"/>
as he did then <hi>open the eyes of the blinde;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 46.</note> open <hi>my

out then, both <hi>dumb</hi> and <hi>deaf</hi> Devils, <hi>That there
are the same to cast out in us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If these actions be <hi>thus done</hi> in thee, as <hi>veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
as ever Christ did <hi>any</hi> of these actions in the
flesh; if <hi>this knowledge</hi> and this experience <hi>be
fixed</hi> in your mindes, and you feel the power
thereof in your hearts, then you have crackt
<hi>The Shell,</hi> you have gotten <hi>the Marrow,</hi> the <hi>Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of the word. Yet, for all this we must not
do with the Letter, as I then told you, because
it is the <hi>shell,</hi> as men usually do with the <hi>shells</hi> of
Oysters, or of Eggs; Having once the <hi>Meat,</hi>
throw away <hi>the Shells;</hi> no, no, for they are the
means to bring <hi>the Word</hi> to us; for to us, because
of our weakness, cannot <hi>this word</hi> be conveyed
<hi>without The shell,</hi> &amp; therefore our merciful God
hath bin pleased <hi>to convey it to us</hi> in earthen ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
and under Earthen resemblances, that so
we might <hi>hear it,</hi> understand and receive it.</p>
                        <p>If we look upon it, as it <hi>runs</hi> in <hi>black</hi> and
<hi>white</hi> letters, tis true; Its a <hi>Lofty Majestical</hi>
kinde of <hi>writing,</hi> That carries <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
in it, and the proof is in it self; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
other Writers are fain to bring <hi>proofs</hi> and
<hi>witnesses</hi> of the truth of that <hi>they write,</hi> whilst
this carries <hi>proof</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> in it self; and
<hi>at the best,</hi> it is <hi>no more:</hi> but he that <hi>can get within
it,</hi> He that can get into the <hi>midst of</hi> the <hi>burning
bush,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9.</note> He shall see <hi>Such spirit and life, That eye hath

not seen, ear heard, nor ever entred into mans heart
to consider:</hi> In short, he shall know what <hi>it is</hi> to
marry <hi>Achsah,</hi> To have the <hi>vail rent;</hi> and what
it is to enter into the <hi>Holiest of All.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And so <hi>of this history,</hi> concerning <hi>Moses</hi>
bringing Israel out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> To see <hi>what slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
they were in, and how <hi>Pharaohs Taskmasters</hi>
beat them, and increased their bondage, taking
away <hi>their straw</hi> and making them <hi>Toil</hi> harder
and harder,<note place="margin">Exo. 1. 12.</note> and yet the more <hi>they oppressed them,</hi>
the more they increased: I say, All this, and the
rest, in the history, runs <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Majestically,</hi>
and that is <hi>the best</hi> you can say of it; but he that
<hi>through the history,</hi> shall see that the <hi>History</hi> was
not written barely <hi>for a history,</hi> but <hi>mainly</hi> and
<hi>chiefly, for us;</hi> He shall see there is <hi>therein</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
an <hi>eternal</hi> LIVING SENSE: He that
looks <hi>within himself,</hi> shall finde all verified in
himself: And not onely <hi>This Scripture,</hi> but the

the <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>all the battels of the Kings,</hi>
and so throughout;<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 21.</note> that whatever part of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
he <hi>shall read,</hi> he shall be able to say and

accomplished in me; for the substance of all
those histories <hi>throughout,</hi> is verified <hi>to this day,</hi>
and shall be <hi>to the worlds end:</hi> It is no matter
what other <hi>Pharaoh</hi> there was, what Typical
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> there was, so we have found <hi>the True
Pharaoh;</hi> Nay it were no matter then, though
we had <hi>never heard</hi> of that <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> for that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46362:350"/>
                           <hi>Pharaoh</hi> doth but Type out unto us what the
<hi>Spiritual Pharoah</hi> is; How he labours to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and advance himself <hi>in his Kingdom,</hi> and
if any <hi>offer</hi> to go out from him, he will lay
heavy burthens upon them, He will make
them groan under service, insomuch that their
cry shall come up before the Lord; And if
they do get out from him by <hi>strong hand,</hi> it is
By <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>wonders,</hi> and he will be sure
to <hi>pursue</hi> them, till he himself be quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
in the midst of the Sea; and so he that
sought for honour and glory in overcoming
them,<note place="margin">Exo. 14. 17.</note> the Lord <hi>shall get himself a name</hi> on that
<hi>Pharaoh, and on all his Host.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And, That we may come to <hi>the history</hi> in
particular, concerning bringing Israel out of
<hi>Egypt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There be three principal things in the Chapter.
<list>
                              <item>1. The <hi>Preparation</hi> before this vision, That
<hi>Moses</hi> saw.</item>
                              <item>2. <hi>The vision it self,</hi> the bush burned, and was
not consumed.</item>
                              <item>3. The effect <hi>That followed,</hi> of the vision, <hi>viz.
Moses</hi> his Commission to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> To deliver
<hi>Israel.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. For the <hi>Preparation</hi> to the vision; that is
in the first verse, <hi>Moses kept the flock of Iethro his
father in Law, and he led the flock to the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of the desart, &amp;c. Moses,</hi> it is testified of
him in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that he was a man, <hi>mighty in
all the learning of the Egyptians,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Act. 7. 23.</note> for being
brought up as a <hi>Kings Son,</hi> he wanted <hi>for no
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:46362:351"/>
teaching</hi> in the Kingdom, For the Egyptians had
<hi>the chief learning</hi> of the world; For I must tell
you, We and all Antiquity are beholding to
the Egyptians for all their and our chief learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>in natural things.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, we must labour to see, in all the words
of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 34.</note> that <hi>the Truth,</hi> and <hi>the word of God it
self,</hi> is <hi>hid</hi> and <hi>coucht under</hi> mighty parables;
<hi>for without a parable spake he nothing unto them;</hi>
and indeed without <hi>parables</hi> can we not <hi>have</hi>
the truth: As we cannot have <hi>meat</hi> without
<hi>excrements;</hi> for in all <hi>the meat</hi> we eat, there is
abundance of <hi>excrement,</hi> to a very little nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment;
the greatest part, though never so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
and decocted, is <hi>excrement:</hi> And so I say of
the Letter, the Letter compared with the Spirit
is but the Shel, the <hi>Excrement,</hi> the outward Husk
<hi>of the word,</hi> and we have a great deal of <hi>excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and Husk and Shell (that doth us no good
at all) to a <hi>very little meat;</hi> for you know <hi>excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
doth not nourish at all; that comes away
again, <hi>and goes into the draught,</hi> as our Saviour
saith; yet we may not abhor nor undervalue
the <hi>Excrement of the Word,</hi> because it is <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
for we cannot have <hi>the meat thereof,</hi>
without <hi>Excrements;</hi> for that which is <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
doth but serve to convey the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into the body: God could not possibly
speak to us, nor convey his word but by the
Excrement of the Letter, as he hath done:
Something must be presented to our eyes
and ears externally, that we may conceive what
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:46362:351"/>
is done <hi>internally;</hi> for if Almighty God should
have spoken as he <hi>would have spoken,</hi> we should
not have been able to have <hi>heard him,</hi> for he
should have quite undone our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>As, the Sun shines to us, and gives us <hi>light</hi> at
such a <hi>distance,</hi> and through so many elements,
ayr, and clouds, and Mereors, and many such
interruptions, so many thousand miles of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which keeps his own perfect and full
lustre, glory and brightness from us; for if it
should not <hi>do so,</hi> we should be quite blinded,
and our sight destroyed by it: for we have much
ado, <hi>the strongest-sighed man that is,</hi> to behold
and look upon the Sun at that distance as it is;
what should we do then if <hi>these things,</hi> and such
a <hi>distance</hi> interposed not themselves between
<hi>our sight</hi> and <hi>the Sun?</hi> So if our great and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God should <hi>speak</hi> to us in a <hi>spiritual way,</hi>
and as himself would speak, if he should shine
into us <hi>in the least part of his own splendor</hi> and
<hi>glory,</hi> all our sights, all our apprehensions of
him, would be quite <hi>put out;</hi> he would utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destroy our sight, and we should be quite
swallowed up; for we cannot possibly see God,
nor hear God, but onely <hi>in that way</hi> that he hath
<hi>already</hi> spoken to us.</p>
                        <p>But happy is <hi>that man,</hi> who gets not the <hi>excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but <hi>the nourishment</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> And
I pray you for all this which I have said, To
magnifie the Spirit above the Letter, let us <hi>be
so far from</hi> throwing <hi>away</hi> the Letter, that you
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46362:352"/>
rather <hi>infinitely</hi> bless God for it, and be very
thankful to him, that he hath so far condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to stoop so low to our weak capacities, that
we may come <hi>as we are able, to receive</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of him, who is our happiness, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life: O praise his infinite goodness for ever,
that the <hi>Mighty, Strong, Infinite, Wise Creator,</hi>
hath been pleased so far to <hi>abase</hi> himself, as to
deal with us <hi>as with Babes,</hi> for we are no better;
That HE the Mighty Jehovah is become
weak to the weak, that he hath made himself
<hi>a Babe</hi> to us <hi>Babes:</hi> Oh! be <hi>amazed</hi> and <hi>astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
at it for ever, and fall down continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his <hi>footstool</hi> with all <hi>trembling</hi> and fear. St.
<hi>Paul,</hi>

that</hi> he could not speak unto them as
<hi>spiritual</hi> men: how then could God himself
speak to them as <hi>spiritual,</hi> or they to bear His
words? If we cannot bear the words of a <hi>weak
frail man,</hi> how is it possible to bear the words
of God Himself?</p>
                        <p>As the Poets fain of <hi>their</hi> God <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and
his Wife <hi>Iuno;</hi> a certain woman desiring of
<hi>Iuno</hi> that she might but lie with <hi>Iupiter</hi> in all
his glory and majesty; she answered, O wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man!
thou hast asked thine own destruction;
but she persisting in her desire, and having her
request granted, presuming upon her own
strength: And as soon as ever <hi>Iupiter</hi> drew near,
she was presently made in to powder; Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby, <hi>thus much</hi> unto the people, that
the true God was infinite, and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:46362:352"/>
For let me tell you, they intended as
much, as ignorant as you conceive them to be,
though to the common people they spake after
this manner, Covertly, by similitudes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons;
For, there was not one of all the
learned, but knew that <hi>such a One</hi> must the true
God be; Neither let us be <hi>so simple</hi> as to think,
that they thought <hi>these to be</hi> Gods; Or that
their Gods and Goddesses were <hi>so wicked</hi> as to
be <hi>Adulterers,</hi> or the like; They were not so
sottish; but they hid and couched the Truth
under these shadows: So God Almighty, even
Our God, who is the true God, if he should
speak unto us, as he is in himself, what crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
could stand before him? he would speak
<hi>all the world</hi> to powder, to nothing; for if he
had pleased, he could have spoke <hi>All Truth in
One Word,</hi> but where had been Auditors to
have <hi>heard or understood</hi> that word?</p>
                        <p>As when the people <hi>murmured</hi> against <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Numb. 16. 3.</note> and were divided against them, and
for them, They thought that all the people of
God were <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> took too
much upon them, and God could speak by
them, <hi>as well</hi> as by <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Exod. 16. 19.</note> but as soon
as God began to shew himself in his power and
majesty, they all trembled and were not able
to stand before him; and again, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
thought they would <hi>go</hi> up to the mountain
as well as <hi>Moses:</hi> Well, saith <hi>Moses, if ye will,</hi>
do; but as soon they drew near to the foot of
the <hi>mountain,</hi> and the storms began but to arise.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46362:353"/>
and they <hi>heard</hi> the thunder, and the lightnings,
and the terrible noise, and the trumpets sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
louder and louder, then they began to
tremble and fear,<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 16.</note> and prayed that God would
not speak unto them; <hi>lest we dye,</hi> said they;
but let <hi>Moses</hi> speak to us, for we can Hear,
Him.</p>
                        <p>Brethren, know this for an undeniable truth,
that in Gods word, there is <hi>such a depth of</hi>
light, and of glory, Such ravishing <hi>profoundness,</hi>
That will <hi>serve</hi> all the men that <hi>ever</hi> were, are,
&amp; <hi>shall be, yea all the Divines</hi> and People of God
through all <hi>generations,</hi> nay and adde to them
<hi>all the Angels in</hi> heaven, to <hi>pry,</hi> and <hi>dive</hi> into,
through all eternity, and yet shall <hi>never</hi> be able
to find out the bottom, and the Vast, stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
depth thereof: But (as I say) God is <hi>pleased</hi>
for our <hi>capacities,</hi> to give us <hi>these things,</hi> hid
<hi>under a vail;</hi> That he may give us The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
He is faine to give us with it the
<hi>Excrement,</hi> which he would not do, if we could
receive the Nutriment alone. For saith the
Apostle, <hi>Till this day, while Moses is read, they
have still the vail over their heart;</hi> In the outside
of the Letter, you see <hi>nothing but the Vail</hi> of
Gods word;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 15.</note> and the truth is, <hi>concerning</hi> some,
God hath <hi>commanded, Make their eyes heavy, and
their ears dull,</hi>

                           <hi>lest they should see with their eyes,
and hear with their ears, and understand with their
heart, and be converted, and I should heal them:
that in seeing they may see, and not perceive; and
hearing they may hear, and not understand:</hi> That
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46362:353"/>
is, And I will be bold to give the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That <hi>seeing the Letter,</hi> they may not see
<hi>the Life;</hi> that <hi>hearing the words,</hi> they may not
understand <hi>the Living sense.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having <hi>premised</hi> this, let us now come and
take inpieces some part <hi>of these words</hi> nowread,
that we may come <hi>to eat of the bread of life,</hi> and

                           <hi>And Moses kept the sheep of Iethro his father in
Law, the Priest of Midian and he led the stock to the

that the Holy Ghost <hi>doth describe Moses</hi> to
be a Sheep-keeper, setting down so expresly
that particular; and still <hi>all the Patriarchs</hi> are
described to be <hi>Sheep-keepers;</hi> certainly there
is <hi>something</hi> to be observed and learned <hi>from
Shepherds,</hi> because <hi>Shepherds</hi> are oftner
mentioned then <hi>husbandmen,</hi> and not onely the
men preferred <hi>before them,</hi> but all their actions
also are preferred before the others. <hi>Cain</hi> was a
<hi>Husbandman, Abel</hi> was a <hi>Sheepkeeper,</hi> they both
<hi>offered sacrifice,</hi> one of his <hi>cattel,</hi> the other of
his <hi>ground,</hi> but the <hi>Shepherds</hi> offering was
<hi>preferred</hi> before the <hi>Husbandmans:</hi> and so all
the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> are <hi>commended</hi> for being <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psal. 78. 71.</note>
and following that <hi>trade:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> he

                        </p>
                        <p>Well, we need not to instance any further;
What may be <hi>the meaning of</hi> the Holy Ghost
in all this? in one word I will tell you what <hi>a
Shepherd</hi> is; A Shepherd is one that lives
<hi>meerly</hi> and most <hi>properly</hi> by the <hi>providence</hi> and
blessing of God upon his <hi>Trade;</hi> for they fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and increase onely upon Gods will, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and providence: He acts not much, but
resigns up his will, &amp; all he hath to God <hi>onely,</hi> &amp;
depends <hi>altogether</hi> upon that; but a <hi>husbandman</hi>
is he, who with <hi>his expectation</hi> of Gods blessing,
joyns <hi>his own endeavours, plowing, sowing, reaping,</hi>
changing <hi>his ground,</hi> rising <hi>early,</hi> and going <hi>to
bed late;</hi> Well, I pray is there any hurt in all
this? No, I forbid them not <hi>to do</hi> so, but this I
say; a Shepherds life is preferred <hi>with God</hi>
far before <hi>a</hi> Husbandmans, because, he that hath
<hi>given up</hi> all to God, all that ever he <hi>can do,</hi> or
<hi>say,</hi> or <hi>think</hi> his whole man is Resigned to God,
confessing that they are <hi>nothing,</hi> that they can
do nothing, and from their very souls acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
(and not in words onely;) they have
<hi>no wit,</hi> no <hi>reason,</hi> no <hi>will,</hi> no <hi>understanding,</hi> their
<hi>whole man,</hi> all that they are or can do, is wholly
<hi>resigned up</hi> to God, and his will; Nor will they
joyn any of their works with Gods, but let God
<hi>act all do all, think all, speak all</hi> in them.</p>
                        <p>This is the life of <hi>a true Shepherd,</hi> who hath
his eye <hi>single, on God,</hi> and looks to him in every
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:46362:354"/>
thing; let him <hi>increase</hi> his stock, or <hi>decrease</hi>
it, he is all one, he is nothing grieved at the
one, nor lifted up with the other, because <hi>he
accounts</hi> nothing he hath <hi>his own,</hi> Nor doth he
think, That he lives by his own <hi>taking care,</hi> or
by his own <hi>industry,</hi> but depends <hi>meerly</hi> on the
blessings of God, and the works of nature: but
the other, They moil and Toil <hi>themselves,</hi> They
must <hi>do</hi> something; and this ye cannot beat
out of them; they must joyn their wits and
their doings with Gods, and do not <hi>ascribe</hi> all
to God, while they do it, As do the other;
And therefore Shepherds are accepted with
God <hi>far before</hi> Husbandmen; the one doth
think verily <hi>his own care</hi> and <hi>industry</hi> is the staff
of his life, They cannot <hi>deny all,</hi> give up all that
they are and can do; They cannot but think
(say what ye will) but they have some power,
some wisdom, some understanding, some abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to bring about their actions; but the other,
<hi>The truly Resigned man,</hi> he sees and <hi>acknowledges
as the</hi> truth is,<note place="margin">Ps. 62. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>That God alone doth All,</hi> And that
His is all the power, all the might, all the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and he hath nothing <hi>at all;</hi> he will not
by any means obscure or <hi>darken Gods power,</hi> nor
his <hi>wisdom,</hi> nor his <hi>praise,</hi> as the <hi>Husbandman</hi>
doth; Though perhaps they may say (in words)
it is their <hi>endeavours,</hi> and the <hi>blessing of God</hi>
thereupon: and then they think they have
made up all; when indeed in their hearts, in
their thoughts, and in their practises they do
not give God his praise and glory: but <hi>sacrifice
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:46362:355"/>
to their own nets,</hi> to their own wisdom, power
and parts. And in effectwith them, Tis MAN

It is a life so contrary to them, that

prefers them sbove <hi>All kind of men,</hi> insomuch
that he is pleased to stile himself <hi>The God

                           <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 17.</note> Beloved, which of you
by all your care, and pains and rising early, can
adde the least tittle, or the least jot unto his
health, or wealth, or honour, or credit in any
thing? no not one hairs breadth? but all you
have, be it <hi>little</hi> or <hi>much,</hi> it is meerly by the will

<hi>thy taking thought</hi> cannot adde one whit,

Not thy <hi>not taking</hi> thought, cannot <hi>diminish</hi> one

                        <p>But I know <hi>flesh and blood</hi> can never <hi>believe</hi> this
though God himself hath spoken it; and till

                        <p>But see, Beloved, and it may be some of you
may be convinced too, what a <hi>boundless</hi> truth
<hi>Moses</hi> hath here couched under two or three
words; that which he doth but only <hi>glance</hi> at
and <hi>glide</hi> by; take notice what a <hi>little</hi> touch he
gives at such a <hi>mass</hi> of <hi>Endless</hi> and <hi>unconceivable</hi>
truth: When you have forsaken, (in one word,)
your selves, that is, all that your <hi>eyes</hi> can <hi>see,</hi> or
your <hi>ears</hi> can <hi>hear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> or your <hi>heart</hi> can <hi>think,</hi> and
<hi>stript your selves</hi> of all <hi>stark naked,</hi> then you may
look to find God &amp; to see Him as he is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
&amp; consequently truth, but not before. And
truly <hi>this work</hi> being done <hi>in the soul,</hi> there is
<hi>such a miracle wrought,</hi> as none but <hi>only</hi> the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of God <hi>could do:</hi> He that thinks <hi>ever</hi> by his
own power to bring it about, is utterly deceived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is a <hi>great</hi> question now adays, Whether
<hi>miracles</hi> be ceased <hi>now,</hi> or no? But it shews
that such men have little experience of these
Divine, sublime truths: It is a most <hi>foolish,</hi>
ridiculous <hi>question</hi> to him who enjoys these
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46362:358"/>
things; for he sees there are <hi>as great miracles</hi>
done now <hi>every day,</hi> as ever was done <hi>since the
world</hi> stood; but the <hi>fault</hi> is in us, <hi>we</hi> see them
not, <hi>our eyes</hi> are <hi>blinded</hi> that we can see <hi>no mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi>
Oh! were they but <hi>open,</hi> we should see <hi>such
miracles</hi> as would make <hi>all the understandings</hi> of
Men and Angels <hi>stand amazed,</hi> and <hi>a thousand
times greater</hi> then ever any that Christ did in
the flesh.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him
in the midst of a burning bush;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>and behold, the bush
burned, and was not consumed.</hi> In these bare li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
words, there is <hi>a mighty miracle;</hi> yet there
is hid in them a miracle <hi>far transcending</hi> this
<hi>outward miracle;</hi> there is <hi>couched</hi> in them an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse,</hi>
hidden <hi>sense:</hi> One would wonder to what
<hi>purpose</hi> God should shew such a miracle <hi>of this
nature,</hi> A burning bush, and not <hi>consumed:</hi> What
did this concern <hi>the work</hi> God Almighty was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
namely, to bring the <hi>Israelites</hi> from under
<hi>Pharaohs bondage,</hi> and grievous <hi>slavery?</hi> Yet it
being <hi>opened</hi> and <hi>unfolded,</hi> you may see <hi>how fit</hi> it
was every way, upon this occasion.</p>
                        <p>As for instance,<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 16.</note> That of <hi>Iacobs</hi> vision. <hi>Iacob,</hi>
when he was to leave <hi>his Fathers house,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
<hi>all his kindred,</hi> and <hi>friends,</hi> never looking to
<hi>see</hi> them again; &amp; he was to walk a <hi>long tedious</hi>
way, and <hi>un-inhabited,</hi> as the world was in <hi>those
times;</hi> he having many <hi>sad</hi> thoughts, and knew
not <hi>what he should do,</hi> nor what should befall
him, having gone <hi>one dayes journey;</hi> and <hi>meeting
with</hi> no lodging <hi>at night,</hi> but weary as he was,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46362:358"/>
                           <hi>lay down</hi> in the <hi>open</hi> field; and having nothing
<hi>to lay</hi> his head on, he gathered a <hi>heap</hi> of stones,
and laid his head on them (a hard <hi>pillow,</hi> as you
may well think) yet at last (it should seem) fell
asleep, and dreamed <hi>such a dream</hi> as never was
<hi>dreamed</hi> on a pillow of <hi>Down:</hi> And his dream
was,<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 12.</note> he saw <hi>a Ladder reach from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
and God himself <hi>stood at the top of the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and the Angels of God <hi>were ascending and
descending</hi> on it: But, as I said of this vision to
<hi>Moses, What was all this to</hi> Jacob? this seems <hi>not
suitable</hi> to his <hi>necessity</hi> at that time. One would
think, that if God had appeared to him, and
said, <hi>Iacob, I will be with thee,</hi> I will <hi>provide</hi> for
thee; <hi>take no thought,</hi> I will be <hi>thy God,</hi> thou
shalt <hi>want</hi> for nothing; though thou hast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
<hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>all,</hi> yet fear not,
I will be <hi>all in all</hi> to thee. This, or else <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what</hi>
to this purpose, had been more fit for <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi>
condition.</p>
                        <p>Beloved, Whatever it seems <hi>to be</hi> in the
History, <hi>in the Mystery</hi> it was the <hi>suitablest,</hi> the
<hi>fittest,</hi> the <hi>seasonablest</hi> vision that could <hi>possibly</hi>
have been <hi>revealed</hi> to him: namely, to let <hi>Iacob
see,</hi> that while <hi>all the Creatures</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<hi>Earth,</hi> which are <hi>Gods Angels,</hi> or <hi>Messengers,</hi> and
do his will, and all go of his <hi>errands, He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
holds the <hi>Ladder</hi> at the top; they all <hi>come
from him,</hi> and they all <hi>return</hi> to him again:
And not only so, but he being their <hi>essence,</hi> their
<hi>being,</hi> their <hi>life,</hi> their <hi>motion,</hi> they are all <hi>moved</hi>
and <hi>actuated</hi> by him <hi>Himself;</hi> there is <hi>not one
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46362:359"/>
Creature,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psal. 103. 21.</note> not one of these Angels or <hi>Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi>
but doth <hi>his will;</hi> and he is <hi>with them,</hi> in
what part of the <hi>Ladder</hi> soever they are; if they
be in the <hi>middle,</hi> or <hi>bottom,</hi> or <hi>at the top,</hi> yet they
are not <hi>absent</hi> from him, but he <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>guides</hi>
them all to do <hi>his work which he appoints them to
do.</hi> Now, my Brethren, this being <hi>fixed</hi> in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi>
mind, that <hi>every Creature</hi> was <hi>formed, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated</hi>
and <hi>moved</hi> by God himself; and that not
any one of them could do <hi>any thing</hi> to him, nor
he could want nothing, but a supply was at
hand, because he commanded it, because <hi>he</hi> was
so <hi>near</hi> it, he was <hi>in it:</hi> This was that which
<hi>comforted</hi> Jacob <hi>in all</hi> his journey, That <hi>whatever
he met withal,</hi> or <hi>wheresoever he was,</hi> he still had
recourse to what <hi>his vision taught him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And so likewise in this <hi>vision</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> it was
<hi>the fittest</hi> that could have been <hi>shewed</hi> him upon
<hi>this occasion,</hi> and <hi>in this business,</hi> which he was to
go upon. Now you may observe three kinds
of Miracles, to three several divisions of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                        <p>1. To <hi>Moses,</hi> and that onely this <hi>One,</hi> the <hi>bush
burned,</hi> and was not <hi>consumed:</hi> and this was <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi>
to work upon <hi>Moses,</hi> and to encourage
him to his work. But,</p>
                        <p>2. The <hi>Israelites,</hi> they will not <hi>beleive</hi> for <hi>one</hi>
miracle, but they must have <hi>three</hi> miracles. But,</p>
                        <p>3. The <hi>Egyptians, ten miracles</hi> would not
work upon them; <hi>something</hi> is included <hi>in
this:</hi> For <hi>Moses</hi> being a man <hi>Near God,</hi> being
a <hi>Shepherd</hi> already, he had in part <hi>resigned up
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46362:359"/>
himself</hi> to God, and therefore one miracle was
enough to make him believe; for as soon as
ever <hi>he saw it,</hi> and God called unto him, and
said, <hi>Moses, Moses,</hi> he <hi>presently</hi> answers Gods
<hi>call, Here am I Lord:</hi> but <hi>Israel</hi> being <hi>further off</hi>
from God,<note place="margin">Ver. 4.</note> having been long in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were
so well <hi>accustomed</hi> there, &amp; also to their <hi>slavery,</hi>
that they had as live <hi>remain</hi> there still as <hi>depart;</hi>
therefore before they could be <hi>perswaded</hi> to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
and follow <hi>Moses,</hi> there must be three
miracles wrought. 1. <hi>Moses threw down his
Rod,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Exod. 4. 3.</note> and it became a <hi>Serpent;</hi> then he took it
up by the <hi>tail,</hi> and it became a <hi>Rod</hi> again. 2.
He put his hand into <hi>his bosome,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ver. 7.</note> and pulling it
out, it became <hi>leprous;</hi> and <hi>putting</hi> in his hand
again, and <hi>pulling</hi> it out, it <hi>became as his other
flesh.</hi> 3. Says God, <hi>If they will not believe for
the first, nor for the second miracle, for the third
they shall believe: Take up of the water of the
brook,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ver. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>and pour it on the ground, and it shall turn
into blood:</hi> These being further removed from
God, God did not <hi>live</hi> in them, he was <hi>exalted</hi>
in them, as he was in <hi>Moses,</hi> but was as dead
and buried in them, and to them.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>ten,</hi> and <hi>ten to that,</hi> can never <hi>work upon</hi>
the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> Those that will <hi>live</hi> and <hi>die E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi>
all the miracles in the world <hi>can never</hi>
make them believe: <hi>Moses,</hi> he said <hi>at once,
Lord, here I am;</hi> he was <hi>ready</hi> to obey God;
and the <hi>Israelites, they answered</hi> at three times:
But <hi>some</hi> there are that are so <hi>hardned</hi> in their
<hi>own</hi> ways, and <hi>so frozen on their dregs,</hi> that let
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46362:360"/>
God <hi>do</hi> what he will <hi>with them,</hi> let him strike
them with <hi>sickness, famine, plague, pestilence,</hi> what
he will, yet it doth <hi>no good</hi> upon them, they will
<hi>never</hi> let the <hi>Israelites</hi> go,<note place="margin">Exod. 9. ult.</note> 
                           <hi>to serve the Lord:</hi> but
if they do, they will <hi>pursue them,</hi> and never
leave them till they themselves are <hi>drowned</hi> in
the <hi>Sea,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ibid. 14. 23.</note> and <hi>utterly</hi> destroyed.</p>
                        <p>Now for the <hi>vision</hi> it self in hand, <hi>And the bush
burned and was not consumed;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note> A strange miracle
that a <hi>bush</hi> should be <hi>all over</hi> of a <hi>red, glowing</hi>
fire, <hi>all a day,</hi> and not <hi>consume:</hi> Indeed <hi>trees</hi>
that have stood <hi>close</hi> together, by the <hi>violence</hi> of
wind <hi>rushing</hi> them together, have been known
to <hi>set on fire;</hi> but then <hi>they consumed:</hi> but who
ever saw <hi>wood</hi> on <hi>fire,</hi> a whole day <hi>together,</hi> and
not <hi>consume? Moses</hi> it seemeth, at first, took no
<hi>great</hi> notice of it; but seeing it <hi>burn</hi> all day,
and not <hi>consume, I will turn aside</hi> (saith he) <hi>and
see</hi> what the reason is, <hi>and see this great sight, why
the bush burneth,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ver. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>and is not consumed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But before I come to the <hi>vision</hi> it self, here
is yet one thing that will <hi>detain us,</hi> and <hi>I fear</hi>
for the <hi>whole</hi> time of the these <hi>few minutes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
us: but God may offer <hi>ere long</hi> another
<hi>opportunity</hi> for to speak of the vision it self. It
is said in this second verse, That <hi>the Angel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to Moses in the midst of the bush;</hi> and in the
<hi>verses</hi> following it is said <hi>to be</hi> the Lord God:
how could <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> be an <hi>Angel</hi> and
<hi>God</hi> too?<note place="margin">Ver. 14.</note> 
                           <hi>Tell the Children of Israel, I AM hath
sent you unto them;</hi> Which <hi>name</hi> can belong to <hi>no
Creature,</hi> but is proper onely to God <hi>Almighty.</hi>
                           <pb n="259" facs="tcp:46362:360"/>
And again, you know in all the <hi>Old</hi> Testament,
when any <hi>Angel</hi> appeared to <hi>any</hi> man, if they
<hi>fell down</hi> and <hi>worshipped</hi> them, never any man
was <hi>blamed:</hi> but St. <hi>Iohn</hi> did but <hi>offer</hi> to fall
down <hi>to worship</hi> the Angel that had <hi>shewed him</hi>
all those <hi>visions,</hi> and he was forbidden; <hi>See thou
do it not, for I am thy fellow-servant; worship God.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 9.</note>
What may be the reason of this? was there any
<hi>difference</hi> between the <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi> Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>New?</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Obj.</note> No certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
The truth is this, and that which will <hi>bear</hi>
the touch, and the <hi>trial</hi> against <hi>all</hi> opposition;
That <hi>every Creature</hi> is an <hi>Angel,</hi> a <hi>Messenger</hi> of
God <hi>Almighties;</hi> not the greatest nor the <hi>least</hi>
nor <hi>meanest</hi> that is, but is one of Gods <hi>Angels</hi>
or <hi>Messengers;</hi> and being so, He is the <hi>Essence</hi>
and <hi>Being</hi> of every <hi>Creature,</hi> The <hi>Substance</hi> of all
things: Insomuch that nothing can have a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
but onely <hi>Himself.</hi> No Creature can say
I AM.</p>
                        <p>If he <hi>were not so,</hi> how could God say, <hi>I am,</hi>
if any <hi>Creature</hi> could say <hi>so, Truly</hi> of it self?
And God is <hi>so</hi> the <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> of all <hi>things,</hi>
not onely as most men affirm and believe, an
<hi>Essence</hi> giving <hi>Being</hi> to all things: so as <hi>every
thing</hi> hath no <hi>Being</hi> in it self, but <hi>from</hi> him, and
<hi>of</hi> him: but he is the <hi>Essence</hi> of the <hi>Essence;</hi>
He is the <hi>Being</hi> of the <hi>Being;</hi> for he it is onely,
that is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 8.</note> the <hi>first</hi> and the <hi>last;</hi>

                        <p>God being <hi>the Substance</hi> and <hi>Form of all things,</hi>

hearken <hi>to none</hi> of them, let <hi>them</hi> be who
they <hi>will</hi> be; know this is truth, He is in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<hi>Essentially,</hi> but <hi>we see him not so,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we <hi>think him</hi> not so. That we see him <hi>not
so,</hi> the fault is not in <hi>God;</hi> for he is <hi>the same</hi> in
all <hi>places,</hi> and through all <hi>ages:</hi> but the fault is
<hi>in our selves,</hi> we are so <hi>weak-sighted</hi> we <hi>cannot</hi> see
him.</p>
                        <p>As suppose I speak to these three several
<hi>Creatures,</hi> to a <hi>man,</hi> to a <hi>dog,</hi> and to a <hi>stone;</hi> the
<hi>man</hi> he hears my <hi>voyce,</hi> and <hi>understands</hi> me what
I mean; the <hi>dog</hi> hears, but he <hi>understands</hi> not;
but the <hi>stone,</hi> it doth neither: And if you should
ask the <hi>Stone</hi> what I said (supposing there were
a <hi>possibility</hi> of answering therein) it would say,
I <hi>spake</hi> not at all; if you ask the <hi>dog,</hi> he would
say, I heard <hi>a voice, a noise,</hi> but he said <hi>nothing:</hi>
but ask the <hi>man,</hi> and he would tell you <hi>That I
spake,</hi> and <hi>What I spake:</hi> Was it therefore <hi>true,</hi>
that which the <hi>dog</hi> and the <hi>stone</hi> affirmed? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they either <hi>understood</hi> not, or <hi>heard</hi> not;
or Was the fault <hi>in me</hi> they <hi>heard</hi> not or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not? No, the fault is in themselves; for
I did <hi>speak,</hi> and spoke sense, but they had not a
<hi>capability of hearing and apprehending.</hi> So, God
shines <hi>Gloriously,</hi> and <hi>Majestically,</hi> and <hi>Super-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altedly</hi>
in all <hi>his Creatures:</hi> but, if we see him
not so, blame not God, and say, He is <hi>not so,</hi> nor
<hi>He is not there</hi> because you see him not, nor
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:46362:362"/>
cannot <hi>apprehend</hi> him there: but blame your
own <hi>ignorance,</hi> your own <hi>blindness;</hi> for, God is
as much <hi>in one</hi> as <hi>in another;</hi> he cannot be <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>
in one, and not in <hi>another,</hi> but <hi>the same</hi> in
all.</p>
                        <p>And God being <hi>there,</hi> he cannot be without
<hi>All His</hi> Accoutrements, of <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Glory;</hi>
Al His <hi>Glorious Attributes</hi> attend him whereever
he is, And he cannot be Sequestred from them,
nor they from him: And if God hath <hi>opened</hi> your
eyes <hi>so far,</hi> as to see him Thus, <hi>in all Creatures,</hi> Do
not offer to take from him <hi>His Glory,</hi> or <hi>Greatness,</hi>
as if God, <hi>where-ever</hi> he is, could want His <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and <hi>All-sufficiency, &amp;c.</hi> As, my <hi>whole soul</hi> is
in my whole body, and the <hi>whole</hi> is in every
<hi>part</hi> and <hi>member</hi> of my <hi>body;</hi> yet my soul <hi>sees
not</hi> in my ears, but there it <hi>hears,</hi> yet the <hi>same</hi>
soul doth see in my eyes: And though my soul
<hi>tasts not</hi> in my nose, but <hi>smels,</hi> yet <hi>the same soul</hi>
doth the same <hi>action</hi> in another <hi>member;</hi> and so
of all the rest: For there is not one <hi>soul</hi> in my
<hi>ears,</hi> another in my <hi>eyes,</hi> but all <hi>one</hi> &amp; the same;
but it works <hi>diversly</hi> in divers <hi>members:</hi> So <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi>
God hath not <hi>one property</hi> in himself in
one Creature, and another in <hi>another,</hi> but he is
<hi>One</hi> and the <hi>Same</hi> in all, as he is in himself: If
he be <hi>gloriously</hi> present in the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and
<hi>Stars,</hi> he is as gloriously present in the least <hi>pill</hi>
of grass, in the least <hi>particle</hi> of dust; but he
works <hi>diversly</hi> in divers <hi>Creatures,</hi> yet he in
himself is <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>Same.</hi> And because <hi>we
cannot</hi> see him so, let us not say <hi>he is not</hi> so,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:46362:362"/>
but blame <hi>our selves</hi> we see him <hi>not</hi> so.</p>
                        <p>For were a mans eyes but <hi>opened,</hi> as <hi>Elisha</hi> his

as well as <hi>then,</hi> but <hi>his eyes were not opened;</hi> It is

prayed God <hi>to open</hi> his servants <hi>eyes,</hi> that <hi>he
might See;</hi> The <hi>alteration</hi> was not in the <hi>place,</hi>
but in <hi>Gehazies eyes:</hi> And so of <hi>Balaam,</hi> because
he did not see the <hi>Angel</hi> a great while, it was
not because the <hi>Angel</hi> was not <hi>there,</hi> for the
Angel was there before,<note place="margin">Num. 22.</note> but <hi>Balaams eyes</hi> were
not <hi>open</hi> to see him <hi>there.</hi> So were our eyes but

for he is there <hi>already;</hi> our eyes <hi>want</hi> but

we see him <hi>as well</hi> in every Creature as in

                           <hi>vail'd</hi> in every place; <hi>Accidents</hi> cloath him;
he is <hi>cloathed</hi> in all Creatures, and <hi>all Creatures</hi>

and all that you can <hi>name, think</hi> or <hi>imagine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And knowing God thus to be the <hi>Essence</hi> and

seeing and beholding him in it, <hi>fall down</hi>

so you worship not the <hi>contracted</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but the <hi>Incontractible, Incomprehensible</hi> God.
And this was the reason the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi>
were not <hi>blamed,</hi> and did not sin in <hi>falling
down</hi> to Angels, because they worshipped not
them, but the infinite God at that instant, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to be in that creature; for <hi>Abraham</hi>
and the rest intimate so much, <hi>Let not the Lord
be angry; shall not the judge of all the earth do
right?</hi> They knew that God was <hi>invisible; onely</hi>
they took occasion upon the sight <hi>of the visible
Angel,</hi> to worship the <hi>invisible</hi> God: for had <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
had <hi>A Thought</hi> of worshiping <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi>
or any thing below God, he had committed
Idolatry; have patience (I pray you) I shall
clear out this truth also.</p>
                        <p>For hence is the <hi>Error</hi> of the Papists, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:46362:364"/>
they think the infinite God can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
or <hi>represented</hi> by any manner of <hi>figure</hi>
or <hi>form:</hi> and this was the fault of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who
would have <hi>worshipped</hi> that Angel that had shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him <hi>those</hi> visions: but (I say) The <hi>soul</hi> that
can see God <hi>Almighty,</hi> not <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>bounded</hi> in
any creature, or <hi>in any form</hi> whatsoever (but
<hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>unbounded</hi> above all <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>forms,</hi>
The <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Forms, filling every thing,</hi> and yet
not <hi>comprehended</hi> by any thing) may in <hi>a holy</hi>
and <hi>reverent</hi> manner fall down aud <hi>worship</hi> this
<hi>Infinite God:</hi> And therefore (I say) the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi>
doing so, were not <hi>blamed;</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> was
forbidden; and if he had <hi>done it,</hi> he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<hi>Idolatry:</hi> The <hi>one</hi> worships God in his
<hi>Infinite, Immense, Glorious</hi> Being, as abstracted
from all <hi>creatures:</hi> the other worships him <hi>as

                        </p>
                        <p>So in this sense, <hi>Moses</hi> here <hi>in</hi> this place, when
he calls God by the Name of <hi>An Angel,</hi> he hath
relation to the <hi>burning</hi> Bush: not that God is
that <hi>burning Bush,</hi> but infinitely <hi>above</hi> and <hi>beyond</hi>
it: for when he <hi>speaks</hi> of God <hi>in himself,</hi> he
hath <hi>no relation</hi> at all to any burning <hi>Bush,</hi> or any
figure,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 32.</note> but as <hi>Abstracted</hi> and above all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
and so he is the <hi>God of Abraham, the
God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob:</hi> but take
him <hi>Concretely,</hi> as <hi>included</hi> or represented in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
creature, <hi>so</hi> it is <hi>Idolatry:</hi> But if in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sense, then ye <hi>worship</hi> him after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Patriarchs. Beloved, I <hi>beat upon</hi>
these things <hi>the more,</hi> and the <hi>larger,</hi> because I
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:46362:364"/>
would fain have you understand me: and it
may be this may <hi>seem</hi> to you an <hi>Error,</hi> or a
<hi>Novelty</hi> at least, till you have eaten it, and <hi>chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the cud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> and <hi>debated it</hi> in your own <hi>souls:</hi> but to
have a thought of worshipping God as includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in any creature, or representing him in
regard of his Essence; to justifie worshipping of
Images, I abhor, and curse all such thoughts to
the pit of hell: and surely you cannot have such
a thought of me; for this is the very thing, I so
much endeavour to perswade you from.</p>
                        <p>But for instance, <hi>There is</hi> the Sun that shines in
at this window, yet (you know) that is not the
Sun, but <hi>a beam</hi> from the <hi>Sun,</hi> though <hi>I lye not</hi> in
saying <hi>the Sun</hi> is there: for that could not be
<hi>there</hi> without the <hi>Sun,</hi> yet it is not the real
Sun: and in seeing that, I do not <hi>see</hi> the
Sun: yet if I desire <hi>to see</hi> the Sun in this room,
and were loth to go out of doors, <hi>let me</hi> but lay
my <hi>eye</hi> in that <hi>beam,</hi> to see whence it comes,
and I should see <hi>the Sun:</hi> it self; for <hi>that beam,</hi> it
goes <hi>directly</hi> to the <hi>Sun:</hi> for if I were in <hi>a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,</hi>
though <hi>thirty miles</hi> deep in the ground, if
the Sun could but <hi>shine in</hi> at any <hi>cleft</hi> or <hi>pin-hole,</hi>
though the <hi>Dungeon</hi> were never so dark, yet if
I lay my eye <hi>in that beam,</hi> I should behold the
<hi>face of the Sun:</hi> Even so it is with Almighty
God; there is in every Creature a <hi>beam</hi> that
comes from him, which is the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Essence</hi>
of the Creature; Now if we shall fall down
and worship that <hi>Beam,</hi> as simply considered,
as contracted and <hi>included</hi> in the Creature, this
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:46362:365"/>
were <hi>sin:</hi> but if I lay my eye in that <hi>beam,</hi> I shall
see it leads me to the <hi>Eternal, One, Immutable,
Incircumscriptible, Iuconceivable Essence</hi> of the
<hi>Divine</hi> BEING; And that Angel beholds
the <hi>very face</hi> of God Almighty. Hence you
may learn to interpret that place where our
Saviour commands,<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>Take heed ye despise not, nor
offend one of these little ones; for their Angels al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
behold the face of your Father which is in
Heaven:</hi> Not that it is lawful to worship that
<hi>beam</hi> or Angel, but He alone from whence that
<hi>Beam</hi> comes, who is farre above every Angel,
and all manner of <hi>Creatures</hi> and <hi>Creation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As (to take the former instance) suppose
there were a <hi>Religion</hi> that it were lawful <hi>to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Sun,</hi> if one should fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
that <hi>Beam</hi> that comes from the <hi>Sun,</hi> did
not he sin? for that is not the <hi>Sun,</hi> but comes
from the Sun; and therefore for any one (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Religion) to worship that
<hi>Beam,</hi> were <hi>Idolatry;</hi> for he worshipped not
that he was commanded, but was taken up in a
thing <hi>Infinitely below</hi> his God: So in the same
sense. Every <hi>Creature</hi> is a <hi>beam</hi> of the Divinity,
which is the <hi>Substance</hi> thereof: and though <hi>you</hi>
see not the <hi>face</hi> of your Father in <hi>Heaven,</hi> yet
that <hi>beam</hi> doth; yet, He that shall see that
<hi>beam,</hi> and fall down to that, <hi>worships</hi> that he
ought not; <hi>something</hi> else instead of God.</p>

I say it again, God is really present in

God as <hi>included</hi> in, or represented in that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he <hi>sins</hi> and <hi>commits</hi> Idolatry, because he
worships that <hi>beam</hi> instead of God, and falls
down to a <hi>Creature</hi> instead of God: But if I

Is it not then <hi>more then apparent,</hi> that
God is every where, in <hi>all Creatures,</hi> and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

first <hi>strip your selves</hi> of all manner of <hi>visibility,</hi>
and whatever can come under any thought of
an Angel, <hi>Beam,</hi> or any <hi>conception;</hi> for God is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowable,
unconceivable:</hi> And as long as you <hi>know</hi>
or <hi>conceive</hi> any thing, you are <hi>short of</hi> what <hi>God
is;</hi> else we make him <hi>comprehensible</hi> and <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
who is altogether <hi>unknowable</hi> and <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible:</hi>
And therefore whensoever I meet
with <hi>any thing</hi> whatsoever that will shew me
<hi>how to know</hi> the incomprehensible God, I must
<hi>cast it</hi> away, because I know it <hi>seduceth</hi> and <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadeth</hi>
me; for God is unknowable; yet God
is <hi>nearer</hi> to me then any thing I can call (I)

all the counsels and comforts of all <hi>Men,</hi> and
all <hi>Creatures:</hi> But thou must first strip thy self

For, There may be such an <hi>occasion,</hi> and a
man may be in such a <hi>condition,</hi> wherein all the

there can be <hi>no case</hi> wherein this <hi>great Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>

There is one <hi>within thee</hi> that can make thee not

went about a <hi>desperate</hi> and a <hi>mighty</hi> attempt,
<hi>viz.</hi> that he, <hi>A poor Shepherd,</hi> should offer to
go to <hi>so great a King,</hi> and to cause him to let
half his <hi>Kingdom</hi> depart from him: but there
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46362:367"/>
was such a <hi>Supporter</hi> within <hi>Moses,</hi> that made
the work seem <hi>possible</hi> to him, though impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to men. Beloved, your <hi>heavenly Father</hi>
is so near you, that he knows what ye need be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ye ask; he is so much <hi>you,</hi> that he is more
near to you then your selves: He is not <hi>so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi>
as the King is present in all his Kingdom,
because his <hi>power</hi> is over all and reaches to all:
In that sense every <hi>Iustice of Peace,</hi> every <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable,</hi>
and every <hi>Officer</hi> is a <hi>finger of the King:</hi> and
therefore it is a <hi>vain,</hi> foolish thing to say, 'Tis
true, <hi>Gods</hi> power is <hi>here,</hi> and he is present in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his <hi>Attributes;</hi> for will ye separate <hi>God</hi>
and his <hi>power?</hi> Will ye make <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi>

power</hi> is his <hi>essence,</hi> And what ever is in God, is
God; and where he is present by his <hi>power,</hi> there
he is present by his <hi>Essence:</hi> if you do not see it
so, blame your selves, lay not the fault on <hi>God,</hi>

your own <hi>eyes</hi> which are not <hi>opened,</hi> and your

                        <p>In the <hi>preparation</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> his <hi>disposition</hi> to
this great <hi>sight,</hi> we observed <hi>something</hi> in that it
is said here that <hi>Moses was a Shepherd,</hi> and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you the reason why the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> takes such
<hi>special</hi> notice of Shepherds, and still prefers
<hi>them before Husbandmen:</hi> as the first of men that
were begotten, <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> the Shepherds
<hi>offering</hi> was accepted, and the Husbandmans <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected:</hi>
and then we produced and traced all the

twelve sons, <hi>all Shepherds;</hi> and so <hi>David,
The first of Kings</hi> that was accepted,<note place="margin">Ps. 78. 71.</note> he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>from following the sheep,</hi> to sit upon the
<hi>Throne</hi> to feed <hi>Gods</hi> people: and still <hi>all the stock</hi>
of the Messiah, of whom Christ came, were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
Shepherds: This is the <hi>Letter</hi> of the
word: but what may be the meaning that
<hi>Shepherds</hi> are more esteemed then <hi>Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?</hi>
what is the mystery? what is the <hi>living
sense</hi> of these words?</p>
                        <p>As I take it, the meaning is this, that the life
of a true <hi>Shepherd</hi> was to depend <hi>more</hi> upon God
and his providence, then Husbandmen, because
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:46362:369"/>
they more resign up their wills to God, and
liye <hi>altogether</hi> upon <hi>his blessing,</hi> And do not so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and Toil: they cannot rest <hi>in themselves,</hi>
and in their <hi>own care and industry,</hi> as <hi>the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
doth; for they think nothing can be done,
but they must put in a hand; they must <hi>rise ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psa. 127. 1</note>
and go to bed <hi>late,</hi> and eat <hi>the bread of care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness;</hi>
they must <hi>plow, sow, harrow, weed, reap,</hi>
and take a great deal of toil &amp; industry, or else
they think there can be <hi>no good done:</hi> yet they
may in words say, <hi>The blessing of God is all;</hi> but
<hi>their practise</hi> says, and <hi>their hearts</hi> say, their <hi>cark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and their <hi>caring,</hi> and their <hi>diligence,</hi> and their
<hi>discretion</hi> doth all.</p>
                        <p>Mistake not, I do not say that these things
are <hi>evil; To sow, plough, reap, rise early,</hi> to use
wisdom and discretion in their <hi>affairs;</hi> but in
that they <hi>ascribe</hi> this <hi>to themselves,</hi> and think
that they have <hi>the mainest</hi> stroke of getting
their own <hi>living</hi> and <hi>maintenance:</hi> when as our
Saviour saith plainly, <hi>Not one of them can adde</hi>

is <hi>but an instrument</hi> in the hand of <hi>the great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi>
that he is but <hi>a staff</hi> in the hand of him

he,</hi> but God; though he live, yet <hi>not he,</hi> but

                           <note place="margin">Ans.</note> is meant <hi>forsaking all

                        <p>This is also, going into <hi>the high hilly Countrey</hi>

                           <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 39.</note> after the <hi>Angel</hi> had been with her,
whose salutation was at first so strange to her:
so when we have forsaken <hi>all</hi> that ever the eye
can <hi>see,</hi> or the <hi>ears</hi> hear, or the <hi>heart</hi> conceive:
till we have forsaken <hi>houses, lands, wives, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

                           <hi>and all:</hi> nay, as long as our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>mingle</hi> with these, we cannot love <hi>God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right:
if he cannot <hi>have all,</hi> but with him <hi>we
must</hi> love these, he will have <hi>none</hi> at all: and if
he must have <hi>all,</hi> where is any <hi>to spare</hi> to any
thing in the world? Therefore I tell you, <hi>If ye
love God,</hi> ye may not love <hi>your health,</hi> ye may
not <hi>love your wealth,</hi> your <hi>houses, your lands:</hi> you
may not love <hi>your wife,</hi> your <hi>childe,</hi> your <hi>good

your <hi>own souls:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">John 12. 26.</note> nay more then this, <hi>He that
hates not father, and mother, and wife, and children,
and his own life, and his own soul too, cannot be my

of God? what, not love <hi>my body?</hi> nay, what
not love <hi>my soul,</hi> nay <hi>hate my soul?</hi> O these are
sore sayings! no; for the love of God cannot
be mingled with these: if you love your wife,
<hi>as your wife:</hi> and your goods, <hi>as your goods:</hi> and
your life, as <hi>your life;</hi> and your soul, as <hi>your soul;</hi>
then your love is divided <hi>between God and them:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luke 16. 13.</note>
then you have played the harlot, and the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer
with them: but you must love them for
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46362:372"/>
                           <hi>God,</hi> and in <hi>God,</hi> and as <hi>coming from him,</hi> and to
be used <hi>for</hi> him, and if you <hi>do so,</hi> Then I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, Love them as dear as you will: you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
love them <hi>too much:</hi> But then I must tel you,
this will follow: if so, they instead of <hi>separat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
you from God, <hi>They draw you nearer</hi> to him:
but if ye love them for themselves, then they
will <hi>draw you</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> they will make <hi>God</hi>
and you at enmity; they will make a <hi>division</hi>
and <hi>separation</hi> between you: but if your <hi>love be
set on God,</hi> it will be also <hi>on them</hi> for his sake: and
this is to love <hi>not them,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> in them; Then
this will also follow, This man can let <hi>God</hi> do
<hi>what he will</hi> with them; either give them <hi>to him,</hi>
or take them <hi>from him,</hi> and yet God and he fall
not <hi>out;</hi> for whatever God doth to him or <hi>with
them,</hi> still <hi>he loves God:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 20.</note> but if ye love them in the
other sense, then he will say with <hi>Lot, Is it not a
little one, &amp; my soul shall live?</hi> could not God have
spared me this one thing, tis but a little one?
what, may I not love <hi>One creature?</hi> no, saith
this soul, I will <hi>let all go,</hi> so I may <hi>enjoy</hi> thee; I
enjoyed <hi>thee</hi> in them, and <hi>thee</hi> I shall enjoy
<hi>without them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And those that <hi>thus joy</hi> in them, may joy that
they <hi>did joy</hi> in them: I say, they may joy and
rejoyce that ever they did joy and rejoyce in
them; but <hi>the other joy,</hi> was <hi>such a joy,</hi> that they
must <hi>sorrow and repent</hi> that they did <hi>joy;</hi> for they
joyed <hi>in the Shadow,</hi> and that <hi>vanished</hi> away: but
the other <hi>joyed</hi> in the <hi>substance,</hi> in the <hi>body,</hi> and
that <hi>remained,</hi> that shall never decay; for God
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46362:372"/>
is <hi>the substance of all things,</hi> but all things <hi>that
are visible,</hi> are but shadows, but appearances,
bubbles, <hi>soon up,</hi> and <hi>soon down,</hi> like bubbles in
the water.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>the reason</hi> why we are so disquieted in
the loss of them is, because we take the <hi>shadow</hi>
to be the <hi>substance;</hi> and if that vanish, we must
needs be disquieted, and we are all out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
Then let God give us what <hi>He will,</hi>
nothing shall please us: why? because <hi>our Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom</hi>
is dead, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. ult.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18. Ult.</note> but he that loves
them <hi>for God,</hi> and <hi>in God,</hi> he is a <hi>quiet man</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they <hi>change;</hi> he is the same; let God
give them to him, or <hi>take them</hi> away from him:
he is still <hi>contented.</hi> Beloved, This is the <hi>man</hi>
that loves them <hi>aright,</hi> and he loves them <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely</hi>
more, <hi>and more dearer,</hi> then all the world
can love his own, or that it most prizeth; for
that <hi>love</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> brings them but grief and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:
but these may joy that ever they had <hi>such
a joy;</hi> and he loves God, as giving him that
love.</p>
                        <p>Until we have <hi>forsaken all,</hi> God will never
appear to us; as he did not <hi>here</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi>
till he had forsaken <hi>All the world,</hi> and come <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Desart,</hi> having forsaken flock and all, till
then God <hi>appeared not to him:</hi> Not forsaken all
(as some expound it) that is, say they, when the
love of <hi>God,</hi> and these outward things comes
into competition, or when we can enjoy them
no longer: but I say, forsake them all <hi>in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
even <hi>while we enjoy them:</hi> for he that will
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46362:373"/>
love them till that <hi>time,</hi> may love them so <hi>long,</hi>
that he cannot forsake them: that is, not quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but he is, as it were, Rent in pieces to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
them: though in act he may be made to
forsake them, yet his <hi>affections</hi> do not: but as
soon as ever we have <hi>forsaken</hi> all, and have cast
<hi>all the creatures</hi> behind our back, so that we
stand indifferently affected to all; Then GOD
will appear to us, Then GOD will shew Us
miracles as well as <hi>Moses,</hi> then God will speak
<hi>Familiarly</hi> to us, <hi>face to face,</hi> as well as to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:</hi>
for there are as <hi>great miracles</hi> done <hi>every day,</hi>

we go not <hi>into the desart:</hi> The reason why
<hi>God</hi> appears not <hi>To Us,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Act. 2. 17.</note> is, because we do not

                        <p>We wonder, it may be, that such <hi>mighty mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>
should be done daily, and we not see
them: Truly, the <hi>fault</hi> is in our selves, not
that Miracles are ceased: but our <hi>eyes</hi> are <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and we cannot see them: and therefore it is
we say, <hi>There is no miracles now adays,</hi> Miracles
are ceased; you are <hi>deceived;</hi> for there wants

Draw not nigh hither, but put off thy shoes from off

                        <p>Here is now a large field before us, Here is a

                        <p>And to that end, know, That every Creature
is an Angel of <hi>Gods,</hi> being considered <hi>as Angel</hi>
                           <pb n="287" facs="tcp:46362:374"/>
or <hi>Messenger</hi> (for so the word <hi>imports</hi>) it is a
name <hi>not of nature,</hi> but <hi>of office:</hi> and every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is sent of an <hi>Errand,</hi> they all come out
<hi>from him:</hi> and when they have done <hi>their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,</hi>
they return <hi>to him</hi> again: And, the <hi>sole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
every creature</hi> comes <hi>about,</hi> and is sent <hi>for</hi>
into the world, is, to <hi>glorifie</hi> and <hi>magnifie God:</hi>
I say, the whole <hi>work,</hi> the <hi>business</hi> all creatures
have to do, <hi>is onely</hi> to <hi>magnifie</hi> and <hi>praise</hi> our
great <hi>God:</hi> after it hath done <hi>its errand,</hi> and sung
<hi>an Hymn</hi> to God <hi>Almighty,</hi> then it <hi>departs</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
<hi>to him</hi> again.</p>
                        <p>For, All creatures do sing his praise in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they do; if not the praise of his goodness,
yet as much to his praise, the glory of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:
the most <hi>senseless creature</hi> that is, is a <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger</hi>
from <hi>God,</hi> An Angel of his sending: <hi>the
winds, the sea, the flames of fire, the earth, the air,
the lions,</hi> and all <hi>beasts,</hi> and what creature you
can name, they are all his Angels <hi>and do his
pleasure.</hi>

                           <hi>Balaams Ass</hi> was made <hi>an Angel</hi> to
him,<note place="margin">Ps. 103. 21</note> when his eyes were opened: But, Because
I say <hi>these are Angels,</hi> I would not have you <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently</hi>
conceive, that there are no other <hi>Angels</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
us: not so, but <hi>what they are</hi> we know not,
they are <hi>such</hi> as <hi>God</hi> Almighty hath appointed
<hi>them to be:</hi> and because we cannot know <hi>what
they are,</hi> let us not say there are none; for they
being in a sphear above us, we are <hi>ignorant</hi> of
them, ignorant of their <hi>Nature</hi> and cannot
Comprehend it. As, <hi>bruit beasts,</hi> they are in a
<hi>sphear</hi> below us; and although they have not
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46362:375"/>
Reason in that degree that man hath, yet they
have some reason; yet <hi>man</hi> is called <hi>the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
creature,</hi> though even beasts have <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
like man: yet because he is so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
above these <hi>creatures,</hi> he is denominated,
The reasonable <hi>creature,</hi> as if nothing had any
reason but him; but it is otherwise: Now <hi>these
creatures</hi> are not able to understand (though
they have some <hi>reason</hi>) the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>happiness</hi> of a
man because they are so much <hi>below</hi> man: So
neither can man, created in a <hi>sphear</hi> so far <hi>below
Angels,</hi> know <hi>the life, happiness, being</hi> and <hi>nature</hi>
of Angels (though something they may know)
yet far short of what they are: But every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath <hi>his happiness</hi> in his own sphear, <hi>a fool,</hi>
he is called <hi>a fool,</hi> not because he hath <hi>no reason</hi>
in him, but because he is so far short <hi>of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi>
that is in other men.</p>
                        <p>There is <hi>reason</hi> in a kinde, in all the <hi>creature,</hi>
in <hi>beasts</hi> and <hi>trees,</hi> &amp;c. their <hi>life</hi> doth <hi>express rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
though themselves understand not <hi>their own
reason:</hi> for they grow and increase, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they <hi>express reason:</hi> for <hi>God</hi> doth not <hi>in any
creature</hi> work <hi>unreasonably,</hi> but [Man] being
made (as it were) <hi>The Master of Reason,</hi> he is
led <hi>altogether</hi> by reason (as he is a man) and
what is above <hi>that,</hi> he is not able to <hi>judge</hi> of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he never knew no <hi>life</hi> above it, no <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
above it.</p>
                        <p>And therefore <hi>man,</hi> if he go about to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine</hi>
those Angels that are nearer to God then
<hi>himself,</hi> he must make use of that which is
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:46362:375"/>
within the <hi>compass</hi> of his own <hi>sphere;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he would <hi>fain</hi> define them by <hi>reason;</hi> but
herein <hi>man</hi> shews himself a <hi>fool:</hi> for those <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures</hi>
above us are <hi>super-rational,</hi> but man
thinks there is <hi>nothing</hi> above <hi>Reason,</hi> because
he never knew any thing <hi>greater.</hi> 'Tis as if a
<hi>toad</hi> or a <hi>horse</hi> should undertake to <hi>define</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a <hi>man,</hi> he could not but he must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
make himself the <hi>measure</hi> of his <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
what he had not in <hi>himself,</hi> he could not
judge <hi>excellent:</hi> So, if men define Angels, they
would measure and define them according to
the excellencies of a man.</p>
                        <p>But all those invisible Blessed <hi>Creatures</hi> that
are next unto the <hi>Burning Throne</hi> of Almighty
God, what are they? Alas, if we should go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to <hi>define</hi> their <hi>nature</hi> (as some have done)
we should prove our selves <hi>ignorant,</hi> yea <hi>fools:</hi>
yet thus much we may <hi>safely</hi> say of them, That
the nearer to God, they nearer to the <hi>spiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of God, because they are further off from
<hi>matter:</hi> though they have <hi>matter,</hi> &amp; are <hi>bodies,</hi> yet
they have but so much <hi>matter</hi> as to distinguish
them, and separate them one from another.</p>
                        <p>God he is a <hi>pure spirit,</hi> onely <hi>form,</hi>
without any manner of <hi>matter;</hi> and all the
Creatures, the <hi>further off from him,</hi> the more
<hi>matter;</hi> and the nearer, the <hi>less.</hi> For example,
If ye have observed it, Angels are <hi>pictured</hi> with
<hi>compleat</hi> bodies; yet to shew that they are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off from <hi>matter</hi> then <hi>man,</hi> therefore they
have always <hi>wings;</hi> and <hi>Archangels,</hi> they being
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:46362:376"/>
nearer God then <hi>Angels,</hi> are pictured with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
cut off by the <hi>middle,</hi> with <hi>wings:</hi> but <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,</hi>
having less matter, and nearer God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
then <hi>either,</hi> are pictured o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ely with <hi>heads</hi>
and <hi>wings:</hi> but <hi>Seraphims,</hi> being furthest of all
from man, and nearest of all to God, they have
no <hi>bodies</hi> at all, but onely represented by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>yellowish</hi> or <hi>fiery</hi> colour; All this, is to shew
the very same thing that I am now <hi>unfolding</hi> to
you; it is a thing <hi>remarkable,</hi> though it may be
you have took no <hi>notice</hi> of it.</p>
                        <p>For the present let this be enough to <hi>limit</hi>
our ranging <hi>thoughts</hi> in these <hi>mysteries.</hi> In man,
<hi>matter</hi> prevails above the <hi>form</hi> because the <hi>form</hi>
is limited and bounded by the <hi>matter;</hi> that
though the <hi>form</hi> be quick, and full of <hi>agility,</hi> yet
the <hi>matter</hi> hinders it, it cannot do what it
would: but in these Angels, <hi>form</hi> is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
over the <hi>matter;</hi> that wheresoever the
<hi>form</hi> would be, the <hi>matter</hi> is obedient.</p>
                        <p>Then let us lay this for a ground, for a max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime
undeniable, That <hi>all Creatures,</hi> from the
<hi>highest</hi> to the <hi>lowest,</hi> are to God, As <hi>a sweet-tuned
Instrument;</hi> They all <hi>harmoniously</hi> and with a
joynt consent Sound forth his <hi>praise;</hi> all the
Creatures <hi>praise</hi> him; from the highest and
sweetest <hi>Treble,</hi> to the lowest BASE of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable
<hi>Earth,</hi> they all express and sing aloud
aloud and Harmoniously, His <hi>praise:</hi> It is the
main business all <hi>Creatures</hi> do, and shall do for
ever, to <hi>sing praise</hi> and <hi>Hallelujah</hi> to God on
High: this is the <hi>business,</hi> the Commission that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:46362:376"/>
all these Embassadours are sent about; Even
the very destruction of evil <hi>Angels,</hi> and wicked
<hi>men,</hi> do aloud sound forth his <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>glory</hi>
for ever and ever.</p>
                        <p>Thus this name of <hi>Angels</hi> hath all this while
<hi>detained us</hi> from answering our <hi>question;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Obj.</note> Why
God is here called an <hi>Angel?</hi> and likewise in
many other places, as <hi>Iudges</hi> 6.<note place="margin">Judges 6. 11, 15.</note> It is said an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi>
appeared to <hi>Gideon;</hi> and afterwards, <hi>ver.</hi> 15.
it was the Lord.</p>
                        <p>The reason is this,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> and included in that I have
now said. If we look upon any one <hi>Creature,</hi> so
far forth as it is a <hi>Creature,</hi> it is infinitely <hi>short</hi>
of God, for God is nothing that we can see or
<hi>imagine;</hi> and therefore as long as you <hi>see</hi> or
<hi>imagine</hi> any thing,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 7.</note> you are <hi>short</hi> of God; for as
<hi>the peace of God passeth all understanding,</hi> so doth
God himself; and there is not <hi>one Creature</hi> but
God is the <hi>peace</hi> thereof: For whatsoever it
be, be it never so <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>splendent</hi> a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that falls within the <hi>compass,</hi> I will not say
of a <hi>mans</hi> understanding, though the <hi>soul</hi> be a
<hi>spiritual</hi> and a <hi>divine</hi> thing; but, let it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
in the <hi>understanding</hi> and <hi>mind</hi> of an Angel
above us; that same is <hi>not,</hi> nor <hi>cannot</hi> be but an
<hi>Angel;</hi> for <hi>God passeth all understanding,</hi> both of
<hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> none know what <hi>He is,</hi> but
his own <hi>Blessed Self.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whatever comes within the <hi>conception</hi> of
any created <hi>Being,</hi> that is but a <hi>finite</hi> thing, and
falls <hi>infinitely</hi> short of the <hi>infinite</hi> God. If an
Angel should appear to me, and tell me that
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:46362:377"/>
he was God, in that I can but either <hi>see him,</hi> or
<hi>hear him;</hi> I know, forasmuch as I <hi>hear</hi>
him, or <hi>see</hi> him, or can <hi>imagine</hi> him under
any <hi>form,</hi> or <hi>name,</hi> or <hi>expression,</hi> that He was but
a <hi>Creature,</hi> be it never so high an <hi>Angel;</hi> and if I
should <hi>fall down</hi> and <hi>worship Him,</hi> I were well
<hi>worthy</hi> of blame (with S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 9.</note> who would have
fallen <hi>down</hi> and worshipt <hi>that</hi> Angel that had
shewed <hi>him</hi> all those things) for it is <hi>But our
fellow-servant,</hi> though it appear in <hi>never somuch</hi>
glory; for all the imaginations of Men and
Angels (<hi>poor drops</hi> as they are) fall <hi>infinitely</hi>
short of God Almighty.</p>
                        <p>But if in any <hi>Creature,</hi> you strip it of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>form</hi> and <hi>imagination,</hi> and behold God
the <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> thereof, as <hi>One, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
Eternal Essence,</hi> as <hi>abstracted</hi> from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Creatures:</hi> then I may with fear and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<hi>fall down</hi> before, or take occasion by any
Creature, to <hi>adore</hi> God: If we can behold God
<hi>thus,</hi> then the whole <hi>Scripture</hi> commands us to
<hi>praise</hi> and <hi>magnifie</hi> him: Then praise him in the
<hi>Sun,</hi> and praise him in the <hi>Moon,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psa. 148.</note> Then praise

                        <p>As suppose there were a Religion that it

through that <hi>Creature</hi> we have recourse onely
to him that is in the <hi>midst of the bush,</hi> in the

<hi>existence</hi> and <hi>being</hi> thereof, and fall down <hi>before
him,</hi> herein I do <hi>no more</hi> but that which is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi>
If I look through the <hi>body</hi> of that
<hi>Creature,</hi> which <hi>body</hi> veils <hi>God</hi> from me, then
I will praise <hi>The High and Holy One in his Holy
place;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ps. 149. 6.</note> then will I praise him in the <hi>firmament
of his power,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ps. 150. 1.</note> and in all the work of his <hi>hands:</hi>
Then <hi>A Gods name</hi> praise him in a <hi>tree,</hi> praise
him in the <hi>wind,</hi> and in all Creatures; for the

all his Creatures; The <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>wind</hi> is
Christ Jesus, the <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>man</hi> is Christ Jesus,

to Jesus Christ as <hi>included</hi> in that man, or in any
Creature, I sin likewise: But if in <hi>men,</hi> and

house,</hi> and travelling <hi>all alone,</hi> had many <hi>sad</hi>
thoughts; he knew not what to do, nor what
<hi>entertainment</hi> he should have where he went;
and it was <hi>a long journey;</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> was to go
from his <hi>Fathers house,</hi> where he had been
<hi>brought up in the knowledge of God,</hi> and was to
go among Heathen Idolaters: These <hi>thoughts</hi>
much perplexing <hi>Iacob,</hi> at night in the <hi>open

<hi>asleep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> &amp; dreamed This <hi>Dream;</hi> which, whatever
it seems to be in the <hi>History,</hi> In the <hi>mind</hi> and
<hi>meaning</hi> of God, it was the fittest that could have
been <hi>revealed</hi> to him: <hi>Behold</hi> (saith the Lord)
<hi>v. 15. I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places
whither thou goest, I will not leave thee.</hi> And <hi>Iacob</hi>
being <hi>taught</hi> by God, and not by his <hi>own</hi> wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
presently makes <hi>the right use</hi> of it; Thought
he, I had thought that I had left God <hi>behind</hi> me,
<hi>In my Fathers house onely;</hi> but I see God goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with me, <hi>God is in this place, and I was not
aware:</hi> Had I been <hi>aware</hi> God had been <hi>with me</hi>
all this while, and that where ever I <hi>go,</hi> he is
still <hi>with</hi> me, I would not have been <hi>afraid:</hi>
Now,<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 16.</note> What shall I <hi>fear,</hi> Seeing God is with
me in all my <hi>Iourney,</hi> and where ever I am?
What need I be careful?</p>
                        <p>To see God <hi>Thus Really present</hi> with a man
what will he, nay what can he be afraid of?
though there were a <hi>thousand</hi> deaths before
him: God being <hi>so near</hi> a man, And to see and
believe this really, it would make him <hi>not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,</hi>
                           <pb n="299" facs="tcp:46362:380"/>
though he were to <hi>enter</hi> into a Sea of <hi>mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

present</hi> with him, to <hi>back</hi> him, to <hi>defend,</hi> to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</hi>
to <hi>protect</hi> and to <hi>encourage</hi> him, as here he
was with <hi>Iacob?</hi> Its no marvel, <hi>Paul</hi> went tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
al <hi>so bravely,</hi> having such a one to back him.</p>
                        <p>Now <hi>Iacob,</hi> whatever he thought when he
<hi>left his Father,</hi> and knew not what should <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi>
of him, nor whether he should <hi>go,</hi> nor
where he should <hi>stay:</hi> Now all these thoughts
are vanished; for now, He sees <hi>God</hi> is with him
<hi>whereever</hi> he is, &amp; withal the <hi>Creatures</hi> he meets
with. And, that they can neither do me <hi>good or
Hurt</hi> Except He Order it. Then also (thought
he) He being so near <hi>me,</hi> I am sure <hi>all my prayers</hi>
shall <hi>reach</hi> him, and he knows all my <hi>wants:</hi>
(And what hath <hi>Iacob</hi> lost now? He hath forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>father</hi> and <hi>mother,</hi> and <hi>house</hi> and <hi>home;</hi> he
hath bidden them all <hi>Farewel,</hi> and now he hath
[<hi>God] instead of All</hi>) who I am sure will suffer
me to <hi>want</hi> nothing, and he is <hi>able</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to
relieve me: He was with me <hi>yesterday,</hi> and <hi>I

                        </p>
                        <p>And so I say of this <hi>vision</hi> of <hi>Moses:</hi> this <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
that he had here of Christ (for it is no other)
Whatever it seems to be; To <hi>him,</hi> at this time
it was the <hi>suitablest</hi> and the <hi>fittest</hi> that could be
<hi>revealed</hi> to him: For <hi>Moses</hi> was to be sent to
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> a <hi>great</hi> King; and <hi>He</hi> was but a
<hi>Shepherd,</hi> such a one <hi>as was An abomination to
the Egyptians, Gen.</hi> 46. 34.<note place="margin">Gen. 46. 34.</note> And besides, He
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46362:381"/>
was an <hi>Exile,</hi> a <hi>banished</hi> man out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> for
he was fain to fly thence for <hi>killing</hi> a man; and
being come thither again,<note place="margin">Exo. 2. 15.</note> he might be <hi>question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
for his <hi>life:</hi> for <hi>Pharaoh sought to slay Him</hi> for
that very thing.<note place="margin">Exo. 10. 26.</note> And besides all this, he went
to <hi>intreat</hi> for almost half the people of his <hi>land</hi>
to depart from him; and they must carry all
their <hi>goods</hi> and all their <hi>substance</hi> with them, all
their <hi>cattel,</hi> and all their <hi>jewels;</hi> they would not
leave a <hi>Hoof</hi> behind. And besides, all the
<hi>Kingdom</hi> depended upon their making of <hi>bricks</hi>
therefore no wonder though <hi>Moses</hi> made so
many <hi>objections</hi> as he did; no <hi>marvel</hi> he asks,
<hi>Who am I that I should do this thing?</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ib. 3. 11.</note> Who would
have thought it <hi>possible</hi> for Him, To have
brought it to pass? The thing was of such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
and attended with so many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
                        <p>And the <hi>vision</hi> was; The <hi>Wonder</hi> which made
<hi>Moses</hi> turn aside to see it; <hi>Not</hi> that the <hi>Bush
Burned:</hi> for oftentimes <hi>Trees,</hi> in a violent
<hi>wind,</hi> standing close together, have been known
by <hi>rubbing</hi> and <hi>rushing</hi> together to fall on fire,
and by many other occasions: but in that it
<hi>Burned,</hi> and was not <hi>Burnt, Therein was the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</hi>
Who ever saw <hi>Trees</hi> on fire, and not
<hi>consume?</hi> who ever saw a <hi>forrest</hi> on fire a whole
day, and the <hi>wood</hi> not burnt? Now, I say, This
represented Christ so <hi>fitly,</hi> so <hi>oppertunely</hi> on this
occasion, as could <hi>possibly</hi> be.</p>
                        <p>It may be you may say unto me, This
was a <hi>great miracle,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Obj.</note> but I see no <hi>great</hi>

                        </p>

                           <note place="margin">Ans.</note> yet <hi>Moses</hi> saw
<hi>enough</hi> in it to bear up his <hi>mind</hi> against all those
<hi>weighty</hi> objections I before named.</p>
                        <p>You will say,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> it may be; 'Tis true, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of the story <hi>God</hi> fitted <hi>Moses</hi> with <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>

He that wrote the <hi>text,</hi> must give the <hi>interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

                        <p>I Answer,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> In effect this <hi>Vision</hi> was the same
that <hi>Iacobs</hi> was; the end of it was to encourage

fire,</hi> that burns and <hi>consumes</hi> every thing, but not

                           <hi>thing,</hi> and consumes <hi>Nothing;</hi> for <hi>fire</hi> doth but

<hi>Air, Fire</hi> to <hi>Fire Earth</hi> to <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> to
<hi>Water:</hi> Fire makes <hi>a change,</hi> but there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

<hi>pleasure,</hi> they must <hi>dissolve</hi> &amp; return <hi>whence
they</hi> came, And out of <hi>That same matter,</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively,
<hi>creatures have been</hi> and are daily
made; Trees grow out of the earth, and having
fulfilled their work and <hi>their time,</hi> they fall to
the earth <hi>from whence</hi> they again arose; All
things are in a continual change, Operation
and Distillation; Even as you see, Water put

stopt, the vapors and the spirits ascend <hi>by heat,</hi>
To the very Top, and the <hi>heat</hi> being <hi>allayed,</hi>
they fall and descend again: Now observe,
There is a change made, but there is nothing
lost; for being close stopt, nothing could go <hi>out</hi>
of the glass: Even so, <hi>Things</hi> are <hi>Altered</hi> &amp; <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi>
by Christ Jesus; He makes <hi>Creatures</hi> of the

They cannot go out of the world; And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>They cannot</hi> be made, but by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
for, All <hi>the creatures</hi> cannot bring the least

                           </hi>
There is required the same power <hi>to Annihilate</hi>
it, as there was <hi>to Create it,</hi> All the Kings in
the earth cannot bring <hi>One creature</hi> to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
if they should <hi>burn</hi> this body of mine
<hi>to ashes,</hi> and scatter the <hi>ashes</hi> in the air, or cast
them into the River; Yet, there <hi>is nothing lost</hi>
of me, but onely every Element hath its part,
<hi>to which it Returns.</hi>
                        </p>

He that burns <hi>the Bush,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Job 38. 14</note> but <hi>consumes it not:</hi> It is

The <hi>Seal,</hi> the <hi>Form</hi> you last gave it, <hi>that stands,</hi>

Jesus Christ, of one and the same <hi>Elements,</hi>

forms,</hi> and <hi>new impressions:</hi> and that <hi>impression</hi> it
last had, That stands, Till he cause it <hi>to Return,</hi>
till he unmake it, and new make it again: And
I dare be bold to Affirm, That if our great
and glorious God should weigh the heavens
and the earth now, as he did at the making
thereof, For the Scripture saith, <hi>He measured
the waters in the Hollow of his Hand, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
The dust of the Earth in a measure, and
weighed The Mountains in Scales and The Hills

<hi>Nothing were lost;</hi> For all he hath Created and

All the whole world, as he doth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
having raised thereout, such infinite <hi>mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions</hi>
of <hi>thousands</hi> of <hi>men, beasts, trees, &amp;c. and is
still in changing</hi> and making them <hi>New,</hi> and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making
them again; yet, I say, If He <hi>Weigh</hi> the
whole <hi>matter</hi> of Heaven and Earth, <hi>of which</hi>
they are made, they would not weigh <hi>One
Grain,</hi> less or more, then at the first <hi>Creation.</hi>
I say,</p>
                        <p>It is He <hi>that weighs the mountains in scales,</hi>

                     <p>From what hath been said, we may <hi>learn</hi>
three things: First, HUMILITY towards
God: <hi>Wo to him that striveth with his Maker,</hi>
Isaiah 45. 7.<note place="margin">Isa. 45. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>He hath shewed thee, O man,
what is good; and what doth the Lord require of
thee? to walk humbly with thy God,</hi> Mic. 6. 8.<note place="margin">Mic. 6. 8.</note>
You know,<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 48.</note> God did <hi>regard</hi> the humbleness
of the <hi>Virgin Mary:</hi> as for <hi>the proud, He
sends them empty away, beholds them afar off:</hi> if
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:46362:399"/>
we be <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>haughty,</hi> and lifted up in our
selves, he hath power <hi>enough;</hi> (for all <hi>power</hi> is
in his hands) to <hi>bring us down:</hi> This is more for
our benefit, then we are aware of, to be
<hi>Emptied</hi> and laid <hi>Low</hi> in our selves, To be
<hi>Children</hi> in our own esteem, <hi>Little in our own
eyes,</hi> as God <hi>Commands</hi> and highly <hi>Commends.</hi>
This fits us for His Heavenly Kingdom; And
all that God requires of us, Is out of meer
Love to us, and out of tender care for the
Good of Man. There is not One of His <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>
but they are made more for mans
good and Salvation then out of respect to
Himself, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and <hi>Elihu</hi> confessed, Job
22. 23.<note place="margin">Job 22. 23</note> A wise man may be Profitable to
<hi>Himself</hi> but not to <hi>God? Is it any Pleasure to
the Almighty that thou Art Righteous? Is it
Gain to Him that thou makest thy ways Perfect?</hi>
and again,<note place="margin">Job 35. 6, 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Iob 35. 6, 7. If thou sinnest, what
canst thou do against Him? or if thy Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
be multiplied, what doest thou unto Him?</hi> Or,
<hi>If thou be righteous what givest thou unto Him?
Or what receiveth he of thine hand? Thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
may Hurt a man, as thou Art, and thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
may profit Him;</hi> But, what canst thou
take away from God, or adde unto Him? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
nothing; He remaineth <hi>Perfect, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
Vnchangable, Impassible,</hi> to Him nothing
can be given or added, detracted or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.
If a man throw up a Heavy stone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the air it will return down again upon his
own Head; we can make God neither <hi>Richer</hi>
                        <pb n="338" facs="tcp:46362:400"/>
nor <hi>Poorer, Greater</hi> or <hi>Lesser,</hi> but He hath a care
of <hi>Us</hi> and <hi>Our</hi> Good, He hath a hand always o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
Ready to give if we could but receive, He
is <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>free</hi> to all <hi>that call upon Him,</hi> And
He requireth nothing at our Hands but onely
this; That we quietly receive of Him, what he
is willing to give.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we may learn hence, <hi>confidence</hi> and
<hi>trust</hi> in God; for he is <hi>stronger</hi> then all our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;

prey, for He is alwayes either watching or

must not, cannot <hi>blame</hi> the Heavens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the cause of all these <hi>distempers</hi>
came forth of the Earth at first: So if we
be <hi>Heavily</hi> punished by the Devil, we may
blame our selves: For we have taken into
our selves of His Nature, whereby he hath
gotten power over us. For, could we but
say as Christ, <hi>He hath Nought in me,</hi> He could
have no power upon us. Let therefore these

Tops) continually, with our <hi>eyes</hi> up unto God;
That He may help us, To <hi>leave</hi> and <hi>abhor</hi> all

                     <p>So that now, I will say of the <hi>Devil</hi> and his

Whereof, after he had long <hi>disputed,</hi> whence it

That it is A more <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>fruitless</hi> thing, to

as <hi>we feel</hi> the flames of evil <hi>concupiscence</hi> in our

finds his <hi>house</hi> on <hi>fire,</hi> to stand still, <hi>Demanding</hi>
how the <hi>fire</hi> came, but doing nothing to <hi>quench</hi>
it: Or whereas he should find his <hi>son</hi> fallen into
a <hi>well</hi> ready to be drowned, yet should stand still,
<hi>Asking</hi> How he came to fall in, but not using any
<hi>help</hi> or <hi>means</hi> to get him out, and so save his life.</p>
                     <p>So may I say of the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Angels:</hi> It
being so, that they <hi>Are,</hi> And that they are so
<hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Destructive</hi> to men; and that they
<hi>move</hi> in, <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>reign</hi> in the <hi>Children of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:</hi>
and have already <hi>climbed our works,</hi> and
are gotten in our very hearts, and there wound,

greatest <hi>wisdom,</hi> to consider <hi>How</hi> to remove
them, how to dispossess them, and to cast these
<hi>unclean</hi> Devils out of our <hi>souls</hi> and <hi>spirits.</hi> And
if you desire to know <hi>How</hi> this may be done;
For, though it be <hi>Hard</hi> and <hi>difficult,</hi> yet it is not
a needless thing to undertake, nor a thing impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
nay, 'tis <hi>high time</hi> 'twas done, left you be

and thus tis in divers other vices; and not onely

you may know and discern Satan <hi>his subtile work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
and plottings in these wayes by this: in such
cases as this, He never <hi>Rents</hi> nor <hi>Tears</hi> them
whom he so leaveth, bur deals <hi>fawningly,</hi> and
<hi>placidly,</hi> and <hi>smoothly</hi> with them: he deals <hi>easily</hi>
and <hi>insensibly</hi> with them: In these kinds, Of

shapes (yet tis still <hi>Himself,</hi> for he never <hi>Tears</hi>
nor <hi>Rents</hi> them) <hi>He departs not</hi> though he seems
to depart, but so much the more <hi>keeps</hi> in, and
<hi>strengthens</hi> himself in his possession: As, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

steps in: and <hi>youth</hi> departs, and <hi>manhood</hi> comes
on: so manhood <hi>decays,</hi> and old age <hi>creeps</hi> upon

<hi>greater</hi> and <hi>stronger;</hi> nay, he may <hi>break off</hi> in

with the greater respect at his return.</p>
                     <p>2. Satan departs from men so <hi>quietly,</hi> that they
may be <hi>the securer,</hi> and the more <hi>careless;</hi> that they
may have no <hi>suspicion</hi> of his <hi>wiles</hi> and <hi>subtilties;</hi>
As when a man departs with <hi>smooth</hi> carriage. <hi>sweet</hi>

be glad to enjoy his company: As those <hi>prophane</hi>

they were so besotted with the <hi>deluding</hi>

and it was <hi>to be sealed</hi> at the day of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,</hi>
that he should say now, and never before,
<hi>All power is given me in heaven and earth?</hi> what
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:46362:421"/>
addition of power had he now, which he had not
before, if he be God equal with his Father? and
he saith many times, <hi>The Father hath committed

shews, he is God, and of <hi>Equal power</hi> and <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
with his Father;<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 28.</note> and yet he saith in the 14, of
<hi>Iohn, The Father is greater then I:</hi> Can God receive
any <hi>new Access</hi> of power?</p>
                     <p>No certainly: but these words are so hard and

filled the Church full of <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Heresies:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Answ.</note> the
Church fell much at <hi>Odds;</hi> for many from hence
denied <hi>the Divinity of Christ,</hi> because they could
not reconcile <hi>these</hi> Scriptures: And (by the way)
if he be <hi>Lord of all power,</hi> then he leaves <hi>none</hi> for
man to claim <hi>to himself.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that I may answer <hi>this doubt,</hi> and make it
clear, I will lay down two grounds.</p>
                     <p>First, Although God receive <hi>no new power</hi> in
himself, yet <hi>he doth receive power</hi> by being made
<hi>further known</hi> unto man. And Secondly, By mans
being made <hi>further known unto him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, By his being made <hi>further known unto
man;</hi> the revealing and discovering of God unto
man, making himself <hi>more known;</hi> the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this is said <hi>To Adde power</hi> to him; but not
<hi>That any thing can be added to him who is infinite:</hi>
if there could, he were not infinite, and <hi>He were
not God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But know this, whatever attribute God hath
ascribed to him, it is in regard of <hi>his creatures,</hi> not
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:46362:422"/>

himself <hi>most,</hi> in that he <hi>Emptied</hi> himself; and
therefore he saith here, <hi>All power is given unto me

men shall now see and acknowledge, that he

him <hi>in Heaven?</hi> do the Angels add any thing to
him, or is any thing added to them? yea certainly;
for <hi>by the Church</hi> these things are <hi>More made known</hi>
unto them; for they were not created in such an
estate but they may be made better; nor are they
<hi>so perfect</hi> but that they desire <hi>an increase in their

their knowledge and perfection is <hi>increasing.</hi> And

                     <p>The second ground: Christ also, as <hi>he is man,</hi>
hath <hi>all power given unto him,</hi> as being united to

                     <p>Jesus Christ, he had the same glory <hi>in himself</hi>
when he was upon earth, as he had with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

man, he to <hi>Us-ward</hi> emptied himself of all his
<hi>glory, And came in the form of a servant;</hi> he was
subject to the like passions and infirmities as we
are except <hi>sinful;</hi> and hereby man came to be
further made known unto him: that is, in regard
of his <hi>humane</hi> nature, he was hungry and thirsty,
and weary, and suffered death, and the like; and
yet in regard of his <hi>Divine nature,</hi> he held his
<hi>glory</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> with his Father: and it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it should be so in both regards; for had
it not been so, he could not have complyed so
with the creatures, and felt their wants and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities:
and had he not <hi>retained</hi> his unity with
his Father (which he could not in regard of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>As God,</hi> either lose, or diminish, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease)
he could not have complyed <hi>so perfectly</hi>
with his Father for the <hi>salvation</hi> of mankind: For
as he was in the <hi>bosom</hi> of his Father, he was <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowable</hi>
to any creature; he was known onely
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:46362:429"/>
to himself; he was inexplicable, not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded;
and <hi>in this regard,</hi> the more ye enter into
darkness, and unknowing, the more ye know of
him; for he is nothing that we can comprehend
or understand, <hi>as (we are creatures,)</hi> until we come
to be <hi>One</hi> with him, and <hi>swallowed up</hi> into him.</p>
                     <p>But let us observe, that Christ never made this
boast of himself, that <hi>All power is given unto me
in heaven and in earth,</hi> till he was <hi>ready</hi> to leave

never all the while He was on earth, ever appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
<hi>all power</hi> to be his, till he was ready <hi>to
depart</hi> out of the earth. And Beloved, this is for
<hi>our</hi> imitation: Christ was <hi>no boaster,</hi> though <hi>none</hi>
might <hi>boast</hi> more; but he was <hi>meek and lowly;</hi>
he became <hi>a servant to all;</hi> when he might have
been advanced and made <hi>a King,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 6. 15.</note> he ran away

                        <p>The Only Reason <hi>Why WE Remain</hi> such Empty

our selves what a progress in Religion we have
made, and despise others. <hi>This</hi> keeps us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>united</hi> to him: Oh! those <hi>High-swelling,</hi> tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering

                        <p>
                           <hi>My eye</hi> can never be <hi>united</hi> to the Sun, till I
behold and look <hi>upon it; Then</hi> those beames that
come from it, draw <hi>my eye</hi> in a direct line <hi>to be

till the Lord himself, <hi>by the eye of faith,</hi> which is
as a beam that comes from him, <hi>unites</hi> and draws
up <hi>thy soul</hi> in a direct line to him again: As long
as thou art <hi>Something</hi> in thy self, so long thou art

                        <head>CHAP. 1. What the Divine Mist or Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is.</head>
                        <p>OTRINITY! That art <hi>above</hi> ES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENCE,
above GOD, above <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
the <hi>Governour</hi> of the <hi>Christians</hi>
wisdom <hi>concerning</hi> God: Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to <hi>direct us</hi> to the <hi>More-then-unknown,</hi> More-then-shining,
<hi>Highest-top</hi> of Mystical <hi>Oracles,</hi>
where the <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>absolute,</hi> and unchangeable
MYSTERIES of Divinity <hi>do Hide:</hi> by the <hi>More-then-lightsome</hi>
MISTINES of Secret-Teaching,
SILENCE in the <hi>Darkest Darkness;</hi> Even <hi>Him</hi>
that over-shineth <hi>That</hi> which is <hi>More-then-most-Glorious,</hi>
and under that, which is <hi>utterly impal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,</hi>
and <hi>invisible:</hi> doth More-then-fill the

Shinings.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. And these <hi>things</hi> I pray for: but do thou,
O my friend <hi>Timothy,</hi> by thy <hi>most intent</hi> study and
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:46362:441"/>
exercise about MYSTICAL Visions, leave and
forsake thy <hi>senses,</hi> and all sensible and <hi>intelligible</hi>
things, and thy <hi>mental operations,</hi> and all things
that are not, and that <hi>are;</hi> and after an <hi>unknown</hi>
manner, <hi>lift</hi> up, and <hi>advance</hi> thy self to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi>
and <hi>Union</hi> with Him who is above all
<hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Knowledge:</hi> for by a <hi>free</hi> and purely
<hi>absolute</hi> departing from <hi>thy self,</hi> and all <hi>things,</hi>
having <hi>separated</hi> all things, and being <hi>freed</hi>
and <hi>loosed</hi> from all things, thou shalt be <hi>brought
back</hi> to the <hi>Super-essential</hi> BEAM of the Divine
<hi>Darkness.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. But take heed, that none of <hi>them</hi> that are
<hi>not Entred</hi> or <hi>Initiated</hi> in our MYSSERIES, do
hear <hi>these</hi> things: I mean <hi>such</hi> as are still <hi>detained</hi>
and <hi>holden</hi> in the things that <hi>are,</hi> and do imagine
nothing to be <hi>super-essentially</hi> above the things
<hi>that are;</hi> but presume by their <hi>own</hi> knowledge to
understand HIm that maketh DARKNES his
<hi>Secret place:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psal. 18. 11.</note> And if these <hi>Divine Institutions</hi>
concerning <hi>Mystical</hi> things, be above Them; what
is to be said <hi>of such</hi> as are yet <hi>more</hi> strangers, and
<hi>farther off</hi> from these <hi>Mysteries,</hi> which out of the
<hi>last</hi> and <hi>lowest</hi> of all things <hi>that are,</hi> do <hi>frame</hi> and
make the <hi>figure</hi> of the SUPER-EMINENT cause,
and think or say, that it hath nothing <hi>more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi>
or is <hi>no way</hi> better then their <hi>ungodly</hi> and
MANY-FORMED <hi>Images?</hi> whereas they <hi>ought</hi>
both <hi>in it,</hi> as the <hi>cause</hi> of all things, to <hi>place</hi> and
<hi>affirm</hi> the <hi>positions</hi> of all things that are, and also
<hi>more properly</hi> to <hi>deny</hi> them all unto <hi>it,</hi> as being
<hi>far above</hi> all things: And yet not to think that
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:46362:441"/>
the <hi>Negations</hi> are opposite to the <hi>Affirmations:</hi> But
that it is <hi>above</hi> and <hi>before</hi> Privations, which is
above all, both <hi>Ablation</hi> and <hi>Position,</hi> or above
<hi>any thing</hi> that can be <hi>denied</hi> or <hi>affirmed</hi> of it.</p>
                        <p>4. In this sense therefore S. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> saith,
That <hi>Theology</hi> is both MUCH and LEAST, and
the Gospel <hi>Broad</hi> and <hi>Great;</hi> and again <hi>short</hi>
and <hi>Concise:</hi> It seems to <hi>me</hi> that he wonderfully
understood <hi>thereby,</hi> that the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good</hi>
CAUSE of all things, may <hi>both</hi> be spoken of, In
<hi>Many words,</hi> and in <hi>Few</hi> and in None, as admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
neither <hi>speech</hi> nor <hi>understanding,</hi> because it is
SUPER-ESSENTIAL, <hi>Super-Eminent</hi> to all
things, and <hi>shineth out,</hi> or <hi>appears</hi> onely to them
<hi>without Vail</hi> and <hi>Truly,</hi> who do <hi>pass through</hi> all
things both <hi>impure</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> and transcend <hi>every</hi>
ascent of all HOLY HIGHNESSES, and leave
<hi>behinde</hi> them all DIVINE, <hi>Lights, Sounds,</hi> and
<hi>Heavenly</hi> words, and enter into That MIST
where He is, <hi>Really</hi> (as the Scriptures speak) who
is <hi>Above All things.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. For it is not without <hi>Cause,</hi> that the <hi>Divine
Moses</hi> is first commanded to be <hi>purged</hi> himself,
and then to be separated <hi>from</hi> them that were not
<hi>such:</hi> and after <hi>All this</hi> purifying, He heareth the
MANY-SOUNDING <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and seeth the
MANY LIGHTS, which <hi>Dart</hi> from themselves
<hi>Pure</hi> and much <hi>scattered</hi> RAYES, or <hi>Beams:</hi> Then
is He <hi>separated</hi> from the <hi>multitude,</hi> and with the
<hi>Selected</hi> Priests, He laboureth up to the <hi>top</hi> of the
<hi>Divine</hi> Ascents; and <hi>in them</hi> he doth <hi>not meet</hi>
with God; but he sees, Not <hi>Him,</hi> for <hi>He</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:46362:442"/>
But Onely The PLACE, where He is.</p>
                        <p>And this I think <hi>intimates</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>signifies</hi> thus
much; that the <hi>most</hi> Divine and <hi>highest</hi> of things
<hi>Seen and understood,</hi> are but certain <hi>Reasons,</hi> and

manner of <hi>Scientifical</hi> Apprehensions; and is <hi>in
Him</hi> that is utterly inattingible, and <hi>invisible,</hi>

                        <p>1. IN our <hi>Theological</hi> Descriptions, we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
the <hi>most</hi> principal things of <hi>affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
Divinity, how the <hi>Divine</hi> and Good <hi>Nature</hi>
is called <hi>One,</hi> and how <hi>Three;</hi> and what it is
which <hi>in it, is called</hi> PATERNITY &amp; FILIAL:
and <hi>what</hi> the Divinity of the HOLY GHOST
meaneth: How from the <hi>Immaterial</hi> and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
GOOD, sprung out the <hi>Cordial</hi> lights of
GOODNESS, which still <hi>abode,</hi> not going <hi>Out</hi>
(the <hi>Mansion</hi> of being CO-ETERNAL to the

                        </p>
                        <p>2. How <hi>Super-essential</hi> JESUS was essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in the TRUTHS of <hi>Humane</hi> nature: as also
<hi>Other things</hi> which we have <hi>Celebrated</hi> in our

3. Likewise also in the book of Divine <hi>Names</hi>
we have declared <hi>How</hi> He is called GOOD, <hi>How</hi>
BEING; <hi>How</hi> LIFE, and WISDOM, and
POWER, and whatsoever else <hi>belongs</hi> unto the
<hi>Intelligible</hi> Divine NOMINATION.</p>
                        <p>4. But in our <hi>Symbolical</hi> Divinity we have
shewed what are the <hi>Metonymies,</hi> or <hi>Translations</hi>
or <hi>Borrowed</hi> NAMES taken from <hi>sensible</hi> things,
and applyed to <hi>Divine</hi> things, <hi>viz.</hi> What are the

to this <hi>Part</hi> of Divinity, which they

God by.</p>
                        <p>5. And I think <hi>Thou</hi> hast seen as well as <hi>I,</hi> how
<hi>many more</hi> words are used in the <hi>latter</hi> then in
the <hi>former:</hi> For it behoved, that the Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

                           </gap>d this <hi>Explication</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
NAMES, should need <hi>fewer</hi> words then
<hi>Symbolical</hi> Divinity: For by how much <hi>Higher</hi>
we climbe towards <hi>That</hi> which is <hi>Above,</hi> by so
much <hi>the more</hi> are our words <hi>Contracted</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred</hi>
in the <hi>View</hi> and <hi>Sight</hi> of <hi>Intelligible</hi> things.</p>
                        <p>As now, when we enter into <hi>that</hi> DARKNESS
which is above All <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>understanding,</hi> we
shall find not <hi>shortness</hi> of speech, but <hi>utter</hi> silence
and <hi>dumbness,</hi> as also want of understanding.</p>

                           <pb n="424" facs="tcp:46362:444"/>
And from thence our <hi>Speech</hi> and discourse <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending</hi>
from the <hi>Highest</hi> to the <hi>Lowest,</hi> according
to the <hi>Quantity</hi> of its <hi>Descent,</hi> is <hi>Enlarged</hi> into a
<hi>proportionable</hi> breadth or <hi>multitude.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But now <hi>Arising</hi> from the things <hi>Below,</hi> to that
which is <hi>Above,</hi> according to the <hi>measure</hi> of its
<hi>Ascent,</hi> it is <hi>Contracted</hi> and grows <hi>Less,</hi> till after
all ascent it becomes <hi>quite Void</hi> of words, and so
united to that which is <hi>Unspeakable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. But thou wilt ask, to what purpose? We
<hi>laying down</hi> the Divine <hi>Affirmations,</hi> began with
<hi>the first;</hi> and now begin the Divine <hi>Ablations</hi>
or <hi>takings</hi> away with the <hi>last.</hi> I answer; That
was because <hi>putting Down</hi> or describing, that
which was <hi>Above all Affirmation</hi> or <hi>Position,</hi> it
was fit <hi>to Begin</hi> and <hi>Establish</hi> the Fundamental
<hi>Affirmations</hi> from that which is <hi>most Proper,</hi> and
<hi>Nearest</hi> unto it. But now when we go by way
of <hi>Taking away</hi> from that which is <hi>Above All</hi>
Ablation or <hi>taking Away,</hi> it is likewise <hi>fit</hi> we
should <hi>begin</hi> our takings away, at <hi>Those things</hi> that
are <hi>furthest</hi> temote from it.</p>
                        <p>For is He not, <hi>Rather</hi> and more properly <hi>Life</hi>
and <hi>Goodness,</hi> then <hi>Aire</hi> or <hi>A Stone?</hi> And may it
not <hi>Rather</hi> and more <hi>Properly</hi> be said, that he is
not <hi>Weak</hi> or <hi>Angry,</hi> then that he is not <hi>Spoken,</hi>
nor <hi>Understood?</hi>

                     <head>Dr. Everards ADVICE upon these
following Sentences in Latin
and English.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>REad not</hi> what follows, till thou have
<hi>Read</hi> and <hi>Felt,</hi> and dost <hi>Understand</hi>
what goeth before: For here follow
certain <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Notable</hi> sayings,
whereby the <hi>diligent</hi> Disciple of Christ may <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine</hi>
himself, and know what is to be thought
or determinated of the True and Inward Union
to the <hi>Onely</hi> and <hi>Supreme</hi> Good, that we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from our selves; and being dead to our own
will, may live to God alone, and to his will: Grant
it, O God, by him which resigned up his own
will to his Heavenly Father, who liveth and
reigneth with the Holy Spirit in a perfect Trinity
for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These, in regard of their succinct and pithy
shortness, they were hard to be understood, if
put into so few words as the Latin: I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not onely translated them into English, but
also annexed the Latin to them, that where the
one Language shall be obscure, it may be helped
by the other.</p>
                     <p>1. DEus est unicus, &amp; unitas existit, &amp; manat ab
eo solo: nec tamen de eo; alioquin enim decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sceret
fieretque minor.</p>
                     <p>1. God is onely One, and Unity is in him, and
flows from him alone: yet not of him, nor any
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:46362:446"/>
way from him; otherwise it would <hi>decrease,</hi> and
become less.</p>
                     <p>2. Ubi sunt duo, quae una servari, aut convenire
oportet, fieri potest ut inter ea oriatur discordia.</p>
                     <p>2. Where there are two things that must be
kept or agree together, it may come to pass that
discord or dissention may arise between them.</p>
                     <p>3. Haec duo non nisi voluntate dissidere possent, id
quod esset summa causa &amp; occasio omnis dissidii,
etiam in Deo, sit duo possent esse in eo.</p>
                     <p>3. These two could not disagree, but in Will,
which would be the <hi>greatest</hi> cause and occasion of
all discord or disagreement Even in God, if Two
things could be in him.</p>
                     <p>4. Nihil enim est quod dissentionem pariat inter
omnia quae dissentire queant, nisi dissimilitudo volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum.</p>
                     <p>4. For there is nothing can breed <hi>dissention</hi>
among all things that can <hi>disagree,</hi> but the
<hi>dissimilitude</hi> and unlikeness of wills.</p>
                     <p>5. Hoc unum (Deus) vult unum, estque omnibus
binis contrarium.</p>
                     <p>5. This one (God) willeth One thing, and is
contrary to all Two things.</p>
                     <p>6. It aque ergo quicquid etiam creavit ipse super
unico illo creavit; alioquin ei defuisset ordo.</p>
                     <p>6. Therefore also, whatsoever he <hi>created,</hi> he
created upon, or To that One alone; otherwise
it had wanted order.</p>
                     <p>7. Praeterea nullam potuisset ejus creatio sive
creatares habere consubstantiam, propter volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
contrariam. quemadmodum videlicet nunc fit
ideoque eam interire oportuisset.</p>

7. Moreover, <hi>His Creation</hi> or created thing,
could have had no <hi>constancy,</hi> because of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Will, to wit, as it is now done; therefore
it must needs have dyed.</p>
                     <p>8. Ea unit as metiri, cogitari, tractari, cognos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
non poterat, nisi duntaxat ab uno, &amp; per unum,
idque interdum in suo contrario.</p>
                     <p>8. That Unity could not be measured,
thought, handled or known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but onely of One,
and by One, and that sometime in its contrary.</p>
                     <p>9. Contrarium existit a se ipso sine culpa adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarii.</p>
                     <p>9. The contrary is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or exists of it self, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the fault of the Adversary,</p>
                     <p>10. Hinc apertissime perspici potest oportuisse ut
uni &amp; optimo esset aliquod objectum, ex quo illud
quoad ejus fieri posset disceretur.</p>
                     <p>10. Hence it may be most plainly perceived,
that there must have been to that One and BEST
some object from which that might be, as much
as were possible, learned.</p>
                     <p>11. Id objectum fuit, &amp; est omnium animalium
essentia &amp; esse.</p>
                     <p>11. That object was, and is the essence and
being of all living creatures.</p>
                     <p>12. Maxime &amp; optime in rationali, &amp; per ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale
animal, qui Adamus fuit.</p>
                     <p>12. Most of all and best, in and by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
creature, which was <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. Hic se videndam exhibet omnipotentia &amp;

13. Here shews it self to be seen the Almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Mercy, and Infinite goodness of the
highest, whose name is the Lord.</p>
                     <p>14. Ad majorem insuper cognitionem liberum
creavit quod creavit; quoniam quod ita liberum

                     <p>14. Furthermore, to the greater knowledge,
he Created FREE that which he Created: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that which so was, is, and abideth Free,
cannot naturally create or make any thing proper:
Now also, that which is free, cannot in any thing
put forth or shew it self to be seen more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
then in its object.</p>
                     <p>15. Qui aliquid quod liberum est, &amp; esse debet,
concludit, propriumque facit, is contra eum facit qui
illud liberum fecit, &amp; creavit; hoc est pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</p>
                     <p>15. He that concludes or shuts up, or makes
Proper any thing which is, or ought to be Free,
He doth against Him which hath made and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that free; this is sin.</p>
                     <p>16. Peccatum clarissime cognoscendum est, id si
perfecte odisse velis.</p>
                     <p>16. Sin is clearly to be known, if thou wouldst
hate it perfectly.</p>
                     <p>17. Odium situm est in contrario, quod vere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatur
semen Dei, sicut imago Dei, quae libertatem
cupit sine intermissione.</p>
                     <p>17. Hatred is placed in the contrary, which is
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:46362:448"/>
Truly named, the <hi>Seed</hi> of God, or the <hi>Image</hi> of
God, which desireth Liberty without intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <p>18. Hoec durat &amp; est, &amp; duret necesse est,
quamdiu est, in eo quod ipsa est, &amp; esse, &amp; manere
potest: est enim ab uno, nec unquam se depelli
patietur.</p>
                     <p>18. This (<hi>Seed</hi> or <hi>Image</hi> of God) continueth,
and is, and must of necessity continue, as long as
God can both be and continue, in that which it
is: for it is from the ONE, Neither doth it ever
suffer it self to be driven or expulsed from
thence.</p>
                     <p>19. Ut ea &amp; cite &amp; rite instauretur, interponit
se unum illud perfecte ad illud omne quod a se dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctum
est in integrum restituendum.</p>
                     <p>19. To the intent, That that <hi>Image</hi> of God,
may be both quickly and duly <hi>Restored,</hi> there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposes

again, all that is disjoyned from it self.</p>

unitatis.</p>
                     <p>20. This could not be done, but in a certain
THING, that must liken it to that which is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
but without all loss of Unity.</p>
                     <p>21. Id oportuit, &amp; necesse fuit, ut seipsum qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus
unum est, &amp; solum unicum apertissime de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clararet,
quo libertas in statum suum rediret, quem
tamen nunquam amiserat.</p>
                     <p>21. It behoved and was needful, that That
should most openly declare it self, in as much as
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:46362:448"/>
it is One, and onely One, to the intent that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
might return into its state which yet is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lost.</p>
                     <p>22. Hinc illud, videlicet Iesus Christus Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus
longe liberrimam voluntatem docuit exercuit,
habuit atque usurpavit.</p>
                     <p>22. Hence that, Namely Jesus Christ of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,
Taught, Exercised, Had and Used, A most
perfect Free-wil.</p>
                     <p>23. Hoc non erat ejus (quemadmodum ipse te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statur)
sed Unius illius a quo id acceperat, ut id per
eum patefiret.</p>
                     <p>13. This was not His (as himself witnesseth)
but that ONES, From whom He had received
it, that by Him it may be made manifest.</p>
                     <p>24. Nec tamen eo privari poterat, tum propter
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us, tum ob perfectionem quam necesse erat ut ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beret
propter libertatem, ut eam optime (sicuti par
erat) declararet.</p>
                     <p>24. Yet could He not be deprived thereof, as
well because of his Right, as of the Perfection
which it was necessary He should have, because
of the <hi>liberty,</hi> That he might (as it was meet)
best declare it.</p>
                     <p>25. Omnium in eo perfectissimum fuit integra
&amp; omnibus numeris absoluta unitio voluntatis, quae
sibi id non arrogavit a quo erat ipse unum; alioquin
discessisset uni.</p>
                     <p>25. The perfectest thing of all in him, Was
the Free, Intire, and most absolute Uniting of the
will, which arrogated not that to himself, from
whence himself was the ONE; otherwise he had
departed from the One.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="434" facs="tcp:46362:449"/>
26. Nunc extat adhuc (quemadmodum jam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatum
est) liberum illud quod admittendum non
est; perdidisset enim illa aliquid quod in nihilum
abisset, &amp; aliquid fuisset, unde consequi posset ut
totum eodem pacto periret.</p>
                     <p>26. Now there is yet extant (as is already
shewn) That Free Thing which is not to be lost;
Otherwise it would bring loss to the Divinity
from which it is, and whose Property it is; for
that had lost something, which had Vanished into
Nothing, and there had been Something, from
whence it might have followed; That the whole
should perish after the same manner.</p>
                     <p>27. Ut igitur id fiat, necesse fuit secundum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar
(quod perfectissimum esse propter officium ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
est) fiat, idque plane ad arbitrium &amp; volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem
unius quod nunquam a seipso discorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</p>
                     <p>27. That that therefore may be done, it is
necessary that it be done according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
(which must needs be most perfect, because
of the duty thereof) and that wholly after the
will and arbitriment of the One which never
disagreed from it self.</p>
                     <p>28. Hoc est, &amp; vocatur redire ab omni dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente
in unicum quod per omnem vitam studendum
est; qui vult, potest; qui id non credit, tentet.</p>
                     <p>28. This is, and is called to return from every
disagreeing thing, to the One and Onely, which
during all a mans life, is to be studied: He that
will, Can; He that believes it not, let him try.</p>
                     <p>29. Hoc potest, &amp; oportet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ejus quod uni contrarium est; alioquin non potest: ea
est obedientia in obedientia, videlicet integra tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,

est; breviter is Christus est verus Dei Filius,
primogenitus fratrum, cujus proprium est, quicquid

unicum possis, &amp; necessario debeas ad unicum, hoc est
ad Patrem venire, qui Pater eum huic rei destinavit.</p>
                     <p>29. This may and must be done Onely by the
losing of that which is contrary to the One;
otherwise it cannot; that is Obedience in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
to wit, An Intire Resignation, A certain
Perfect <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which is Voluntary: Briefly,
that Christ is the true Son of God, the first begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of his Brethren, To whom it is Proper what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

by whom alone thou mayest, and necessarily must

                     <p>IN conclusion, I will hereunto <hi>Annex</hi> the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Iohn Denqui,</hi> concerning the holy
Scriptures, made in his Recantation, not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death, and printed.</p>
                     <p>I do (saith he) prefer the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> before
all <hi>Humane Treasure:</hi> yet so that I do not <hi>so much</hi>
esteem them, as <hi>the Word</hi> of God which is <hi>Living,
Potent</hi> and <hi>Eternal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and which is Free, and at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from all the <hi>Elements</hi> of this world: for if that
be God himself, it follows that it is <hi>Spirit</hi> (not the
Letter) <hi>written without pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> or ink:</hi> so that it can
never be <hi>Obliterated:</hi> And for this cause, <hi>True feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi>
or the <hi>word of God,</hi> is not tyed to the Letter
of the Scriptures: The reason is, because <hi>it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi>
that by the Scriptures alone, an <hi>Evil</hi> mind
should be <hi>Amended,</hi> though it may be made <hi>more</hi>
learned: but a <hi>good</hi> mind that is, such <hi>A One</hi> as is
endued with any spark of <hi>Divine study</hi> or <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
is made better by All things: so that the
Holy Scriptures are <hi>Clean to them that are Clean,
Good</hi> and <hi>wholsom (i. e.</hi>) to those endued with the
Holy Spirit: but to the <hi>Unclean</hi> and <hi>Unbelievers,</hi>
they (as all things else) are <hi>Unclean</hi> and <hi>Deadly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus then it is possible, that a man <hi>chosen</hi> by
God, may be <hi>saved</hi> without <hi>Preaching,</hi> or the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:46362:451"/>
Scriptures: yet it follows not, that therefore no
<hi>witness</hi> taught of God is to be heard, or that the
Scriptures are not to be <hi>Read</hi> and <hi>Enquired</hi> into:
but on the other side, that all <hi>Unlearned Illiterate
men</hi> are not in the state of <hi>Damnation,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot Read: neither <hi>whole</hi> Cities and
Nations sometimes, because they have No <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi>
sent them from God: Thus far He.</p>
                     <p>All these things aim at this, That we should
by a <hi>Received power</hi> from God, do our endeavour
to hunger for God and his word: and not go on
<hi>so securely</hi> with the <hi>Killing Letter</hi> of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:
but giving them all <hi>Convenient Honour,</hi>
should grant them to be a certain <hi>Image, Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
Lanthorn, Scabbard, Manger,</hi> and <hi>Vestry</hi>
of the Word: but withal should know, that
there is <hi>more</hi> required; namely <hi>A Sword</hi> to this
<hi>Scabbard, A light</hi> to this <hi>Lanthorn,</hi> that it may
<hi>cut</hi> and <hi>shine:</hi> but we know, that whilest these
things are saying, There are some that are much
<hi>Troubled</hi> and <hi>Offended;</hi> as in the case of <hi>Mary,</hi>
Saying, we would <hi>reject</hi> the Scriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we say, There can never be <hi>Too much</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
given; but the truth is, whilest unto the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> as unto <hi>Mary,</hi> is ascribed <hi>the Honour
due</hi> to God <hi>Alone,</hi> it becomes <hi>the Worshipping of
Idols;</hi> and of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as of <hi>Mary,</hi> is made
<hi>a certain</hi> Idol, which is <hi>Put, Honoured, Accounted,
Adored</hi> and <hi>Consulted</hi> with, in the place of God:
The Scriptures indeed, as an Holy thing, ought to
be <hi>a Terror</hi> to men, and to be <hi>Read</hi> with Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Trembling:</hi> and as before is said, <hi>to
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:46362:451"/>
be preferred</hi> above all <hi>earthly</hi> Treasure; but not
made <hi>Equal</hi> to God <hi>and His Word:</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
(as the Law and all things else,) <hi>Are Good
to the Good,</hi> who onely know <hi>How</hi> to use them
<hi>well.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as now adayes, many ignorant people
handle them, and are <hi>conversant</hi> in them; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all doubt, it were <hi>Better</hi> they were <hi>asleep</hi> the
while. For from the wrong understanding and
abuse of them, flow All <hi>Heresies, Sects, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions:</hi>
so that not onely the Jews, but the Turks
also, make them their <hi>Advocates,</hi> and think the
<hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> are the foundation of <hi>Their faith:</hi>
My self know at least twenty <hi>Christian</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
all which <hi>rest upon</hi> the Holy Scriptures, and
every one <hi>Hopes</hi> they are on <hi>their</hi> side; all these
things proceed, Either from <hi>far-fetcht</hi> Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Allegories, <hi>nothing to the purpose,</hi> or from
the <hi>dead Letter</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> or lastly, from a
certain <hi>Arrogance</hi> and <hi>Abuse</hi> of them: Now it is
far better (in many cases) not to use <hi>A thing</hi> at
all, then so to abuse it; therefore I must needs say
<hi>Once again,</hi> that the Scriptures are <hi>Shut</hi> up, and
<hi>Forbidden</hi> to all flesh, because it can Never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them: for to that end, there is required to
them, a <hi>Supernatural, Divine</hi> NEW-MAN, Born
of God, who may <hi>bring</hi> with him to them, <hi>The
light</hi> of the Holy Ghost: Such a man, can <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
Dispose, Understand, Interpret, Place,</hi> and
<hi>Accommodate,</hi> All things, in their <hi>due</hi> places: nay
more, that which is the <hi>Table, Feast</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> of
these <hi>God-born</hi> men, the same is the <hi>Snare, Poyson,</hi>
                        <pb n="440" facs="tcp:46362:452"/>
and <hi>Death</hi> of all <hi>Natural</hi> men.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, As <hi>All Works</hi> before <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi>
are <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Unclean:</hi> so also, To <hi>Read the</hi>
Scriptures, to <hi>praise</hi> God, to <hi>fast, pray,</hi> and the like,
and, not onely to <hi>torture</hi> and <hi>kill</hi> men, or to <hi>steal,</hi>
and the like: for seeing that <hi>whatsoever is not of
faith is sin,</hi> and to the <hi>Unclean</hi> nothing is <hi>Clean,</hi>
but they are <hi>Reprobate to every good work:</hi> It
must needs follow, that all their <hi>Seemingly</hi> good
life, exercises and vertues are <hi>sin,</hi> and nothing but
<hi>dissimulation:</hi> So God doth <hi>often</hi> in Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the <hi>Fasts, Holidays, Sacrifices, Prayers, Praises,
Preachings, Gifts,</hi> and <hi>Charitable Deeds</hi> of the
Pharisees, as well as the <hi>known</hi> and <hi>gross</hi> impieties
of the Publicans: the wicked <hi>words</hi> of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
their <hi>Violences, Usuries, Murthers, Adulteries,
Thefts, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore is Regeneration <hi>Principally</hi> neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
before which <hi>All things</hi> are <hi>alike</hi> sin, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
thou canst <hi>Think, Speak, Do, leave Undone,
Read, Hear, Write, Give, Love, Worship, Will,
Know, Have,</hi> or <hi>Be;</hi> for as to them that <hi>Love</hi> God,
all things are to their <hi>Good:</hi> so to them that love
the world, all things are to their <hi>Evil;</hi> yea, God
himself is to them Perverse, contrary, and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:
and his <hi>True</hi> word is <hi>to them</hi> hateful and <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>
for it is meet, that <hi>to the froward</hi> all things
should fall out <hi>Untowardly:</hi> and to them that are
<hi>Contrary</hi> to God, all <hi>things</hi> should be <hi>Cross:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as they are not <hi>Enough,</hi> so they are not <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes</hi>
good: those Sayings, <hi>Fast, Pray, Give to the
Poor, Read the Scriptures, &amp;c.</hi> But these, before all
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:46362:452"/>
things; Be <hi>Regenerated</hi> and <hi>Born Again</hi> of God
and <hi>his</hi> word: and, then Thou wilt be Fit to do
All things, which <hi>that New-birth</hi> will teach thee,
which <hi>Cannot</hi> Sin: and <hi>whatever thy hand shall
find to do,</hi> thou shalt do it <hi>Well:</hi> for God will
be <hi>present</hi> with thee: for then thou being <hi>Iust,</hi>
shalt do <hi>Iust</hi> things: It is not enough <hi>to do a
thing,</hi> but to do it <hi>Well;</hi> else better be <hi>idle,</hi> and
leave doing: By this means, the <hi>good deeds,</hi> which
<hi>good men</hi> do, are not <hi>rejected:</hi> but onely the <hi>shew</hi>
and <hi>feigning</hi> of good deeds, which that <hi>Herd</hi> of
<hi>Apes</hi> do imitate.</p>
                     <p>It were expedient indeed, to <hi>read</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> all
things, if a man knew how to <hi>read</hi> or <hi>hear:</hi> but
few there are that have <hi>the Art of God</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> and
<hi>read</hi> his word: and far fewer, that can <hi>so pierce</hi>
into this <hi>Thorny-thicket,</hi> that they be not <hi>rent</hi> and
torn: Therefore I will not by these my writings,
<hi>scare any man</hi> from any <hi>right Art</hi> of writing,
learning or reading; but do <hi>admonish all men,</hi> to
see they use and do all things <hi>rightly;</hi> and first
of all in the <hi>word</hi> of God, to grow <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi>
and then at the length we shall know <hi>how</hi> to
<hi>read, do,</hi> and <hi>Use all things profitably:</hi> and then
we may safely <hi>Philosophize,</hi> even in the writings
of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or any others: and like <hi>Natural
Birds,</hi> fly among all the <hi>boughs</hi> and <hi>branches</hi> not
taken: whereas before, we could not <hi>safely</hi> be
conversant, no not in the Sacred Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
without eating <hi>Death</hi> from God and his
word. Briefly, by this you may <hi>See</hi> the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>whole</hi> business; And <hi>be it thus deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;</hi>
                        <pb n="442" facs="tcp:46362:453"/>
Onely the <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Regenerate</hi> man can
and doth use <hi>All things Well,</hi> and with <hi>pleasure</hi>
and <hi>profit</hi> read all Arts, and all Heathen Books:
to him there can be nothing <hi>Prohibited</hi> or <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt;</hi>
He is a certain clean <hi>Bee;</hi> upon what thing
soever <hi>He Sits,</hi> He sucks from it meer <hi>Honey</hi> and
<hi>Life:</hi> yea, even from <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, the old and <hi>Natural</hi> man, which in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is called <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> can use <hi>nothing at
all</hi> well: and to him all Arts, and all the <hi>Nature</hi>
of things, nay, the very <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and God
<hi>Himself</hi> and <hi>His Word,</hi> do bring <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Evil:</hi>
He can neither <hi>Do,</hi> nor <hi>Read,</hi> nor <hi>Know</hi> any thing
<hi>Profitably</hi> or <hi>Pleasing</hi> to God: He is <hi>Abuse</hi> and
<hi>Poyson it self,</hi> and an <hi>Unclean Spider,</hi> which, <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>
where it will,</hi> sucks nothing thence but <hi>Poyson,
Sin, Death,</hi> even out of the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
Out of things <hi>Well done,</hi> out of God and
<hi>His word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So it comes to pass, that to the <hi>wicked</hi> all things
are <hi>deadly</hi> and <hi>forbidden:</hi> such as are <hi>good deeds,</hi>
to <hi>make</hi> or <hi>hear</hi> Sermons, to <hi>read</hi> the Scriptures,
to <hi>do good</hi> to the <hi>poor,</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> to <hi>fast,</hi> and such
like, as is before said: <hi>for to the unclean all things
are unclean and hurtful:</hi> so that it cannot be, but
the things that to <hi>the Good are profitable,</hi> shall be
to them <hi>Unclean</hi> and deadly. Briefly, the good
man, <hi>in point</hi> of God, is never at rest, till being
<hi>Entred</hi> into God, He have lost his own <hi>Pleasure,
Will, Act,</hi> yea, <hi>Himself,</hi> and all <hi>His things</hi> in God:
so that wanting <hi>Sense, Will, Desire,</hi> He doth now
(as the word requires at his hands) <hi>Covet</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:46362:453"/>
so that now God <hi>in him</hi> freely <hi>Wills,
Knows, Desires, Doth, leaves Undone, How, What,
Why,</hi> and to <hi>whom he pleaseth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Summarily, In such a man, God hath <hi>freely</hi>
his <hi>Will, Kingdom, Pleasure, Place:</hi> so that he
is not now, <hi>The man</hi> he was, but is as <hi>A dead man,</hi>
who attributes nothing to himself: yea, <hi>so far</hi>
that God is in him <hi>All things:</hi> God in him
<hi>Loves, Reads, Writes, Preacheth, Gives, Prays,
Hears, Knows,</hi> and is <hi>All things:</hi> and therefore
it is, that the great God, hath determined to
<hi>Crown, own,</hi> or <hi>Reward</hi> Nothing in us, but <hi>His own
work:</hi> the rest, which himself <hi>in us</hi> doth not
<hi>Know, Read, Write, Do, leave Undone, Speak, Preach,
Hear, Think</hi> are Sin: and therefore saith St. <hi>Paul,
Now live not I, but Christ liveth in me:</hi> And I
dare not <hi>Do,</hi> nor <hi>Say</hi> anything which Christ doth
not <hi>Say</hi> or <hi>Do</hi> in me.</p>
                     <p>To this <hi>Iudge</hi> let every man <hi>refer</hi> all his life:
he shall then soon find in what <hi>estate</hi> all his <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs</hi>
are, and to whose <hi>Service</hi> he hath addicted
himself, and offered his members <hi>as a living sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:</hi>
Let him <hi>observe himself,</hi> and understand
who it is that <hi>worketh</hi> in him: And That <hi>he to
whom</hi> he liveth and beareth <hi>fruit,</hi> His <hi>Servant</hi> he
is. Now the <hi>fruits</hi> of the two <hi>Masters</hi> are reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in the Epistle to <hi>Gal. 5. 22. The fruit of the
spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, &amp;c. against
such there is no Law: and they that are Christs,
have crucified the flesh with the affections and
lusts: if we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:46362:454"/>
spirit, &amp;c.</hi> I would be glad <hi>with all my heart,</hi> if by
the <hi>help</hi> of God, I might have <hi>so much power</hi> as to
drive all <hi>natural men</hi> from their <hi>good Deeds, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Omissions, Life, Arts, Reading, Writings,</hi> and
the rest, unto God the <hi>True Sabbath:</hi> that lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>feet,</hi> and utterly <hi>void</hi> of will,
<hi>Art, Desire,</hi> they might keep <hi>Holy-day</hi> from their
own works: Truly, then God (which otherwise
<hi>goeth not forth</hi> in our strength) would <hi>go forth</hi> in
them with great <hi>strength:</hi> for indeed God <hi>must
and will</hi> go forth (and the time is at hand) <hi>that
the heavens must keep Holy day;</hi> as it is in that
pious and precious proverb, <hi>All things must be
comprehended, and keep Sabbath; there must be no
going up, no running out, nor no work done;</hi> Seeing
God desires not <hi>Our works,</hi> but <hi>Our Sabbath;</hi> and
that himself in us, <hi>Free</hi> and None <hi>Hindring</hi> him,
a MASTER and a GOD, may <hi>Work, Know,
Love, Praise, Pray, Hear, Crown,</hi> and <hi>Reward
HIMSELF</hi> in us.</p>
                     <p>Beloved, without all doubt, this is the ONE,
and <hi>Onely</hi> thing that pleaseth him: And he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<hi>All Flesh,</hi> that in Divine matters, it never
<hi>Stir it self,</hi> or desire any thing: And therefore
it is, that I in this Book have <hi>Robbed</hi> man of all,

<hi>Precious</hi> Riches, that he had in <hi>Divine</hi> businesses,

All these must we <hi>Unlearn;</hi> from all these must

The unspeakable and super-abounding love of the

Ardent and Pleasant Turning, all our powers and

Most-glorious Trinity hath predestinated
us, Namely, from the love of This deceitful world, to
the enjoyment of Himself, and to all His Riches and
