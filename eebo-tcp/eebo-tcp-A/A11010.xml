         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Euen ſo it is with all ſciences, if they be ſeuered from the

it a man to knowe the height of the Heauens, the

man to ſeeke by Phyſick to prolong afraile temporall life
to the bodie, if his conſcience tell him in the mean-tyme
that his ſoule ſhall periſh for euer? What auailes it a man

God himſelfe is the Author of this ſcience, he reueiled it.

faithfull preachers of the Goſpell, who preaſed in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes

ROLLOCK, that faithfull and reuerent ſeruant of Ieſus

tell if vpon any almeſt in this Land the Lord beſtowed
greater aboundance and varietie of graces of his Spirite,
if in any there was a more ſpirituall and heauenly

O what and how many giftes and graces were in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that man! in conceiuing he was quick, in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſolide, he vttered the Word with great libertie, he
preached with euidence and demonſtration of the Spirit
and power: in opening vp of the text and raiſing groundes
of doctrine he had a ſpeciall grace, in teaching he was
cleare and ſententious, in conuincing, powerfull: in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
earneſt and pithie: in correcting vehement: who
for graces being in account and honoured was more
humble? <hi>(&amp; rara virtw humilitas honorata)</hi> who being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
was leſſe vindictine? who preaſed more to keepe
the chaire of Veritie cleane from corrupt paſſions, that
the word of God might haue free paſſage and be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Who ſought the world leſſe? Who eſtemed leſſe of
theſe earthly thinges: For he behaued himſelfe as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſeruant of God, not ſeeking himſelfe, but Ieſus Chriſt,
as a pilgrime heere, yea and crucified to the world: for
knowing that here he had no continuing cittie, he ſought
for one to come he had his conuerſation in heauen, from
whence he looked for Ieſus Chriſt his Sauiour to come.

in his companie and conference, ſet your ſelfe in all
thinges to pleaſure him, what teſtimonies of true loue
and vnfained kindneſſe ye would haue vttered to him,
how freely for the loue of Ieſus ye would haue communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to him temporall thinges, (if that man, who was ſo
well content with that he had, could haue ſuffered you,
and had not ſtayed the courſe of your liberalitie.) Alſo
when that laſt meſſenger and fore-runner of death did
ſeaſe vpon his fraile and weakned bodie, few are ignorant
how carefull ye were for his greater eaſe to haue him
tranſported to your owne houſe: How liberallie ye and
your bed-fellow (whoſe praiſe ought not nor ſhall not be
buried in obliuion) beſtowed on him all thinges neceſſare
and commodious, how chearefully ye receiued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
for his cauſe all them that came to viſite him,
and what great benefite ye counted the Lord beſtowed on
you in that he offered the occaſion, which long ye wiſhed
to ſhowe your liberalitie in temporall thinges towardes
ſuch a rate veſſell of mercie and faithfull ſeruant of Ieſus
from whom he had receiued ſo many ſpirituall thinges.
Againe who is ignorant, what affection and kyndneſſe ye
haue vttered and daily vtters towardes his relict and poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume
for his cauſe yea and towardes all theſe who loued
him in Chriſt. Next, to paſſe by that M. ROLLOCK in
<pb facs="tcp:16659:5"/>
teſtimonie of his loue dedicate to you his commentare
in Latine on the ſecond of theſe Epiſtles, as alſo that in
his Teſtament he ordeined that all his bookes which he
left to be printed after his deceaſe ſhould be dedicate to
you, and come out vnder your name and patrocinie, that
whoſoeuer gote commoditie thereof, next after God,
might giue the honour and thankes vnto you, after a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
ſort this worke requyres your patronage. For throgh
your care, moyen and expenſes theſe Lectnres were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
and gathered from the handes of theſe who wraite
them from his mouth, by your moyen and procurement
they were reuiſed, corrected, and made apt for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
by your meanes they now ſee the light, which they
had neuer ſeene, but had bene buried in darkneſſe, if the
Lord had not made you an inſtrument to publiſhe them.
Laſt, if that the paines which hath bene taine in reuiſing,
correcting and making them apt for the printing might
yeelde any right to make choiſe of a patrone to this work,
we would not, nor could not offer it to any, but to you,
Sir, not onely becauſe of the vndeſerued loue and kynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ye vtter daily towardes vs, yea and towardes all the
ſeruants of Chriſt, both publikly and priuily as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

to mooue vs to vndertake ſuch traueiles. Indeeed ſuch a
propine is farre inferior either to your deſertes or our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire:
and therefore we preſent it, not ſo much thinking
thereby to diſcharge and ſatiſfie the debt, as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our obligation to you, and to be a teſtimonie of our
thankfulneſſe.</p>
            <p>For theſe cauſes, Sir, we deſire you to receiue this work
in your patronage and protection, to defend it from the
ſpeaches of ſuch as hes not learned yet to ſpeake well of
any perſon or their workes. For we are not ignorant how

much and oft they who ſet forth other mens works vſe to
be ſubject to the ſharpe cenſure of men, and how little
thankes commonly, either they get, or may looke for of
many, ſo that few would be found to take trauaile in them,
except they were rather moued through the loue of the
glorie of God, and edification of his Church, then throgh
any thankfulneſſe they may expect at mens hands. Laſt,
Sir, wearie not in wel-doing, goe forward to doe good
vnto the Saintes for Chriſts ſake, and experience ſhall
giue you a proofe of the Lords loue and bleſſing vpon
your bodie, ſoule, and actions in this life, his Saints ſhall
loue you, his ſeruantes ſhall pray for you that ye may
finde mercy in that great day, and when ye haue run out
your courſe, when your journay ſhall be ended, when ye
haue foughten out the battaile, the Lord ſhall then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you to his Saints and crowne you with glorie. Now
the God of al conſolation, Lord of Lords, and King of
kings, bleſſe you with al benefits ſpiritual and temporal,
direct you by his ſprit, and preſerue you long to the glorie
of his Name, and to he well of his Church, that your
pilgrimage being ended ye may with joy reſt from your
labours in Ieſus, in whoſe countenance is ſacietie of joyes,
and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for euer more,

OF THE FIRST EPISTLE TO
THE THESSALONIANS.</head>
               <p>THESSALONICA was a cheefe City of Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
rich, populous, and puiſſant, builded by <hi>Philip</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, King of Macedonia, after
the victory he had gotten ouer Theſſalia inuaded by him
at vnawares. For returning home victorious he builded a Citty
and named it Theſſalonica, that it might be a perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
of that great and excellent victory he had obtained. <hi>Paul</hi>
(as ye may read Act. 16. and 17. chapters) in his peregrination
together with <hi>Sylas</hi> (who in this Epiſtle is named <hi>Syl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſixteenth yeere after his conuerſion, being called by a viſion
to preach the Goſpell in Macedonia came firſt to Philippi, and
next paſſing through Amphipolis and Apollonia came to this
Cittie Theſſalonica, and entering in the Synagogue of the Iewes
three Sabboth dayes diſputed with them, prouing by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that it behoued the Meſſias to ſuffer and riſe againe from
the dead, and therefore that Chriſt whom he preached was the
true Meſſias and Redeemer of the world. At the which preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſundrie of the Iewes that dwelt at Theſſalonica be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
and joyned company with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> together with
a great multitude of the Grecians, and many of the cheefe we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Cittie. But the Iewes that beleeued not, moued with
inuy, raiſed a great perſecution againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> whereby he was
forced to flee to Berea: where he preached the Goſpell with
better ſucceſſe: For the Iewes of that Synagogue receiued the
word with al readines, and tryed his doctrine by the Scriptures,
ſo that many of them, &amp; likewiſe many men and wemen among
the Grecians were conuerted. Yet the obſtinate Iewes there
alſo mouing perſecution againſt him, he is brought to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb facs="tcp:16659:7"/>
to Athens, where he waited for <hi>Sylas</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> who
returned vnto him when he was in Corinth in Achaia Act. 18. 5.
Therefore it was reported to him that the brethren that beleued
at Theſſalonica wer heauily perſecuted by the obſtinate Iewes:
where-vpon the Apoſtle was moued with an earneſt deſire to
come to them, but he was hundred by Satan. 1. Theſſa. 2. 18.
Therefore tarying himſelfe at Athens he ſent <hi>Timothie</hi> to them
(1. Theſſa. 3. 2.) to comforte them in their trouble, and confirme
them in the trueth. <hi>Timothie</hi> returning and bringing good ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges
to him of the great grace of God that he found with
them, becauſe he could not come himſelfe; the more to comfort,
confirme and encouradge them to continue in the trueth, he
writes vnto them this Epiſtle, which by the judgement of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

to vs doctrine ſeruing for vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
inſtruction, admonition, conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp;c. Then to come to the purpoſe
ſhortlie: We ſhall ſpeak ſomething of theſe Theſſalonians to
whom he wrytes; of the Argument of this Epiſtle, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of the Apoſtle in it. The Theſſalonians were thoſe, who
inhabited a towne called Theſſalonica, which (as the Hiſtorie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16659:9"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſounded and builded by <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedonia, after the
victorie he had gotten ouer Theſſalia; for returning home vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
he builded at towne, and named it Theſſalonica, to be
a perpetuall memorie of that excellent victorie he had obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But to leaue this: <hi>Paul</hi> (as ye may read, in the 17. Chap. of
the Acts of the Apoſt.) in his peregrination together with
<hi>Sylas,</hi> who is heere named <hi>Siluanus,</hi> comes to this towne in
Macedonia, called Theſſalonica, and entring into the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
of the Iewes, three Saboth dayes preached vnto them,
and all his preaching tended to this, to proue that it behoued
the Meſſias when he ſhould come in the World, firſt to ſuffer,
then to ryſe againe in glorie: Vpon this he ſubſumes that that
Ieſus whom he preached, had ſuffered, had riſen vp in glorie;
And therfore he concludes, that Ieſus, and no other, to be the
Meſſias and Redeemer of the World. At <hi>Paules</hi> preaching,
ſundrie of the Iewes who dwelt in Theſſalonica were conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
a great multitude alſo of the Grecians who abode there,
and of the chiefe women of the towne, not a few: Yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of all this, ſedition is moued againſt the Apoſtle, and
that by certaine obſtinate Iewes, who would not be conuerted:
ſo he is compelled to flee out of Theſſalonica, fleeing he comes
to Beroea, where he gets better entertainment, and conuertes
ſundrie:<note place="margin">Occaſion of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle.</note> Yet perſecution ryſes, and he is led to Athens, where
he abiding, word comes to him, that the Brethren who were
conuerted at Theſſalonica, were heauilie troubled, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
by the obſtinate Iewes there. Vpon this the Apoſtle
ſendeth <hi>Timothie</hi> to them, to confirme them, and comfort them
in their trouble. <hi>Timothie</hi> returning, and reporting the grace of
God he ſaw there, <hi>Paul</hi> would haue gone to Theſſalonica, but
as he ſayeth, Sathan withſtoode him, and therefore he takes
purpoſe to write this Epiſtle vnto them, which ſhould be in
ſteede of his preſence. This is the occaſion of the writing of
this Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>Then to come to the Epiſtle it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Partes of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</note> and to ſpeak of the parts
thereof. Firſt, there is a ſalutation: after the ſalutation, he hath a
congratulation, and rejoyſing with them, for the graces he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode
to be in them, by the report of <hi>Timothie.</hi> He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16659:9"/>
his congratulation a long tyme, almoſt to the end of the
ſecond chapter. Then he comes to his exhortation, and exhorts
them (notwithſtanding of al trouble) to preſeuere conſtantlie to
the end. This he doth in the third chapter: In the fourth and fift
chapters he comes to the matter; and as before he had exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to perſeuerance: ſo he exhorts them to godlineſſe
and holineſſe of life, ſuch as becomes them, who haue receyued
the Lord Ieſus. This is the ſubſtance of the Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>Now in this chapter: Firſt, we haue the ſalutation, then the
congratulation, and rejoyſing for the graces of God in them;
which continewes all this chapter, and the moſt part of the next
chapter. Now to come to the ſalutation, wherein the Apoſtle
ſalutes the Theſſalonians: I will ſpeake ſhortlie of it, becauſe it
is a common forme vſed by the Apoſtle in his Epiſtles, and
hath beene oft exponed. The perſons from whom this ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
comes, are <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle, <hi>Siluanus</hi> &amp; <hi>Timotheus,</hi> two Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts:
They who are ſaluted, are the Theſſalonians, that is, the
Church of God, that was made vp of the Theſſalonians, who
were inhabitants of this towne of Theſſalonica<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The bleſſings,
or good things that are wiſhed from <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt, to the
Church at Theſſalonica, are grace, and peace: the Author of
this grace and peace, from whom, as from the fountaine, <hi>Paul</hi>
with the reſt of his aſſociates, wiſheth theſe things to the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,
is the Father firſt: the Sonne our Lord Ieſus next. The
cauſe wherefore grace and peace is wiſhed from the Father
and the Sonne to the Theſſalonians, is, becauſe the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
ſtoode in that bleſſed conjunction with the Father, and
the Sonne, and therefore it is ſaid in the text, <hi>To the Church of
Theſſalonica,</hi> which is <hi>in God the Father, and in the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt,</hi> that is to ſay, which is in that holie ſocietie, and conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with the Father and the Sonne.</p>
               <p>Now to marke ſomething of the ſalutation.<note place="margin">Note.</note> This forme of ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lutation
that is vſed in this place, and in other places, by this &amp;
other Apoſtles: al theſe general ſalutations vſed by godlie men,
vnto godlie men; what are they? they are teſtimonies of that
good minde, and good-will, that the godlie beares to the godly:
They are more too; they are meanes and powerful inſtruments
ordained by God, wherby the grace of God, the mercie of God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16659:10"/>
in Chriſt, is conuoyed from God, &amp; Chriſt to them, to whom the
ſalutation is directed. There are many meanes, whereby grace
is conuoyed from God to man, amongſt all the reſt, theſe ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are meanes ordained by God, to that end. Brethren, it is
no ſmall matter to wiſhe well to a man or woman, if thou
haue a godlie heart when thou wiſhes well to a godlie perſon,
of neceſſitie the affection of thy heart and mouth muſt bee
effectuall.</p>
               <p>The to goe fordward. Grace and Peace, is wiſhed. But
from whome? <hi>From God the Father, and from the Sonne Ieſus
Chriſt.</hi> The Sonne muſt not bee forgote heere, becauſe all
grace is geuen in him by the Father; in ſuch ſorte, that if any
man will ſeeke grace without Chriſt, hee ſhall neuer get it.
Therefore he who would haue grace, let him ſeeke it at God,
through Chriſt: that he may receyue it of that fulneſſe that is
in the Sonne. The Iew that will ſeeke to the Father without
the Sonne, ſhall neuer ſee grace.</p>
               <p>Whom to is this grace and peace wiſhed? to the Church at
Theſſalonica. Wherefore? Marke this ground. Becauſe this
Church is ingraft in the Father and in the Sonne by faith. Then
firſt I ſee here: there is no grace, but from the Father and the
ſonne: and therefore there no wiſhing of grace to man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
but from the Father and the ſonne, who are the fontaine of
all grace. Againe I ſee grace, mercie and peace pertaines to
none, but to ſo many as are in this happie conjunction with the
Father and the Son. Art thou in the Father? Art thou in the ſon,
ingraft in him by a liuelie faith? Then grace pertaines to thee:
mercie and peace pertaines to thee. Art thou out of him, and
not ingraft in him by faith? Let men wiſh welfare and peace to
thee as they will, no grace, mercie nor peace pertaines to thee.
By grace &amp; peace is vnderſtood whatſoeuer bleſſings of God
that followes on that conjunction and vnion that is with God
the Father, and the Son Ieſus Chriſt; As for exemple: Remiſſion
of ſins, Iuſtification before the Tribunall of God, Regeneration
&amp; clenſing of this foull nature, peace, joy in the holie Ghoſt, &amp;
life euerlaſting: all flowes from this conjunction: and therfore
it muſt follow, that to him who is out of this conjunction with
the Father and the Sonne, there is no remiſſion of ſinnes: if thou
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16659:10"/>
be not vnited to the Father and the Sonne by faith; no ſaluation,
no regeneration, no life euerlaſting, no peace for thee: all thy
peace is falſe peace, and thou ſhalt curſe the tyme that euer thou
had that peace. Then it muſt follow that this forme of ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
pertaines not to the Iew this day, who is out of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
neither I, nor no man can ſay to the Iew this day, Peace
and grace to thee from God the Father and from Chriſt Ieſus
his Sonne: neither pertaines it to the Turke or Pagane, who are
out of this vnion with God and Chriſt by faith. More then this,
it will not be the name of any thing that will do the turne: there
are many that taks vpon them the name of a chriſtian, &amp; ſo will
ſeeme to be in the vnion with the Father and the Sonne, that in
heart haue no conjunction with them: But I ſay to thee, it will
not be the outwarde conjunction with them, in the name of a
Chriſtian, it will not be the wiſhing of good dayes and good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenings
that wil do thee good, except thou find thy hart bound
vp in that bleſſed vnion with the Father and the Sonne Ieſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Marke an other thing. Learne heere a forme of an effectuall
and pithie ſalutation that the godlie ſhould vſe: firſt, when the
godlie ſalutes, as <hi>Paul, Siluanus</hi> and <hi>Timothie,</hi> when they wiſhe
any thing to thee, what wiſh they? Not any thing thou deſerues,
if thou were neuer ſo holie, but free grace, without any merite,
as <hi>Paul</hi> heere doth: then againe, they wiſh it from them that
hes this grace in their handes, from the Father and the Sonne.
And laſt, they wiſhe it to them who ſtands in the vnion and
conjunction with the Father and the Sonne: for this vnion will
draw down the droppes of grace from the Heauen, from Ieſus
that is full of all grace. Therefore Brethren, theſe ſalutations of
the Heathen &amp; Gentiles, and of prophaine men now, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worth; they were neuer of valure: I will not giue a pennie
for <hi>Cicero</hi> his <hi>ſalutem dicit;</hi> nor <hi>Plato</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe in wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well, they knew not what they wiſhed, they called it wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
well doing: they knew not grace, nor the free mercie of
God: they knew not God, the fountaine of all grace, nor Chriſt
his Son, from whom all grace flowes: they knew not a Church,
nor the conjunction of the bodie, or the members with the
head: ſo their ſalutations were of no value. Euen ſo it is this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16659:11"/>
day with prophaine men, who knowes not God, nor Chriſt nor
the Church, nor knowes not his conjunction, their ſalutations
are not worthie a ſtray; all their good dayes and good euenings
are deare of right noght, for their ſalutations are only prophaine
words, and when they are bleſſing with their mouthes, they are
curſing in their hearts.</p>
               <p>Now, brethren, to goe fordward to the next part, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
this congratulation &amp; rejoyſing together with the Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,
for thoſe graces of God which were beſtowed on them
Ye ſe the words: <hi>We giue God alvvayes thanks for you, making men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of you in our prayers.</hi> In this congratulation he rejoyſes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with them, for the graces the Lord hath ſhowne on them:
in rejoyſing for the graces ſhowne on them he forgets not God
the geuer of all grace, but in rejoyſing with them, he glorifies
God &amp; thanks him for them, and ſo acknowledges al the graces
that were in the Theſſalonians, to flow out of this fountaine, he
acknowledges their faith, their charitie, their hope, not to come
of themſelues, but to be of God: and therefore in rejoyſing with
them, hee geues God the glorie of all the graces that was in
them. Why ſhould wee not congratulate and rejoiſe for the
graces of God we ſe in others? we are bound to doe it. Thou
art obliſht to rejoiſe with him that rejoyſes for the graces of
God geuen him, as if they were geuen to thy ſelfe. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes,
<hi>Reioyce vvith them that reioyſes: mourne vvith them that mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
Rom. 12. 15. Wee are bounde when wee ſee the grace of
God in anie people or nation, to commend it in them: for it is
ſaid trewlie, vvhen grace or vertew is commended, it growes.
But looke that thy rejoyſing, thy commendation of men for
the grace thou ſees in them, be to the end that thou may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
God, who is the Author and fountaine of all the grace,
looke that in commending of men, if it were all the Monarchs
in the earth, on paine of thy lyfe thou forget not God. Looke
firſt vp to the geuer, and then to him who hath receyued: ſay
not, Sir, or my Lord, I commend you for your good witte, and
gouernance, I commend you for your man-hood and wiſdome.
The flattering Gentiles that knew not God ſayes ſo: but thou
who art a Chriſtian ſpeake not ſo to any man: but ſay, I giue
thanks to God who is the fountaine of all grace, for the grace he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16659:11"/>
hes geuen to thee: thou haſt no good grace no wiſdom, no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
&amp;c. but that which God the Author of grace hes geuen
thee: as euer thou would ſee the glorie of that God, who euer
thou be haue thy eye firſt of al, in al thy ſpeaking and doing on
the glorie of that God. I confeſſe there are many impediments
caſten in betwixt thy eyes and the glorie of God, but ſtriue to
get a ſight of that glorie, or elſe thou ſhall neuer be partaker of
that glorie. Thou may haue a ſhadow of glorie in the world for
a while, but as the muſt before the Sunne vaniſhes away, ſo ſhall
thou and thy glorie vaniſh away, to thy euerlaſting confuſion, if
thou ſtriue not to haue the glorie of God before thy eyes. Then
hes thou anie good graces in thy ſelfe? giue God the glory: <hi>What
haſt thou, that thou haſt not receyued?.</hi> 1. Cor. 4. 7. Giue him the
glorie and praiſe of all: if it were eating and drinking at thy
dinner: looke that thou eat to his glorie, and drinke to his glorie
1. Cor. 10. 31. And ſay in the meane-tyme, I doe not this ſo much
to feede this mortall bodie, as I doe it to glorifie thy Majeſtie.
When thou liues, liue to him: deying, die to him; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
thy life and death to him. Fye on vs that can not learne
to giue the glorie of all to our Redeemer. As for mee, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
I craue nothing more, nor that the glorie of God may
ſhine before my eyes in my vocation, that when I ſpeake or
thinke, all maye be to his glorie, that in the end I may haue
this aſſurance that I ſhall bee glorified vvith him for euer.
But yet to ſticke to the wordes: He ſayes not; I giue thanks,
but <hi>vve giue thankes,</hi> I, and <hi>Siluanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus</hi> giue thanks:
Hee ſayes not for an handfull or a certaine nomber of you,
but for <hi>you all.</hi> He ſayes not for a tyme, but <hi>alvvayes.</hi> Marke
all theſe wordes: He ſayes, vve all, and that for all, vve thanke
euer. It is a large thanking, and it teſtifies that the graces
ſhovvne on the Theſſalonians vvere large. When the graces of
God are ſhovvne on me, on thee, or on anie people, thy heart
muſt not bee narrovv, but it muſt bee enlarged, and thy mouth
muſt be oppenned vvyde to praiſe and magnifie God the geuer
of all. Or elſe I aſſure thee, vvhen his grace is large, if thy heart
be narrovv, and thy mouth be oppenned but a little, the Lord
ſhal draw in his hand &amp; diminiſh his grace to thee. So is ſene of
it in Edinburgh this day, the graces of god on thee ô Edinburgh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16659:12"/>
were large, but thy heart was narrow, and thy mouh was not
oppened wide. Therefore the Lord is pinching his graces; if it
ſo continew, woe will be to thee. Go this grace of the Miniſtrie
away, and the Lord cloſe mens mouthes and let them not ſpeak
to thee, all thy grace is gone; and I thinke the Lord is begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to pinche his graces on vs, for that glorious Goſpell
which was preached with great libertie, and was ſo powerfull
in the land, hes loſt the power: and the nomber of the godlie
of the land is contracted, for the one depends vpon the other:
therefore cry, that the Lord may make his grace abound, and
that he would continew with vs the light of his Euangell.</p>
               <p>Now to the next words. He joynes with thankeſ-geuing,
prayer:<note place="margin">Praier ioy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned vvith tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</note> 
                  <hi>Making mention of you in our prayers:</hi> It is not aneugh
to thank God for the grace that eyther we, or others haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued,
but alſo thou muſt pray: Cry for grace and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of grace; for I aſſure thee, if vvith thankeſ-geuing there
be not prayer for continuance, the grace receyued ſhall decay.
Amongſt all the reſt of the meanes the Lord hes appoynted
for continuance of grace, earneſt prayer to God is an eſpeciall
meane. So as thou vvouldſt haue thy ſelfe ſtanding in grace,
pray euer for grace, for there is no moment, but vve are readie to
fall away, except the Lord hold vs vp. The meane to entertaine
grace, is, earneſt prayer. The Lord holde vs vp and let vs not
fall: but if the meane be not vſed, fall ſhall vve, thogh all the
vvorld had ſaid the contrair.</p>
               <p>It is to be marked farther. He ſayes, <hi>in our prayers.</hi> As hee
would ſay, in our daylie prayers we are accuſtomed to pray to
God; in our daylie prayers we forget you not, but we remember
you. Marke this, Brethren. He is not meete to pray for others,
that can not pray for himſelfe, nor hes no acquaintance nor
acceſſe to God. Who can ſoliſt for any man, when he hes no
acceſſe to him vvhom hee foliſts? Canſt thou pray for me to
my God, and thou haue no acceſſe to him? He vvho vvill pray
for others, muſt be vvell acquainted vvith God, and haue a
daylie acceſſe to him. And hovv ſvveete a thing is it to haue
familiar acceſſe to him? for all the joy of the world is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to that joy, which the ſoule findes when it is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
with the Lorde familiarlie: for when thy heart is with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16659:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him, no doubt he is with thee. Alaſſe, beaſtlie man, fy on thee
that euer thou was borne, and thou haue not that ſvveete ſenſe
of joy that flowes from the meditation on the Lord: wilt thou
let thy ſoule be euer ſtupide and ſenſleſſe? vvilt thou neuer be
a Citizen of Heauen, expecting for the glorious comming of
Chriſt, but ay ly as a ſowe, muzling and grountling vpon the
earth? vvilt thou neuer look vp with thy eyes to Heauen? vvilt
thou ay be looking dovvn? If thou doe ſo thou ſhalt fall dovvn
at laſt to that euerlaſting damnation. The Lord raiſe vs vp, for
heauy are we: we are dead lumps ay tending downward &amp; can
get no riſing vp: the Lord raiſe vp our ſoules therfore to heuen.</p>
               <p>Now followes the cauſe wherefore he rejoyſes with them, in
the next verſe. <hi>Without ceaſing, remembring your effectuall faith.</hi>
That is one, <hi>and diligent loue;</hi> that is tvvo: the third is, <hi>and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of your hope in the Lord Ieſus Christ, in the ſight of God, euen,
our Father.</hi> Heere, brethren, not to eſcape the wordes, I ſee, firſt,
an vnceſſant and perfite remembrance of the graces, God hes
geuen his people, as Faith, Charitie and Patience. I ſee, then, in
the example of <hi>Paul, Siluanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> that, in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and heart of the godlie, the graces of God ſhowen, eyther
on themſelues, or others, makes a deepe impreſſion; when they
ſee the graces of God, they take a deepe apprehenſion of them.
In the wicked it is otherwiſe: let God raine down graces from
Heauen on them ſelues and others alſo, as they come, ſo they
goe, they remember neuer a good turne doen to them. Now, on
this remembrance followes prayer, they remember with joy, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
praying, remembring by night, euer praying, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring by
day, euer praying, at leſt, in the hart, if not outwardly in words.
Marke it: a man that would pray wel to God, muſt be of a good
remembrance: vvould thou pray well? remember well: Prepare
thee to pray, by remembrance of the bleſſings of God and pray
then. What matter haſt thou of prayer, when thou remembers
not his bleſſings? So, all tends to this; that, thou be carefull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the bleſſings of God: and as thou remembers, ſay, Lord,
I thanke thee for that bleſſing. I tell thee, the loſing of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the grace of God, ſhowne to thee and others, hes loſt
many graces to thee: if thou remember not the graces bygone,
and be not thankfull for them, the grace of God will grow nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16659:13"/>
and become barren and turne away from thee.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the end ſhortlie, let vs touch the cauſe of
this joy; firſt here are thre graces of god that comes to the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,<note place="margin">Cauſes of thanks giuing faith, hope &amp; charity</note>
wherfore <hi>Paul</hi> thankes God in their behalfe, to witte
faith, charitie and hope. I ſee theſe thre graces recounted by the
Apoſtle in other places: in the 1. to the Cor. cha. 13. 13. <hi>And novv</hi>
ſayes he, <hi>abyds thre things, faith, hope and charitie, but the cheefeſt of
of thoſe is charitie,</hi> becauſe when the reſt go away, it abides in the
life to come: in theſe thre ſtands the perfection of the life of a
chriſtian man, in faith towards God and the Lord Ieſus: begin
at them in this life, begin at God &amp; Chriſt his Son, &amp; be joyned
to him by faith: then come on to loue towards thy neighbour,
loue thy neighbour: woe to thee that loues not thy neighbour:
thou loues not God if thou loue not thy neighbour. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our life is not here, but it is hid vp with God in Chriſt, thou
muſt await for thy life in him, and ſo comes in hope, hope for
thy life in him: theſe thre muſt conuoy &amp; accompany thee heer,
till thou poſſeſſe that life. So faith is the beginning of grace, faith
joynes thee with God throgh Chriſt, with a ſweet conjunction,
whereby all flowes out of him to thee, for as we ſaid in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
no bleſſing but in that conjunction with him. Faith
brings forth charitie, the bud of faith is charitie; and there is ſuch
a ſure bond betwene faith and charitie, that the one can not be
without the other. If thou ſay, thou haſt faith to God, and haue
not loue to the Church, &amp; the reſt of the members of the body,
thou art a lyar. Now the end of all grace in this life, is hope; hope
of ſaluation and glorie, grace in this life ends in hope: it begins
at faith, grows in loue, and ends in hope; &amp; that is the laſt degre,
it goes no farther: for as to ſaluation, thou can not get it heere;
the fartheſt thou can reach to, is to hope, reaching vp to heauen,
expecting that glorie that is appointed to thee there. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
recounting the armor of a chriſtian man. 1. Theſ. 5. 8. ends in
hope, he begins at faith, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to loue, &amp; ends at hope: &amp; ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the graces we haue in the Goſpell, as temperance, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
and godlines; Tit. 2. 13. He ſubjoines: <hi>Avvaiting for
that hope and appearing of that glorie of that great God, and of our
Sauior Ieſus Christ.</hi> Where ye ſee he puts on hope as it were a
crowne on the reſt of the graces: hope, I ſay, is the laſt of all the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16659:13"/>
graces in this earth, and we can go no farther, but in that life to
come farewell hope: for we ſhall get the full ſight and fruition
of all the graces that now we looke for: my eyes ſhall ſe my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. So there the grace of graces in the
other life, ſight: for we liue heerby faith, and not by ſight, but
then we ſhall get that full ſight of glorie, <hi>for vve ſhall ſe him as he
is.</hi> 1. Ioh. 3. 2.</p>
               <p>Yet to ſtick to the words: he ſets out theſe vertues &amp; graces,
not ſimplie, but, he deſcriues ſome one vvay, ſome another way:
and ſo, he cals it not faith, but, effectuall faith, or, vvorking faith:
he ſayes not, loue ſimplie; but, a diligent and labouring loue: and
he cals it not hope ſimplie, but, the patience of your hope: a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
hope,<note place="margin">Faith vvorking</note> a vvorking faith, a laborious loue. Novv, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the exerciſes of euerie one of them. Faith hes her exceriſe,
in vvorking: what vvorks ſhe? working out the filth of nature:
(fy on the foull nature of men &amp; wemen): ſo, that, the exerciſe of
faith in Ieſus, is in cleanſing the foull heart and euerie corner of
it. And therefore, in the chap. 15. verſ. 9. of the Acts, faith is ſaid
to purge the heart: for, by faith, Ieſus dwelles in the heart, and
Chriſt can not be idle, hee will be exerciſed, and he purges out
the foull ſtinke of nature that lyes hid in euerie corner of the
heart. Hee that is not exerciſed in cleanſing of his heart vtters
euidentlie, that, he neuer had faith, ſay vvhat he vvill. This is the
vvorke of faith.</p>
               <p>Novv,<note place="margin">Charitie is laborious.</note> to come to Charitie. Faith is exerciſed inwardlie, in the
hart, Charitie is exerciſed outwardlie, in the hand, and can not be
idle: labouring, not for her ſelfe, but, for me and thee, and thoſe,
that are about her, and he who hes charitie, or, he ſhould not doe
good to his neighbour, he will rather want his hand: fy on them,
who will not worke with their hands, to helpe others. This land
is full of idle men, &amp; ſo, it can not be without judgement, thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
going idle, in all parts, and how can charitie be keeped,
without labour? if thou were a Lord, put to thy hand, and call
to God, for to ſanctifie thy labour, it is vanitie to ſit idle, put to
thy hand and doe good to thy ſelfe, or, ſome others, or, elſe, ſore
ſhall that count be, that thou ſhall make.</p>
               <p>Now, come to hope. What is ſho doing? She is bound vnder
the Croſſe, lying in patience, looking for that glorious reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Act. 14. 22. So thy hope that awaits for the kingdome of God,

preuail: for hope neuer made man to be aſhamed, hope in God
for ſaluation, for he hath promiſed. and is able to performe: and
<hi>hope makes not aſhamed.</hi> Rom. 5. 5. Then to take vp this matter, I
ſee all the graces of God are quick; a dead grace is naught, all
are liuelie, either exerciſed in one exerciſe or other: Faith is
working, Charitie is laborious, Hope is ſuffering, each one hes
their owne exerciſe and therefore let not an ydle bodie that is
not exerciſed in ſanctifying of the heart by faith, of the hand
by charitie, that refuſes ſuffering in hope, let him not thinke he
hes theſe graces of God. Thou that haſt no work, no faith, no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring,
no charitie, thou that can not beare patientlie, and who
at euerie thing comming to thee art readie to diſpare, thou that
can not ly vnder the croſſe, thou hes no hope. And therefore as
thou would finde grace in the life to come, looke that thou be
exerciſed in this life, for if thou be not exerciſed heere, thou
ſhalt enter in that damnation, where there ſhall be no end of thy
labour: &amp; thou that wil be exerciſed in faith, charitie, and hope,
aſſure thee in the life to come, thou ſhall not be pyned with
worke, thou ſhalt ceaſe from thy labour, and the teares ſhall be
wyped from thy eyes, all paine and anguiſh ſhall be put away.
Looke then how ye will ſpend a moment, to eſchew an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
if thou paſſe thy tyme idle, and do no good heere, neither
to thy ſelfe, nor to thy neighbor, thy labour ſhall endure euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinglie.

               <p>In the end of the verſe he places, and groundes this patient

He ſetteth to her witneſſe <hi>God the Father:</hi> He muſt be witneſſe,

the Lord Ieſus, immoueable for euer: who is able to ſhake
him? If my hope be ſet on Ieſus, I defye all the worlde: ſhake
me as thou wilt, no more nor thou is able to moue him out of
his place, no more art thou able to moue my hope out of my

haue a witneſſe, &amp; he who hopes muſt hope before the Father:
for the Father ſeeth all, and there is no ſinceritie but in the Spirit
of God; and thou who wilt hope, conſider God is before thee
looking into thine heart, and haue him euer before thy eyes:
otherwayes, thou ſhalt do nothing in thy life-tyme ſincerelie,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE laſt day, Brethren, we ſpake of the
firſt part of this Epiſtle, written to the
Theſſalonians, to witte, the ſalutation
that the Apoſtle, with <hi>Siluanus</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus</hi>
directs to them. We entered in
the ſecond part, which continewes the
congratulation, wherein he rejoyſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with them, for the graces of God
beſtowed on them: geuing God the glorie of all, making him
the chiefe Author of all grace: Namelie, for their faith which is
imployed in clenſing and purifying their hearts, for their loue
and charitie, which was imployed in laboring with paineful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
for their brethren and nighbours, to their profite and
well: and laſt, for their hope, which was imployed in ſuffering,
and taking things patientlie, grounded on the Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt; hauing God the Father for an witneſſe of her ſinceritie.
This far for the matter going before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:16659:15"/>
Now followes in the fourth verſe, an other cauſe of this
thankeſ-geuing to God, and of this rejoyſing: a more effectuall
cauſe nor any that was named yet: their eternall election be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all worlds. All the graces told before were in tyme, but, as
for this election, it is before all tyme, from all eterni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e: Vpon
this, as vpon a foundation, all grace that is receyued by vs in
tyme is grounded, as ye would ground an houſe vpon an fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:
None getteth faith, but thoſe that are choſen of God
from all eternitie: None true loue, but thoſe whom God loueth
from all eternitie: None hope of lyfe, but thoſe who are choſen
of God from all eternitie: So all grace geuen in tyme, is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on this ground of election that was before all tyme. But to
come to the words: <hi>Knovving</hi> (ſaith the Apoſt.) <hi>brethren beloued
of God, your election.</hi> He ſtyles them brethren firſt, then he calleth
them beloued of God (for, I lyke that reading beſt.) The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is the cauſe of the firſt. Becauſe they are beloued of God,
therefore they are Brethren to him, to <hi>Timothie,</hi> and to <hi>Siluanus:</hi>
Marke this.<note place="margin">Note.</note> Whom God loueth and vpon whom he powreth
forth his grace, as he did on theſe Theſſalonians, we are bound
to loue them, to powre out our affections vpon them, to call
them Brethren in Ieſus Chriſt, to ſpeake kindlie and louinglie
to them: for, the graces of God we ſee in men, hes force to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate
the loue of men; ſo that, men when they ſee them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are bound of dewtie to loue them. If thou ſee the grace
of God in any man; thou art bound to loue the man for the
grace, as thou would vtter thou loueſt God, the geuer of
the grace. The loue thou carries to a man for the graces of God
thou ſees in him, vtters the loue thou carries to God the geuer.
Then we ſhould learne to craue grace, to vtter holie affections
to them to whom the Lord hath geuen his graces, and that, for
the graces God hath beſtowed on them.</p>
               <p>But to go forward. The next thing heere that <hi>Paul</hi> vtters,
is a knowledge of their election. <hi>Knovving your election,</hi> ſayeth
he. This is a farre ſight. Then it is true, brethren, the godlie who
are able through the Spirite of diſcretion, to take vp the grace
of God in others, they haue a great inſight, yea euen to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
election, and predeſtination to that life and glorie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
they are appointed, and they will vtter an wonderfull aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16659:16"/>
thereof. (For the word ſignifies, <hi>Knovving perfitelie your
election)</hi> Indeed a man will haue a greater certaintie of his own
election, then of the election of any other, becauſe the warrand
of his owne election is within him in his owne heart;<note place="margin">Tokens of election.</note> his heart
is ſtamped therewith: he findes the ſeale thereof in his owne
conſcience: as for the election of others, it is onelie outward,
as in his actions and behauiour: by the eye of the godlie, by the
words of the godly and the works of the godlie, and ſuch like
thinges the viſible tokens of the mercie of God in men is
ſhowen: and ſo the Lord makes by ſome outward tokens their
election from all eternitie to appeare.</p>
               <p>There are two things, whereof it is verie hard to judge v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
and to vtter aſſurance of: the firſt is the eternall election of
others: the other is, the perſeuerance of others in grace to the
end: the one bygone from all eternitie, the other to come to the
end. It is very hard to judge of theſe two, in other men eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie:
Yet I ſee the Apoſtle takes on him to judge of both, and
he vtters an aſſurance of both. Ye ſee in this place, he knowes
the election of the Theſſalonians. In the Epiſtle to the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians
1. 6. he is perſwaded, that he who had begun with them
(which is God) would perfite the worke he had begun, to the
comming of Chriſt, that is, that they ſhould perſeuere in the
grace they had receyued vnto the end. The ground of all was,
becauſe of the grace of God he ſaw in tyme of the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
and Philippians: therefore he knowes perfitelie the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians
is elected, and is aſſured the Philippians will perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
and ſtand in grace. So all tends to this, the grace of God
beſtowed on any (if we ſawe but a ſparke of grace in them)
ſhould euer moue vs to judge charitablie, that thoſe perſons
are the elect of God, and will ſtand and perſeuere in grace to
the end. Away then with hard judgements of men.</p>
               <p>More then this (Brethren) ye ſee the Theſſalonians are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted:
yet he prayes for them, <hi>Making mention</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>of you
in our prayers.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Election no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prayer.</note> And for this ſame cauſe; knowing that ye are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
Marke this. The election of God, that ſure ground and
foundation of lyfe and ſaluation, prejudges not prayer. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſay not, I am elected, my ſaluation can not faile, ſaued muſt
I be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> therefore, what needs me to pray my ſelfe, or cauſe any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16659:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pray for me? No, by the contrair, ſay, I am elected, therefore,
I will pray: ye are the elect, therefore, I will pray for you: that
is <hi>Paule</hi> reaſon. For, as ſaluation, and life is predeſtinate and
appointed by God, ſo are the meanes of ſaluation appointed
by God, which thou muſt vſe, if euer thou wouldſt attaine
to lyfe, notwithſtanding of thy election. And among all the
reſt of the meanes, Prayer is one: thou who art choſen to life,
prayers is a meane to thee, to be vſed before thou come to life:
Pray muſt thou, and others muſt pray for thee, or elſe, thou
was neuer choſen to lyfe. There was neuer man choſen to life
from all eternitie; but the Lord appoynted that he ſhould
vſe prayer; alſo God ordained that he ſhould liue in holineſſe,
and vvorke good vvorkes, vvhich is an other meane muſt be
vſed. Epheſ. 2. 10. For, if prayer be not vſed, if hee liue not
holie, if he liue vvithout loue, vvithout charitie and goode
vvorkes, if he continevve ſo to the end, he ſhall finde that he
was neuer choſen.</p>
               <p>Now in the next verſe, he falles to and proues their election:
he vtters not this aſſurance of their election without goode
warrands. There are two arguments in the text. The firſt is,
from that vertew and power he founde in himſelfe, vvhile he
preached to them. The other is, from the effectualneſſe and
force of his Miniſtrie in them. The firſt is in <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe,
the ſecond in the Theſſalonians: the firſt is contained in theſe
words. <hi>For,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>our Goſpell,</hi> that is the Euangell preached
to you, the Goſpell of God: (there is no Preacher but he may
take it and call it his Goſpell, and except thou be ſaued by it,
as it is the Goſpell miniſtered by the Preacher, thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
get ſaluation: Wilt thou goe to God immediatlie, and not
heare of them, but contemne them thou ſhalt neuer be ſaued.
It is <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> Goſpell, and the Goſpell of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of it, ere it ſerue to thy well (this by the way.) This Goſpell
ſtoode not <hi>in bare language and vvords onelie, but alſo in povver.</hi>
As he would ſay: when I preached to you, I vttered the Goſpel
in libertie and power, and therefore vpon the graces and power
I found in my ſelfe in vttering the Goſpell to you, I gather,
they to whom I preached are choſen of God. Then brethren:
when the Lord ſends out men to preache in power, it is neuer in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16659:17"/>
vaine; but it is a ſure argument amongſt them to whom they are
ent, there are ſome choſen of God to life euerlaſting: and the
man who finds himſelfe ſent out with power to preache the
Goſpell, he may ſay certainlie, there is ſome I preach to choſen.
Who will ſend out a reaper except there be ſome harueſt to be
reaped? Will the Lord ſend out a man inſtructed with power to
any place, except there be ſome to be win to him there. The
Lord ſayes Matth. 9. 37. 38. <hi>The harueſt is great,</hi> it is comming to
maturitie, but the laborers are few: <hi>therefore pray the Lord of the
haruest to ſend out reapers.</hi> And euerbefore any man be ſent out to
preache, the men to whom he is ſent are rype to be inſtructed,
ſo that he is ſent out to gather them in to the barn-yarde. And
by the contrair, when God takes away graces, and drawes away
power from preachers, when he lets them vtter nothing but
dead and emptie talke without power, or when he cloſes mens
mouthes to ſpeake, it is a token that the nomber of the choſen is
growing narrow, and the Church is begun to be barren. Well,
go this Miniſtrie away, and if this power be taken away from vs
to an other part, there was neuer a ſurer argument of the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in of the godlie in a narrow bounds then this is, and that the
remanent are left onelie as miſerable catiffes appointed to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
What auailes this life and al that we haue, if we miſſe that
glorie to come. In all our proceedings, looke what ſerues for the
life to come; for all our liues will away, our life is not heere: this
death temporall is not death; this life temporall is not life, but
death eternall is death, and life eternall is life.</p>
               <p>But to come to the words, and marke them. <hi>For our Goſpell</hi>
ſaieth he, <hi>vvas not vnto you in vvordes onelie, but in povver.</hi> Then
it is not preaching in vvordes onelie that vvorkes ſaluation.
I ſee there are tvvo ſortes of preachings: ſome preachings
in vvordes onelie, as theſe Orators vvho preached to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
for inuy of <hi>Paul,</hi> had nothing but vvordes. There
he ſayeth. <hi>When I come I vvill cognoſce theſe men, not in their
vvordes, but in their povver</hi> (if they haue anie) <hi>for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God ſtandes not in vvordes, but in povver of the Spirite.</hi> 1.
Corinth. 4. 19. 20. There is an other preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
not in vvordes onelie, but vvith vviſdome and povver.
Theefore ſeeing this difference is in preaching, that ſome
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16659:17"/>
preachinges are in vvordes onelie, and ſome preachings in
vvordes vvith power, I muſt confeſſe the cauſe wherefore there
is onelie vvordes vvithout povver geuen to the teachers, is oft
tymes not onelie in the people themſelues, although they be
wicked, but in the preacher that vtters nothing but wordes
without power, to worke into the hearts of the hearers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he that ſpeakes in the name of the Lord, looke that he haue
power, and aske power of God, that his words may be effectual
in the hearts of the hearers to ſaluation, or elſe let him holde
him ſilent. Either ſeeke that power of God may be joyned with
words, or elſe cloſe thy mouth, and ſpeake not one word in the
name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>This power is not gotten lightlie, looke to the groundes of
this power: <hi>Paul</hi> ſets them down heer. <hi>In the holie Spirite,</hi> there is
one, <hi>and in full aſſurance,</hi> there is an other. The firſt, the preaching
of the Spirite:<note place="margin">2. groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of povver in preaching</note> the ſecond, a full aſſurance that is in the heart of
man that ſpeaks to the hearers. Looke that he haue aſſurance in
his owne heart, that remiſſion which he preaches to others is
gotteu to himſelfe. Is he promiſing life to the people? looke that
he haue aſſurance that that lyfe is in him. The firſt and chiefe
ground of all power is the holie Spirite of Chriſt: if the Spirite
of Chriſt ſpeake not, but onlie the ſpirite of man, the humane
power in the teacher, there ſhall be no power, no vertew in that
word to edifie. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Cor. chap. 2. verſ. 13. when
he hes ſpoken of the myſterie of Chriſt, which the wiſdome
of the vvorlde could not comprehende, he ſubjoynes, <hi>The
vvhich vve ſpeake not vvith ſpeaches, and vvordes, vvhich the
vviſdome of man teaches, but vvith vvordes, vvhich the holie Spirit
teaches vs, ioyning ſpirituall vvords vvith ſpirituall matters.</hi> By the
which words he meanes plainly, that except the Spirit of Chriſt
be the principall ſpeaker of a ſpirituall matter, be the matter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo true of it ſelfe, it ſhall haue no power, yea farther in the 1.
cha. v. 17. he ſaieth, the preaching of Chriſt, with the wiſdom of
words &amp; humane eloquence makes the croſſe of Chriſt ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.
1. Cor. 2. 5. he ſaieth, <hi>that faith ſtands not in the vviſdom of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi>
and therfore, who euer teaches in the name of chriſt, let him beg
earneſtlie that that holy Spirite may be in the heart, to tune the
heart; may be in the tongue, to tune the tongue, that the matter
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16659:18"/>
and words that he vtters may both be of the holie Spirite. It
is a dangerous thing to a man to ſpeake in the name of the
Lord, except firſt he pray and ſay, I am going to this place,
Lord giue me matter, giue me words, and let not the ſpeach be
ſo much my ſpeache, as the ſpeache of thy Spirite in my heart.
If the Spirite be in thy heart, he will ſpeake, but if he be out of
thy heart, it will be the voice of a man onelie. No, nothing will
conuert men, but that which comes of the Spirit. A natural eare
may take pleaſure to heare a naturall thing, a naturall heart to
ſpeak of a naturall matter: but a ſpirituall eare and hart wil take
pleaſure in a ſpirituall matter, which comes from the heart of a
ſpirituall man.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the ſecond ground of this power: It is the
full aſſurance of grace and mercie, that he preaches by his own
feeling, he ſpeaks nothing but of faith and particular aſſurance:
a generall aſſurance is naught; for before I preache the grace
of Chriſt, I muſt ſeeke my warrand in my heart, that that grace,
righteouſnes &amp; life I teach, is ſetled in my minde, and vpon this
aſſurance I muſt ſpeake to others; and if the ſpeaker (albeit the
grace were neuer ſo good) haue not in his heart an aſſurance
of that grace, all his words will be vnſauory words. So he muſt
ſtriue alwayes to participate of that grace he teaches to you, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in teaching, or before. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayes <hi>I beleued and therefore I
ſpake.</hi> Pſal. 116. 10. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>We beleue</hi> to ryſe againe, and
to be joyned to Chriſt, <hi>and therfore vve ſpeake.</hi> 2. Cor. 4. 13. As he
would ſay, I am ſpeaking to you of the ryſing of the bodie, but
all this comes of an aſſurance in my hart, that this bodie of mine
ſhall be diſſolued, and at that laſt day ſhall liue, and be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified:
and vpon this aſſurance of mine, I preache to you this
reſurrection. All tends to this: He who ſpeakes of God to vs
would be a man, that in his owne heart hes a full aſſurance of
grace: and aboue all men, a Miniſter that ſtands vp and ſpeaks
to others, ſhoulde haue this aſſurance, and ſhoulde ſeeke all
vvarrandes of his ovvne ſaluation. And of the aſſurance of
his heart, he ſhould ſpeake and ſay: Becauſe I haue felt remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſins in Chriſt Ieſus, and lyfe in him, therefore I may aſſure
you of them in him, if ye earneſtlie by faith ſeeke them. So look
that none that is faithles, on pain of his life ſtand vp to vtter one
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16659:18"/>
word in the name of Ieſus, to offer life, or remiſſion of ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
his ſpeaking is but like the clattering of a Parocket, his heart is
dead, and his head onelie ſounds. The Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Becauſe I
am aſſured in my heart</hi> of this, <hi>therfore I ſpake vvith a great libertie</hi>
Then there are the two groundes: firſt, the holie Spirite: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coundlie,
the aſſurance; if theſe two be of neceſſitie the worde
muſt be profitable: and thogh a man can not get the ful meaſure
of theſe two; well is he that can ſigh and ſay, Lord giue mee an
aſſurance in my heart, ere euer I vtter it to others.</p>
               <p>In the end of the verſe, he takes them to be witneſſes of his
doing, manner of ſpeaking, and povver they ſavv in his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>As ye knovv after vvhat manner I vvas among you for your ſake.</hi>
As ye know: then they knew the power. So brethren, there will
be no Congregation of the Lord that will be ſo ſenſleſſe and
dead, but there wil be ſome that vvill haue that Spirite of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in them, know who ſpeakes with power, and who not.
Euerie man in the Congregation will not haue it; but certainlie
in all congregations there will be ſome that will know emptie
words, and diſcerne them. And therefore let euerie man that
ſpeakes in the name of the Lord, ſpeake ſo, that he may take the
people to whom this diſcretion is geuen to be witneſſe of the
power, and the Spirite where-with he preached.</p>
               <p>Now all this is for their cauſe, all the graces <hi>Paul</hi> had, was
for their cauſe,<note place="margin">All grace is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the Church.</note> they were not for himſelfe: Matter, word, power,
ſpirite, all was for their cauſe, what euer grace any member
gets, all is gotten and geuen for the whole bodie: the grace that
the eye of the bodie gets, the grace the hand gets, all is for vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the bodie and if the Lord had had no other regarde,
but of the hand onelie, he would not haue geuen it the grace
to grip. So is it in the bodie of Chriſt: for if he had not had an
other reſpect to <hi>Paul,</hi> but for himſelfe onelie, he had neuer
receyued theſe graces. So <hi>Iames, Peter, Iohn,</hi> &amp;c. all their graces
are for the well of the Church. The Apoſtle. 1. Cor. 3. 21. ſayes,
All is yours, whither it be <hi>Paul, Apollos</hi> or <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>phas,</hi> al is yours,
and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods. Then the man that hath
gotten the Spirite, and excels aboue his neighbours in graces,
looke that in pride he contemne not the leaſt menber of the
bodie; the eye muſt not lightlie the foote, for if it looke to the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16659:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
skyes and let the foote ſtumble, it ſhall periſhe it ſelfe: ſo who
hes gotten great graces, let him take them, and lay all down at
the feete of the Church, and diſtribute them to the well of the
Church, and ſay, I got them all for your cauſe. The Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
gotten a reuelation and aſſurance, he ſayeth, God gaue it
for the Church. So when thou haſt gotten any grace, giue it out
to the Church in humilitie, whither the gift be ſpirituall or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
or elſe it had beene better thou had neuer receyued it:
yea, let a King beſtow all his graces vpon the Church, for his
calling is for the Church, and except there wer a Church, there
ſhould not be a King: woe to them that knowe not this end,
that all Kingdomes and policies ſtandes for the well of the
Church. <hi>Daniel</hi> tolde <hi>Nabuchadnezar</hi> an heathen King, that his
Kingdome was for the ſtanding of the Church. The Lord op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the eyes of men, to ſe that they do their duetie in their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that at that laſt day they may be found to be members of
that bodie.</p>
               <p>To goe forward, the Apoſtle gathers the election of the
Theſſalonians: firſt, from that power he had to vtter the word,
&amp; that for their cauſe: ſecondly, by the effectualnes &amp; powerful
working of this God within them. Brethren, if the power that
God hes geuen the preacher, for vttering of his Goſpell for
their well, be an argument to them of their ſaluation, hovv
much more muſt the effectual working of the Goſpell be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of their well? Ioyne theſe two together, the powerfull
preaching of the Spirit &amp; the working therof, theſe two makes
the aſſurance of the election of the hearers. And by the contrair
if there be nothing but ſpeaking without power, &amp; no effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alneſſe
in the heart, it will not be the ſpeaker that will auaile, it
wil be ineffectuall to them to their ſaluation. So thou muſt finde
the effectuall working of the Spirite in thee, which muſt be thy
warrand. But to come to the words. <hi>And ye are become follovvers
of vs, and of the Lord, and receyued the vvord in great affliction, and
vvith ioy of the holie Ghost.</hi> Theſe are the words: ye ſe this effectu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>alneſſe
in the Theſſalonians ſtands in imitation and following,
not ſo much of him, as of the Lord, of whom he was a follower.
Well to be ſhort: the effectualneſſe of the Goſpell in the hearer
ye fe conſiſts in the imitation of the ſpeaker, when the hearer
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16659:19"/>
imitates in lyfe the preacher; and aboue all, imitates in life and
conuerſation the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; followes Paſtors as they
follow the Lorde onelie, and no otherwiſe. If then the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alneſſe
of the Goſpel in the people, ſtands to imitate thee, looke
thou that there be matter of imitation of thee, looke how thy
mouth ſpeaks, looke thou ſpeake as Chriſt ſpeaks, otherwiſe
ſpeake not, except thou may ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, when he hes
preached to the people, ye are followers of me, I am made a
guide to you going before, ye are followers: at the leaſt, if they
wil not follow thee, look that thy life be good, thogh they ſhold
run away, go thou forward in the way of life. Preaching wil not
do the turne, if thou be not a light going before the people, all
thy words ſhall do no good, and thou ſhalt neuer be partaker
of that glorie thou ſpeaks of.</p>
               <p>Then mark againe. Wherin ſtands this imitation? <hi>And receyued,</hi>
ſayes he, <hi>the vvord vvith great affliction.</hi> There the imitation of
the Preacher, not only in receyuing the word deliuered by him,
not onlie by following him in doing, but chieflie by following
him in ſuffering affliction. Is he afflicted for the delyuering of
it? thou that receiues it follow him in affliction. I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber <hi>Paul</hi>
in the ſecond Epiſt. to <hi>Timothie.</hi> Cha. 3. v. 10. 11. 12. where he layes
downe many things in himſelfe to be followed, but chieflie his
doctrine, maner of liuing, his purpoſe, his life, lenitie, patience:
then he ſayes, my perſecution and affliction in Chriſt. Now he
ſticks on this laſt, &amp; he ſpecially bound <hi>Timothie</hi> to that, and he
ſayes in generall (as it were to euery godlie man) <hi>All that is vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to liue godlie in Christ, ſhall ſuffer affliction,</hi> &amp; thou muſt be one
of that nomber, <hi>Timothie.</hi> Brethren, we will be all content to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in doing the Paſtor. Hes he faith? we will follow his faith:
hes he any other thing in him? we follow him in it: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it comes to the croſſe, then we will leaue him; we will let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
no, if it were Chriſt himſelf going out of Ieruſalem to Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatha
wher he ſuffered, we wil let him go all alone &amp; will abide
in Ieruſalem. It is vaine to thinke that affliction onlie pertaines
to the ſpeaker, and not to the hearers. The Apoſtle ſayes, hauing
receyued the word of God with great affliction. No, affliction is
the vnſeparable companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Goſpel in this life: heares thou
and receiues thou the word, make thee for affliction. And ſo
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16659:20"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie</hi> makes affliction the neceſſare companion of
the Goſpell. <hi>2. Timoth,. 1. 8.</hi> It bydes with thee heere on the earth
with a croſſe on the backe of it, for thou ſhalt not brooke it
without a croſſe. Therefore maruaile not at this affliction, for it
is a meruaile that the Goſpell ſhould haue remainde ſo long
without affliction in Scotland, and all this affliction in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
is nothing in reſpect of other parts where affliction is.
And therefore if we brooke this Goſpell, looke for greater
afflictions, then theſe; for who hes ſtriuen yet to the blood, for
the libertie of the Goſpell?</p>
               <p>Now in the laſt words, with the affliction he joynes the holy
Spirite, <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>oy</hi> ſayes he, <hi>of the holie Spirite.</hi> Ye receyued the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
with affliction, and with affliction ye receyued joy of
the holie Spirite.<note place="margin">Ioy of the holie Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite ioined vvith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note> Looke how ſurelie affliction is the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Goſpell; as ſurelie is the joy of the Spirite the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of affliction, and this is moſt ſure, that the affliction of
the Goſpell is moſt joyfull. aboue all other things in the world.
A man that ſuffers as an euill doer, a man that ſuffers for theft,
a murtherer that ſuffers for murther, an adulterer for adulterie,
he hes no joye in ſuffering, he is aſhamed and hangs dovvne his
head, becauſe the querrell for which he ſuffers bringes an euill
conſcience: theft bringes an euill conſcience, murther bringes an
euill conſcience, adulterie brings an euill conſcience, &amp; therfore
he hes no joy in ſuffering. It is true, a man that is to be execute
for his his euill deedes, in his execution will rejoyce, but marke
the ground. It is it not the euill cauſe that bringes that joy, but it
is the aſſurance of the remiſſion of ſinnes in Chriſt that bringes
the joy: the euill turne bringes euer an horror of conſcience: but
vvhen one ſuffers for Chriſt and the Goſpels ſake, there is joye
and comfort: and they that hes ſuffered for Chriſts ſake, in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
haue greater joy in the ſpirite, nor euer they had in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of their pleaſures in the world. Peter in his firſt Epiſt. 1. 8.
ſayes, In the midſt of their ſuffring they ſuffred joyfully: when
there is a good conſcience, when men ſuffer for Ieſus ſake, there
was neuer joye comparable to that joy, it is ſuch a joye as vvill
ſwalow vp al paine &amp; terror. Experience of this we haue in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
godlie Martyres: not that affliction brings joy with it, for it
is naturall to the affliction to worke ſorrow and griefe, but it is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16659:20"/>
the good conſcience that makes joye, and the good conſcience
comes of the good cauſe. When the conſcience ſayes, Thou art
ſuffering for Chriſt that ſuffered for thee, and be aſſured after
ſuffering thou ſhalt be glorified, ô the joye that that man ſhall
finde! The Lord giues euerie man joye that ſuffers any thinge
leſſe or more for Chriſt: the furniſher of the joye is the Spirite,
who will not ſuffer anie perſone to beare anie thing for Chriſt,
but he will giue comfort and joy therein. Brethren, ye heare it
commonlie ſaid, It is the cauſe or the querrell, and not the paine
that makes the martyre: the paine &amp; the torment, were they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo greuous will not make a man a martyre: the ground is the
good cauſe &amp; quarrel that they ſuffer for, the Goſpel &amp; Chriſt.
But I ſay farther, if there be no more nor the cauſe or the quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
that makes not martyrdome, if when thou art ſuffering for
Ieſus ſake, thou haſt no joy, no patience, no faith and tolerance,
no joye in the holie Spirite, and reioyſe more in ſuffering
and bonds, nor he that goes free, it is no martyrdome. Ioyne me
joye and the good cauſe vvith patience in torment all three to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
theſe make a Martyre. Peter ſets downe the rules of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring,
ſaying. <hi>Let no man ſuffer as a murtherer, as a theefe, as an euill
doer, or as a buſie bodie in other mens matters.</hi> Then he ſubjoynes, <hi>If
anie man ſuffer as a chriſtian for a good cauſe, let him not be aſhamed
therein, but let him glorifie God.</hi> 1. Epiſt. 4. 15. 16. As in the I. Cha V.
8. he ſayes, They haue in ſuffering for a good cauſe <hi>a ioy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
and glorious:</hi> So here he forbids them to be aſhamed in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
but to reioyce and glorifie God who hes called them to
that honour: for this is the higheſt honour of all, to ſuffer for
Chriſt as the Apoſtles did. Marke all theſe grounds: Theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
and rules commending ſuffering, are not ſet downe in
vaine: and let none thinke to be a chriſtian and to be exeemed
from ſuffering. Away with them who will ſay, they will preach
and receiue the word gladlie in calmnes, but they will haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with ſuffering: but I ſay, if thou prepare thee not for
ſuffering after ſo long a calmneſſe of the Goſpell, the end ſhall
prooue that thou ſhalt curſe the time that euer thou heard the
Goſpell. Therfore in purpoſe let vs prepare our ſelues to ſuffer,
that nothing come to vs vnawares: and let vs ſay when we riſe,
here I am readie, if it pleaſe thee, ô Lord, to lay any thing on me
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16659:21"/>
for the Goſpell ere euening, Lord giue me grace not to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
but to ſuffer in joy, my life is not heere, but my life muſt be
laid down. And wel is him can be this way prepared and lookes
for greater affliction: for no doubt, after ſo great calmneſſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
muſt follow, and all our ſuffering is but childrens play
yet. The Lord prepare vs for it, and make vs readie when he
pleaſes to viſite vs. To this God be all praiſe for euer.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this part of this Epiſtle, which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
we haue in hand: ye haue heard (bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
the Apoſtle rejoyſes together with
the Theſſalonians, for thoſe graces of
God, which he vnderſtood and knew to
be in them, geuing God thanks therefore,
rendering him the whole glorie thereof.
The graces wer, as ye heard, namely firſt,
their effectuall faith: ſecondlie, their laborious loue and charity:
thirdly, their patient hope. Then he comes to the ground of all
theſe graces, their election which was from all eternitie, vttering
an aſſurance of their election and of the chuſing of them before
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16659:21"/>
the world was made. The grounds of his aſſurance of their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
election wer two: the firſt in himſelf: the ſecond in the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians:
the ground in himſelfe, was that grace of God, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
that power which he had in preaching Chriſt when he
came among them, which aſſured him, the Lord had his choſen
amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The ground in them was a faire meeting, receiuing
the word, &amp; that with affliction; as he deliuered the word with
affliction ſo they wer followers of him, and receiued the word
with great affliction, but yet with joy alſo; for as affliction ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies
the word, ſo the joy of the holie Ghoſt accompanies
the affliction. This ſhortlie for that which ye haue heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the text we haue red. In the firſt verſe therof
the Apoſtle amplifies the grace that God had geuen to them
in receyuing the word with great affliction: yea (ſaith he) yee
haue receiued the word with ſuch affliction <hi>that ye vvere exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to all that beleeued in Macedonia,</hi> that is, in the countrie round
about you: (for Theſſalonica where they dwelt, it was chiefe
Cittie in Macedonia,) and not onelie were ye examples to them
in Macedonia, but to them in Achaia, that is in the countrie next
adjacent to Macedonia: ſo that euen as the Theſſalonians in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and grace followed <hi>Paul,</hi> who was the teacher of grace
to them: ſo the Theſſalonians wants not their ovvne followers:
all thoſe that beleued in Macedonia and Achaia followes them
as examples of faith, patience, &amp; al graces. Marke it, <hi>Paul</hi> goeth
before them in good example, they againe go before al the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians
&amp; thoſe of Achaia in their good exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. Then ye ſee
examples of life hes great force,<note place="margin">Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples are forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> either to well doing or euil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
for wel doing &amp; euil doing in this world come for the moſt
part by example &amp; imitation following others: a good man wil
follow a good man, a wel doer wil follow a wel doer, a thefe wil
follow a theefe, &amp; a murtherer wil folow a murtherer: they that
are inclinde to harlotrie and filthines will follow them that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
harlotrie and filthines: ſo they that intend to haue grace
will followe them that are gratious, they who doe long and
thirſt for heauen wil follow them whome they thinke to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to heauen: they that will run to vvickednes will run to hell
after them that runne before them thereto: ſo that our vvell and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16659:22"/>
woe ſtands greatlie in imitation of others: and therefore, he who
walks let him take head to euerie foote-ſtep, eſpeciallie he that
is in any high rowme, in the ſight of the people, let him take
good head to his walking, and to euerie foote he ſets down,
how he goes, where he goes, what he is doing: for certainlie, he
ſhall not goe alone: walks he well? he ſhall haue followers:
walks he euill? he ſhall haue followers: falles he in the myre?
moe ſhall fall with him: breaks he his neck? ſome ſhall follow
him who ſhall break their necks with him: ſtands he vpright?
moe ſhall follow him and ſtand vpright. Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
doubles ouer the precept, <hi>Walke vviſelie, vvalke circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectlie.</hi>
Eph. 5. 15. 17. Colloſſ. 4. 5. Each foote thou ſets to the
earth, looke where thou ſets it, and looke who followes thee.
And Chriſt ſayes. Matth. 18. 7. <hi>Woe be to that man by vvhom of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
commeth,</hi> that is, that walks not warelie but runnes himſelf
to deſtruction, and drawes men and wemen thereto. This is a
world wherein men had need to take head to their walking:
God graunt that they who are in high rowmes, may take head
to their walking, for they that goes before others may ſaue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
if they walke well; and may loſe many by their walking and
going in wickedneſſe, if they walke euill.</p>
               <p>Farther marke. Who are theſe that followes the Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?
or to whom are they patterns of grace &amp; patience in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring?
The Macedonians, the Contrie about them: &amp; beſide that,
the Achaians, they of the nighbour Countrie: for Achaia is next
to Macedonia. And vvho vvere theſe? They that beleeued in
Chriſt before the Theſſalonians were called: they who were
called firſt, followed them who were called to grace laſt. Marke
then, the Theſſalonians who were called laſt, outranne in the
courſe of grace the reſt of the Macedonians and Achaians, and
left them behinde them, albeit they broke off before them. It is
to be noted: We are all running in one courſe and we are all in
one rinke, running towards the marke: for in the tyme of our
lyfe there is none ſitting: thou deceaues thy ſelfe that ſayes
thou haſt a ſtabliſht manſion heere, all muſt be on foote, and all
muſt be running, and we muſt runne to the place where our
manſion is, to the But of our glorious reſurrection and life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting:
if thou ſit ſtill, thou ſhalt ſtinke, rotte and periſhe: but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16659:22"/>
if thou run, and runne on while thou come to the But, thou ſhalt,
be ſafe in the end, and ſhalt receyue the Crowne and pryce of
immortall glorie. Now in this courſe and rinke of chriſtianitie, it
falles out ſo, that they that ſtart laſt, ſhall out-runne them that
ſtart and break off a good ſpace of tyme before them; and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them in faith, patience, affliction, and joy. Ye ſe this plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
in this example of the Theſſalonians with the reſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,
and them of Achaia. So that is moſt true which Ieſus
ſaid, <hi>The laſt is firſt and the firſt is laſt.</hi> Math. 20. 16. There is a
great alteration: the laſt outrunning them who brake off firſte:
they that broke off firſt are made laſt. and ly behinde, and is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercomde
in grace. The Iewes entred in this rinke long before,
yea many hundreth yeeres ere the Gentiles thought of any rink,
or to come to heauen: but ſo ſoone as the Gentiles come in and
breakes off in the rinke they did outrun the Iewes, &amp; left them
behind them as far as they might look to them: they were ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
in the beginning. After Ieſus came in the world and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
were teaching, it is wonder to thinke hovv ſpeedie they
were: So this hath beene oft times ſeene that in the Church of
God, they who were called laſt hes ouercomde them who were
called firſt. And I thinke that nation of France hath ouercomde
all the Churches in Europe, in ſuffering a continuall &amp; frequent
affliction: thinke not they are behinde vs in our courſe, no: they
are farre before vs. And as to our nation in this part of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of, I thinke it is behinde all nations. Alas,
what haue we ſuffered? our tyme is yet abyding vs. The Lord
prepare vs thereto: and I thinke it is comming on; yea, it is a
wonder we ſhould haue heard the word ſo long without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
               <p>Yet to the words, he calles them <hi>examples,</hi> patterns going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others. He ſayes not ye were a patterne ſingularlie, (the
words hes a great force) but ye were patterns: meaning, that ſo
many heads of men and wemen, as there were of the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
they were as many patterns, euerie perſon was a pattern;
a patterne in grace, in faith, in patience and ſuffering.<note place="margin">Manye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>
                  </note> So that
ye may marke, when Ieſus come in the world, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
went out to the Nations, to draw the Nations to Chriſt,
to conuert them, the Harueſt was great, the world was full of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16659:23"/>
choſen veſſels: when Ieſus came the world was full of men and
wemen to be ſafe: ther was neuer ſo many before his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, &amp;
I wote not if euer there was ſo manie ſince: and that was it that
Chriſt meaned when he ſaid, <hi>The harueſt is great but the laborer:

                     </gap>
to his Wyne-yarde.</hi> Matth. 9. 37. It is a wounder to heare howe
haſtilie at one preaching ſo manie thovvſandes were conuerted.
Reade the Acts of the Apoſtles, the ſecond and third chapters,
ye vvill vvonder at the zeale, loue, patience and joye of them.
Brethren, this vvas the beginning and infancy of the Church, but
ſince that number hes begun to be drawne in narrow bounds, &amp;
in proceſſe of time theſe Theſſalonians who are now ſo praiſed
by the Apoſtle, they are ſo drawne in, that vve heare it not told
that Chriſt is profeſſed among them. So it was in the beginning
heere amongſt vs after the reformation, when papiſtrie was put
avvay: it vvas a vvonder to ſee how men and vvemen did thring
in, and vvere glad to indure great labour, and ſuffer afflictions
for the Religion. So, no queſtion but that reformation fell when
the Lord had manie rype to be called in this land. But I vvill
ſpeake my opinion, I thinke in theſe dayes the number of the
faithfull be dravvne in, and (except the Lord ſay it) they ſhall
grow fewer, and peece &amp; peece they ſhall go away. Now when
all the elect ſhal be gathered in to the laſt perſon, then the Lord
Ieſus ſhall come and put an end to this vvorld: and I trow it ſhal
not be long to it. To returne: So manie Theſſalonians, as manie
patternes of grace to Macedonia &amp; Achaia. I aske a queſtion
ere I leaue this. Receiued the Macedonians &amp; Achaians anye
hurt by this ſuperioritie and prefement the Theſſalonians had
ouer them, they vvere caſten behind, the Theſſalonians before,
were the Macedonians hurt therby? No: the grace that God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
to a man, if he vſe it rightly, neuer hurts another man but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
him: ouer comes he me in this grace? I am nothing impared
in that, becauſe he is a patterne to me, whom I ſhould follovv in
that grace: runnes he before me? he ſhould vvalken mee vp to
follow and runne after: for this is one meane among all the reſt
of the meanes the Lord vſes to dravv vs forvvard in the courſe
of grace: for we are ſlovv in running, &amp; euerie one of vs by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is inclyned to ſluggiſhnes, &amp; ay looking ouer our ſhoulder
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16659:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to ſtay our courſe, as <hi>Lots</hi> vvife did. Therefore the Lord hes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
this meane to draw thee forward, he wil ſet out one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
thee, long after thee, and vvill cauſe him to come by thy
eare vvith all ſpeedines, and runne out before hee, to prouoke
thee to emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo thou ſholdeſt ſay, This man began after me,
I was in faith before him, he hes outrunne me, it is ſhame to me:
&amp; ſo thou ſhould take thee to thy foote &amp; run: otherwiſe thou
haſt no part with the runners in this rinke. So did he with the
Iewes: they were all lingring at the comming of Chriſt, the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
comes out after them, and runnes by them, that they might
be prouoked to follow: ſo that both Iew and Gentile might run
on together to that But, which is Chriſt. Rom. 11.</p>
               <p>Now to the next verſe: The words are plaine. He makes this
more cleare, to wit, That they were examples to them of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia
&amp; Achaia. And he ſayes, <hi>For from you ſounded out the vvord
of the Lord, not in Macedonia and Achaia onelie.</hi> Euen as, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
this bleſſed Goſpell ſounded out from Zion (for they
that preached it came from Zion, which is Ieruſalem) and ſpread
it abroad through the vvhole world. So from the Theſſalonians
the word ſounded out, &amp; ſpread to Macedonia &amp; Achaia. Who
wer theſe that ſounded the vvord to Macedonia? Novv certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
it appeares vvell, euen trauelling men, ſo journers, paſſingers,
marchants, traffiquers, that had trauelling in Macedonia (as men
that vvould go out of Edinburgh to other parts of this Realme)
&amp; ſo from Macedonia to Achaia. Theſe men as they ſo journed

the Lord bids you ſpeak, he bids you be lamps &amp; lights to blind
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16659:24"/>
people, where euer ye reſort: for beſides all other meanes, the
Lord hes appointed this as a mean to win ſoules to Chriſt, that
ye who trauailes and haue heard of grace ſhould communicate
that grace, and haue conference thereof to all perſones where
ye come, that you may vvinne your poore brother &amp; ſiſter that
haue not heard of it. Alas, our conſciences may accuſe vs verie
ſore for the neglect of our duetie herein: And I trow, becauſe
vvhen men are abroad trauailing, they trauaile with cloſe mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,
neuer ſpeaking of the grace they got at home, the Lorde
hes begun to cloſe the mouthes of the preachers of grace in this
Towne heere.</p>
               <p>He goes forward in the next part of the verſe and he ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
this grace of the Theſſalonians: Not onelie hes the vvorde
ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to Macedonia, but he ſayes, <hi>your faith alſo vvhich is tovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
God, is ſpread abroad in all quarters.</hi> So that the Apoſtle tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
to no part but the brute of their faith met him: The brute
of a man will go farther nor his voice vvil be heard. Thou then
ſhouldſt take heade to thy name and fame, and trauaile to get a
a good fame: for I tell thee, as thy preſence is either good or bad
to them that ſee thee, and vvith vvhom thou art conuerſant, ſo is
thy fame to them that ſee thee not. If thou die bearing the name
of a good man, thy name doth good to the poſteritie: but if thou
die an euill man, thy euill name deſtroyes manie. Woe to them
therefore that leaues an euill name behinde them, eſpeciallie if
they be in high places: and amongſt all the reſt of the meanes
God vſes to enlarge Chriſts Kingdome with, and to bring men
to Heauen, as the preſence of a man and his voice is one mean,
ſo the name and fame of the grace of God in a man, is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meane. Take head to thy name and fame; for either it ſhall
turne to thy conſolation or to thy damnation, accordinglie as
thou liueſt: and thou making men to follow thy euill example
in doing, ſhalt aggredge thy judgement: looke how little a
thing will do much euill: we ſhould then walke warelie, this
life will away, bleſſed is he that can make his name to ſerue to

avvay. The Lord oppen mens eyes to ſee this, and lette vs not
loſe this name vvhich vve haue in the mouthes of good men in
other countries.</p>
               <p>Novve the laſt vvordes of this verſe. <hi>That vve need not to
ſpeake any thing.</hi> As he would ſay: the fame of your faith ſpred
ſo abroade, that vvhere euer I come, it mette me, ſo that my
mouth vvas cloſed, that I needed not to ſpeake of your graces.
The Apoſtle vvhen he had conuerted anie people he euer
commended them to the people he vvent to, and tolde of their
graces, as the Acts beares. Novv comming to other Countries,
after the conuerting of the Theſſalonians, before he coulde
ſpeake one vvorde of them, the brute of them mette him ſo the
Theſſalonians did holde in that parte of his trauaile. It is moſt
true, the people may disburdeene the Paſtor of many thinges:
for euerie one of them ſhoulde edifie an other, as he preaches &amp;
and edifyes in publict: if euerie one of them would edifie others
in priuate conference, they vvoulde releeue him of a great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene.
The end of his whole trauailes is to edifie, and if euerie
one of you edifie others, yee releeue him of a great part of his
burdene. His office is to builde vp the houſe of the Lorde,
and euerie one of you is bound to take a ſtone in your armes
to lay vpon the building, and euerie one in their own vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is bounde to helpe vp the building of the houſe of the Lord
by conference communication, and ſuch other meanes. But, alas,
hovv is this practiſed in this nation? they burdene the builder,
not onelie to build, but alſo to build without an helper, for none
there is that builds with him, The bloodie murtherer, will
come in with a foul ſlander, and will beat down all that the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hes builded in the hearts of many: the foull adulterer with
a foull ſlander, and he will beat down that which the builder
hes builded: the blaſphemer with a foull mouth, and he will

So the thing that was reported to the Apoſtle of the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
is their turning. Brethren, the firſt effect that is required in
a man or woman in this world, is to turne them round about, to
turne their face where their backe was, to turne them off the
courſe they were on, they are in an euill courſe, running to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
and their eye is on Hell. There is the firſt effect of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16659:25"/>
the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Connerſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the firſt effects of the Goſpel</note> to turne them about; to take their eye off the Deuill,
and ſet it on God: thy heart, thy ſoule and thy affection that is
ſet on the Deuill, muſt be turned about within thy breaſt, and ſet
on God, &amp; if this turning be not wroght in thee by the Goſpel,
looke not for grace, remiſſion of ſinnes and lyfe euerlaſting.
Art thou a murtherer, and haſt thy heart ſet on blood-ſhed? at
the hearing of the Goſpell, if thy heart be not turned, thy
ſinne ſhall neuer be taken avvay. He vvho is nevv comde from
murther, he vvill come in and holde vp his eare to the Goſpell,
and heare of remiſſion of ſinnes and lyfe euerlaſting through
Chriſt, and he will take all to him, and in the meane tyme he will
haue his foull heart ſtuffed with murther and reuenge. Away
with thee ô foole: it is impoſſible to get pardon &amp; remiſſion of
ſinnes, when thy heart remaines yet vnturned from ſinne: thou
haſt no part in Ieſus, I debar thee from him. Troweſt thou to
get remiſſion and lyfe vvhen thy heart bydes vnturned, lying
ſtill in that ſtincking filth? In a vvord, thou ſhalt get no effect
of the Goſpell except thy heart be turned to God. So as thou
vvoulde haue lyfe after this lyfe, looke thy heart be turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay
from ſinne, and turned to God. So then there is the firſt
effect that the Goſpell vvorkes,<note place="margin">Parts of conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> Repentance and turning.
Wherein ſtands it? Looke to the vvordes: it ſtands firſt in this
pointe, in leauing off Idols: if thou be an Idolater, turne thy
backe on an Idoll. Thou makes an Idoll to thee of thy foull
affection, as murther, theft, adulterie, vvhen thou obeyes them:
turne thy back on theſe Idoles. Many thinkes to come to God
in an inſtant vvith his Idole in his armes, they vvill preſent to
God prayers, vvith the Idoll in their boſomes, as Rachell would
come dovvne from Padan-Aram and vvorſhippe God, but
ſhe keeped her Idoll. No, be not deceiued, if thou leaue not
the Idole behinde thee, (vvhither it be an Idole in deede, or a
foull affection that thou ſetteſt vppe in the rovvme of God)
I diſcharge thee of the Connention of the Sanctes of God,
for thou ſcornes him, and one daye he ſhall be auenged on thee
for it. Turne thee therefore from that vvicked Idoll or elſe byde
away.</p>
               <p>Nowe followes the ſecond part of the conuerſion. It is not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16659:26"/>

ſonnes, (euen the Kings ſonnes) are borne, (ſo that we haue no
cauſe to glorie in our ſelues:) When he is borne firſt, and comes
out of his Mothers vvombe, the backe of him is to God, and
his face to the Deuill, and the burning eye of God is vppon
him. No infant, vvhat eſtate ſo euer hee be, is borne other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,

thee ſeede of hatred, vvith the gall of bitterneſſe againſt God
in his heart, and if hee remaine in nature, there is no day he

of God. Now in the meane tyme the eare of him is ay pulde,

the light of reaſone beginnes not ſo ſoone in him, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
will round in his eare, there is a God that created this
world, and oft he will looke ouer his ſhoulder to get a blenk of
that God his Creator, and ſeeing him, faine would he be quite of
that Creator, and of that ſight of God that reaſon chalenges his
ſoule with: (looke to this our nature, fy on them that begins to
extoll this nature in their doctrine) yet he can not be quite of
the ſight of God, and he findes that nature puſhes him to ſeeke
a God. And then he ſaieth: ſeeing I can not be quite of God, I
ſhall make to my ſelfe a God, and then he will change the glory
of the true God in the Image of a foure-footed beaſt, &amp;c.
Rom 1. 23. Then the Lord ſeeing this malitiouſneſſe in the heart
of man, who ſees a God and will not ſee him; he putteth out
his eyes, &amp; geues him ouer to a reprobate ſenſe and minde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

as a blinde bodie running like as he were mad, and waits not

ſlaues: ye are turned and conuerted from theſe falſe Gods to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
that ſeruice on the liuing and true God.</p>
               <p>Then brethren, to marke ſhortlie the leſſons, for the Text is
plaine. Our conuerſion &amp; turning to God, is not that we ſhould
ſtand vp idle before him or play the vvanton in his eyes: but it
is to be humbled before him, to honour him, and to conſecrate
our whole life, (if we did liue ten thouſand yeeres) to his ſeruice.
Manie men, vvhen for the faſhion they haue turned from
Idolatrie to God and to the Goſpell, where he is preſent, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their vvhole life (as ye ſee by experience) to diſpleaſe and
diſhonour God in his face. In the light of the Goſpell hee vvill
come out and playe the murtherer: in the face of Chriſt in the
Goſpell ſhe vvill playe the harlote, the thirde will oppreſſe, the
fourth will ſteale, the fifth will ſpew out blaſphemie. Now why
wouldſt thou not do this when thou didſt ſerue idoles? the leſſe
judgement ſhoulde haue falne vpon thee to haue done theſe
things in the face of an Idole that ſavve thee not, nor in the face
of God vvho ſees thee. O hypocrite, it had beene better for thee
thou hadſt neuer beene conuerted to the Goſpell, nor hadſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
heard the ſound of the Goſpell, nor when thou heareſt it to
contemne God by thy life therein. Fy on thee, go backe againe
to idolatrie, except thou behaue thy ſelfe comelie ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the face of that Majeſtie of God. Brethren, it is the thinge I
haue beene thinking on: This Goſpell ſhall ſerue to the greater
condemnation of the multitude of people in this world, &amp; that
for the contempt thereof: fy that ſuch villanie ſhould be daylie

               <p>He joynes ſome properties to this God, and calles him the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

that are geuen to him: Marke the vſe of them: They are
reaſones mouing the Theſſalonians to ſerue him: He is liuing,
why ſhould they not ſerue him? he is the true God, why ſhould
they not ſerue him? The life that is in God, the veritie that is in
him is more then matter to moue all mankinde to honour him.
Man cannot be honoured, but by others nor himſelfe: take men
away from a man, no honour to that man. It is not ſo with God,
for, if all the creatures of the earth were turned to nothing, the
honour and glorie of that God ſtands ſure and abſolutelie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite.
Then, if notwithſtanding of the honour in him, of the life in
him, of the trueth in him, which all are matter of all ſeruice to be
geuen to him, thou wilt not be moued to honour God, he is but
an Idole to thee, an idole without life to thee, without ſenſe or
feeling, without hearing ſeeing, without all prouidence &amp; care
in gouerning theſe things in heauen and earth: thou that ſerues
and honour him not in this life thou makes him an idole. If you
thought he had an eye to ſee the inward of thy heart, an eare to
heare what thou art ſpeaking in thy ſecrete chamber, if thou
thought he had a prouidence ouer this world, for all the world
thou wouldſt not do as thou doeſt. The adulterer the oppreſſor
if they had a conſcience that God ſawe them and marked their
doings, for al the world they would not do ſo as they do: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thou makes an idole of him, thinking him neyther to ſee
nor know anie thing: therefore thou playeſt the wanton: thinke

this, thou diſhonoured me in the profeſſion of my name.</p>
               <p>Yet there is more in theſe wordes. He lets them ſe that greater
advauntage they had in ſeruing God, nor euer they had before:
before they ſerued dead and falſe things, now ſaieth he, ye ſerue
not a dead &amp; falſe thing, but <hi>a liuing and true God.</hi> There is great
vauntage heere: Brethren, there are many ſortes of ſlaueries in
this world: but to be addicted to an Idole, or a falſe God, to fall
down before a ſtock or ſtone,<note place="margin">Slauery of Idolaters.</note> of all ſlaueries this is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt:
it is true, it is a ſlauerie to be ſubject to a tyrannous man in

his dominion, if he be a ſlaue to a falſe fained God, an Idole,
of all ſlaues he is the greateſt ſlaue: for not to knovve the true
God is the greateſt ſlauerie that is: for there is no conſolation
but in God: if thou had all the libertie in the vvorld, thy ſoule
is in ſlauerie, if thou ſerue not the liuing and true God. I will
not call a Nation a free Nation, a King a free King, if they

Now followes the ſecond end of their conuerſion, which is
to looke for the Sonne and his comming; the firſt was, to ſerue
the Father of this life; the ſecond is to awaite for the comming
of the Son. Marke euerie word. It is not eneugh, brethren, to
ſerue the Father, the liuing and true God, in faith, in loue, in all
ſeruice that pertaines to him in this lyfe, except thy eye throgh
hope reach out beyonde this lyfe in the meane tyme of thy

There are many in wealth, in honour, in eaſe, in healthe of
bodie in this worlde, that vvould make a Couenant with God,
and ſay, Lorde, Let mee dwell ſtill to ſerue thee heere, and it
were for euer, and I obliſhe me neuer to looke for more at thy
hand: giue me this lyfe, and wealthe and pleaſure thereof, I ſhall
ſerue thee to let me liue heere for euer, and I ſhall binde my
ſelfe neuer to craue more of thee: alas, I trovv there be many
of this ſort. Fy on it, this can not be rooted out of the hearts of
the moſt godlie, euen as if either God had gotten glorie ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie,
or we could get perfite happineſſe in this life. Alas, if our
hope were onelie in this lyfe, and our bleſſedneſſe reached not
out beyonde this life, of all men the chriſtian man wer moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.
I had rather chuſe to be a Turke nor a Chriſtian, except
my hope reache out beyond this life, &amp; all the pleaſure and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
I can do to God in it. If thou preaſe to be a true chriſtian,
think not with thy ſelf, I ſhall driue ouer this life quietly, &amp; ſhal
ſtand faſt in al trouble, but thou muſt bide toſſing &amp; toyling, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
thou can not be a chriſtian: <hi>for throgh many tribulations
thou muſt enter into the kingdom of heauen.</hi> Act. 14. 22. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye who
wold ſerue God, ſerue him as pilgrimes in a ſtrange country far
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: what euer thou be doing here in his ſeruice walking in
thy godly exerciſe, in the mean time let thy hart be with Chriſt:
let thy hart be wher thy life is hid vp with Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi> giues an
example of this in his own perſon ſaying, I liue here as a Citizen
of Heauen. Philip. 3. 20. A Citizen in the heauen is a pilgrime
on the earth. And therfore he ſubjoynes, liuing as a pilgrime
heere, and a Citizen of Heauen, I hope for my ſaluation in
Chriſt. A pilgrime hes euer his eye out of this world. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Epiſtle to the Corinthians. Chap. 5. verſ. 7. 8. he ſhovves
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16659:30"/>
that in this lyfe he walked in faith and confidence, but ſaieth
he, <hi>I chuſe rather to flit and remoue out of the bodie, and to dvvell
vvith my Lord Ieſus.</hi> Fy on thee, that is ſo nailde throgh head and
heart to this world, that thou hes euer thy heart and ſight heere.
Certainelie I am of this minde, that the thing that euerie one of
vs ſhould moſt care for, ſhould be to ſteale away peece &amp; peece
from this earth. Lowſe thy heart peece and peece, and free thee
from this wofull life.</p>
               <p>Now this hope and looking is for the Sonne: ſomething per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
to the Father, thou muſt ſerue the liuing and true God:
ſomething pertaines to the Son, thou muſt looke for him from
Heauen. Thinke not to honour the Father without the Sonne.
The Iew is vaine that thinks to honour the Father without the
Sonne, No, it will not be: ſerue the Father, but honour the Son
alſo, or elſe the Father ſhall accept no honour at thy hand. Ioh.
5. 23. For all the honour of the Fathers is in the Sonne. But marke
the ſpeciall honour that is geuen to the Sonne in this life. The
Sonne is honoured in faith in this life, in beleeuing that he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
come in the world, that he is come in our nature and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the death for our ſins: that he died<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was buried, roſe againe
from the death, thou honoures him in beleeuing this. But this is
the ſpeciall pointe of this honour, to hope that he ſhall come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
as he come once, ſo looke that he ſhall come againe. But
brethren, neither hes his glorie yet appeared, as it is in deed, and
ſhall appeare: neither yet your grace appeares as it ſhall when
he ſhall come againe. And therefore the ſpeciall ſeruice we can
doe, is to await for his comming, ad to glorie vnder that hope.
No, beleeue thou in the Father as thou wilt, if thou hope not
for that glorious returning of the Sonne, thou honours him not.
This is all to ſtirre vs vp by hope, to looke for an other life: for
all theſe things; King and Kingdome vvill avvay, and they who
hoped for him in this lyfe, ſhall ſhine in glorie with him in that
life eternall.</p>
               <p>Fromwhence ſhal we hope that he comes? where ſhal we caſt
our eye (if we looke for a man to come from one part, our eye
will euer be on that part where from he ſhould come, whither
it be Eaſt or Weſt, South or North) Where then ſhould we caſt
our eye? Neither to the Eaſt, Weſt, South nor North, nor to any
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16659:30"/>
part of this earth, but caſt thy eye vpward to Heauen, Ieſus is in
Heauen, and he ſhall come from Heauen, he is not in the earth:
and therefore ye ſee in him that hopes, as the hart breakes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
ſo will the eye looke vpward, the hand, the head will be
raiſed vpward: as Chriſt ſayeth, <hi>lift vp your heads.</hi> Luke 21. 28.
ſo his behauiour will tell thee from whence Chriſt ſhall come.
And againe thy behauiour wil tell that thou haſt no hope when
thou tends altogether downewards, thy face euer towards the
earth, &amp; thy hart moyling in the earth: when any man ſees al thy
care and minde onelie vpon the earth he may ſay, this bodie hes
no hope, he lookes not for the returning of the ſonne of God.</p>
               <p>Then followes <hi>Whom he raiſed from the death,</hi> meaning the
ſonne of God: the Father raiſed him. I will not inſiſt, but ſo farre
onelie as the text will beare me. Beleeue that Ieſus is raiſed from
the dead, and that he is in heauen; beleue the thing done &amp; paſt,
and then hope that he ſhall come againe: firſt be a beleeuer, and
then hope: he that hopes for a thing to come muſt be a beleeuer
of the thing by gone. Faſten thy beleef on the things bygone,
that Chriſt died, was buried, and roſe vp by the power of God,
and aſcended to the heauen; beleeuing all theſe things by gone,
hope ſhall take hold on things to come; but if thou beleeue not
theſe things bygone, thou ſhalt neuer hope that Chriſt ſhal come
againe to thy deliuerie. All theſe things bygone goe before the
thing to come: he hes told all the articles of the beleefe, ere he
come to this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt againe; therfore thou muſt beleue
theſe things bygone ere thou hope for Chriſts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. Then he
brings in a deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſon of God; from his name, a Sauior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
from his office, a deliuerer: a ſauior muſt be a deliuerer, his name
bears his office, for Ieſus muſt be a ſauior of men. There are two
things joined together, Chriſts comming and our eternall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie:
when he came firſt in the world, he began with deliuerie,
and by his death redeemed vs; when hee ſhall come againe
he wil make an end of our deliuery &amp; there ſhal be no more ſin,
death,<note place="margin">Our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendes on Chriſts comming.</note> trouble or ſorow. So al our deliuerie depends ſo on chriſts
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, that if he return not we ſhal neuer be fully deliuered: &amp;
by the contrair, Ieſus returning, of neceſſitie thou muſt get a full
deliuerance. They that looke for deliuerie (there is the order of
hope) their hope is euer firſt in the comming of Chriſt, vpon the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16659:31"/>
which their deliuerance dependes, then in the ſeconde rowme,
they looke for their deliuerance. They are fooles that look firſt
to be deliuered, that is a backward order: therefore ſay, I hope
Ieſus ſhall come againe, and then ſay, I hope to be deliuered: &amp;
ye ſee in the Reuelation the cry of him who lookes for ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is <hi>Come Lord Ieſus.</hi> Reuel. 22. 20. The meaning is, When vve
deſire Chriſt to come, we deſire the performance of our deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
when we deſire Doomeſ-day, vve deſire the perfection
of our eternall deliuerie, and it will not be vntill that day: if thou
be founde in Ieſus thy deliuerance ſhall then come in the full
accompliſhment thereof.</p>
               <p>Now, from what ſhould he deliuer vs? <hi>From the vvraith to
come.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liueres vs from the vvrath to come.</note> That is, from all paine and vexation. All the terrors, &amp; hell
that ſhall follow on the wrath of that great God that ſhal be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
in that great day (for, that effectuall wrath of God ſhall
ſtrike in that great day) are called <hi>the vvrath to come.</hi> No doubt
the Apoſtle by this word would ſtirre vp our mindes to looke
for a greater wrath, then euer was ſeene in this world: there was
neuer ſince the firſt day to the laſt, ſuch a wrath of God ſeene in
the world, as ſhall be ſeene in that laſt day. The Lordes vvrath
hes bene vttered oft times in great meaſure ſince the beginning,
as in that great deludge, in the burning of Sodome and Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha
with fire and brimſtone, in the particulare deſtruction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
people and ſundrie nations: but all is nothing to that great
wrath, all is but play, in reſpect of that laſt wrath. And therefore,
they are fooles, who meaſures the greatneſſe of the wrath of
God, by the ſelie momentaneall afflictions, that is laid on men
and wemen in this earth. Some thinkes, God can not powre a
greater wrathe, nor when he caſts a man in great ſickneſſe,
when he cauſes one to be rugged in ſunder one part from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when he cauſes one to be burnt with fire: and fooliſhe
wretches will ſay, What can God doe more to me? Knoweſt
thou not, that, there is an euerlaſting wrath in God? or euer it
light on thee, it ſhal make each member ſhake in ſunder, &amp; when
thou ſees it comming down on thee, thou ſhalt cry, Mountaines
and Hilles fall downe on me, and couer me from the wrathe of
the Lambe Reuel. 6. 16. Againe, mercie is not, to be meaſured,
by the mercie we get heere: it is a blaſphemie, to thinke, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16659:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God hes no greater mercie to ſhovv on thee, nor he ſhows here.
So the greateſt affliction that can fall on vs heere, is nothing in
reſpect of that laſt wrath. Therefore, that laſt day is called 2.
Rom. verſ. 5. <hi>the day of vvrathe.</hi> There was no day before called
the day of wrathe. Now, brethren, as the greateſt wrath ſhall be
powred out that day: ſo, the greateſt mercie ſhall be ſhowne to
the godlie that day. And they, who ſhal be founde vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
of the wings of this Ieſus the Sauiour, wrath ſhall paſſe by
them: but, they, who ſhall not be found vnder his winges, the
wrath ſhall tumble on them. Alas, if we could conſider this.
Learne to ſeek Ieſus in tyme. The way to find Ieſus a couerture
in that day, it muſt not be to beginne then, thou wilt not get him
then, if thou got him not before: thinke not to cry, then, Ieſus
couer mee: but, the waye to make Chriſt a couertour to thee
muſt be in this lyfe: beleeue in him heere, beleeue, that, he came
into the worlde to releeue thee from this great wrathe that
day: beleeue, that, he died for thee, roſe againe for thee and hope,
that, he ſhall come againe to that eternall deliuerance. Miſſe not
this hope. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie</hi> 2. Epiſt. 4. 8. ſpeaking of that crown
of righteouſneſſe he ſhall receyue, he communicates that crown
with others: but, who are they? they, that hopes for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
If thou, in ſome meaſure, hunger not and thirſt not for his
comming in this life, looke not to be couered by him hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
grone therefore, and thirſt for Ieſus, in ſome meaſure, that he
may keepe thee in that great day from the fearce wrath of God.
Conſider this, the world bindes vp mens eyes, that, they ſhould
not ſee Chriſtes comming, and it makes vs, neuer to deſire, to
heare, nor, know of an other life, or, of Chriſts comming. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
take vp this neceſſitie, and let all this lyfe be a preparation
to a better life, &amp; in al thy exerciſe in this life, ſay, Lord, I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſde
heere, in this vocation, or, that vocation at thy command:
but, Lord, for all this buſſines, I am a pilgrime here, my life is not
in this world, and my heart and eye is beyond this worlde vvith
thee. The Lord giue vs grace, to haue this hope: woe to that

               <p>Now I will go forward in the Chapter following. Wherein

that he could not win to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſhewes the impediments, Sathan

               <p>To come then ſhortlie to the leſſons. Firſt Iſe the people that
hes beene grounded and edified in faith by the miniſtrie of the

of the word in the Miniſtrie, I challenge your experience how
oft ye remember the power of God in the miniſtrie, whither ye
rejoice or not: ſaying, well is me, I haue not my faith grounded
vpon the wiſdom of man, but vpon the power of God; ſeeke it
for the fondation of your faith, that it be firme and ſure: for if
thou haue not a ſure foundation to ground thy faith on, it ſhall
fall. And that thou may find it. I counſell thee that thou neglect
not the Paſtor: for if thou forget the Paſtor &amp; his miniſtrie, thou
ſhalt not come to the fondation of thy faith. I put it out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
the power of Gods word by his miniſtry is a ground wher
vppon your faith is grounded. If this miniſtrie go awaye, faith,
ſaluation, and all graces in this land will decay.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing wheron ſtands this power, is in the ſecond
verſe. It ſtands in a libertie, boldneſſe &amp; freedome, in vttring the
Goſpell, and ſpeaking of Chriſt. So, brethren, wher liberty, wher
boldnes in preaching the Goſpell is, there is effectualnes in it, &amp;
the man who hes this boldnes, is a fectfull man, &amp; his entry ſhall
neuer be in vaine. If the Lord giue thee libertie, if all the worlde
had ſaid the contrair, the effect ſhall not be in vaine, and where
the Lord geues not this libertie, all the preaching is fectleſſe and
without frute. I ſhall ſay nothing but that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaieth:
where there is no liberty in the ſpeaking of Ieſus, of his mercie
and grace, no freedome of mouth &amp;c. there is nothing but a
dead Goſpell Where there is no libertie in vſing all the parts of
the miniſtrie, in rebuking, admoniſhing and comforting, there
is nothing but a dead Goſpell. (I meane euer of a libertie groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on God, not on mans vaine affections) where this liberte is
not there is nothing but a dead miniſtrie. I beleue this nation be
come alreadie to the hight of this liberty, not of the mouth only,
but of the heart. And I think the Lord is binding vp the harts of
men that they are not louſed with that liberty, if it were but in
preaching the Goſpel, as they wer. Lord be mercifull to vs. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
this worke be drawing to an end: ye haue keped it long: &amp;
bleſſed ſhall they be that dies in the light. And ſo when I looke
a far off, I pittie the poſterity, which appearantly ſhal be dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of that liberty; al for our ingratitude, we had a grace, &amp; liber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie
which we contemned. So God in juſtice is drawing it away.</p>
               <p>Next marke againe. <hi>In God,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>not in man.</hi> That is we
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16659:33"/>
vſed that libertie which God gaue vs. The libertie of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of man is nothing worth. Looke then what euer be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the Miniſter, it be warranded by the word of God. And
looke againe, that it ryſe of the inward motions of the Spirite in
the hart. If a man ſpeake of his owne priuate affection (ô Lord if
he ſhould not haue a well ſanctified affection that ſpeaks in the
name of the Lord) it is better to him not to ſpeake, he indangers
himſelfe &amp; hes much to make account of. But if thou haſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands
in the word, break out with it with liberty: for it is as great
danger to thee to conceale it when thou haſt a warrand, as it is
to ſpeake it of thy owne affection. And without queſtion the
Lord will controll them that will controll thy libertie here. The
Lord giue eyes to men that they may ſee what danger they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
by controlling the libertie of the worde in the Church.
There is his moderation in teaching.</p>
               <p>Now one thing more. Al this power is in the beginning in his
enterance to them. The Apoſtle is now afflicted in Macedonia,
when he comes to Theſlalonica, all his preaching is but a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile:

ſhall I ſay of this? If <hi>Paul</hi> had had no more but the ſpirite of a
man, he would not haue immediatlie gone to Theſſalonica, and
there teached: and being in Theſſalonica he would not haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
any thing that would haue diſpleaſed them: No, but he
does otherwiſe: the power of God neuer ſo well appears in men
as vnder affliction, for when man is weakeſt God is ſtrongeſt in

laſt day vve ſhevve the Apoſtle proponed his manner of his
entrie among them, it vvas not in vaine, it vvas not fectleſſe,
but fectfull, and when he come and entered amongſt them, he
come vvith a libertie and boldneſſe, vttering the Goſpell of
Chriſt, and a libertie not grounded on man, or on his ovvne
affection, but on the power of God. This boldneſſe he ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
in reſpect of the afflictions vvhich before he had ſuffered
at Philippi, &amp; in reſpect of that ſuffering he had, while he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
that word of the Goſpell with libertie among them.</p>
               <p>Now to come to this text we haue in hand. The Apoſtle in
the third verſe of this chapt. anſweres to that which might haue
bene thoght and objected by the Theſſalonians (for he meetes
the thoght of the heart) Thou ſayes thy entrie amonge vs was
with libertie &amp; boldnes, but looke with what ſincerity thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
among vs: it is not eneugh to preach with boldnes &amp; liber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie,
but there muſt be ſinceritie, looke that thy preaching hes not
bene with deceat to deceiue vs, with vnclea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, with guile. If any
of theſe thre things haue concurred with thy preacing &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting,
al thy liberty in preaching &amp; exhorting auails not. The
Apoſtle anſweres (marke euerie word) <hi>for our exhortation vvas
not by deceit, nor by vncleannes, nor by guile.</hi> Look to the vvords.
Our exhortation, our doctrine or preaching (for by a ſpeciall
part of the doctrine, which is exhortation he vnderſtandes the
whole, and that becauſe all doctrin ends in exhorting. Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion of all doctrine) exhortation, ſayeth he, was
not with deceat, with vncleannes, nor with guile, that is to ſay,
was not with any kind of fainednes, neither in ſubſtance of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,
which is called deceat (falſe doctrine deceiues.) Neither in
affection, in vttering the Goſpell, which is called vncleanneſſe,
neither in the manner of delyuerie, which here is called guile. In
a word our exhortation was voide of all ſort of vnſinceritie: no
part was ſimulate. Marke the leſſon on this verſe. Ye ſee here
this meeting the Apoſtle makes to the verie thoght of the heart,
and to the opinion they might haue conceyued, that he was
not ſincere in doctrine, vtters plainlie that there is oft-tymes
a verie opinion and ſuſpition in the heartes of the hearers,
that there is vnſinceritie in the teacher, in delyuering the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and this will make ſuch a doubt in the heart, that it will
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16659:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hinder edification and faith. And therefore the teacher had
much neede to take head to himſelfe in teaching, to his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to eſchew all ſort of vncleanneſſe, if it were but in his
thoght and affections: before he ſpeake he ſhould ſtriue to get
a ſanctifyed heart, and in word let him meete the verie thoght
and ſuſpition of the people, to remoue all blame of vnſinceritie
in preaching and vttering the Goſpell, that edification and faith
may increaſe. His end in preaching is faith, that the people may
beleeue and be edified: Let him therefore put away all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
that may ſtay the edification of the people, that the
worke and building may goe vp and faith may grow.</p>
               <p>Then ſecondlie ye ſe, there are ſundrie ſorts of vnſinceritie: A
man may be vnſincere in teaching many wayes: he may teache,
and yet teache falſe doctrine: he may be vnſincere in his heart
in teaching: he may be vaſincere in delyuering, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
thee. And there is none of theſe wayes, but they will ſtay
edification, if the people take a ſuſpition, if it were of an vnſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie
of the heart, it will ſtay the worke. And therefore, in all
manner of way the teacher ſhould ſtriue to be ſincere in vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Goſpell: that if there be any ſtop, it may be in him that
heares, and not in him who teaches: for if the preachers ſtryue
not for his part to ſinceritie, and the people for their part to
ſinceritie in hearing, it will be a great ſtay to the worke.</p>
               <p>Now into the next verſe, when he hes remoued from him
the opinion of all kinde of vnſinceritie, and hes purged himſelf
thereof, either in doctrine, affection, or in manner of delyuerie:
He ſets downe the contrair, to wit, the ſinceritie he vſed in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
The ſinceritie he vſed was this, that he ſpake: how ſpake
he? Not as they doe who are ſet to pleaſe men, but to pleaſe
God. There is the ſinceritie in ſpeaking: he had not men before
his eyes, he reſpected not the pleaſure of men: but in ſpeaking
and preaching his God was before his eye, and his heart was
ſet to pleaſe God. Sinceritie in preaching and hearing is to be
meaſured by the end that thou reſpects in doing thereof: for
if God and his glorie be not before thy eyes, as the Butte wherat
thou ſhootes, albeit that which thou doeſt and ſpeakeſt had
neuer ſo faire a face, yet al is vnſincere and vncleane. The thing
I marke heere ſpeciallie is, a Paſtor that ſtryues to be ſincere in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16659:35"/>
ſpeaking and preaching muſt ſet himſelfe to pleaſe ſome in his
ſpeaking: but heere a caueat to be keeped, in the perſone whom
thou ſtudies to pleaſe, either by doing, or by ſpeaking: this is all
the weight of the matter; if thy heart be ſet in ſpeaking, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and doing, to pleaſe men and to ſatiſfie the humours of men
firſt of all: if that be the butte thou ſhootes at, becauſe this man
likes of this ſpeaking therefore I wil ſpeake this: if this ſpeaking
pleaſe this woman, therefore I will ſpeake this. If that be the
end of thy ſpeaking, all thy ſpeaking is vnceritie &amp; flattery:
if thou ſeeke to pleaſure any creature, if it were the Angels, let
be a man, all thy pleaſant talke is but vaine talke and flatterie. I
deny not but men may be pleaſured to, Rom. 12. 18. but looke
that thy butte be not to pleaſe men, of what eſtate ſo euer they
be, but onelie to pleaſe God. Firſt pleaſe God, and in God pleaſe
them, &amp; then thou can not go wrong. If men and wemen (what
rank ſo euer they be of) can not be pleaſed in God, and will not
let God haue the firſt place, then pleaſe thou God, and anger all
the world. If thou ſtudies to pleaſe any perſone onelie in God in
ſpeaking and doing, there can be nothing there but ſinceritie. A
ſure rule, a man can neuer faile in ſetting his heart to pleaſe God,
in thoght, word and deed. The Lord giue vs vpright hearts to
ſtudy to pleaſe our God, and then all creatures onelie in him.</p>
               <p>Now he layes down a good ground, why in his preaching he
ſtryued to pleaſe his God, it was not without a good cauſe: and
the ground is, God pleaſed him firſt, &amp; why ſhould he not inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
himſelf to do all things to pleaſe him againe, &amp; render him
the lyke duetie. <hi>But as vve,</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>vvere allovved of God in ſuch
ſort, that the Goſpell ſhould be committed vnto vs, ſo vve ſpeake.</hi> That
is, that he hes placed vs in this calling, made vs Apoſtles who
wer vnworthie bodies: of one who was vnable of ſuch a calling,
hes made vs able: as it hes pleaſed him ſo to pleaſe me, and as he
hes allowed of me, who was altogether vnworthie, my ſpeaking
ſhall be to pleaſe him. There was neuer a Miniſter that euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
grace for that calling at the hands of men, neither at king
nor ſubject, but onlie at Gods hand: and therefore let him ſtudie
to pleaſe, not men, but God, who geues him al graces: and if men
can not be pleaſed in God, let him not ſtudie to pleaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now
to ſpeake of this allowance, there is a difference betwene the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16659:35"/>
of men, when they allow of men, and God when he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
of men: man allowes of man, becauſe he ſees ſome good
qualities in him, which qualities he neuer gaue him, for God
gaue him them. But when God allowes of man, he allowes not
for any good thing he ſees in him, to moue him to allow of him,
but al the allowing of God is of fre grace, all is according to the
good pleaſure of his will:<note place="margin">Gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovvance of free grace.</note> he allowes not of man becauſe he is
able to do good, but becauſe God allowes of him, therfore he is
made meet and able to do good: when God choiſed thee before
all eternitie to glorie, what ſaw he in thee? The Apoſtle ſaieth.
<hi>He predeſtinate vs in himſelfe.</hi> Eph. 1. 5. Of his own fre loue he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vs to grace. Before he called vs to grace, what ſaw he in vs to
moue him to make vs partakers of his grace? He ſaw matter of
hell and damnation in vs. And therfore his allowance of vs was
not for any grace was in vs: if he had allowed of vs conforme to
that which was in vs, he would haue ſhot vs with his hand to hel
for euer. So when he calles one to be a Miniſter and teacher of
the Goſpell, allowes he of him becauſe he hes a grace before
hand? No, the beſt Miniſter that is choſen he hes no more grace
by nature to this holy function, nor the vildeſt ſinner in the
world. So it is the allowance of God himſelfe that makes man
meet to that office: ſo this allowance of God was in himſelf: no
matter thereof in <hi>Paul,</hi> matter contrarie to grace was in him, he
was a blaſphemer. 1. Tim. 1. 12. <hi>Paul</hi> had neuer bene an Apoſtle,
but an impe of the Deuill, if God had not allowed of him firſt.
The note is,<note place="margin">Gods free loue binds vs to pleſe him.</note> the vndeſerued loue of God, when he allowes of vs,
when he calles vs to faith, or places vs in any calling (if it were a
King in his calling,) either in Church or common-wel bindes &amp;
obliſhes vs to ſpende our liues in that calling, that God may be
pleaſed. If euer thing bound thee, this vndeſerued lyking God
had of thee, who firſt lyked thee when thou was full of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inne,
bindes thee to ſet thy heart to pleaſe God: for thy bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
joy and felicitie is to pleaſe him: and he that ſtudies not
to pleaſe him, knew neuer what joy was. Alas, if we coulde
apprehend our owne miſerie before Gods allowance of vs:
(We are not placed ſo ſoone in any calling, but immediatlie we
conceate vvith our ſelues, that God hes ſeene in vs ſomething
worthie of it,) and then againe, if we could apprehend that free
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16659:36"/>
mercy of God, after the ſight of our own vnworthines, then we
would ſet our hearts to pleaſure him. For, neuer apprehending
our miſerie and Gods mercie and free calling, we ſet our ſelues
in our calling to pleaſe men and our owne foull affections. The
Lorde waken vs, for appearantlie the tyme of tryall drawes
neere: we haue beene vnthankfull for the vndeſerued graces of
God beſtowed on vs. Therefore he is begun to draw them from
vs, and lets vs follow our own affections.</p>
               <p>Now next, In what thing ſtriues <hi>Paul</hi> to pleaſe God? what
was his calling? He ſayes, <hi>The Goſpell vvas committed to me.</hi> That
is his calling. Therefore, ſaye he, <hi>ſo vve ſpeake.</hi> Looke what is
euery mans calling? Euery man in a faithful diſcharge of his own
calling is bounde to pleaſe God. He ſaieth not, God allowed of
me, therefore I pleaſe him in playing the part of a king or magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate:
but he hes called me to be a miniſter, therfore I wil pleaſe
him in ſpeaking. Then let euerie man ſet his heart to pleaſe God
in his owne calling. So there are two things vve ſhould reſpect
in ſeruing God: Firſt do all to pleaſe him; Secondlie, in the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
he hath placed thee into chieflie ſtudie to pleaſe him. Keep
theſe tvvo, and then thou ſhalt be acceptable vnto him.</p>
               <p>In the end of the verſe he ſubjoynes, <hi>But God vvho approoueth
our hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Theſe vvordes containe an aſſurance that <hi>Paule</hi> had
in his heart, that in ſpeaking and diſcharging of his calling hee
pleaſed God. God within me had his ſecreete allowance, God
in my hart as he allowed of me firſt, ere I had grace, and placed
me in the Miniſtrie, ſo now when he has geuen me grace to
pleaſe him, he allowes of me There are two ſorts of Gods allow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing.
The firſt is when God allowes of any man before he haue
anie grace,<note place="margin">2. ſorts of Gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovving.</note> and by his allovvance makes him able to doe good:
the ſecond is, vvhen he allowes of him in the vvorke he hes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
him by his grace. The firſt allowance moues a man to ſerue
his God and to do all things in his calling: the ſecond allowance
is a warrand to him that he hes done well. Alwaies the leſſon is.
If thou ſet thy ſelfe to pleaſe God thou ſhalt neuer vvant a vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of thy doings, thou ſhalt neuer want a ſecreete teſtimonie
within thy ſelfe, (albeit all the vvorld ſhould cloſe their mouth,
and neuer ſpeake to thee) thou doeſt well: ſetteſt thou thy ſelfe
to ſerue God, he ſhall round in thy eare and tell thee of thy wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16659:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and giue thee a ſecreete joye. By the contrair, doeſt thou
euill? art thou an harlote? ſetteſt thou thy ſelfe to diſpleaſe God,
who hes geuen thee all things? thou ſhalt get a bitter witneſſe in
thy hart, ſaying, falſe villaine, thy pleaſure is in diſpleaſing God;
ô catiffe, thou art adjudged to condemnation. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. Epiſt. 3. 20.
ſayes, <hi>If thy heart condemne thee, God is greater then thy heart,</hi> much
more will he condemne thee: take head to thy conſcience; if thy
conſcience tell thee thou doeſt well, the Lord approues thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
otherwiſe, if thy conſcience telles thee thou does euill, the
Lord diſallowes thee.</p>
               <p>Now as he hes remooued from him before, all ſortes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere
doing, and tooke to him ſinceritie in ſpeaking, to pleaſe
God in all things who gaue him his allowance: he goes deeper
in the verſe following, and he remoues from him the ſoull vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
out of the which ſprings the vnſinceritie in dealing. The
firſt is called flattering words: the ſecond auarice: the third, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
inſatiable greed of honour and eſtimation.<note place="margin">Fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines, of vnſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie.</note> He remoues
all theſe three, which are as as many fountaines, wherefrom vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinceritie
ſprings. It is not my purpoſe to inſiſt largelie on theſe
vices. Onelie I ſhall ſpeake as accords to this place. The firſt
then is flatterie,<note place="margin">Flatterie.</note> for no man vſed he anie flattering wordes in
preaching. Marke the leſſon. When a Preacher is inclyned to
flatter and fletche on earth, either King, Queene, Councell, or
ſubject, man or woman, he is not ſincere in his calling. There is
none of vs in no degree, but we may be, yea, and would be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.
The Apoſtle is ſpeaking heere of flatterie, not of Kings,
or Princes, but of the flattering of the Theſſalonians, <hi>Neither did
vve vſe flattering vvordes,</hi> ſayes he. But my leſſon is, Where any
Miniſter is ſet to flatter and fletche on the earth, that man ere all
be done, will fall out in falſe doctrine, he will frame himſelf ſo to
the affection of them whom he would flatter that he wil be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere
in doctrine. Why? The fountaine of flatterie is the foull
crooked affection of man or woman: and ſo, if the vaine man
wil apply himſelf to the crooked affection of man, the doctrine
ſhall be crooked: ere he faile in flatterie, he ſhall fall out in falſe
doctrine. The heart of them who ſpeakes in the name of the
Lord Ieſus, muſt be ſet onelie on God, and not vpon any man
on earth, Well, the Apoſtle takes them to be witneſſes of this,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16659:37"/>
and ſayes, <hi>As ye knovv.</hi> It eaſie to knowe a flatterer, his wordes
will bewray him, he will commonlie call God to witneſſe, but
not men. Men ſhold behaue themſelues ſo, that they take not ay
God onelie, but alſo good men to be witneſſes to their doinges:
<hi>Paul</hi> heere takes not God, but the people of Theſſalonica to be
witneſſe, ſaying, <hi>ye knovv.</hi> It is true, brethren, albeit the words wil
bewray the flatterer; yet ſuch is the blindnes of man, who vvith
ſelfe-loue is ſet to pleaſure his foull affection, that if a man wold
neuer ſo plainelie flatter him in his face, yet oft times he can not
perceiue the flattery, and he beleues this fained flatterer to be his
greateſt friend. The Lord keepe vs from ſuch flatterers, &amp; ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
our eies vs grace that we may diſcerne them.</p>
               <p>The next verſe. The ſeconde vice is auarice, and he calles it
the pretence of auarie;<note place="margin">Auarice.</note> your books turnes it, <hi>nor coloured couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
Auarice in anie man is dangerous, but chieflie in a Miniſter;
it will make him to do much euill: for if his heart be ſet on aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
and that be his end and purpoſe to vvin the worlde, he will
in the end fall out in corrupt doctrine: for the rule of his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
being his ovvne bellie and gaine, ere he faile to get his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
hee will teach falſe doctrine. It maye be there be ſome men
in this lande vvhoſe hearts are ſo ſet on this ſort of auarice, that
they vvould ſay maſſe, ere they ſhould vvant their gaine. After
that this vice of auarice raigne in anie man, it vvill miſguide him
maruellouſlie, he wil leaue nothing vndone to get his filthy hart
ſatiſfied: in anie eſtate in the vvorld an auaritious heart workes
much miſchiefe. In the next words he takes God to be witnes, &amp;
ſayes, <hi>God is my record</hi> Auarice is not ſodanely perceiued, becauſe
it comes in with ſo faire a colour, the colour of godlines, the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
colour that is, and the ſight of man is ſo ſhort that it can not
looke in to the corners of the heart full of guile. But the Lorde
hes an eye that can looke through thy bodie in to thy hart, and
he can tell thee whether auarice be in thee or not. And therfore
<hi>Paule</hi> takes God to be vvitnes that his heart was cleane of aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice.
Then learne; there is nothing ſo hid in man but he will get
a witnes thereof; if man can not be vvitnes, God vvho ſees all
things, hee ſhall be vvitnes to thee, and in that great day he vvill
reueale all, and diſcouer the ſecreetes of all hearts: thou ſhalt not
vvant a vvitneſſe: thinke nor, vvhen thou art ſinning, thou ſhalt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16659:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ay lurke ſtill in ſinne; no, the Lord at laſt will take thee out and
make thee a ſpectacle to the vvorld.</p>
               <p>The laſt vice here is ambition.<note place="margin">Ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
                  <hi>Neyther</hi> ſayes he, <hi>ſought I the
praiſe of men,</hi> I ſought no honor, <hi>neyther of you, nor of others;</hi> and ſo,
I am free of all kinde of ambition. To ſpeake this by the vvaye:
It is not eneugh to be free of anie ſinne in anie reſpect, at this
time onelie, in this place onelie, in the ſight of ſome onelie; but,
he that vvould be free of anie vice, as ambition, let him in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
be free of it; in reſpect of all perſones, all times, all places:
for, otherwiſe, he is an hypocrite and he vvill begyle men. So, we
ſhould ſtudie to pleaſe God in all wayes, in reſpect of all places
and perſones, and as if there vvere in the vvorld no moe but thy
ſelfe allone, thou ſhouldſt doe as he commanded thee. The leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone
is, It is dangerous for anie man to be ambitious; but, in him
that teaches the Goſpell in the name of the Lord, whoſe calling
ſhould be, to ſeeke the Lord &amp; his glorie, ambition is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous:
if this man be ambitious, if the thinge he ſeekes by his
preaching, be his honour and eſtimation, if his heart be inclyned
that way, in the end, if occaſion ſerue, he will proue an euil man;
he will be a papiſt, an hereticke, and ſo forth. It is a moſt ſure
thing, he that is geuen to ambition will applye all his actions to
obtaine honour, becauſe he ſerues that ſinne as a ſlaue. I confeſſe,
there are none free of vice, we are all borne in ſinne, (except the
Lord Ieſus) and naturallie we are inclyned to al vyce, to auarice
to ambition, we woulde all be Kings, and rulers &amp;c. no, none
of vs is free thereof: but, bleſſed is that ſoule that getteth a peece
of mortification, that his ſinnes raigne not ouer him, as lords; for,
if ſinne raigne ouer thee, thou ſhalt be compelled to ſerue thy
appetite. Wee are all foull, aſwell miniſters as people, but, the
Lord keepe vs from ambition raigning in vs and tyrannizing
ouer vs. For, then, there is no vyce nor miſcheefein ths worlde
that can be deuiſed, but we ſhall be compelled to commit it, and
all, to ſerue that foull ſinne; and a Miniſter in his calling of all
men ought to haue the greateſt care to flee this ambition. Alas,
the raigning of theſe ſinnes what they haue wroght in this age,
experience hes told: this black darknes and this corruption that
is in the kingdome of Antichriſt hes riſen on flattery, auarice &amp;
ambition: among all the Princes on earth, who ouercomes this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16659:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Antichriſt in auarice? who ouercomes him in ambition? who
goes before him in flatterie? Miſerable experience ſhowes well
eneugh, that theſe vyces hes broght in all hereſies, and darknes,
and theſe are thre rootes to all other vices.</p>
               <p>Now in the wordes following, he amplifies that which he hes
ſpoken of the ſins of auarice and ambition. He ſaieth <hi>I ſoght not
goods, nor honour of you, nor no others:</hi> he amplifies it <hi>In deed I might
haue ben chargeable to you.</hi> I might haue ſoght goods of you, being
the Apoſtle of Chriſt: my calling might haue made me charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to you, to haue taken goods and honour or you: but I did
it not. Brethren this is a maruellous thing. Men hes this ſentence
in their mouth.<note place="margin">miniſters right to temporall things.</note> The Miniſter of God hes no right nor title to
theſe thinges which other men enjoyes. But I ſay to thee, he hes
a title to the riches and goods of this world, to his own ſhare of
the honour of this world in his calling. Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
to the Corinthians, 9. 11. ſayes, <hi>If vve haue ſovve vnto
you ſpirituall things, is it a great thing, if vve reape your carnal things?
If or hers vvith you be partakers of this povver, are not vve rather?</hi>
Which wordes importes a greater right we haue nor other men
hes. If ye be addebted in any of theſe things to any man, much
more to him that miniſters ſpirituall things. And <hi>Paul</hi> charges
Philemon verſ. 19. not with a common pleaſure or goods: but
with a debt of himſelfe: a Miniſter hes a right in a man to his
lyfe if he be faithfull. But that ye ſhould not thinke this marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
the things, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, that are geuen by the Miniſter, are
things ſpirituall: he miniſters to thee that ſpirituall lyfe, and
woe is to that man that gettes not this ſpirituall lyfe: and thou
may ſay, curſed be the houre that euer I was born in, thogh thou
were the Monarch of the whole earth, if thou get not this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
lyfe, the lyfe of God, the lyfe of Chriſt. Then he ſayes, as
by <hi>Ironia:</hi> is it a faire matter to thee to miniſter to them temporal
things? this world thinks they get ouermuch if they get a drinke
of colde water, or an aiker of land: but would to God men had
an eye to ſee what theſe ſpirituall things meanes. There is no
ſenſe of heauenlie things amongſt the moſt part of men now in
thoſe dayes. Yet againe the ſpeciall commendation a Miniſter
can haue, is euen for Chriſts ſake, and for the Goſpels ſake, to
renounce ſome part of this right he hes to worldlie thinges,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16659:38"/>
ere the Goſpell ſhould be ſlandered. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes,
we haue not vſed our right, but we ſuffer all thinges, that in no
maner of vvay the Goſpell ſhoulde be ſtayed, and ſo the courſe
of mans ſaluation left off. Marke it, If anie man for the Goſpels
ſake let a peece of his right paſſe, (aſwell an other man as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter)
that the Goſpel may be furthered, and the courſe of mans
ſaluation goe forvvard, it is vvell done. The Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Why
ſuffer ye not vvronge rather nor before heathen magistrates ye ſhoulde
cauſe the Goſpell to be ſlandered?</hi> 1. Corinth. 6. 7. Well is hee that
can let ſome part of theſe vvorldlie goodes goe, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
may encreaſe: hee ſhall receyue a faire recompence, and
he ſhall get a part of that heauenlie inheritance with Chriſt his
Sauiour.</p>
               <p>Novv to end: In the laſt verſe we red he ſets downe a vertue
contrarie to auarice and ambition; leauing auarice, leauing am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
what follovved? he ſayes, <hi>But vve vvere gentle among you,
euen as a nource cheriſheth her children.</hi> So the vertue that <hi>Paul</hi>
vſed contrarie to theſe two vices, is pleaſantnes: this pleaſantnes,
vnderſtand what it is, it is a gentlenes in all manner of dealing,
in behauiour ſubmitting him ſelfe to them, for the winning of
them, ſubmitting him ſelfe to al kinde of trauell and paine; as the
paine the nource takes for the childe, to be a ſeruant to them
that he might vvinne them, not reſpecting the honour and care
of the world, but onlie vpon ſuch affection as the mother hes to
her childe; &amp; ſo he takes a ſimilitude from a mother toward her
infant: there is no buſines nor care the mother wil leaue vndone
for the infant, nor reſpecting her hyre or gaine, but vpon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teere
affection to the infant. Then learne ſhortlie; A paſtor muſt
be like a mother: <hi>Paul</hi> Gall. chapter 4. verſe 19. compares him
ſelfe to a mother trauailing in birth, vntill Chriſt be reformed in
them; <hi>O my little children, vvith vvhom I trauaile in birth, vvhile
Chriſt be reformed in you.</hi> Novv he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pares the paſtor to a nource
taking paines to nouriſh them when they are borne vpon a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie
affection, without eyther reſpect to goods or honor; and
he compares the people, who by the paſtor are fed in Chriſt, &amp;
nouriſhed by the ſincere milk of the vvord to infants. As a yong
infant craues no other nouriſhment but milke; no more ſhouldſt
thou craue to be nouriſhed with any other food but the ſinceere
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:16659:39"/>
milke of the word: and as the infant would die, except he be fed
with milke: ſo all they that refuſes to be nouriſhed with this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
milke of the word, if they continew, die ſhall they. Thou
Lord, Laird, or Barron, Husband-man, die ſhall thou, if thou be
not nouriſhed with this ſincere milke of the worde. If it be
ſo betweene the people and the Paſtor,<note place="margin">Affection of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor to the flocke.</note> as betwene the childe
and the mother: the Paſtors leſſon is. Looke what tender affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
the mother hes to her birth, to cheriſhe it, to take paines
and trauaile, to wake and watch ouer it, and all vpon a motherly
affection, without reſpect of honour or gaine: the lyke ſhoulde
thy affection be towards thy flocke, and on paine of thy lyfe
looke thou ſeeke them, and not theirs. The Mother ſeekes the
well of her childe, and not his goods, nor honour: ſo ſeeke thou
the well of thy flocke, and not their goods, nor honour, and let
thy affection be motherlie: and when thou ſees the motherlie
affection of the mother to the childe, ſay, The Lord giue me
ſuch an affection to my people as this mother hes to her childe,
&amp; let my honour and gaine be to get them nouriſhed. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a Miniſter is in Heauen, and not in earth, his gaine
is in Heauen. So <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth, 1. Theſſ. 219. <hi>What is
our hope, or ioy, or crovvn of reioyſing? are not euen you
it in the preſence of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt at his

compariſion. A mother who loues her childe, ſhe will not be
ſparing to him, but liberall: ſo a Paſtor that hath anie tender
affection to his flocke, will not be ſparing, but liberall and
free to them. When the heart of man is open with the affection
of loue, it will open the hand alſo, and if he be niggard-handed
ſparing on his flocke thoſe graces God hes geuen him, it is a ſure
argument there is no loue in his heart.</p>
               <p>But come to the good things whereof the Apoſtle was libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
The firſt thing was the Goſpell of God, a pretious thing,
the glorious Goſpell of the bleſſed Lord. That is the thing that
is concredite to him, and it is the foode of the ſoule of man: ſo
that his liberalitie beginnes at the foode of the ſoule, he muſt
be liberall of the foode of the ſoule of men, which is concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
to him, to giue it to his flock. The mother beginnes to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
her childe with the milke of her owne breaſt, her own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
So the Paſtor muſt beginne at the foode of the ſoule, he
muſt begin at the ſincere milke of the word, without the which
there is no growing, and if they be not fed with this milk of the
word firſt, they ſhal neuer come to the grouth &amp; ſtature of man,
but ſhall be like dwarſſes: and we ſo long as we dwell heere are
onelie infants in heauenlie things; and all our thinking of heauen
is but infancie; all our ſpeaking thereof, the blabling of infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
So we muſt be fed with that milk or elſe we ſhal neuer come
to the ſtature of men, and perfection of heauenlie things. The
Apoſtle counts this but a ſmal thing, to deale the goſpel of God
(albeit it be pretious) in reſpect of the other thing, his ſoule he
had to deale to them. 1. Cor. 9. 16. He ſaieth, <hi>if I preach not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,

for his flock. This is counted a greater thing not the other, to die
for the flocke, greater not to deale the Goſpell. Not that <hi>Pauls</hi>
ſoule was more pretious then the Goſpel of God: no, the Goſpel
of God was more precious then the ſoules of <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> and of
all the Apoſtles, and of all the men in the world: but he counts
it greater, becauſe it was an harder thing to him to do: it was an
eaſier thing to him to preache the Goſpell, nor to giue his lyfe
for them. Yet brethren, albeit it was an eaſier thing to a man to
preache the Goſpell, nor to giue his life, thinges will fall out ſo,
that all the bygone preaching ſhall be in vaine, except in the
end thou ſeale vp thy bygone preaching with thy bloude, if
God call thee therevnto, the Goſpell ſhall not haue that ſweet
ſmell except it haue the perfume or thy bloude. The Apoſtle
to the Philipp. 2. 17. ſayes that the vvould rejoyce <hi>If he vvere
offered vp vpon the perfume of their faith.</hi> When the Lord thinks
it expedient, he muſt lay dovvne his ſoule, and vvith his bloud
he muſt perfume the Goſpell he hes preached, otherwiſe he hes
loſt all his trauell and his life to; and it is better to ſuffer then to
loſe all his trauaile, and in the end his life. This tyme is yet to
come to vs, the Lorde knovves hovv neare it is. The Lorde
giue vs grace that vvee loſe not our tyme bygone, but that
vve may laye dovvne our lyfe for the Goſpell, if that neede
requyre.</p>
               <p>In the end of the verſe he turnes againe to the ground of his
liberall dealling. This my liberalitie is not for any liberalitie of
yours toward me, nor for any reſpect of commoditie I will get
at your hands. This my liberalitie is ſet onelie vpon louing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
So that hee declareth the cauſe thereof to be loue.
It is neceſſare to the people to be perſwaded of the loue of the
Paſtor, otherwiſe except they be aſſured of his loue, albeit he
ſhould vtter the faireſt doctrine that is, there will be no edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And ſo I ſee <hi>Paul</hi> ay ſeekes to ſhow them of his loue, that
they might be edified. Particular gaine will make a man preach:
There are ſundrie Miniſters who wil be diligent to preache for
game; but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it comes to lyfe geuing they faile there. Worldlie
gaine will neuer cauſe him be liberall of his lyfe, onelie loue
makes a man liberall of his lyfe. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth,
It was onelie for loue, and not for gaine, <hi>becauſe ye vvere deare

To teſtifie the inward affection of the heart, the Paſtor beares
to the flock: it is not eneugh to profeſſe a good-will, that he
had a purpoſe to haue vſed liberall dealing with them, and
to ſay, I vvill deale liberallie vvith you: that is onelie vvordes:
but vvith the words, the flock muſt haue an experience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
an experience of bygone loue and of a good deed, and there
is nothing better to teſtifie the affection, then the labour and
trauaile the Paſtor ſuffers for the flock. Charitie is laborious
and painefull chap. 1. verſ. 2. a man who loues an other he will
vndertake paines for him: His loue will not be in word, but in

Ye knowe this all well eneugh. Farther the word is to be

and yet he preached carefully to them, and al to this end, that the
Goſpel ſhould not be ſlandered, he wroght with his own hands,
albeit they wer debt-bound to him. Marke here, the thing in the
world all men ſhould chieflie ſeeke, is that the Goſpell of Chriſt
ſhould haue the own progreſſe, without any ſtop or ſtay. And
aboue al things a Paſtor who is the inſtrument of this progreſſe,
is bound that by no meane hee be the ſtay of the Goſpell gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to win ſoules to the kingdome of Ieſus: left that which he is
building vp with the one hand, be not caſle downe with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

the week they caſt down by their euill life: they deſtroy more
by their life &amp; maner of liuing, nor they builde by their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The leaſt offence in the world wil hinder the courſe of the
Goſpel; becauſe of the infirmitie of men &amp; wemen, for they will
ſtart at a ſtray. There was neuer a ſtumbling horſe comparable
in ſtumbling to the heart of man: conſidering that ſo little a
thing will cauſe men take offence at the Goſpell, and leape far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
back nor they came forward. (We clim vp to Heauen verie
ſoftlie and ſlowlie: but if vve runne to Hell, vve ſhall fall dovvn
in an houre more then vve did climme in a yeare.) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are all bound to flee all kinde of offence and ſlander.
Looke that thou offend not, offend not the infirme to cauſe
them goe aback, neither in the word of thy mouth, nor in any
action vvith hand or foote, or by the vvinke of thy eye to ſay
the progreſſe of the Goſpell And of al men the Paſtor is bound
to walke moſt warelie. <hi>Paul</hi> renounces his own right to flee this
occaſion of offence. The Theſſalonians wer bound to giue him
temporall thinges, who miniſtered to them ſpirituall things:
but giuing ouer his right, he laboured night and day with his
hands for his ſuſtentation. Euerie man in their owne degree is
bound to ſuffer all extremitie, ere they be a ſtay to the Goſpell;
but cheeflie the Miniſter. For <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt Epiſtle to the
Corinthians chap. 9. verſ. 23. ſayeth, If for the Goſpell they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteene

               <p>Farther ye may perceiue in the perſon of <hi>Paul</hi> and his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

their labour all the day is crying, and begging. Alas, it is a ſhame

be mended, aſwel as it is lamented: alas that there is no remedie

A man that loues, be he paſtor, or be what he will, he will ſhowe
his loue in going before others in a godlie life and conuerſation.
In his life and conuerſation he wil be an example to others, and
he liues not without vvitnes in the worlde: when thou goeſt out
the way, the eyes of manie are vpon thee; goeſt thou out like a
murtherer? many followe thee, goeſt thou out like a thiefe, an

going out before his flocke in an holie life: and theſe that haue
not an holie life I will not ſay they haue loue: I will not ſay that
the murtherer hath loue, no not to his owne wife and children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and he is but a ſtumbling blocke to all them that looke on him.
An harlote hes no loue, ſhe is but a ſtumbling blocke, &amp; would
haue al the world to follow her: theſe are deſtroyers of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that ſhoulde be builded on Chriſt: woe to the deſtroyer of
the Church of Chriſt. This is to be marked: thou wilt not liue
without vvitneſſes in the world, liue as well as thou wilt. <hi>Paul</hi>
had vvitneſſes of his life and manner of conuerſation, God was
vvitnes and men were witneſſes: <hi>ye are vvitneſſes and God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

ſerues for nothing: who can allow when God diſlikes? So thou
who can not nor dare not ſay, Lord be witneſſe to my ſincere
heart, thou haſt no witneſſe of God. Againe it is needfull that
the conſciences of men among whom we liue in this worlde,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16659:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhould geue vs a teſtimonie of a goode life: &amp; if thou laikes the
teſtimonie of men, thou laikes an approbation thou ſhouldeſt
haue: and <hi>Paul</hi> euer ſeeks the approbation of men and appeales
their conſciences. The worde in the end of the verſe is to be
marked. <hi>Among you that beleeue.</hi> That is, you that are faithful: he
takes the approbation of the faithfull. It is faith that decernes, it
is the eye of faith that ſees good and euill, and not the eye of the
bodie. The faithleſſe man, if he were neuer ſo quick, can not take
vp holineſſe, if he be faithleſſe, he can not decerne betweene
the holie and vnholie. This will be his diſcretion: the beſt man
he will judge him worſt, and the worſt man he will judge him
beſt. And therefore with <hi>Paul</hi> let no man take him to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of wicked men: but let him rejoice when wicked
men ſpeake euill of him: but take him to the approbat on of
good men. The approbation of an vnſanctified bodie is of no
valour. The true approbation is onelie of God, and of theſe
who hes faith to take vp the trueth of good and euill.</p>
               <p>Now the laſt argument that teſtifies of this loue, it is in ſuch
things as concernes his calling; namelie, in exhorting, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,<note place="margin">Faithful. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

Wel then a louing Paſtor wil not be dumbe: a dumbe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
is nothing worth: but as <hi>Paul</hi> makes the compariſon, he
muſt be as a father teaching his ſonnes ſtanding in the midſt of
them, exhorting, comforting, rebuking them; ſo muſt a Paſtor
ſtand in the midſt of his flock, to exhort, comfort and rebuke
them: loue muſt be in dealing with diſcretion, and all men muſt
not be delt with alike, all men muſt not be exhorted, becauſe all

there muſt be a right cutting of the word, a Paſtor muſt be a

his flock will ſtand vp before God and Chriſt and juſtifie him
in their preſence in that day: if he hes bene vnfaithfull, they ſhall
make a complaint of him, that he was an vnfaithfull Paſtor who
hes not done his duetie in his vocation. Therefore let euery man
take head hovv he behaueth himſelf vvith any people, for either
they ſhall be condemners. or abſoluers of him.</p>
               <p>Now he exhorts them. To vvhat thing? <hi>To vvalke.</hi> Not to ly

becauſe this life is but a pilgrimage, and a ſleeping pilgrime is
nothing worth. If thou goe not on, thou ſhalt neuer come to thy

it were better for men to be ſitting or ſleeping then to be walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

maner.<note place="margin">Rule of vvalking.</note> What is the rule of this comelineſſe? <hi>Walke vvorthie
of God vvho hes called you to his Kingdome.</hi> In a vvorde, the rule
is, this glorious calling of God to be a Chriſtian man and to
be partaker of his kingdome. He vvho is called to be a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
man or vvoman, is alſo called to the Kingdome of God
and Chriſt. Brethren, euerie mans life ſhould be meaſured ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his calling, and as his calling is, ſo ſhould he walke,
and that calling ſhould be a meaſure of his life. The king ſhould
vvalke in Majeſtie, to command: the people in loue and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
to obey: the Miniſter in vprightneſſe, to teache: the people
in holineſſe to vvalke before him: a marchant, a man of law,
each one of them is bound in their manner of liuing, according
to the rule of their calling. So, they that haue their calling to be
chriſtians, ſhould haue their walking according to their calling.
Is thy calling to be a chriſtian? Liue not as a Pagane then, but
as a chriſtian. Thou wilt ſay, thou art called to be a chriſtian, and
then thou wilt be in the meane tyme a murtherer, an harlote, a
thiefe: Is that thy walking in thy calling? No, this chriſtian cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is to a Kingdome and glorie. There are none who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16659:45"/>
to be a chriſtian, but they are called to a glorie and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
they are tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated from the power of darkneſſe, to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
of Chriſt. Therefore, ſeeing, their calling is to a kingdome,
they ſhould walke like Kings ſonnes: we are all made by our
calling the ſonnes and daughters of God, adopted in Chriſt and
heires of that glorie that God dwels in. Then, walke worthie of
God and glorie. As our kingdome is aboue, flee and mount a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
this earth, in ſome meaſure, ſo far, as the heauineſſe of this
corruption will fuffer: lift vp thy ſelfe, ſinne holds thee down,
caſt off ſin and preaſſe vpward: that life that is in God muſt be
gotten aboue, in Chriſt: otherwiſe, if our harts be not lifted vp to
that kingdome &amp; glorie, if our conuerſation in ſome meaſure be
not anſwerable to our calling, we are vnworthie of that calling,
and we haue neuer bene effectuallie called: thou was called by
the eare onelie, thou heard the Goſpell, thy heart neuer recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the Goſpell, nor ſaw this Kingdome and glorie that thou
was called to. Theſe wicked lyues of men ſhowes vs, that, they
were neuer effectuallie called. So as thou wouldſt be a citizen
of that heauenlie kingdome, and partaker of that glorious

is the double matter of reioyſing and thankeſgiuing to God:
double grace and meetinge of grace craue double rejoyſinge
and thankeſ-giuing to God for the mercie double beſtovved
vppon them. If anie man had euer anie grace, <hi>Paule</hi> had it; yet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16659:47"/>
the man is neuer ſatiſfied in his owne perſone, except he finde
grace in thoſe to whom he vttered grace meeting his grace, &amp;
except he finde his miniſtrie povverfull to them whom he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
for otherwiſe he counts all his labour and running to be in
vaine. Therefore all teachers ſhould ſtriue to finde the povver
of the worde in the people; for wherefore are Miniſters ſent in
the worlde? but to ſee that that word be effectuall in the people
to vvinne them to God: and in verie deede he may rejoice when
he ſees the ſaluation of the people wrought by his teachinge.
This in generall.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the words. Their faith is ſet downe in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
degrees; and marke them: the firſt degree is hearing; they
heare the word of the Apoſtle;<note place="margin">4. degries of ſaith</note> there is the firſt grace in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
meetting the paſtor, when they giue their preſence &amp; heare
him patientlie. It is of the grace of God that a man or woman
can ſit and heare the vvord of God: and it appeares that it is the
grace of God; ye ſee manie in Scotland that gets neuer the grace
to heare, no preaching,<note place="margin">1. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the vvord.</note> no hearing in many parts of the land: mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
are they without preaching, without hearing No queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what euer other cauſes be of the lacke of preaching &amp; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it is a juſt judgement of God on the people: and woe be to
them that drawes away the moyen of preaching and hearing
from the people: miſerable ſhall their end be. For, I ſee not, how
ſaluation ſhall be, without preaching and hearing. There are
many againe, that albeit occaſion of hearing bee offred to them,
and the teacher be at hand, yet they will not come to heare, they
may heare and will not heare. Some will come to ſit down, but
if any thing touch their affection, they will heare with impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
all this ſhowes you, hearing is of grace. Firſt, to get the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of hearing, is, grace: next, to heare patientlie, to heare ſin
and vice rebuked in all eſtates of men and vvomen it is a grace;
for, ſome, in hearing their ſinne rebuked, they heare impatiently

And by the contrair; it is a ſpeciall grace of God, that men and
vvemen gets, when they can ſit ſtill and heare the word of God
patiently. There is the firſt degree.</p>
               <p>The ſecond degre of their faith and meeting of the Apoſtle,
is receyuing of the vvord. That is to ſay, a receyuing and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of the word of God,<note place="margin">2. generall allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> to be true and good, euen, a generall
allowance therof. When this man will ſay vvithin himſelfe, this
is true that is ſpoken. Many gets not this grace: for, many when
they heare, ſuppoſe they lend their eare to the vvorde, in their
minde they diſalovv that which is ſpoken: and albeit thy mouth
be cloſe, yet the minde vvill be making contradiction <hi>The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle. 1. Cor. 2. 14. <hi>vvhen he heares of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
things, he vnderstands them not:</hi> yea, more, <hi>he thinks them all but
fooliſhneſſe.</hi> Set vp a naturall man, he will ſcorne all that is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Chriſt and of ſpirituall things, and will laugh at them in
his owne heart. When <hi>Paul</hi> came to Athens Act. 17. verſ. 18. and
entered among thoſe high headed Philoſophers, and begouth
to ſpeake of the way of God. They met him againe with ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and they ſaid, <hi>What meanes this bablor?</hi> they thought all that
he ſpoke babling. There are many of them in Scotland, who
thinks, vvhen a man ſpeaks of Chriſt, that, all is but babling.
Then, it is a grace of God, to geue an allowance to that vvhich
is ſpoken.</p>
               <p>There is farther heere.<note place="margin">3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> heart.</note> The third degree of grace, is, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the word in the heart. There are many that can heare, that
is a grace: when they haue heard will giue a generall allowance,
that, all is good, all is true; there is the ſecond grace, but, in the
meane tyme, they will ſhoote it all out of their heart: they will
ſay, it is true and good, but, what is that to me? they neuer em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embrace
it in their owne heart. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> (as it is tolde, Acts
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16659:48"/>
8. 21. allowed of that which was ſpoken, &amp; it is ſaid, he had faith;
in the meane time, no application in his ovvne heart, for, ſhortlie
after he vttered that gall of bitterneſſe which was in his heart
&amp; he wold haue bought the graces of the holie ſpirit: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Peter</hi> meetes him, and wiſhes, that, he ſhould periſh and his
money to. There are manie of this ſort, who vvill be content to
heare &amp; allovve it to, &amp; ſay. The Miniſter hes ſaid vvel this day,
all is true: yea but what haſt thou reported, and what haſt thou
applyed to thy heart? Thou heard to thy condemnation, except
thou apply ſome thing to thy ſelf of that grace thou didſt heare.</p>
               <p>Yet ther is a fourth degree; <hi>to receiue it as God vvord,</hi> Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to heare, allow, embrace; but to receiue it as the word of God.
Albeit, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke it,<note place="margin">4. Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the vvord, as the vvord of God.</note> yet, they looked vp, aboue <hi>Paul,</hi> and tooke
it out of his hand, not as his vvord, but as the vvord of God: that
is a greater grace. There are manie that reſt to much vpon the
man that teaches, and ſet their hearts on the mouth of him that
ſpeakes more nor on God that giues the ſpeaker the grace. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
will heare this vvritten vvorde, allow it, embrace it, but they
make it to them the vvord of man, rather nor the word of God;
becauſe they count the Scripture to be authentick, not becauſe
God did ſpeake it, but becauſe the Church ſayes it, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
do ſay, this day. So they make the New and old Teſtament
to be the vvord of men. The Lord keepe vs from ſuch an error:
for it is not poſsible to builde faith vpon that ground. I appeale
thy conſcience that ſayeſt this, if euer thou didſt finde that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
faith in thy heart: faith can not reſt, except it haue an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that, the word is from God and not from men: how manie
in this countrie faile in this? There are manie that receiue and
embrace it, not with that reuerence they ſhould: when they hear
it ſpoken they giue no reuerence nor obedience thereto, more
nor it were the word of man, for when they goe out, they are as
wanton in wickedneſſe as euer they were before. This teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
their want of due reuerence, If this were ſetled in the hearts
of men, that, the word that is ſpoken were the word of God, and
that it is not the man that ſpeaks it, but Gods Spirite in the man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
they would receiue it, embrace it, and obey it with greater reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
O, the obedience he would giue to that word. There is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallie
ſuch a reuerence of God in the heart, that when they are
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:16659:48"/>
aſſured it is of God, they will reuerence it.</p>
               <p>Now brethren, ye ſee in all theſe degrees nothing but faith.
All is expreſſed in faith: ye ſee the beginning of it, the progreſſe
of it, the ending where it reſts. It begins at the outward ſenſes: It
begins at the eare. <hi>Faith is by hearing.</hi> Rom. 10. 17. Then it goes
next, to the minde, which allowes and approues it. It ſticks not
there, but it goes downe to the heart; and there in very deed is
the right ſait of faith: there is the proper loding of faith. Look,
that, thy faith be not in thy head and eare onelie (there are many
hes it ſo, and it goes away with the winde) Looke, that it goe to
the minde, and be not content with that, but ſee, that, it goe down
to thy hart. This faith, ye, ſee, then, it exerciſes the whole ſoule of
man: it exerciſes both the reaſonable powers &amp; the affections.
Take head to it. The thing whereinto this faith is exerciſed, is
the word of God. Faith in the eare is exerciſed about the word,
faith in the minde is exerciſed about the word, faith in the heart
is exerciſed about the word of God. The word of God ſhould
fill the whole head, mynde and heart. This is it that the Apoſtle
to the Coloſſ. ſayes. chap. 3, 16. <hi>Let the vvord of God dvvell in you
plenteouſlie:</hi> not ſparinglie, but powerfullie. And certainelie
thinke on, I tell you, if thou ſtryue not, ſo long as thou art heere,
to be filled with the word of God, looke not after this lyfe for
his preſence: if thou preaſſe not, in ſome meaſure, in this lyfe, to
haue thy ſoule filled with him: looke not, that, God ſhall be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to thee in the life to come. Alas, we can not get that fulneſſe
and our ſoules ſo wel exerciſed as we ſhould haue by the word:
but if we ſtriue to this, our willingneſſe is acceptable to God.
Where there is a deſire to thinke and meditate of it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
that thou canſt not haue that deſire therof as thou wouldſt,
it repares that want we haue of that fulneſſe.</p>
               <p>There is yet one thing heere to be marked. The ſpeciall
ground of his thankſ-giuing, is, for the imbracing of this word,
not as the worde of men, but as the worde of God. Wherein
ye ſee, it is a rare thing and a ſpeciall bleſſing of God, vvhen
a man is not offended vvith that goode vvorde of God. What
care I for him, ſome vvill ſay oft-tymes, I vvill heare the vvord
of God, and receyue it, but this companion vvho teaches, hes
offended me, I vvill not heare him. Againe, he is of ſo meane
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16659:49"/>
graces, he can not ſpeake two words right, he is babling. Well
thou art ſtumbling: and thou wilt breake thy neck if thou doeſt
ſo: for thou muſt not thank that the word of God hangs on the
mouth of man, but the mouth of man doth hang on the word of
God. This is the fault, we meaſure euer the word of God by the
inſtrument, and counts ay of the word of God, as of the word
of man that ſpeakes it and preaches it. 2. Cor. 10. 7. Enter in

doing, and mans doing is contrair to Gods doing. There is the
wiſdome of God. It hes pleaſed him from the beginning to put
his power in the weakeſt creature, in the ſillieſt and baſeſt to
looke to the hes not choſen the wiſe in the world, the potent and
noble, to put his power in them, when it pleaſed him to vtter his
omnipotent power. When he vttered his power againſt <hi>Pharao,</hi>
he puts his power in frogs, in lyce, in flees, and he is auenged
on proude <hi>Pharac,</hi> by thoſe vylde things. All this is, and was,
that his power ſhoulde be ſeene, that men ſhould not thinke,
this is the power of a frogge, louce or flee: but is the power
of the great God that made all thinges. And when he meanes
to deſtroy <hi>Goliath,</hi> he will not haue the armie of the Iſraelites,
nor <hi>Saul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

without armour, with a ſling onelie. All this was that the world
might ſee, it was not <hi>Dauids</hi> power, but Gods that ſlew <hi>Goliath.</hi>
So, the richeſt treaſure that God hes in Heauen, vvhich is
Chriſt Ieſus in the word, he puts it in vylde veſhelles, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
thereof. The vnſearchable riches of Chriſt, the power
and juſtice of God in Chriſt, and all the glorie of God in Chriſt,
he takes it and puts it not in veſhelles of ſiluer, and golde: no,
but in a veſhell of earth. 2. Corinth. 4. 7. and all this is, that, the
vvorlde ſhoulde not eſteeme the treaſure according to the
veſhell. Therefore, the Lorde will put in a veſhell of claye
the treaſure that is Heauen in Chriſt. Now will ye ſee mans
famous wiſdome. When he heares the vvord comming out of
this baſe and infirme man, he ſayes, the veſhell is nothing worth,
it is made of clay, it ſerues for no purpoſe; a ſillie fellow, from
whence came he? therefore this word that is in his mouth, it
can not be the word of God: would euer he haue put ſo preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a thing in ſo vylde a veſhell? O rebellious man, that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16659:49"/>
contrarie to God in all thinges, and ſpeciallie in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell!
Experience teaches vs of the enimitie, that the wicked
men in this Realme caries in their heart againſt God and his
Miniſters: they will not let God be wiſe in his wiſdome he hes
in his Miniſterie, but they will be wiſer. Well, fight on, his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
will winne the fielde, and thou wilt loſe it to thy euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Now to goe forward. He caſteth in a parentheſis, ſaying,
<hi>As it is in deed, the vvord of God.</hi> Ye eſteemed it not as the word
of men, but of God, as it is in deed: Receyue it as ye pleaſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it Gods vvorde, or mans, as ye pleaſe, it is and ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde
Gods vvord; and thy mouth in the end ſhall be ſhutte
vp, ſo, that thou ſhalt not vtter one vvord if thou account anie
otherwiſe of it. So vvhat euer be the opinion of men in the
vvorlde, and their ſpeaches, their ſaying, or gaineſaying alters
nothing:<note place="margin">Th' inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adds, nor dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the glorie of the vvord</note> The vvord of Ieſus abydes, and ſhall abyde the true
vvord, and ſhall retaine the ovvne authoritie and glorie: thy
vvordes vvill neuer be able to make any change. No, brethren,
the mouth of man for as infirme and graceleſſe as it is, will not
be able to impare a jot of the glorie of that God: and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair,
put it in the mouth of neuer ſo glorious a creature, if it wer
in the mouth of an Angell, nothing will be added to the glorie
of it: it is powerfull in the ſelfe, the creature will not be able to
make any alteration. In deed, it will honour the mouth, when it
is put in the mouth of a man it will make him honourable, but
he can not honour it, if he were neuer ſo noble or eloquent. Set
vp a king to preache, trow ye he will honour the Goſpell? no,
but he ſhall get honour by the preaching of it. No, if it were all
the Angels of Heauen that would preache this glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
they can not giue it honour, but they are honoured by it.
And when the Angels came and cryed to men this word of
God, they got a ſingulare honour. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Galat. chap. 4.
verſ. 14. ſayes, <hi>ye receiued me as an Angell of God,</hi> yea, <hi>as Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
Wherefore was this? for <hi>Pauls</hi> ovvne preſence? no, but for the
word of God in his mouth, which made him to be accounted
as an Angell of God. Neuer man ſhall be able to ad any honour
to the word, or diminiſhe the honour thereof. Now bleſſed is
he who gets this grace to deliuer this word with an earneſt zeale,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:16659:50"/>
to glorifie God and Chriſt by preaching thereof.</p>
               <p>Now in the end of the verſe. He thinkes it not eneugh to call
it the word of God, but he giues a proofe of it. The vvord of
God vvher euer it be,<note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>er of the vvord.</note> will euer prooue it ſelfe to be the vvord
of God: it can not be idle, it muſt be quicke and effectuall in
the hearer, it muſt vvorke liuelie, it vvill pearce lyke a tvvo
edged ſvvord, and therefore, it is ſaid: <hi>vvhich alſo vvorketh in
you that beleeue.</hi> Hovvbeit it vvas vttered by an infirme man,
yet, the vveakeneſſe of the perſone hinderes not the povver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
operation of the vvorde. It vvill not be the mouth of the
ſpeaker that vvill holde back povver from the vvord of God.
But vvhen the Lord puts his vvord in his mouth, and ſayes, I
will put my vvord in thy mouth, go thy vvay, if all the world
had ſaid the contrare, that vvord ſhal be powerfull. Well is that
man in whoſe mouth this word is put: and vvell is that people
that hes a man in vvhoſe mouth the Lord hes put his word, the
baſneſſe and infirmitie of the man, will not be able to hinder
the povver thereof. If the Lorde once put his vvorde in his
mouth (it is ſo vvonderfull a thing.) Set vp eloquent <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes,</hi>

they ſhal not haue ſuch operation in the harts of men,
as a ſillie fellow, and ſimple of ſpeache ſhall haue, vvhen he
ſpeakes the vvord in the name of the Lord. And if there vvas
euer a vvorke in the vvorlde maruellous, that vvorke vvhich
the Miniſter by the Spirite, and vvorde of God workes, is moſt
maruelous. For, to regenerate a man, vvho vvas once dead, it is
not a mans tongue, his eloquence, his inſtancie that can doe it,
but onelie that powerfull, and bleſſed vvord of God: that all
glorie and praiſe of his povverfull operation may be giuen to
his Majeſtie.</p>
               <p>Marke a word farther. He ſayes, not that workes in euerie
one of you: but he ſayes, <hi>in you vvho beleeues.</hi> In the 1. chap.
Rom. verſ. 16. The Goſpell is called <hi>the povver of God to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to them that beleeues.</hi> In the firſt to the Corinthians chap. 1

God effectuall to ſaluation. Brethren, it is true, it is offered with
power to the vnbeleeuers, as well as to the beleeuers, but this is
the difference. If thou haſt not an heart &amp; hand to take it when
it is offred to thee with power, thou ſhalt neuer receiue its thou
wantſt power to receiue it, but there is power in the word very
ſufficient vnto ſaluation. Alas, how manie heare the vvord
with their heart ſo hardened, that the word ſtrikes on their hart
as an hammer on the ſtuddie. The hardnes of thy heart beats it
backe againe, ſo, that it is not powerfull to thee. My counſell is,
except thou preaſſe to haue thy heart mollified, and craueſt at
God to mollifie it, hear not the word, or Ile aſſure thee, the more
thou heareſt, the more thou vvilt be hardened. Manie make a
ſhowe of hearing: the Lord and the Laird will come and ſit in
their daskes and heare the worde, and will come forth without
anie profite, becauſe their hearts were not attentiue to heare.
Ieaſt not with the word, it ſhall eyther ſaue thee or ſlay thee, and
in the day of damnation thou ſhalt curſſe the time, that thou e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
didſt heare the word of Chriſt, if thou finde it not powerfull
in thee. Come, in a minde to renew thy ſinfull life, or, elſe, bide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
come to be humbled vnder this word and reuerence it, if
that thou were a King, or elſe bide away, vnleſſe thou vvouldſt
heap on thy ſelfe an intolerable damnation.</p>
               <p>Now brethren, I ſhall end ſhortlie in the next verſe. He thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
it not eneugh to ſet downe this in generall, what the vvord
of God wroght in them that beleeued, but he comes to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulare.
It will not be the generall word will do thee good but a
particulare. The ſpeciall effect is, <hi>It made them to be follovvers.</hi> It
is good to followe them that goe the right way: they vvere fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of the Church that was in Iudea, followers of the Ievves
that were conuerted and beleeued in Chriſt. The word confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Theſſalonians to the chriſtian Church of the Iewes. Al
this was by the povver of the vvord of God in the mouthes of
men. Looke not for an Angell from heauen to ſpeake to thee,
nor for a ſound from heauen: but looke for it out of the mouth
of men. We wearie faſt of this miniſtrie; what miniſtrie vvill vve

Lord Ieſus and to make him a ſillie lambe: He that now was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to draw him to Chriſt &amp; to cauſe him ſit down, and joine
himſelf to Gods people in holineſſe and godlines. This is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous
effect that the word hes. It is not the proper effect of the
word, to cut men from good men, but to make a conformitie to
joine good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; draw al together to the church.
The Lord, the great Paſtor, he joynes all the members of the
bodie together, and all to make a whole body to the head chriſt.
In a word, it is the force of Gods word, to worke our felicitie &amp;
bleſſedneſſe, and I aſſure thee, thou who art a contemner of the
word of Ieſus, thou ſhalt neuer be happie, neither in this life, nor
in the life come. All ſtands firſt in a conjunction with Chriſt
the head, and then, with the members. Step out of the ſocietie of
the church as you wil (what is the church to thee) I denounce the
terrible judgement of God againſt thee, if thou ſeek not to haue
that conjunction &amp; ſocietie of the church of God, thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
get a portion in Ieſus: there is thy doome, if thou repent not.
This conformitie is not al wroght at once: but, the word of God,
by the power thereof, will bring one firſt in, then, an other man,
then, the thrid man: then, one Church; ſecondly, an other church;
thridlie, the thrid church; and ſo, draw them al together. So, that
they who comes laſt, haue no diſaduantage, they both haue that
ſame word to draw them in that the firſt had and then alſo they
haue examples before them, drawing them in. It is good to haue
an aduantage beſide the word, to draw thee in. Brethren, we that
are now in the world we haue this laſt vauntage, we haue theſe
patternes: looke how many haue bene called, they are as many
vauntages and patternes to draw vs to God. And looke that
thou heare not of a godlie man, but preaſſe to follovv him, and
ſay, God make me lyke him: for, among the reſt of the meanes
God hes ordained to winne ſoules, the ſetting vp of patternes
before men is one meane. This nature of ours is backward, (For,
vve are all borne naturallie Woolfes and Tigers) ſo, that, it

               <p>Yet againe this conformitie that is ſet down wold be marked.
The conformity is in ſuffering, ye are followers of the church in
Iudea: in what? in ſuffering alike with them: the ſame perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they ſuffered, ye ſuffer: yea, more; he amplifies their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feringes,
in that they did ſuffer of ſuch like perſecutores as the
Church of Iudea did: euen of their own countrie-men: the Iewes
it was that perſecuted the Iewes who were conuerted: it is the
Theſſalonians that perſecutes you that are in Theſſalonica.
This is the perſecution.<note place="margin">Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring.</note> Then, learne. The conformitie that
ought to be among men and vvemen in the world, ſtands not
in doing onelie, to make others doe vvell, as he doeth well: As
one Church liues holilie, ſo, to cauſe one an other liue holily: but,
it muſt be a conformitie in ſuffering alſo, that, as one man ſuffred,
ſo, an other ſhoulde ſuffer: as one Church ſuffered, ſo an other
Church ſhould ſuffer: it wil not only be actiue, in doing, but, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue,
in ſuffering. There is a faire effect, conformitie in ſuffering.
Brethren, men oft tymes are readie eneugh to follow others in
doing, but, they are loath to ſuffer: all godlie men would be like
other godlie men in doing: I ſee not a godlie perſon, but, I would
be lyke him: and one Church would be like an other godlie
Church, in doing. But, if I ſee a godlie man ſuffer before me, I wil
hold aback and ſhrink to follow him. If thou ſee one martyred
before thee, thou wilt leaue him and not take part of his burden.
There is not a flouriſhing Church in Europe, but this would be
like it: but it hes no deſire to be like that Church in France, that
hes bene ſo long vnder affliction, and can not get vp the head
of it. It is in deed an hard matter to the word of God, to worke
doing good in the heart of man: but, a harder matter, to worke
patience and ſuffering of affliction: but, if the word be not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
as well to work ſuffering, as doing; I can not ſay, it hes that
force and power in vs that it ſhould haue. And therefore, albeit
thou be not as yet at ſuffering; yet, prepare thee for ſuffring: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
not thy ſelf for doing alone euery day, but, for ſuffring alſo
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16659:52"/>
whatſoeuer croſſe the Lord will lay on thy back. And let this
be part of thy prayer: Lord ſtrengthen me in ſuffering. For, as
thou wouldſt raigne with him, ſo thou muſt take a reſolution to
ſuffer with him. Who will not ſuffer, let him neuer looke to be
an heyre of Heauen. It is now due time to learne to be prepared
for ſuffering for Chriſts cauſe. The Lord giue vs grace that we
may ſuffer patientlie, that he may be glorified in our ſuffering.
To this God be glorie and praiſe for euer.</p>

ſayes he, <hi>the Lord Ieſus.</hi> There is the firſt point of their dittay.
Theſe men the Iewes, that trouble the Church of Chriſt in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,
are they that haue ſlaine the Lord Ieſus himſelf. They haue
in their extreame perſecution ſlaine and crucified to the death
the Lord of glory. 1. Cor. 2. 8. That is, they haue diſpatched him,
not after a common manner, but after a moſt cruell and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
manner, by a cruell, ſore and ſhamefull death. Whom haue
they ſlaine? the Lord of glorie: and honourable perſonage, all the
glorie of God, is, &amp; dwels in him as it wer. Who is this by name?
It is Ieſus, the Sauior of the world: euerie word aggreages their
fault. There is the firſt point of their dittay. The firſt crime laid
to their charge, is the crucifying of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, this is
the thing he begins at: there are mo pointes of dittay laid againſt

Lord Ieſus him ſelfe, if not in action &amp; in deede, yet in intention;
in the malice and hatred of the heart. The Prophetes in deede
were ſlaine and perſecuted in action, and died before the Lorde
Ieſus came in the world: but theſe ſame men that ſlew the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
with their hand, ere they ſlew the Prophets they ſlew the
Lord of the Prophets, the Lord Ieſus in their hearts: becauſe
that all the Prophets that were ſlaine were his ſeruants ſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him that was to come.</p>
               <p>Now to come forward. The ſecond thing is, <hi>They ſlevv the
Lord Ieſus,</hi> they ſlew the Lord of glorie, that in his ſlaughter,
ſo farre as in them lyes, the worlde ſhould be ſlaine: for they
that vvoulde ſlay Ieſus vvould ſlay all men, ſo farre as lyes in

Brethren, this is the ingyne and nature of perſecutors: the
worthier the perſonage be who is perſecuted, the greater grace
of God be in him, the greater glorie and innocencie be in him,
the greater will be the extremitie of their perſecution. None of
the Prophets of olde were ſo extremelie perſecuted as the Lord
Ieſus was; neither yet the Apoſtles that followed him were ſo
perſecuted as he was: and all becauſe of the greatneſſe of the
glorie of his perſonage. If ye will ſearch the grounde of this, it
muſt, no queſtion, come of great blindnes, for if men ſavv vvell
the grace and the glorie of God that is in the perſones of them
that are perſecuted, for all the vvorlde they durſt not perſecute
them. And therefore he ſayes in the 1. Corinth. 2. chap. 8. verſe,
<hi>If they had knovvne they had not crucified the Lord of glorie.</hi> No if
the glorie of the Church were ſeene, vvicked men durſt not
ſtirre her. There is yet a greater and an higher ground; The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of the heart comes in and blindes and putteth out the eye
of the minde, Eph. 4. 18. <hi>Throgh ignorance</hi> ſayes <hi>Paul, that comes
through the hardnes of the heart,</hi> for this is the nature of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the heart to hate the light and to delite in darknes, which
is enemie to the light of God: All our pleaſure is in darknes by
nature, and ſo it is caried againſt the light, and the firſt thing it
does it puts out the light of the minde yea euen the very natural
light, and ſo when the heart is blinded it caries him againſt all

               <p>The thride thing to be marked heere is. When he is laying

and ignominie of that paſſion: looke to theſe two things in him,
and then looke down to thy ſelfe, and looke what thou art firſt,
not a Lord, if thou were a King, but a ſeruant (all the Kings on

thou ſuffers, and thou ſhalt finde thou ſuffers not the

inequalitie betweene thee and him, and then beginne to reaſon.
The ſeruant is not greater nor his Lord, the diſciple is not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
nor his Maiſter. The Lord Ieſus is my Lord I am not but a

extremity; then may I not be content to ſuffer the thouſand part
of his ſuffering? Of this comes contentment of heart, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to ſuffer for the Lord. For except thy eye be ſet vpon that
perſonage of Ieſus Chriſt, it is not poſſible for thee to ſuffer
with joy the ſimpleſt croſſe that is for the Lords ſake.</p>
               <p>The next point of their dittay, <hi>they haue ſlaine their ovvn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>

It may be that he will lay to the charge of them that ſlew the

ſlaine them with their owne hands.<note place="margin">Poſteritie guilty through their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> For ye muſt vnderſtand that

All ſerues to this; to make fathers to be waie and to take
head to their actions, that they ſlay not themſelues allone, but
the multitude of their poſteritie, as <hi>Adam</hi> ſlew vs all. Yet there
is an other ground and anſwere to this. Theſe Iewes that ſlew
the Lord Ieſus, are counted to haue ſlaine the Prophets before
them. The ground and cauſe is this (I would that all murthereis
did heare this:) Slayeſt thou an innocent man ſuch as Abel? the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16659:54"/>
whole innocent bloud that was ſhed ſince the beginning lights
vpon thee, thou art guiltie of it. And therefore Chriſt Matt. 23.
36. layes to the Ievves charge the whole innocent bloud ſhedde
ſince <hi>Abell</hi> vnto <hi>Zacharias</hi> that vvas ſlaine betweene the temple
and the altar. Therfore murtherer take head, thou ſhalt drowne
in bloud, for by thy act thou giueſt approbauen to al thoſe mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therers
that were from the beginning. Thou makeſt it a paſtime
to dip thy hand in innocent bloud: but wo to thee if thou be not
waſhed in the bloud of chriſt. This for the anſwer to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Now marke, brethren. When he ſpeakes of the ſlaughter of
the Lord Ieſus committed by theſe Iewes, he forgets not the old
Prophets: and with the Lords he joines his ſeruants, neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
he the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Both the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cent in Gods me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.</note> 
                  <hi>and vs alſo haue they perſecuted:</hi> al are put in
one catalogue, the olde Prophetes, the Lord Ieſus, the Apoſtles
and Martyres that were ſlaine. And who doeth this? It is not ſo
much <hi>Paul</hi> as the holie Spirite that doth it: which is a token that
all the martyrdomes that haue bene, is, and to be; was not, is not,
nor ſhal not be forgot of the Lord: they are all in recent memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
And ſuppoſe there were not a booke of Martyres vvritten
in the earth, yet there is a booke in Heauen written, and all the
Martyres from the beginning are regiſtrate in it: and that book
ſhall be laid oppen before man &amp; Angels: ye ſhall ſee them, not
in pictures but in face. And again, he remembers the Iewes who
did it: ſo as there is a booke of Martyres in heauen, ſo is there a
booke of perſecuters, wherein all their names are written, and
in that great day the booke ſhall be laide oppen, and ſhall be
preſented to their eyes, to their rebuke, ſhame and eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.
So the Lord hes all in remembrance, the Lord hes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
memorie: a thouſand yeeres are but like a day to him, and a
day as a thouſand yeeres: albeit we will forget all, yet all is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
in his memorie. And this is verie comfortable to the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and it is terrible to the perſecutors. Woe is that man that
hath not his ſinnes forgote and pardoned of the Lord. There is
not one teare of the ſufferer but it is put vp in his bottle. This
for the ſecond point of their dittay.</p>
               <p>Let vs novve come to the third point. The Iewes vvere

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16659:55"/>
A wonderful thing that this people can not hold vp their hand:
the fathers ſlay the Prophets, the children ſlay the Lord, &amp; then
the Apoſtles. Ere I goe forvvard marke this: iniquitie, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

&amp; vngodlines, when once it enters in anie familie or clan, in any
race of men in the vvorld, howe hard a thing it is to get it out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
Oft times when the fathers begin with it, it followes on ſo
vpon the whole race of them, that it makes an end of them and
their race both Beginneſt thou that art a father? thy ſonne and
thy vvhole poſteritie vvill follow, while in end the judgement
of God light and deſtroy all together. Is the father a murtherer
and ſlew he one? the ſonne will double it: and ſo forth of other
vices: and then the Lord throwes dovvne the houſe and cuttes
off all the generation. And the Lord did ſo vvith theſe Ievves,
It is ſaid in the ſecond command, that <hi>the Lord viſites the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

this? becauſe the iniquitie of the fathers is driuen to the children
to the thrid and fourth generation. Therefore the vengeance of
God lights on all. Ye fathers therefore take head to your ſelues,
and purge you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iniquitie: for if ye be careleſſe of your ſelues,
the vengeance of God ſhall be on you and your children both.
The example of the Iewes might be a ſpectacle to al the world;
the verie iniquitie proceeding from the fathers to the ſonnes, till
all were cutted off, might nowe ſuffice to exhort all fathers to
leaue ſinne, as they woulde not be deſtroyed and their vvhole
race after them. Marke an other thing heere. There is nothing
that can not content this people: there is no kinde of meſſage
that can pleaſe them. Firſt the Lord ſends Prophets to them:
<hi>then he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ids his Sonne</hi> (as it is ſaid in the parable) <hi>that they might
reuerence him</hi> Matt. 21. 37. Laſt he ſends the Apoſtles his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
and they are as rigorous againſt them, as they could: ſo
no ſort of meſſage could content them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi>
So there is the ground: becauſe all come with
the light of the holie Spirite, therefore they perſecuted all. The
malice of a perſecuter, is euer againſt the light of the Spirite of
God. So let euerie man be ſure, ſo long as the Spirite of light is,
there muſt euer be perſecution. Had I an other man (will the
prophaine man ſay) I would heare him. No, if thou haſt this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16659:55"/>
of the light of the ſpirite in thy heart, if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould come
and preach thou vvouldſt perſecute him: yea if Chriſt him ſelfe
ſhould come in proper perſon, thou wouldſt perſecute him: take
therefore head not ſo much to the preacher as to thine owne
heart: if thou haſt the loue of the light, the preacher can not
be diſliked by thee, and by the contrair if thou haſt not the loue
of the light, thou wilt perſecute all that come to thee. This for
the thrid point of their dittay.</p>
               <p>Now comes on the fourth part of their dittay. <hi>God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. This followes the other three. The ſlaying of the Lord: the
ſlaying of his Prophets, and the perſecuting of his Apoſtles.
They that ſlew the Lord, and his Prophetes, and perſecuted the
Apoſtles: How could they pleaſe God that was the ſender of
them? And ſo in theſe wordes he takes off the couer of their
faces. For theſe malicious Iewes when they were doing all this
euill, they boaſted of themſelues they pleaſed God, &amp; they wer
his people ſaying. We are the Church and all theſe are enemies
to God. <hi>Paul</hi> pulles off this couer, and he ſhowes that they in
doing of this, were nothing but enemies to God Ye knowe in
theſe dayes men will come in and ſay, It is we that are the true
Church, it is we who are ſeruing God aright and in the meane
tyme they will be perſecuting burning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ormenting the children
of God? But what are they? will ye haue them deciphered? they
are enemies to God: the Pope is the Antichriſt, and this ſhall be
ratified in that great day. But to let them alone there are many
amongſt our ſelues, who will ay be doing euill, and are enemies
to God: for thou that art an enemie to his ſeruants, thou pleaſes
not God: for heere is a ground, There is no glorifying of the
Lord, but in his miniſtrie. Contemne thou this miniſtrie by little
and little in end thou ſhalt be an enemie to God, if thou hadſt
ſworne the contrair. If thou ſeuere the glorie of God and this
miniſtrie, and be a contemner of it, thou ſhalt neuer be glorified
of God. Ye haue heard foure pointes of their dittay.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the fift. <hi>They are contrai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Gentile. This is a conſequent of the firſt three: ſlayers of the

ſaluation, nor ſee the face of God) they are enemies to all
mankindes ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Come to the laſt point of their dittay. They forbid vs to ſpeak
to the Gentiles: they are enemies to the ſaluation of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
that by our miniſtrie ſhoulde be wonne to God and to his
Church: the porple-wall is broken down that did hold out the
Gentiles before, yet they wil hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the fold. There are
ſundrie ſortes of Iewes that hindered the ſaluation of men: there
is one ſort of them that vvould not ſuffer Chriſt to be preached
to the Gentiles at all, but euer raiſed vp ſedition to impead that
vvorke. Of theſe ye may read in the 13. of the Acts. There was
another ſort of the Iewes that ſuffered the Goſpel to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to the Gentiles, but added to it circumciſion and the law
of <hi>Moſes:</hi> of whom read Act. 15. The firſt ſort is worſt. Now
the Apoſtle heere meanes chieflie of this firſt ſort; who, as the
Lord himſelfe ſayes, <hi>vvould neither enter them ſelues into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor ſuffer others to enter.</hi> For this is a ſure thing, euen
as a man that hes gotten his own heart enlightned by the loue of
the trueth, would haue that light to be imparted to all the world
and wiſhes from his heart that all were partakers of it, as <hi>Paul</hi>
wiſhed to <hi>Agrippa.</hi> and the reſt that heard him, that they were
lyke vnto him ſauing his bondes. Acts 26. 29. Well had they
bene, thogh they had bene chainde, to haue had the light of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:
yet he puts to theſe wordes, for reuerence cauſe <hi>ſauing theſe
bandes.)</hi> Euen ſo, a man who hes the hatred of the trueth and
light, he would haue all the world blinded as he is, he woulde
haue all mouthes cloſed as his mouth is cloſed, that neuer man
ſhould name Chriſt to the world: He would haue all eyes put
out, that neuer a man might ſee one jote. In a word he that is in
Heauen tranſlated out of this darkneſſe of nature, he woulde
haue all in Heauen with him. And by the contrair: He that is yet
in darkneſſe, and ſo in Hell, he would haue all with him. So
looke what condition the man is of he would haue all lyke to
him. Therefore I will neuer thinke well of men that impeades
the progreſſe of the Goſpell of Chriſt: they argue what is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them: for were this loue of the light within their hearts, for all
this worlde would they not hinder the progreſſe of the Goſpel
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16659:56"/>
Alas, ye ſhall finde this ouer true in the end: woe, woe, to them
that hinders the planting of the Goſpell. Alas, if there were
this loue of the light in their hearts, there would not be ſo many
churches vnplanted, &amp; ſo many ſoules fuffred to periſhe.</p>
               <p>Now I draw to an end. When he hes ſet down theſe ſix points
of their dittay, whereof the leaſt is worthie damnation: for what
judgement muſt light on the ſlayers of the Lord, of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles? He ſets down the end of all, that euer <hi>they

this vvay to this end that the meaſure of their ſins ſhould

This is the end of the counſell of God. They had an other end.
But to make this plaine.<note place="margin">all things fall out to man by meaſure vvhole the fulnes come.</note> All thinges that fall as it vvere out

and Abell felt them firſt, and euer ſince the meaſure of them hes
beene increſſing vntill it came to Ieſus; and he tooke an heauier
vveight of affliction vpon him nor euer was before him. Yet
the meaſure of the afflictions of the Church is not filled out. In
comes the Apoſtles and they get their part: after them comes
the Paſtores, and they get their part: and enerie perſone that is
in Chriſt gets his part, and ſo euerie one hes his ovvne burdene.
So long as the world ſhall ſtand this meaſure ſhall be in filling
out: when it ſhall be full the world ſhall fail, and the pillers of it
ſhall be cutted, and an end ſhall be put to all teares. Reuel. 21.

hes his owne part. Likewiſe, ſome goe by a meaſure and ſince
the beginning this meaſure hes beene in filling: euerie age hes
caſten to their their owne part. It is not one age that hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

their arme-fall and burdene of ſinne: he vvith murther, the with
harlotrie, and he with oppreſſion and perſecution, and he comes
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:16659:57"/>
in with blaſphemie: yet the cup is not full, and the meaſure of
ſinne ſhall not be filled vp ſo long as the worlde doeth ſtand.
When the father dies, the ſonne will liue to fill out this meaſure:
he makes his teſtament, yet the ſin is not filled vp, but the thing
he could not doe himſelfe, he bids his ſonne do it, and he will
ſay to his ſonne: Sonne I could not get this man ſlaine, nor this
euill deed nor that euill deed ouertaken, if I had liued, I ſhould
haue done this or that: doe thou therefore that I coulde not do.
So doe the Iewes, and therefore the Lord ſayes, <hi>Fill out the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of your fathers ſinnes,</hi> Matt. 23. 32. Now when this meaſure
is full, the vvorld ſhall take an end and all ſhall fall down, but

deſtroyed for euer, and the afflicted bodie ſhall finde ſaluation.

of the Diuell ſtirred vp ſuch a vehement ſedition, that <hi>Paul</hi> is
compelled to ſlee to Beroea. The word he vſes heere hes a great
pith. It ſignifies not onelie to be ſeuered, but it ſignifies to be
made an orphanne, a puple deſtitute of father and mother, and
ſpoiled of his parents: and therefore the ſeuering of him, was as
the ſpoyling of an orphane or puple from the father whom he
loued beſt in the world. The text is eaſie, and the obſeruations
fall out as eaſie. Ye may ſe firſt the delite and pleaſure the godly
haue to dwell with other to haue a mutuall preſence one of an
other, that euerie one may receiue of other conſolation in Ieſus
Chriſt. Rom. 1. 11. 12. eſpeciallie a Paſtor, or a Miniſter when he
ſee the Lord hes bleſſed his laboures among any people or
congregation, his pleaſure is to abyde with that people, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte
is in the preſence of that people, and when he is ſeuered
from that people, it is as ſore to him, as to a childe, or young one,
when he is ſeuered from the parents, and ſpoiled of the preſence
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16659:59"/>
of father and mother. Againe we may note. The Deuill the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
of mans ſaluation muyes nothing more then the mutuall
ſocietie of the godlie: and eſpeciailie aboue all other ſocieties,
he inuyes the preſence of a faithfull Paſtor vvith his people:
for he knows that by this miniſtrie ſaluation is vvrought. Novv

ſeuered, the people ſhall be a pray to him. This is his oulde craft,
and no noueltie. Now the Deuill is euer lyke himſelfe, he can

caries the meſſage of ſaluation before the people, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Now the word vſed heere is to be marked. He ſayes, he was

haue gotten the deſyre and langor away, he had gotten a great
victorie: but as the heart abode with them; ſo his deſire was to
haue a bodilie preſence, to ſee them face to face. And brethren,
trow ye that the deſire that the godlie hes to be with other be in

be vaine: and that which it will deſire moſt, it will not artaine to

either one tyme or other. Deſireſt thou to ſee Ieſus and his face?
(for thou feeſt it not yet) deſireſt thou to ſee that glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?
thou with thy eyes ſhalt ſee it certainelie. Deſires thou to

This is a token thy deſire was not ardent: thou that wilt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

we muſt euer goe forward that we may be excuſed both before
God and man: and this is the excuſe of the Apoſtle, he could do

               <p>I goe forward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before whom and in whoſe preſence ſhall this

if in the meane time the light of Ieſus ſhine not in thy heart, all is

all this light muſt come from Ieſus Chriſt, and thou muſt holde

he ſayes alſo, as ſoone as the heart is turned, the va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

euer feele that ſolide joy and life, but when thy heart was ſet on
that countenance of Ieſus? Foole, thou mayſt rejoice, like a dog
or beaſt with a ſenſuall pleaſure, but woe to thy joye and peace:
there is no peace to the vvicked; for when thou art ſo paſsing
thy time out of Ieſus, the judgement ſhall ſodainelie ouertake
thee: for there is no ſaluation out of Ieſus.</p>
               <p>When ſhal this be? At this comming. It is true we vvalke heere
in his preſence, and that joye that comes downe from Heauen
it comes through that glorious bodie wherewith he is cled: but
the ſacietie of all ſhall not be, vntill the eye ſee it, thy glorie
ſhall not be perfited while then. I tell you, all the light we haue
now, the Apoſtle calles it the light of the Euangell of the glorie
of God: it is his face that ſhines in a mirror, thou ſeeſt him no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe:
but then this mirror ſhall be taine avvay, and the face
of Ieſus ſhall be holden vp in your ſight. Brethren, while we are
here, the light co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes from heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ouer ſhadowes and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
the ſoule onlie, and that, not fullie, but in a part: but, when
he ſhall come, he ſhall tranſforme not the ſoule onelie, but theſe
vilde bodies, and make them conforme to his glorious bodie.
Phil. 3. 21. And ſo, there muſt be a greater force in his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
nor is in the mirror of the Goſpell. And thou that takeſt a
pleaſure to ſee Ieſus in the mirror of the Goſpell, and to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſhadowed
with the light of the Goſpell, the face of Ieſus
ſhall ſhine on thee: and by the contrair, thou that takeſt no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in the mirror of the Goſpell, thou ſhalt neuer attaine to the
ſight of Ieſus. Wilt thou continue in hatred of the miniſtrie
of Ieſus Chriſt, thou ſhalt neuer ſee the glorious countenance
of Ieſus.</p>
               <p>In the end of this chapter, not being content to tell this once,
he ſayes it againe, <hi>yes, ye are my ioy.</hi> This doubling proceedes of
a perſuaſion that he had of that glorie: in a word, let a Miniſter
be faithfull to winne many ſoules, to pleaſure God and Ieſus
Chriſt, who will recompence him ſo aboundantlie. The glorie
is ſure, the joy is ſure, and if he finde faithfulneſſe, and a bleſſing
in his calling in this lyfe: as the joye and glorie is certaine, ſo
when he is going out of this lyfe, he may be ſure, and may ſay
with confidence, I ſhall enter in my joy, and my ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

(brethren) a congratulation and rejoiſing
of the Apoſtle with the Theſſalonians, for
the graces of God in Chriſt, that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed

excuſe of the Apoſtle, wherfore he came
not to viſie the Theſſalonians: he excuſed
himſelf, from that great deſire &amp; purpoſe
he had to viſite them face to face. He entred in the journey once,
he was impeaded: he entred the ſecond tyme, Sathan impeaded
him: he could do no more. Now ſhortly to come this text. He
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16659:64"/>
followes out the ſame purpoſe, and continewes his excuſe,
ſhowing them the deſire yet left him not, but albeit he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaded

not bring to paſſe in his owne perſon, he thought good to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
by another, by a deare brother, and fellow laborer Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie.
Therfore he tooke purpoſe, being at Athens in Grecia,
and Timothie with him, to abyde at Athens himſelfe alone, and
to ſend away Timothie to them, and all to this end to eſtabliſhe
them in that word which they had receiued: To exhort them
that they ſhould not be commoued or daſht with the afflictions
which ouertooke them and wherewith they were exerciſed.
Vpon this, he ſalles out in an exhortation: exhorting them to
beare patientlie thoſe afflictions that fell vpon them. The firſt
argument to moue them thereto is, knowing well they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
thereto. God had ordained from all etern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

for them, a neceſſitie was impoſed vpon them, and
why ſhould they not then ſuffer and beare them patientlie? The
next argument wherewith he comfortes them. There is nothing
come to vs (ſayes he) but that wherewith ye were forewarned.
Therefore take it patientlie. This is ſhortlie the ſumme of the
text ſtanding in theſe two partes: in a purpoſe he tooke (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

him to the next beſt, and that vvhich he could not doe by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he tooke purpoſe to doe by <hi>Timothie,</hi> vvhich vvas his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv-labourers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Where there is an earneſt deſyro to doe well
in the heart of any man, that thing he can not attaine to at the
firſt, he aſſayes it ouer againe, and if he can not get it done in
his ovvne perſon, he preaſſes to doe it in an other. As <hi>Paul</hi>
aſſayed the firſt and ſecond tyme in his ovvne perſone, and
vvas tvvyſe in the journey: vvhen he is impeaded in his ovvne
perſone, that he is not able to performe it himſelfe, he purpoſes
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16659:65"/>
to doe it by others, and ſo he ſends <hi>Timothie</hi> to performe that
which he might not doe himſelfe. Then ye may ſee: an earneſt
holie deſyre hes ſuch a force that it reſts not, it muſt break out in
ſome effect at one tyme or other, by one way or other: it can
not ſtill remaine in the heart; nor the Deuill will not be able to
impead the action for euer. No, but an holie deſyre of goode
in the heart, ſhall take effect once, in deſpite of all the worlde.
Then marke. The great neceſſitie joyned to euerie one of vs, to
do the thing we ſhould do muſt not be left off, for one, or two,
or three, or foure impediments: and when we are not able in
our ovvne perſone to doe it, then prouide ſome other meane to
doe it: for it may be the Deuill will not be ſo buſie to impead o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as he will be to impead thy ſelfe: for it is certaine the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
is euer buſie working, but he was not ſo buſie to ſtay <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,</hi>
as he was to ſtay <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in the next wordes, he ſayes, <hi>he thoght it beſt to abyde ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare,
all alone at Athens,</hi> where he was for the tyme, (for from
Theſſalonica he went to Beroea, and from Beroea to Athens,
and there he abode) as he would ſay to the Theſſalonians: I
tooke purpoſe to hurt my ſelfe for you, I forgot my ſelfe for
your profite and the care which I had of you, that ye ſhoulde
haue good companie, I chooſed to be alone my ſelfe among the
infidels, without fellow-helpers. The leſſon is plaine. Where
there is loue in the heart of the Paſtor to the church, or any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he will be content to be ſolitare, without good company, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in the midſt of infidels, that that Church may haue good
companie: he will be content to be poore, that the Church may
be riche: he will be content to die, that the Church may liue: he
will wiſhe to be an <hi>Anathema,</hi> and accurſed for his brethren,
that the Lord may be glorified in the ſaluation of his Church.
No it is an vnſpeakable loue, that a faithfull Paſtor hes, firſt to
the Lord Ieſus, who hes ſent him: and next to the Church, that
is bought with the bloude of Ieſus: he will forget himſelfe to
remember them, he will not not onelie ſeuere from good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
for their cauſe, but he will forget his owne lyfe to haue
them well.</p>
               <p>Marke next. Ere he comes heere to the ſending of <hi>Timothie,</hi>
to the Theſſalonians, he telles of the purpoſe he tooke. <hi>I thought
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16659:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it beſt to abyde at Athens myne alone.</hi> And vpon this purpoſe, I
entered in action and ſent him. Ye ſhall finde this commonlie
in <hi>Paul,</hi> vvhen he ſpeakes of his doing, he ſpeakes euer of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and decree going before, and then the action follovving.
I decreed to knovve nothing among you, but Chriſt and him
crucified. 1. Cor. 2. 2. All vvell doing ſhould proceede of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of the mynde:<note place="margin">Purpoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation ſhold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede acti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on.</note> well doing would not come raſhlie to our
hand, but as the Lorde hes giuen a man a mynde to conclude
and reſolue: ſo well doing ſhould come of the reſolute pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of the mynde: without the purpoſe of the mynde in well
doing, the action hes not the full praiſe. God himſelfe did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but by purpoſe and counſell preceeding: He elected vs
of a purpoſe, before all eternitie: in tyme of purpoſe he calles
vs, of purpoſe he juſtifies vs, and of purpoſe he glorifies vs. In
a vvord, he does all things according to the purpoſe of his will.
Ye may read this in the firſt chapter of the Epiſtle to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians.
So vvhen God giues grace to any man, to doe anie
thing: the firſt grace he giues, is a willingneſſe in the mynde to
doe well. Grace beginnes at the heart and mynde, and not at
the hand. Philipp. 2. 13. it is ſaid, God is he, vvho giues the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vvill and purpoſe, that is firſt: and the performance, that
is next. Ere he giue thee the performance of vvell doing, he
giues thee the purpoſe of the heart to doe it. Therefore before
thou put out thy hand to doe vvell, looke thou haue the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in thy heart, and then the vvell-doing is perfite: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
not. Many will put out their hand to doe ſome good thing,
vvhen the heart will be fighting againſt the hand. Put both
purpoſe in minde and action in hand together to do well, or elſe
hold altogether to thy ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now to the next verſe. Hauing taken a purpoſe, he ſayes: <hi>He
ſent Timothie.</hi> Hauing taken purpoſe he goes to the action: he
ſends him. The leſſon is eaſie. After purpoſe is taken, then goe
to the action: aduyſe thee well, and then ſtay not, but goe to,
and execute thy purpoſe. There are manie vvho are ay pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
and conſulting, but their purpoſe is ay fectleſſe: and
vvhen they haue taken purpoſe, they ſtand ſtill there, their
purpoſe in nothing vvorth. It is verie true, euen as the purpoſe
to doe vvell is of grace, it is not of mans ſelfe to doe it, it is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16659:66"/>
God vvho giues the purpoſe: ſo the action of the hand is of
God, in ſuch ſort, that when thou haſt gotten grace to will well,
thy hand ſhall be bound hard and faſt, that thou ſhalt not be
able to doe it, except thou be furniſhed with an other grace alſo.
When God hes giuen thee the purpoſe, except he alſo giue thee
the performance, thou ſhalt neuer doe it: for the Apoſtle ſaies,

Yet to inſiſt on this commendation of <hi>Timothie.</hi> It is an
high commendation, and all tends to this, that he ſhoulde be
well accepted of the Theſſalonians, to whom he was directed,
that ſo he might doe them the more good. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſent him adorned with this faire teſtimone.<note place="margin">Good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſerue good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Brethren,
When we ſee good men in Church or common-weal, we ſhould
giue them their own commendation; why ſhould not the Prince
haue his ovvne commendation in ſight of the people vvithout
flattrie? why ſhould not the Paſtor haue his honour? but to this
end <hi>Paul</hi> looked to, that they might be well accepted among
the people: the next end, that being honoured among them,
they may get obedience. So euerie good man ſhould haue his
owne authoritie among the people to doe his goode turnes.
The Lord grant that euerie man who hes office, may haue mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of recommendation within himſelfe, that when he is praiſed
he be not flattered. The Lord grant that the Prince may haue
matter of his commendation; and the Paſtor matter of his
commendation, to this end, that their labours be not in vaine.</p>
               <p>Now to go forward with the words. Wherefore is this good
man <hi>Timothie</hi> ſent to the Theſſalonians? not to play him not to
looke about him: but to confirme the Theſſalonians in that
faith in the which they were grounded by the Apoſtle. The
office of the Euangeliſt vvas to confirme men in that faith
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16659:67"/>
which was had down by the Apoſtles, to watter that which the
Apoſtles had planted. <hi>Paul planted, Apollo vvattred,</hi> 1. Cor. 3. 6. So
<hi>Timothie</hi> was ſent to do his ovvne office: his owne office was to
confirme them vvho were grounded. Brethren, ye haue heard
heere before a great deale ſpoken of that ſingulare faith which
the Theſſalonians had: and read in the whole Epiſtles of <hi>Paul,</hi>
ye ſhall not finde ſuch a commendation giuen to anie Church
as to theſe Theſſalonians: they were examples to the whole
Churches about them, as to Macedonia, Achaia, &amp;c. the word
of them went abroad to all people: and yet <hi>Timothie</hi> muſt be
ſent to them to eſtabliſhe them. Marke it. There is none in this
life ſo vvell grounded on the faith of Ieſus,<note place="margin">Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith neceſſarie to all men on this life</note> but night and day
they haue neede of confirmation: yea, euen at the laſt breathe,
when thou art going out of this world, thou muſt craue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation:
for there is no perfection in this lyfe, nothing in
this lyfe but beginning of grace. Let none thinke he ſtandes,
if he thinks ſo, he deceyues himſelfe, and the man who thinkes
he ſtands, he is readieſt to fall. There is nothing heere but either
to grow or decay, no ſtanding. So we haue neede continuallie of
a confirmation: faith in Chriſt is ſet downe to vs, as a ground
wherevpon we are eſtabliſhed. Continuallie euerie houre and
moment we craue a ſetling on that ground: for why? the ſea, of
the ovvne nature is not ſo ſubject to commotion and ſlovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as the heart of a man. When it is ſet dovvne once in that
faith vvhich is the foundation, leaue it there, it ſhall returne to
the ovvn nature againe. Then ye ſee, the ſea, vvhen it flowes on
a rock, immediatlie the jaw returnes backe againe in the ſea:
So, our heart ſet on Chriſt, except by grace it be daylie, hourlie,
momentlie ſetled, it vvill returne backe againe to the ovvne
nature of it. There vvas neuer moe vvindes nor ſtormes on the
ſea, to cauſe it rage, nor is daylie, and hourelie brangling our
faith, if it were poſſible to beate thy faith off the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d-ſtone.
Thou neuer ſeeſt thing with thy eye, but it is a blaſt of wind, to
beat thee off thy ground: thou neuer hearſt thing, but it is a blaſt
to beate thee off thy ground. Proſperitie a blaſt of wind to thee:
aduerſitie, a blaſt off winde to beate thee off thy rocke Chriſt
Ieſus: the ſcorning vvorld is a winde to beate thee from Chriſt;

               <p>The next words telles the maner of the eſtabliſhing of our
faith. <hi>And to comfort.</hi> The firſt word was borrowed: the next
vvorde makes it plaine. The maner is, ſeeing the heart of man
is ay fleeting. Therefore we haue ſent to comfort you touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your faith. The verie ſame miniſtrie which <hi>Paul</hi> had for
the tyme, <hi>Timothie</hi> for his tyme; the Paſtors and Doctors hes
this day: That ſame miniſtrie which conſiſtes in inſtructing,
exhorting, comforting, admoniſhing, and rebuking them for
their miſdeedes: for all are included within this word exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and all theſe ſerues to confirme men in the faith of Chriſt.
<hi>Paul</hi> to the Epheſians, 4. 11. ſayes, <hi>When the Lord Ieſus aſcended to
heauen,</hi> after that glorious reſurrection, leauing this earth, he left
behinde him <hi>ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome Euangeliſts, ſome Paſtours,
and Doctours, to the end vve ſhould not be ay children, fleeting, flovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and caried avvay vvith euerie light vvinde of doctrine.</hi> What
meanes all this? That the vſe of the miniſtrie is to eſtabliſhe the
heart of man, to holde the heart, that the winde of affliction and
tentation blovve it not avvay, and to ſettle it on Chriſt, vvho
is the ground-ſtone. Then, turne it ouer: take avvay the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie,
that men vvoulde haue ſo faine avvay (giue men their
teyndes, they vvould be content neuer to heare a Miniſter) no
ſtablitie ſhall be in the heartes of the people, thy heart ſhall
be blovvne avvay from Chriſt, and thou ſhalt periſhe. Alas,
vve haue ouer great experience of this, and eſpeciallie in this
Cittie of Edinburgh, the Lord amende it. Count all thinges
vanitie, but to be eſtabliſhed in Chriſt. Alas, that vvee are ſo
ſenſleſſe of this. A vaine heart vvaites not vvhat this word
meanes, but a ſolide heart mournes for the vvant of the meanes
of the vvorde.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the next verſe. The end of this eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
confirming and exhorting of theſe people by the miniſtrie
of <hi>Timothie</hi> is this, <hi>that none of them ſhould be commoued for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,</hi>
vvherevvith they vvere exerciſed for the preſent: For,
the Theſſalonians at that tyme were afflicted by the Iewes, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to God and man. Then, the end is, that they ſhould not be
commoued with the afflictions, that laye on them. It is eaſie
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16659:68"/>
to a man to ſtand in a calme: but when winde blowes it is hard
to ſtand ſure: It is eaſie to profeſſe Chriſt in calmneſſe, but,
when the blaſt of tentation ſtrikes on thee, then, it is much to
ſtand and hold Chriſt.<note place="margin">In tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vve must ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on Christ, by faith.</note> We are not yet wel acquainted with this.
So all tends to this: Albeit the waues of the ſea daſhed on them,
they ſhoulde ſtand faſt in the faith of Chriſt. Brethren, all this
worlde is full of tentations: the diuell blowes, and all his impes
are euer blovving and raiſing a ſtorme: it is a ſtormie world, and
all the thuds light on the ſillie creature. Alas, if we knevv the
ſtumbering eſtate we ſtand into: vvhat tentations are to aſſaile
vs; the windes of tentation from the Eaſt, Weſt, North &amp; South,
all meeting: aduerſitie on one ſide, proſperitie on the other ſide,
all meeting, to dravve thee from Chriſt. What remedie can be
ſought of this wofull eſtate we ſtand in by nature? if we ſtand
not in grace, vve ſhall curſſe the tyme, that euer vve vvere borne
and liued in this vvorld. The remedie is Stabliſhing. What reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
for a ſhip when windes blovv? Stabliſhing. And hovv ſhall
the heart be eſtabliſhed? How is the ſhip made ſure? By caſting
the ankor in the ſea: the ankor of the ſoule is faith, and hope;
thou muſt then caſt it vpon Chriſt. Caſt it not down in the ſand,
but, vpward through the vaill, to Ieſus the ſure ground of it:
and then, all the windes, how beit they may ſhake thee, yet, they
ſhall not ſeuere thee from him. Then where ſhall we get this
ankor faith? Faith is by hearing, as is ſaid. Rom. 10. 17. Thou
muſt hold to thy eare, or elſe thou ſhalt be blowne away. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is by preaching. So all reſolves in this ſame miniſtrie, the
preaching of this glorious Goſpell of the bleſſed God: let this
miniſtrie be heard, and thou ſhalt get faith: getting faith the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kor
of the ſoule, thou ſhalt ſtand faſt, and ſhalt not be thruſt
from the Rock Chriſt. But, caſt away preaching, as euer a ſhip
was toſſed to and fro, vntill ſhe periſhe, thou ſhalt be toſſed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
thou periſhe euerlaſtinglie.</p>
               <p>Now to go forward in the ſecond part of the text, in which
he exhorts them, patientlie to beare affliction. And ſo he falles
from the laſt purpoſe and goes to the former, patience in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

beare it patiently. Ther is the forme of the argument: learne
then, It is of the will and decree of God from all eternitie, that
the creature ſhold ſuffer in this life,<note place="margin">Gods vvil, that vve ſuffer in this life, ſhoulde be reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced.</note> in one meſure, or other. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
againe: the creature ſhould haue ſuch reuerence to Gods will,
that, when it thinkes, that, it is the will of God it ſhould ſuffer, it
make no whiſpering; but, ſtoup there. <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 9. 20. ſpeaking
of the indured reprobate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anent the induration, reprobation and
condemnation; He teaches them, that the reprobates when they
are tolde, it is Gods will that they ſhoulde goe to Hell, their
mouth ſhould be ſhut vp, that they querrell not the Lord. And
he ſayes in anger, <hi>What art thou that vvhiſpers againſt God's vvill

yet, at laſt, in the end, their mouth ſhal be cloſde &amp; they ſhal not

before al time. <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes, we are called to ſuffer in time. 1. Epiſt.
2. 21. So, when the Lord calles thee to glorie, he calles thee, by
ſuffering and he ſayes; Come to the torment and ſworde, and
ſire, and ſo, by that way thou muſt euter in glorie. Chriſt our

head entred by the croſſe to glorie: ſo muſt thou. Well, then,
knowing this neceſſitie, what ſhould we do then? Make vs for
patience, and ay prepare vs, in the morning, at euening &amp; at our
meate and ay cry, The Lord prepare vs for ſuffring: I am going
out, I knowe not what ſhall befall me before my comming in:
Lord conduct me in this miſerable life, that I may raigne vvith
thee. I knowe there is nothing but trouble in this life: in trouble
Lord, comfort me and conduct me, while I raigne with thee, and
reſt from all troubles. This ſhould be our daylie prayer. Alas,
the vanities of this worlde ſo ouerrunnes our eyes, that we can
not ſee the tottering eſtate we are in. There is no ankoring but
in Chriſt. The Lord oppin our eyes to ſee this more and more.</p>
               <p>Now one word on the next argument: the ſecond argument
is from the forewarning of the Apoſtle. <hi>For the firſt time vve
vvere vvith you, vve tolde you vve ſhould all ſuffer.</hi> The Goſpell can
not be without affliction, for, affliction is an vnſeparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
thereof: and therefore, I tolde you before, that ye might
be patient. It is a common prouerbe, Once warned halfe armed:
an euill that is foreſeene to come, ere it light, will hurt the leſſe:
when it comes not to vs contrair our expectation, vve will take
it in better part: but this euill that lights on a man ſudainlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair
his expectation, ô, it is a ſore and heauie trouble, and will
make him to ſhake. When a man is crying peace, and thinkes
all ſure, then ſaies the Apoſtle 1. Theſſ. 3. 5. when the trouble
ouertakes him vpon a ſodainetie, vvhat ſhall be his dolour? <hi>His
dolour ſhall be like to a vvomans trauailing in child-birth,</hi> which is
compared to the paine of hell for the exceeding fierceneſſe and
ſharpneſſe. The Apoſtle knowing this, vvhere euer he came to
preache the Goſpell of Chriſt, vvith the Goſpell he preached
affliction, and he did euer ſay, O people, prepare you for ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
thinke not but yee ſhall ſuffer: that beeing forewarned,
they ſhould not ſtoupe and let afliction paſſe ouer them.<note place="margin">Affliction foretolde more eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſtaind</note> No, he
aſſures them, that, it behoues them, through many afflictions, to
enter in the kingdome of heauen. Act. 14. 22. Euerie one who
liues godlie ſhall ſuffer. 2. Timoth. 3. 12. The Apoſtle ſo warnes
them, that when the people are warned, the affliction ſhoulde
not come vnto them vnarmed: but that, when they ſee it, they
ſhould ſay, I looked euer for affliction: Now, welcome afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16659:69"/>
He that is prepared for it, and knowes perfitelie, affliction
wil follow the goſpel, he wil tak it in his aimes, &amp; ſay, welcome
affliction; and he wil receiue it with ſuch patience, as the tongue
of man can not report, and where patience is joyned with affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
it is but halfe affliction: but, a man who lyes ſighting and
waltring in trouble, ô, that man hes double diſeaſe. Therefore,
brethren, ſince it is, that we muſt ſuffer, either in one meaſure, or,
other, let not the things of this worlde make vs forget, that we
are appointed to ſuffer: but, when proſperitie comes, let vs ſay,
this world will decay: thou art mounted vp this day, thou may
be caſten down the morne: thou art whole this day, thou may
be ſicke the morne; and ſo, I will not be deceyued with anie
thing, but, will prepair me for aduerſitie. The Lord prepair vs
for it, for Chriſts ſake. To this Chriſt, the Father and the holie
Spirite, be all praiſe and honour, now and euer.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the beginning of this chapter (Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> telles of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he did take to ſend <hi>Timothie</hi> to the
Theſſalonians, to eſtabliſhe them in the
faith and to exhort them; and of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of that purpoſe: that as he
tooke purpoſe to ſend <hi>Timothie</hi> to them,
ſo he ſent him. And this was one of the
Arguments whereby he excuſes him ſelfe for that hee did not
come to them himſelfe, being impeaded by Sathan. The next he
could do was to ſend that brother <hi>Timothie,</hi> who was a faithfull
man in the miniſtrie of the Lord: and therfore they ſhould haue
him excuſed. Then thereafter ye heard he fell out in a ſhort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
exhorting them to beare patientlie thoſe afflictions
and croſſes that they ſuffer in this life. The firſt argument vvas
from the appointment of God: God had ſo appointed from all
eternitie that they ſhould ſuffer: therefore ſeeing that neceſsitie
was impoſed on them, why ſhold they not bear the burden pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie?
The ſecond argument was from his fore warning of them
of the troubles for the Goſpels ſake. There is nothing come but
that I did forewarne you of; therefore when they are come what
reſts but that ye ſhould beare them patientlie?</p>
               <p>Now, leauing that which we ſpok the laſt day vpon the text
preceeding, I come to this preſent text. The Apoſtle in the fift
verſe of this chapter returnes again to that which he ſpoke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Timothie</hi> and the ſending of him to the Theſſalonians.
In the next verſe he hes a narratiue of <hi>Timothie</hi> his returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and of that good report he made in his returning of the
Theſſalonians, of their faith, loue and remembrance they had of
<hi>Paul.</hi> After that in the verſe following he ſhowes what effect
that report of <hi>Timothie</hi> wrought in him: it brought to him joye
and conſolation, notwithſtanding of all his affliction he was in
for the preſent. The reaſone is giuen: becauſe we liue when ye
ſtand in the faith: your perſeuerance is our life; and therefore
what maruell if vve rejoice in your faith? And thereafter he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that he can not thanke God eneugh for that grace they had
gotten of God.</p>
               <p>Now to come back againe. The text containes a plaine nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16659:70"/>
                  <hi>Wherefore</hi> ſaies he, <hi>vvhen I could no longer forbeare, I ſent Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie
to you.</hi> Of this vve ſpoke the laſt day in the beginning of
the chapter: and therfore vve goe forward. The end is ſet down
wherefore he ſent <hi>Timothie, to vnderſtand of your faith.</hi> That is,
of your perſeueeing, of your abiding and of your ſtanding in
that faith yee haue receyued. This is an other end from that
which vvas before. Before he ſent <hi>Timothie</hi> to eſtabliſh and to
comfort them: nowe he ſends <hi>Timothie</hi> to vnderſtand of their
faith and perſeuerance. No matter albeit there be ſundrie ends
wherefore he ſent <hi>Timothie;</hi> one for their cauſe, to eſtabliſhe
them: an other for his owne cauſe, that hee him ſelfe might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

the report of their perſeuerance therein. So ye ſee, the Apoſtle,
brethren, is euer carefull of this Church at Theſſalonica planted
and begun by him there. So that in the beginning he vvas care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to lowe the ſeede of the vvorde amongſt them, to conuert
them and turne them to the faith of Chriſt. When he hes done
this he leaues not off his care; but that vvorke he had begunne
he is carefull that it bee brought to ſome perfection in Chriſte:

and thereafter to plucke away his hand from them, and to let
them ſtand as it were them allone: but hee muſt ſtriue to holde
them vp; as he hes laide the foundation of faith, ſo he muſt build
vpon that foundation continuallie, ſo far as lies in him, while the

               <p>Then to returne. By your defection and falling away, what
ſhould I haue loſt? He ſayes, <hi>and that our labour had bene in vaine.</hi>
Therefore labours he, that he ſhould not loſe them. It is a paine
to a man to take trauell, to labour night and day, and then in the
end to loſe all, and not to receiue frute of his trauell. It is a paine
to a man to ſuffer for the Goſpell, and then in the end to loſe all.
Alwayes I marke of this place. When any people makes defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from the faith of Chriſt, not onelie the people them ſelues
who makes defection, but alſo the Paſtor who trauels among
them, makes loſe in their defection. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſes in the Epiſtle

ſaying, <hi>I haue feared concerning you, that I haue vvearied my ſelfe in

brethren, the carefulleſt and walkryfeſt man in the miniſtrie
loſes his paine and labour, when he attaines not to that end that

loſe makes an vncarefull Paſtor, when through his default any
people falles away to defection? Iudge ye then, vvhat is his loſe
and damage: he loſes not onelie the people, but himſelfe: the
people periſhes, and the bloude of the people is craued at his

this Goſpell and Euangell is nothing but theſe glad tydings of
Gods mercie through Chriſt. So lykewiſe the beſt newes that
can come of any people is, that the people hes receyued the
Goſpell and that faith in Chriſt. There is great matter of joye
vvhen vve heare that grace, mercie and peace is preached to
any people: There was neuer ſuch joy, if we knew what is true
joy, but alas we are lying on the earth, we haue no ſenſe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
things, our eye is ay on the earth, as thogh there were no
grace nor glorie, but in this lyfe.</p>
               <p>But brethren to goe to euerie word, and to ſpeake of theſe
things <hi>Timothie</hi> reportes to <hi>Paul.</hi> The firſt pointe of theſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges
is faith; he beginnes at faith. <hi>Timothie</hi> ſayes: <hi>Paul,</hi> the
Theſſalonians continewes ſtill in that faith of Chriſt, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
that Goſpell of Chriſt, which thou taught them. There
is the firſt part of the newes. Then ye ſee plainlie heere. the
firſt part of the good tydinges that can be reported of any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is that they holde faſt the faith of Chriſt. and embrace the
Goſpell of Chriſt. There is the firſt and beſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ydinges that
can be reported of any people. And learne, He that hes not
and keepes not this faith, I ſay in a vvorde there can be no good
tale tolde of him. If he had all the vvorlde, vvithout this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
it is all in vaine, becauſe he hes no goode propertie, and
there is no bleſſing of God in him: That vvhich ſeemes to
be a bleſſing is a verie curſſing to him. The more honour and
riches he hes in this world, the mo are the maledictions of God,
and all his actiones, all his ſpeakinges, or vvhat euer he does
or thinkes, all is ſinne. What euer flovves not from faith in
Chriſt, is ſinne, if it vvere neuer ſo gliſtering. Rom. 14. 13. So
then I holde this ground. Thou canſt not tell a goode taile of
anie man that embraces not Chriſt and his Goſpell. They will
ſay, he is a ſtoutman, he is a riche man, the vvorlde goes vvell
vvith him, but all is curſſing to him, except hee haue faith in
Chriſt: faith bleſſes all, and therefore no lyfe to thee, except that
thou haue faith.</p>
               <p>What is the next pointe of the tydings? Loue. Faith beginnes
and ſhe goes forvvard as the Queene of all grace. Next to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16659:73"/>
her comes in loue, ſhe is next in honour, and among all the reſt
of the graces that accompanies with faith, loue is the chiefeſt,
Then in one vvord. The next pointe of good tydinges of any
people, is to be a louing people, a people that intertaines loue
and charitie: no oppreſſion among them, but euere one is
readie bent to helpe an other: ſuch kyndneſſe, lenitie and loue,
that the tongue of man can not expreſſe it. I tell you (as I haue
ſaid before) vvhere theſe tydings can not be tolde, that a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
intertaines loue and charitie, it is impoſſible thou canſt tell
a good taile of them. Tell me he is not charitable: I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
there is no grace in that perſone. O but ye will ſay: yet he
beleeues, and vvho hes bene ſo inſtant an hearer of the Goſpell
as he? but all is vanitie; thy lyfe ſhovves the contrare: for <hi>vvho
loues not their nighbour, and ſaies that they loue God, they lye</hi> ſayes
<hi>Ioha</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle 4. 20. For certainlie loue is an vnſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
companion of faith, as the ſhadovve is of the bodie, ſo
that if loue be ſeuered from it, thy faith is of no value. Where
charitie is not, there is no true faith, and therefore bee chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and loue thy neighbour, othervvviſe thou haſt no good
propertie.</p>
               <p>The thrid pointe of the nevves, is, concerning <hi>Paul</hi> in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall,
that remembrance they had of him in his abſence, and of
this rememberance a deſyre to ſee him: and that becauſe he
had grounded them in that faith in Ieſus Chriſt, and that loue
to their neighbour. Brethren, as the firſt pointe of goode ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges
that can bee reported of anie, is the imbracing of this
Goſpell of Chriſt and Chriſt in the Goſpell: So the laſt thing
that can bee reported, is the imbracing of the Miniſters of this
Goſpell, the imbracing of them in their preſence, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
of them, and the deſyring of them in their abſence. Theſe
are <hi>Paules</hi> ovvne vvordes. And I affirme if anie people haue
no lyking of the Miniſter of the Goſpell, no man can tell one
good vvord of good tydinges of them. If <hi>Timothie</hi> could not
haue reported this farre of the Theſſalonians concerning <hi>Paul</hi>
that they had remembrance of him: but had ſaid that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
not of <hi>Paul;</hi> Trovvye that <hi>Paul</hi> vvould haue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the report of their faith and charitie? No he vvould haue
ſaid, they had no faith nor charitie: for where there is not a loue
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16659:74"/>
to the Miniſter of the Goſpell, no faith nor loue there. Many
vvill ſay, I loue the Goſpell. I loue my nighbour: but vvhen it
comes to the miniſtrie; then if there be any vyle and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſpeaking it will be of them. My Lord or the laird will ſit vp
and ſpeak of that calling with ſuch diſdaine and deſpite that the
verſe Ethnick can not go beyond him; and in ſcoffing will ſay,
away with theſe fellowes, wherefore ſerue they? they holde the
countrie in ado. Fyon thee, that euer thou ſholdſt take the name
of Chriſt in thy mouth, when thou ſo heatſt his ſeruants For it is
impoſſible where the loue of Chriſt and the Goſpell is to ſeuere
thee from the loue of the ſeruants of Chriſt. Thou deceiueſt thy
ſelf, thou neuer loueſt the maſter when thou heatſt his ſeruants:
thou neuer loueſt God, when thou heatſt the faithfull Miniſter
he ſends to thee. Alas, among all the curſes that procures hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
judgement at Gods hand. this is one. the contempt of this
miniſtrie: God is (as it were) wreſtling with vs in this great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to hold in this light but if we continue, we ſhall loſe this
light, to our vtter ruyne: for God will not wreſtle ay vvith vs.
Take heed to this, and learne this leſſon vvith <hi>Paule.</hi> As ye
would haue a report of well doing, looke that this report may
be tolde of you, that ye haue a remembrance and deſyre of your
faithfull miniſtrie, otherwiſe all other reports is nothing worth.
For where there can not be a report of your lyking of the good
Miniſters, it can not be poſſible that a goode tale can be tolde
of you.</p>

he ſayes) when he tolde me theſe good tydings, my miſerie was

theſe good newes to me, <hi>I vvas quickned</hi> in hearing of

vs. So brethren, theſe tydings are not without great joy, they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
comfort. Neuer one of theſe things are tolde, but joy and
comfort breaks vp in the heart. Trow ye that it was the good
report that raiſed this conſolation in the heart? No, there was
an higher ground. If <hi>Paul</hi> had not had an greater loue to the
Theſſalonians, all the good tydings that was reported by <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi>
of them to him, ſhould not haue wakned joy in his heart.
It is true in deed, when we heare of the grace of God to be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other, there is matter of joy to vs, we ſhould not heare ſo
ſoone that the grace of God is in any man or woman, but we
ſhould rejoyce therein, euen as it were in our ſelues. When thou
heareſt of faith or loue in any man or woman, thou ſhouldſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice:
when thou heareſt of any ſinner that is penitent, &amp; turnes
to God, rejoyce when thou heareſt of any loue in any perſon,
there is matter of joy, all is true. But brethren: Who rejoyces
when it is reported that any grace is in any perſon? I anſwere.
None but the louer; he that loues that people or perſon will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice.
As for others that haue no loue to the perſone the more is
tolde to them of the grace of God in him, either ſpirituall or
temporall, the more they inuy it. This is all our nature. What is
it that inuyes not? <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, Charitie inuyes not 1. Cor. 13. 4.
And vnderſtand this, he who loues, rejoyes when he heares of
any others well. Take me away loue and charitie no rejoyſing

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16659:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not impared the paine, they vvould haue curſſed God and man,
So let a man or vvoman vvho would haue their paine mitigate
ſeeke to get this joy. We ſee how ſweetlie they vvill depart out
of this life vvho hes that joy in Chriſt, and therefore differre not
till the laſt houre, thinking to get joy then, but in tyme vvhen
thou art neither ſicke nor ſore, in ſoule nor bodie, prepare thee
to get a ſenſe of that joye that may be ſteadable in trouble: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
thee vvith heauen, as euer thou vvouldſt goe to heauen.
Avvaye with the ſecuritie of men who playe the vvanton, and
will promiſe to them ſelues heauen, if they get but leaue to aske
mercie in their laſt breath. Fy on them, they ſhall be deceyued.
It is true,<note place="margin">Delay of repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous.</note> the theefe that hung at Chriſts right hand got mercie;
but the other theefe got none. Therefore repent &amp; amend your
liues in time: for vvhere one gets repentance at the laſt houre of
their death, a thouſand wants it.</p>
               <p>Now ere I leaue this marke. Certainelie it appeares that <hi>Paul</hi>
loued the Theſſalonians well: for vvhen he heares the report
of theſe good newes, he who was in trouble is reuiued: and if he
had not loued the Theſſalonians exceeding well hee had not
receiued ſuch exceeding joye.<note place="margin">Loue is the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ioy.</note> Ye ſee, who loues a man vvell,
when anie good report is made of him he will rejoice for it. O
the great loue of <hi>Paul</hi> in all parts! it may be a mirror to all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.
Woulde to God that ſuch loue or halfe loue were in our
hearts: wee are bounde to a Congregation, and yet we can not
loue them as he did hauing manie Congregations: for he vvas
miniſter as well at Corinthus, Galatia, Epheſus &amp;c. as Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica.
Neuer did any man loue a ſonne begotten of himſelf more
intirelie nor <hi>Paul</hi> did all his Churches. Surelie a Paſtor ſhould
loue his flock ſo well, that he ſhould giue his life for them.</p>
               <p>In the end of the verſe he giues the reaſon wherefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced,

life: what wounder then that hearing of your ſtanding in the
Lord, which is my life, I rejoice? Then if he be a louing Paſtor,
who loues the ſoule of the people well. as <hi>Paul</hi> did, the grace
that the people gets of God it is a quickning grace to him, it is a
viuifying of him, if he be in dolour and diſtieſſe it is a walkning
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16659:76"/>
of him. Therefore looke what aduantage thou getteſt through
loue. Art thou a paſtor? thou ſhalt get life. Art thou one of the
people? if thou loue thou ſhalt get life to: and thy loue ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
report to thee a joye in thy greateſt dolour. If thou be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
off this life, and haſt beene a faithfull paſtor, the report
of the ſtanding of thy flocke ſhall comfort thee: if thou be one
of the people, thou ſhalt euer haue comfort: for the grace of any
member of the Church reported to thee ſhall bring joy to thee.
But the man who hes nothinge but inuie can haue no joye: hee
knowes not what this ſpirituall joye meanes. Therefore as thou
wouldſt liue in joye and conſolation ſtriue to be louing, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Text immediatlie going before,
welbeloued in Chriſt, wee heard of the
ſending forth of <hi>Timothie</hi> to the Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,
we heard of his returning, and
what tidings he brought: hee reported to
<hi>Paul</hi> of the Theſſalonians, concerning
their faith and perſeuerance in faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their loue; and particularlie of
that remembrance they had of <hi>Paul,</hi> who had founded them in
the faith of Chriſt, in his abſence deſiring moſt earneſtly to haue
his preſence againe. Laſt ye heard what effect theſe tidings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by <hi>Timothie</hi> vvrought in <hi>Paul:</hi> they wrought conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and joy, notwithſtanding all the afflictions and miſerie he
lay in in Athens for the preſent.</p>
               <p>Now brethren, to come to the text vve haue in hand. In this
text he does two things: firſt he ſhowes vvhat thankſgiuing he
gaue to God for them and for all that joye he had conceiued of
the glad newes he heard of them: he ſhowes how earneſt &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
he was in prayer for them, crauing day and night that hee
might ſee them face to face, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that report he heard
of them by <hi>Timothie.</hi> Then in the ſecound part of the text he
falles out in a prayer continewing to the end of the chapter, firſt
beſeeching God the Father and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to direct
his journey toward them: next deſiring God to increaſe them,
and make them to abound in loue euerie one toward an other,
and toward all men in the worlde: thridlie beſeeching God that
he would eſtabliſh their hearts before him in all holineſſe at the
comming of Ieſus Chriſt with his Sancts. There is the effect of
the text ſhortlie. Novv to returne and to ſpeake of the firſt part:
he ſhovves his thankſ-giuing and prayer to God for them. He
ſayes, <hi>For vvhat thanks can vve recompenſe to God againe for you,
for all the ioy vvherevvith vve reioyce for your ſakes before our God.</hi>
I can not get a heart (would he ſay) to thanke my God for it,<note place="margin">Ioy in the hart bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes out in thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</note>
as I ſhoulde doe. The text is verie plaine. So the doctrine is

a ſpirituall joy for the grace of God, eyther beſtowed on
him ſelfe, or vpon others, it is not able to conteine that joy, but
it muſt breake out, and it muſt open the mouth to giue thankes

                  </gap> and meane of joy,
the firſt thanks that are giuen will not be giuen to it eſpecially.
<hi>(Paul</hi> heere giues not the glorie of this joy to the Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)
but the mouth will be opened to glorifie the author of all
grace and joy, which is God: for without him there is no grace,
neither haue we our ſelues any grace, neither hes any other any
grace in him ſelfe:<note place="margin">Thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing to God only.</note> and without God there is no joy; except he
worke the joy, there can be no joy in the heart. Yea, albeit the
grace be giuen, yet if he giue not a new grace to worke joy in
the heart for the grace, there can be no joy. And therefore the
mouth when it is opened, to praiſe &amp; glorifie, firſt of al it ſhold
be opened to glorifie him who is the giuer of all: honour the
inſtrument as the inſtrument, honour the Miniſter as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
but let the author &amp; worker of al haue the glory &amp; thanks.
Then thridlie mark. In a maner he complaines that he can not
get a mouth to thanke God ſufficientlie for all that grace they
had receiued, and joy he had receiued and gotten through their
graces. Marke then, our thanking and glorifying of God for the
grace receiued and joy conceiued in heart, it is not anſwerable in
greatnes to the grace, nor to the joy receiued. For will ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare
theſe two together, the grace of God, and thy thankfulnes for it,
the grace of God paſſes thy thankfulnes, yea, the verie joy that
we haue in heart for the grace beſtowed on vs or others, will be
greater nor the thankfulneſſe can be: and the tongue of man is
not able to vtter all that joy conceiued, nor to thank God ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie
for it. <hi>Peter 1.</hi> Epiſt. 1. 8. he calles it a joy vnſpeakable:
The joy the faithfull heart will conceiue, is an vnſpeakable joy.
So <hi>Paul</hi> of the ſighs of the godly. Rom. 8. 28. The mouth of man
is not ſo wyde, nor ſo capable of grace as the heart is. I meane of
the regenerate man. If the ſpirit of Ieſus dwel in the heart, all the
tongues of men and Angels, can not be able to tell nor expreſſe
the thouſand part of that joy the hart wil haue in Gods grace <hi>for
all that ioy</hi> ſaies he, <hi>vvhat thanks ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> giue to God?</hi> As he wold ſay,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16659:78"/>
my mouth can not get words to vtter thanks to God the author
for the graces receiued, and joy that is conceiued there throgh.</p>
               <p>Now farther we haue to learne in the wordes. He ſayes, all
this joy is before God,<note place="margin">All ioy in the face of Ieſus.</note> all the joy that the heart conceyues is in
the ſight of God and in his preſence, it is all in the ſight of chriſt.
No libertie ſayes <hi>Paul,</hi> but when the heart is turned to God, and
laid oppin to him. 1. Cor. 3. 16. 17. No, no light of the knowledge
of the glorie of God, but in the face of Ieſus Chriſt. 2. Cor. 46.
No ſacretie of joy, but in his countenance, ſayes <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d</hi> Pſal. 16.
11. And <hi>Peter</hi> in his 1. Epiſt. 7. 8. ſayes, <hi>that beleeuing in Ieſus, and
keeping him in our preſence, vve reioyce vvith a ioy vnſpeak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and
glorious.</hi> So, no joye for thee, except thy eye be fixt in ſome
meaſure on the face of Ieſus. Looke not for it, turne thou thy
back to him, and thy face from him, no joy for thee, if thou were
all the Monarches in the earth: No, no joye, peace, nor tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie
of conſcience but in the face of God. And therfore who
euer would haue joy, and rejoyce, and be glad in heart in this
world, let him caſt an eye on Chriſt, and be humelie with him:
for his face is joyfull. And what is all this joy we conceyue in
heart? but as little ſparkles of the plenitude and fulneſſe of that
heauenlie joy in Chriſt, all proceedes as blenks from it. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
teaches vs, that neither by day nor night can the ſoule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
but when it hes the preſence of the liuing God, in the face
of Chriſt: for there is no ſight of him but in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now laſt I gather of all this: He can not thanke the Lord e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neugh
for their perſeuerance. Then all perſeuerance in faith and
loue comes of God if thanks muſt be giuen to God for it, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
it muſt follow that God is the giuer of it: and therefore
it is a vaine tale to ſay that mans perſeuerance is in his owne
hand: he has a free will, he may ſtand if he will, he may fall if he
will. All is vanitie, all our ſtanding is onelie in God: if he holde
vs in his hand we ſhall ſtand: if he pull away his hand we ſhall
fal: therefore ſeeke at God that we may ſtand and perſeuere; for
without him we ſhal not ſtand one moment: &amp; euerie one who
ſtands is bound to praiſe him, who is the author of all perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
So brethren by <hi>Pauls</hi> example a Paſtor when he ſees his
flock perſeuere in the faith of Chriſt aboue all men he is bound
to praiſe God.</p>

it is God that giues thee the increaſe and growth,<note place="margin">Increaſe of faith onelie by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie.</note> 1. Cor. 3. 7. but
it is as true, he giues no growth in faith and grace, but by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.
God giues the growth to the corne, but if the corne be not
wattred vvith raine which is the ordinarie meane thereto, the
corne will not grow. So if thou be not continuallie wattred with
this miniſtrie, thou ſhalt not growe, (I ſaye ordinarelie and not
extraordinarelie.) The Lord let vs ſee the miſerable eſtate vve
are into through contempt of the ordinare meane that the Lord
hes appointed. <hi>Paul</hi> Epheſ. 4. 11. ſayes <hi>When the Lord paſt vp to
heauen, he gaue ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome to be Prophets. &amp;c.</hi> And
how long is it needfull that this miniſtrie ſhold abide with thee?
for a day, a month a yeere, or twentie yeeres? No, it is not eneugh
but it muſt abide with thee ay vntill thy breath go out, and vntil
thou giueſt vp the laſt gaſpe: thou haſt ay neede of the goſpell.
Therefore the Apoſtle in that place he limites the time, <hi>vvhile ye
come altogether to the vnitie of the faith, and vnto the perfite man in
Chriſt.</hi> When commeſt thou to that perfite man? Not ſo long as
life is in thy lippe. So thou haſt need of the miniſtrie ſo long as
thou liueſt. But in deede when all thy ſenſes goe away, when
ſpeaking and hearing go away; then the miniſtrie leaues thee, &amp;
thou feelleſt a ſenſe of theſe things that thou heardſt before: but
if thou lay not to thine eare to heare in time, thou ſhalt neuer ſee
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16659:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them. Brethren, ye will wonder at this earneſt deſyre he had to
ſee them: Might not the ſending of <hi>Timothie,</hi> and wryting of
this Epiſtle ſatiſfie him? No, he thinkes he can not doe them
that goode that he would vntill he ſee them and ſpeake them,
and that for this purpoſe to fill out then faith. Well brethren,
when once Sathan gets a ſeuering of the paſtor from the people
it is hard to get them together againe. Do what <hi>Paul</hi> could do,
he could not meete with theſe Theſſalonians: For he ſayes, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
held him away when he would haue bene at them. Then
ye ſee, the remedie againſt Sathan to ſtay his courſe is prayer,
and inſtant prayer night and day.<note place="margin">Preſence of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor verie povverful.</note> But to the purpoſe: There is
much in the preſence of him who hes the grace of God in him,
for augmenting the faith and grace of God in men: his meſſage
will do much, but his preſence will do more: the lyuelie voice of
man vvill be more effectuall, nor the written word will be: his
preſence will edifie more nor his letter. And ſo it is no ſmall
matter to haue the preſence of a man that is gratious <hi>Paul</hi> knew
this well, and therefore he is ſo inſtant in praying to haue their
preſence. If the Lord hes choſen out a man to win ſoules, there
is nothing in that man, but it will edifie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his tongue, his eye, his
behauiour, his countenance, all will edifie and further men to
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Novv in the ſecond part of this text he falles out in a prayer.
There are thre parts thereof. The firſt part is, that yet God the
Father and the Lord Ieſus ſhould direct his journey tovvard
them, that he would giue him that grace to ſee them, and haue
that mutuall preſence. Then when he is ſpeaking of the prayer
he vſed to God, looke what fell out. Showing them he vſed to
pray inſtantlie for them: in the meane tyme he leaues off this
narratiue, and he burſts out in prayer to God. There is a ſodaine
change. Now take head. If that earneſtneſſe and feruencie to
pray be in the heart, the leaſt occaſion in the world wil walken
it vp, and make a man hold vp his hands, and fall on his knees
immediatlie: The verie name of ardent prayer vvill raiſe him vp
to prayer: for as of the aboundance of the heart the mouth ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
ſo the words in the mouth will walken the heart, if there be
anie ſpark of grace in it: and the hart being walkned the mouth
will fall out immediatly to prayer. Looke to thy heart &amp; mouth
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:16659:80"/>
both. Looke that thy heart be filled with God: looke that godly
ſpeaches be in thy mouth; for certainlie as thou ſpeakeſt ſo thou
vvalkneſt the heart: ſpeake well, a good affection will riſe in thy
hart: ſpeak euil a foul affection wil riſe in thy hart; and thy words
ſhall be as bellowes to blow vp thine owne heart and the hearts
of them that knovv the ſinne and vncleanneſſe.</p>
               <p>To the purpoſe; he prayed: to whom? <hi>To God the Father.</hi> To
whom next? <hi>To Ieſus Chriſt the Lord.</hi> He giues them both their
owne ſtyles. Chriſt hes bought vs vvith his bloude, and ſo hee is
our Lord and wee his ſeruanes: And the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>For this

Rom. 14. 9. Nowe brethren, marke their ſtyles more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowlie

name of loue. <hi>Paul</hi> vſes to ſet downe the majeſtie of God vvith

&amp; dominion. The ſtyle then that <hi>Paul</hi> vſes telles you
what diſpoſition was in his heart in praying: he ſpoke to a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie,
he ſpoke to a Lord: therefore reuerence was in his heart.
He ſpoke to a louing father:<note place="margin">Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart in prayer.</note> therefore loue and homelines was

and I vvorke vvith him.</hi> Iohn. 5. 17. Farther, the Father vvorkes
with the Sonne, when he is incarnate, cled with our nature: and
Ieſus Chriſt, God and man, being in our nature workes together
with the Father; and the Father giues vs all the graces out of the
fleſhlie hand of Chriſt the man: all the goodneſſe that flovves
to thee, it flowes through the vaile of the man-hood of Chriſt.
Looke their thou ſeuere not Chriſt and his Father; and look that

all together in prayer. Pray to God the Father, and the Son ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted

This is the rule of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Now the ſecond part of the Prayer is: Seing he can not come
to them as he vvould, he prayes to God the Father, and to the
Sonne the Lord Ieſus Chriſt; that thoſe thinges he could not get
done by his prefence, the Lord wil do them in his abſencer that
is, <hi>That the Lord vvold make them abound in loue and charitie, first
among them ſelues, and then among all men.</hi> The example he giues,
is, <hi>euen as I loued you.</hi> Then when thou canſt not get that which
firſt thou wouldſt haue; leaue not off to pray for the next beſt.
There are many that when they pray for any thing, and cannot
get it, they leaue off all praying. No, but vvhen thou canſt not
get that firſt thing thou prayeſt for, pray for the ſecond; it may
be, if thou get not the firſt, thou ſhalt get the ſecond: and well
is the ſoule that gets any peece of grace. So vvhen one thing
failes thee,<note place="margin">Loue, the gift of god o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ely.</note> ſeeke an other, and neuer leaue off ſuting. Then he
prayes for loue and charitie. Alas for loue and charitie in this
age: fare well loue, thou haſt gone away out of Scotland. There
is a vaine name of faith among vs; he beleeues, and ſhe beleeues:
but, loue vvhich is the true vvitneſſe of faith is gone. Fare vvell
loue. Theſe are the latter dayes: all loue is dead. But, to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Ye ſee that he begges loue from God to them. Then, it
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16659:81"/>
muſt follovve of neceſſitie. As faith is the free gift onelie and
grovves not in our foull ſtinking nature: ſo, loue and charitie is
the gift of God, and growes not in nature. Thy loue by nature
is a foull ſtincking ſelfe loue, thou haſt that rooted in thy heart,
thou wilt hate God and all the world for that loue: and if thou
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>akeſt a ſhovve of loue to any vvho is conjoyned to thee, all it
for thy ſelfe, and not for Chriſt. Thou wilt loue thy vvyfe and
children, but, not for Chriſt, but, for thy ſelfe. No ſinceritie in that
loue. The Papiſt will ſay, God commands vs to loue: therefore
it is in our owne hand to loue, or not to loue: Is this a faire argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
But, I reaſone by the contraire, out of this place. <hi>Paul</hi>
begges loue at God to them; therefore it followes well, loue is
the gift of God onelie. For, if it were in nature, whereto ſhould
I aske it from God? Marke one rule. It is a fooliſh thing to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the commaund of God by the ſtrength of nature; and the
ſtrength of nature by the command of God, and to reaſon, God
hes bidden me doe this, therefore, I haue free-vvill vvithin my
ſelfe to doe it; this reaſoning will deceiue thee. The Lord when
he commaunds thee who ſtands in that Couenant made with vs
in Chriſt; with the verie command, by his Spirite he workes in
thy heart aboue nature the ſame thing he commaunds thee, he
workes that loue that he commaunds thee. O the greatneſſe of
this loue of God. Say, Lord, doe that thing in me thou bidſt me
doe; bid me doe nothing, Lord, but that vvhich thou vvorkeſt
in me, for, I can doe nothing without thee. The Lord open mens
eyes to ſee this.</p>
               <p>The next thing is the meaſure of loue, that he askes of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
He ſeekes not loue in a ſmall meaſure, he ſeeks not little loue, but
aboundant loue. Seeke euer theſe ſpirituall giftes in as great
meaſure as thou canſt, ſeeke aboundance: for, thou canſt not ſeek
ſo much with thy mouth,<note place="margin">Meaſure of loue.</note> nor conceiue ſo much in thy heart, as
the Lord is able to giue thee. His hand is larger nor thy heart,
and ſo be greedie of thoſe ſpirituall graces, and neuer leaue off
to ſeeke, or to begge, till thou findſt thy heart running ouer
vvith grace; full of loue, full of knovvledge and light. <hi>Paul</hi> to
the Coloſſ. 3. 16. prayes that the Lord would <hi>fill them vvith
knovvledge:</hi> Looke Ephes. 3. 10. 20. Col. 1. 9. For, our perfection
ſtandes in abundance, our glorie ſtandes in fulneſſe, and our ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16659:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
goes forward degree by degree: There is nothing in this
life but a growing in faith, in knowledge, &amp;c, we are neuer filled
with loue, knowledge, &amp;c. but we muſt grow peece and peece,
vntill we ſee the Lord face to face: and then we ſhall get ſaciety,
then we ſhall be filled when God (who is loue himſelfe) ſhall
be all in all thinges. And therefore grovv euer; get a peece of
grouth this day, another peece to morrovve, and ſo day by day
grovv, vntill thy heart be filled vvith the grace of Chriſt. As
thou increaſeſt in knovvledge, ſo thou muſt increaſe in loue:
for, theſe muſt be joined together, knowledge and loue. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is in the mynde, and loue in the heart. Ye ſee how pleaſant
it is to ſee the Sunne, but the light of the mynde whereby we
ſee the Sunne of glorie is more excellent; it is the light that
commeth from the Lord. Then joyne thereto the loue in the
heart, theſe tvvo ſhould anſvvere other in proportion. Groweſt
thou in knovvledge of the vvay of Chriſt? looke thou grovv
in loue to God and man: othervvayes, I ſay, thy knovvledge
ſhall not auaile thee; and the greater knowledge, without loue
grow there-with, the greater damnation.</p>
               <p>Now whom ſhould they loue? <hi>Loue euerie one among your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
loue,</hi> next, <hi>all men in the vvorld.</hi> Loue all mankinde. Ye are
Chriſtians, loue together mutuallie. Be ye among the Heathen,
loue them too, who knows not Chriſt: loue the Domeſtickes of
faith, but loue the ſtrangers too: loue the members of the bodie
of Chriſt, but loue them alſo, vvho are out vvith the bodie: but,
in a different maner. The words lets vs ſee, the loue of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick
is mutuall. As thou loueſt me, ſo I loue thee: as the
hand loues the foote, ſo, the foote loues the hand. So among the
members of Chriſts bodie, there is a mutuall loue. The band of
loue goes from my hart to thee, and comes again from thy hart
to me: but, it is otherwaies with the loue that reaches out beyond
the body to ſtrangers: it is but a ſingle loue going from my hart,
and not returning againe from them. I loue him, but he loues
not me: I loue the Iew, but he loues not me: I loue the Turke,
but he loues not me; becauſe he is not conjoined in a body with
me: we ſhould loue them to ſaluation. Then, learne, we ſhould
not be narrovv hearted in loue Say not, I loue not him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he loues not me: if Chriſt had done ſo, vvhen thou vvas
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:16659:82"/>
an enemie, it had not beene well with thee. He loued thee being
his enemie. Loue them then vvho hates thee, and them, vvho
would ſlay thee. I will not giue a penny for thy loue, if thou loue
them onely vvho loues thee. And this telles that thou art a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the bodie, when thy loue reaches out with the bodie to
others. As Chriſt loues his enemie, ſo, thou, if thou be of Chriſts
bodie, vvill loue thy enemie. Alas, the canker of our nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
loue. If thou ſtriue not to loue thy enemie and to get that
rancor of thy nature ſlaine, ſlaine ſhalt thou be. <hi>Steuin</hi> when the
Ievves vvere ſtoning him to death, ſayes, <hi>Lord, let it not be laid to

ſafe, loue thy enemie.</p>
               <p>He layes downe his owne enſample: <hi>as I doe you.</hi> He vſes this
commonlie when he bids them doe any thing. I craue nothing
but that ye ſhould reſemble me: I loue you, loue ye others. There
is a leſſon Thou vvho vvilt bid anie other doe well, doe vvell
thy ſelfe: vvilt thou bid me loue? loue then firſt, thy ſelfe, and
loue all men. A Paſtor vvho vvould teach his flock to loue, let
him ſhovv loue firſt in his life and actions himſelfe: othervvaies,
he ſhall not haue grace in his vvords: let him caſt himſelfe to be
full of loue, and then, his vvords ſhall edifie: Let him euer
ſeeke an hartie loue to their ſaluation, and craue loue
to them, at the hands of the Father, and Chriſt
Ieſus his Sonne. To vvhom vvith the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

(brethren) the Apoſtle makes mention to
the Theſſalonians, of that earneſt prayer
he vſed to God for them: that once it

in a prayer. The prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
thre parts: the firſt part is, that God
the Father and the Lord Ieſus vvould direct his vvay tovvardes

they ſhoulde abound in loue, euery one tovvardes another, and

enemies.</p>
               <p>Now ſhortly to come to our text. In the laſt verſe of this
chapter, ye haue the third head of his prayer: he beſeeches God
to giue them holineſſe; holineſſe in generall, all kinde of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
As he prayed before that they might abound in loue and
charitie, vvhich is a part of holineſſe: So novv he prayes they
ſhould haue all ſort of holineſſe. Thereafter in the chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
he falles out in precepts of good maners, and holie lyfe
and conuerſation, and this he follovves out to the end of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle:
ſauing onely by the vvay he caſts in one or tvvo infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
reſoluing them of certaine doubtes: the firſt concerning
the mourning for the dead: the ſecond concerning the day of
Iudgement and the comming of the Lord Ieſus. Novv to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.
He prayes for holineſſe to them. And vvhat ſhould this
holineſſe doe? <hi>To make your hearts</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>stable and vnblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
before God.</hi> And at vvhat tyme? <hi>eſpeciallie at the comming of
the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> In vvhat companie ſhould they be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
with holineſſe? They alone? No, but <hi>vvith all his Saints:</hi>
in that happie ſocietie of the Church of God and the Saintes.
There is the effect ſhortlie of this thirtienth verſe. Then bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
marke. It is holineſſe, not a faſhion of holineſſe in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard
behauiour;<note place="margin">Holines ſtabliſhes our harts before God.</note> but vvithin the heart of a man or vvoman, that
makes them ſtand vp in the preſence of God, that eſtabliſhes
them without feare, terrour, or trembling when they ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the. Tribunall of a terrible Iudge. Where there is no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
no ſinceritie of heart in man, but an heart filled vvith
foull affections; full of vncleanneſſe and filthineſſe, there the
heart dare not preſent the ſelfe before the face of God, for feare
that wrath come out from his angrie face, and burne it vp. The
Apoſtle Heb. 12. 14. ſayes, <hi>Without holineſſe, no man ſhall ſee God;</hi>
for if they ſee him, at ſhall be to their deſtruction. When he looks

                  </gap> the heart, and findes not holineſſe and cleanneſſe there; his
looke ſhall deſtroy the heart, and he ſhall make it tremble and
ſhake at his preſence. Brethren, many hes experience of an euill
conſcience: vncleanneſſe makes euer an euill conſcience: and a
man with an euill conſcience is not able to ſtand in the ſight of
God. There is not an vncleane body but he findes this in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16659:84"/>
They runne euer to ſome hole and cannot abide the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ſight of God: he is holie, thou vnholie: he looks throgh thee,
thou canſt not abide his ſight. Now it is true our compearance
before God and his Tribunal, ſhall ſtand in the righteous merits
of Chriſt Ieſus, &amp; except we be cled with that perfit righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Chriſt, imputed to vs by faith, ther is no ſlanding for vs.
Rom. 5. 1. But it is as true, if thou findſt not again in ſome meaſure
ſome holineſſe and cleanneſſe inherent in thy ſelf; thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſtand before God: for where the righteouſneſſe of Ieſus is,
wher remiſſion of ſins is in any man, there of neceſſitie muſt be
ſome meaſure of holineſſe &amp; pureneſſe of life in him alſo. If thou
be juſtified by the fre mercy of God in Chriſt, of neceſſitie thou
muſt be ſanctified &amp; muſt haue ſome ſpark of godlineſſe in thy
ſelfe: for thoſe whom he hes juſtified, he alſo hes ſanctified. So
when euer a man hes the juſtice of Chriſt imputed vnto him, of
neceſſitie he muſt haue a ſhare of this juſtice inherent in himſelf:
wants he a part of this holineſſe, brag as he will, he hes no clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
throgh the blood of Chriſt. <hi>Iames</hi> ſayes, <hi>If thou haſt faith, let
me ſe it thy vvorks. 2. 18.</hi> If any by grace be ſanctified in Chriſt,
let them vtter it in ſome meaſure in works: otherwaies they lie.
So this holds ſure. No ſtanding to vs before God, except there
be holineſſe in vs.</p>
               <p>Now the ſtiles are to be marked in the text which are giuen
to God; Firſt he is called <hi>God:</hi> then <hi>our Father.</hi> The name of <hi>God,</hi>
a name of Majeſtie and of great glorie. The name of <hi>Father,</hi> a
name of homelineſſe and louingneſſe. Marke it. If God vvere
nothing elſe to vs but God, that is to ſay, but an high Maieſtie,
full of all glorie: if that Majeſtie dimmitted not himſelfe to be a
louing Father to vs through Ieſus, there were no ſtanding for
vs before him, our heart durſt neuer preſent the ſelfe before
him. A ſinne is not able to looke vpon God, as he is God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
in Majeſtie, Honour, Glorie and Iuſtice. No, the whole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
of the world dare not face him as he is God onely. All
our compearing before him is, becauſe, as he is God in Majeſtie
and glorie: ſo in Chriſt he is become a louing Father to vs:
and if vve receiue not the Spirite (that is called the Spirite of
adoption, teſtifying to our ſpirite, that he is become our Father
in Ieſus Chriſt, and we are adopted in Chriſt; and therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16659:84"/>
our mouthes to cry Abba, Father) vve would neuer haue
a face to looke to him, nor a mouth to ſpeake to him. And ſo
as he is become a Father to vs in Chriſt, ſo craue that thou mayſt
get that Spirite of adoption, that thy mouth may be opened
wide, with ſweetneſſe, to cry, Abba, Father Moreouer, theſe very
ſtiles learns vs, how our harts ſhould be diſpoſed when we come
and ſtand before him, euen heer in his congregation, &amp; church,
where his preſence is. (We are now in his ſight and preſence.)
He is a God in Majeſtie; A Majeſtie would haue feare and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
So ther is the firſt thing, ſtand before this Majeſty of God
in feare and reuerence. Then there muſt be more then this: he is
a Father, and therefore, thou ſhouldſt loue him: ſo thou ſhouldſt
both reuerence and loue him together: If theſe two be together,
they ſhall mak thee to be in good temper to ſtand before God.</p>
               <p>Now come to the time when the hart ſhal be eſtabliſhed. It is,
<hi>at the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> It is true brethren, euen in
this life, before that glorious appearing of Chriſt, we ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God in holineſſe, and our hearts are eſtabliſhed before him
without rebuke in a manner: and euen now at this preſent time,
who euer they be who hes holineſſe in their hearts, they finde,
in effect, their harts ſtanding in his preſence; when they looke
to that face of his Majeſtie ſhining in the Goſpell, with the eye
of faith, the heart is eſtabliſhed before the face of God, and God
is pacified, and beholds them in quietneſſe. Let all men diſcend
in their hearts, and if they haue holineſſe, I aſſure them they will
haue peace and quyetneſſe in the hart, when they think on him,
Then this is true. Euen in this life before the great day, we ſtand
before him eſtabliſhed in holineſſe: but it is as true, ſo long as we
liue in this life, ther is euer a peece of vnquyetnes in the harts of
the moſt godlie: and there are none of vs who can find ſo peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
an heart before God, as we ſhould haue. There is euer ſo
long as we liue heere a peece of euill conſcience for ſinne. The
cauſe is, becauſe ſo long as we liue he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r, we are but holy in a part
and that in a verie ſober part: ſinne leaues vs neuer, and therfore
the prick in the conſcience for ſinne leaues vs neuer, And where
this euill conſcience is, there muſt euer be a peece of feare and
terrour to ſtand before that heauenlie preſence. But vvhen
the Lord ſhall come in that latter day, which is called the day
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16659:85"/>
of judgement, when Chriſt ſhall appeare in that great day, the
heart of the godlie ſhall be eſtabliſhed before him, without any
feare or terrour. If thou be one of the choſen of God, thou ſhalt
ſtand before the face of God, vvith an heart in peace, vvithout
any terrour. (But ô how great ſhall the feare of the heart of the
wicked men be?) the cauſe is, becauſe thou ſhalt not ſo ſoone ſee
the face of the Lord Ieſus, that faire glorious face, but as ſoone
in the moment of thy reſurrection, thou ſhalt be tranſformed in
a perfite holineſſe, both in body and ſoule. And therefore the
Apoſtle ſayes. Philip. 3. 21. When we ſhall ſee him, <hi>We ſhall be
tranſformed, and this vyle body of ours, ſhall be made conformable to
his glorious body,</hi> and vvhen vve ſhall ſee him, vve ſhall be made
like him in glorie and holineſſe, vvithout any ſpot or vvrinckle,
or any part of deformitie in bodie or ſoule. What then is it, that
puts this terrour in our heart to ſtand before God? Onely ſinne.
So when all ſinne ſhall be taken away, all feare ſhall be taken
away. Then, ſeeing there is no perfite quyetneſſe vntill vve ſee
him; why ſhould not our deſire be to ſee him? wherefore ſhould
all this feare be of this latter day, ſeeing thou wilt neuer be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in heart, nor get thy full glorie vntil his comming at that
day? thy bleſſedneſſe ſhall be perfite there. I finde in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the perfection of all graces differred vntill that time. Ye
ſhall finde no grace,<note place="margin">Perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red til the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>utter day.</note> but the perfection thereof is remitted vntill
that day. <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame Epiſtle. 2. chap. 19. verſ. My joy is in
the ſight of God, and of Ieſus Chriſt, at his comming: He gets
not perfection of joy, vntill he come. And therefore he will not
promiſe to the Theſſalonians their joy vntill that day; no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of grace, mercie and peace, vntill God put an end to
ſinne, to death, and wickedneſſe. Looke then if we ſhould long
for that latter day; we looke heere and there for this thing and
that thing; but who lookes for that comming of the Lord? Alas,
if we knevv vvhat grace and joy Chriſts comming brought to
vs, vve vvould looke for nothing ſo much, as for his comming.
We are earthlie, and therefore all our lookes are for earthlie
thinges: we are not ſpirituall, and ſo we cannot looke for that
ſpirituall grace. The Lord prepare vs to looke for, and deſire
that glorious comming. All theſe earthlie thinges goes away;
Heauen onelie abydes. What fooliſhneſſe is this, ſeeing we are
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16659:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſubject to mortality, that we ſhould ſet our hearts on this world:
our dwelling muſt not be here; but in Heauen in endlieſſe joy.
Seeke it earneſtly therefore.</p>
               <p>Novv in the end of this verſe he telles vs in vvhat company,
and with whom we ſhal be eſtabliſhed in holineſſe before God:
thou ſhalt not be holy thy ſelfe alone: thou ſhalt not be an <hi>a per
ſe</hi> in holineſſe, doe as thou wilt, either ſhalt thou be in a ſocietie,
in a companie vvith many more nor thou;<note place="margin">All gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the ſocietie of the ſants</note> or elſe thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be holie, nor ſee the face of God. This is plaine. Either thou
ſhalt be in the Church, which is the communion of the Saintes
of God, or elſe thou ſhalt neuer ſee Gods preſence. He will leape
out of it at this ſide, and he at that ſide; but if thou come not in
again in that ſame ſocietie (yea, and to the number of this church
and of the Saintes that profeſſes Chriſt this day in Scotland)
thou ſhalt neuer ſee Gods face. All bleſſinges, grace, mercie, and
peace euerlaſting before God is in the companie of the Church,
that profeſſe the truth and puritie of the Goſpell of Chriſt: not
in the company of them, who will take the name of a Church,
or that falſe Church, the Romane Church. So let him vvho vvill
ſtand vvith holineſſe in the number of the Saintes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeuere from
Babylon, or elſe he ſhall be partaker of the judgement. So (bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
to come againe, ye ſhall not read in the Scripture of any
grace giuen to any man, but ye ſhall finde that it is giuen to him
as a member of that bodie, as one of the Saintes, in the ſocietie
of the Saintes. In the firſt to the Epheſians verſe 18. ſpeaking of
the riches of the glorie of the inheritance of Heauen; he ſayes,
thou ſhalt neuer get it but <hi>among the Saintes.</hi> Then againe he
ſayes, chap. 3. verſ. 18. Who ſhall vnderſtand the loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of God? None but they <hi>that are in the ſocietie of the Saintes.</hi>
No light, mercie nor knowledge of God, but to them that ſtands
knit vp as members in the bodye of Chriſt: ye ſee, cut off a
member of the body and caſt it away; no ſap can follow from
the body to it: So, if thou be cut off from the number of the
Saintes, vvho are the Church of God, thou ſhalt neuer get any
grace of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now to the next chapter. In the fourth and fift chapters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
the laſt part of this Epiſtle, containing the doctrine of
maners, exhorting to holineſſe of lyfe, and godlineſſe. But to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16659:86"/>
the wordes. He ſayes, <hi>And furthermore,</hi> As he would ſay, all is not
tolde: I will tell that which reſts, which is the doctrine of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
precepts of godlie lyfe and conuerſation. When we haue
teached all the yeere ouer; when we haue tolde you the doctrine
of juſtification, ſanctification, &amp;c. ſo long as there is no ſpeaking
of a godly lyfe and conuerſation; and ſo long as we haue not
tolde you, how ye ſhould lead your lyfe; there is euer ſomething
behinde vnſpoken of. Neuer a full and perfite preaching, wher
there is nothing ſpoken of a good or of an euill lyfe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation.
For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is ſuch a neceſſitie laid on men and wemen
in this world, that all ſerues for nothing, except they liue a good
&amp; holy life: Thy profeſſion of loue, righteouſneſſe, mercie, &amp; all
the reſt is but vanitie and winde, if thy conuerſation toward thy
neighbour be not aunſwerable to thy profeſſion: it is a ſhame
to thee to ſpeake of Chriſt, of holineſſe, of righteouſneſſe, of life
euerlaſting, except thou liue conforme thereto. And therefore,
ye ſhall neuer read any Epiſtle of <hi>Paul,</hi> but euer vvhen he hes
ſpoken of faith, juſtification, &amp;c. then in the end he ſubjoynes
precepts charging vs to liue a godlie lyfe. And more then this;
Trow ye, in the end, at Chriſts comming to judgement, that the
pretence of faith or righteouſnes will be ſufficient to thy eternal
ſaluation. No, but we muſt liue holie: for, al the bleſſinges of God
in Chriſt tends to this end that we may liue holie: yea, this is the
end of election it ſelfe. Epheſ. 1. 4. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes. We are choſen
from all eternitie that we ſhould be holie. Then we ſhould liue
ſoberlie and juſtlie with our neighbour. Tit. 2. 12. And therefore
either caſt avvay profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, and heare neuer a
word of faith, righteouſneſſe, &amp;c. or elſe ſtriue to liue conforme
thereto. This in generall.</p>
               <p>Now to the wordes. <hi>I beſeech and exhort you,</hi> and that <hi>in the
Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> What exhorts he? <hi>that they increaſe more and
more</hi> in godlie lyfe and conuerſation. As for the forme of your
going forward, I haue tolde you the forme. <hi>hovv ye ſhould vvalke</hi>
in this world; walke conformable thereto. The words would be
well marked, <hi>I beſeech and exhort you,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>in the Lord Ieſus.</hi>
He might haue well ſaid, I command you; as wrytting to Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
verſ. 8. 9. he ſayes, <hi>When I might command thee, in the name of
Ieſus: yet, rather, for loues ſake, I pray thee.</hi> Loue turnes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16659:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in a prayer. All doctrin that comes from any perſon muſt
come of loue, or elſe it is deare of the hearing. Now he ſhowes
his loue, in ſpeaking; for the wordes comes from the heart, and
ſo among al the reſt of the wayes, whereby he vtters the loue he
had in his heart, this is one, when precept and commaund is
turned ouer to requeeſting. When he may commaund he will
not, but he turnes it ouer and exhortes. Ye may marke this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
oft in the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul.</hi> Now the wordes are dowbled:
He is not content to ſay, <hi>I beſeech you:</hi> but he ſayes alſo, <hi>I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
you.</hi> There is no vvord loſt heere. This doubling of the
vvordes teſtifies of the earneſtneſſe that vvas in his heart to
haue this people going forvvard in this godlie life: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie
of the neceſſitie that lyes on euerie one of vs, to liue
holie in this life. For, vvhere there is no neceſſitie, why ſhould
a man be earneſt? but ſeeing there is a neceſſitie lying on all
people, that either they muſt liue a godlie life in this worlde,
or elſe be damned, woe to that Paſtor that is no buſie to ſtirre
vp the people to liue godlie and holilie. As there is a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in them to liue holie; ſo, there is a neceſſitie in him to charge
them to liue holie. And therefore, blame not the Paſtor to be
buſie, eyther to pray, admoniſhe, or othervvayes to correct,
and to reproue ſinne. For, he hes a neceſſitie laid on him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the paine of damnation, to puſhe you forvvard to Heauen.
<hi>For the Lord Ieſus ſake,</hi> that is, as euer they vvoulde looke for
mercie and grace at Ieſus hand; as he would ſay, if ye liue wel, ye
ſhall finde him to be a merciful God: otherwaies, if ye liue euill,
to be a terrible judge to you. This is ſome ſeueritie againſt
them. Sweetneſſe and ſharpneſſe muſt be joined together, thou
muſt be moued to thy duetie, partlie by ſweetneſſe, &amp; partly by
ſharpneſſe: therfore, with his requeſt he joines this ſo weghty an
obteſtation; &amp; this is a common cuſtome to this Apoſtle. 2. Cor.
10. 1. More, this telles that howbeit a man vſe prayer and faire
wordes where he might command, yet, we ſhould not abuſe his
lenitie and patience; for, if thou meete lenitie and patience with
diſobedience, it ſhall bring on a greater judgement: nor if
he had vſed threatning and ſeueritie. The greater lenitie that a
man vſes to thee to winne thee; if thou wilt not be winne, the
greater ſhall be thy condemnation, and thou heapſt on coales on
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16659:87"/>
thy owne head.</p>
               <p>Now what is this he exhorts them to? <hi>That they euer eaſe more
and more.</hi> That they goe forward ſtill on with inſtantneſſe, vntill
they come to the mark: for, this courſe of holineſſe hes a faire
end. Brethren, there is no ſtanding for vs in this courſe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie
and holineſſe of life. When thou enterſt once in the way,
ſtand not there. A man will begin and runne on till euening, and
then ſet down his ſtaff and reſt him: but we muſt ay runne, ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
waking, eating, drinking, &amp;c. ay forward: there is not an
halfe houre granted thee, no, not ſo much tyme as to looke ouer
thy ſhoulder to reſt thee, but ay thou ought to haue thy eie on
the marke. And when thou runneſt, ſtriue, not onely to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne
them that runnes with thee: but more, the words meanes,
that thou ſhouldſt ouerrunne thy owne ſelfe; if thou runneſt faſt
this day, runne faſter to morrow, and ay preaſe to run forward,
and when thou art lying on dead-bed, runne faſteſt then, and ſo
ſhalt thou finde exceeding great comfort in thy running. The
Lord hes bidden thee run, and cryes out of Heauen, Run as thou
wouldſt ſaue thy ſelfe. What is the Paſtors office? <hi>Paul</hi> when
the Theſſalonians are running out before him, he cryes, Runne:
ye are in the rinke, runne forward, excell your ſelfe, runne out
before your ſelfe vntill ye come to the end of the rinke. This is
the office of the Paſtor, to cry behinde you when ye are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
and this ſhout of the Paſtor behinde the people, when
they are in the rinke, is ſo needfull, that except he cry continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
Run out and excell, they ſhall linger and ly down. That all
the world may ſee the great neceſſitie we haue, to haue this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie
continuallie crying in our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God we could let the neceſſitie of this cry (to runne) to ſinke in
our harts that we might obey it. If ye would be ſafe, haue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in this cry, and runne on identlie, vntill ye come to the high
preaſe of our calling.</p>
               <p>Now followes the forme and manner of this running for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vntill they come to the end of their rinke. No other forme
but the forme ſet downe before, <hi>ye haue receiued of vs hovv ye
ought to vvalke, and pleaſe your God.</hi> Brethren, as there is a running
and an inſtant courſe craued of vs, ſo we muſt run, not in euerie
ſort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor after euerie manner, but we muſt runne with an ordor.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16659:87"/>
There are rules preſcryued to vs how we ſhould runne.<note place="margin">Order in running.</note> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
1. Cor. chap. 9. verſe 24. ſayes, <hi>Runne ſo that thou mayeſt get

wraſtles, and runnes, if ye ſtriue <hi>not lavvfullie</hi> according to a
good ordor, ye ſhall not winne. 2 Tim. 2. 5. So when we runne,
we muſt runne according to good ordor, not raſhlie, according
to our owne fantaſie, but according to the good lawes of God.
There is no well ruled life on earth, but that life that is ruled by
the rule of God. So we all running in this rinke, muſt be ruled
by good lawes. As <hi>Paul</hi> beſoght them to runne and cries, grow
more and more: euen ſo he giues them the Lawes to runne by.
So as the Miniſter is bound to cry to men to runne; ſo the word
of God is giuen to him to tell thee thou ſhouldeſt runne by this
rule, or that rule: the King by his rules, the counſeller in his own
calling by his rules: what man that euer he be, except he run in
his owne calling according to his rules he ſhall neuer attaine to
the marke. And if the Lord take away this word that telles vs
the rule, whereby we ſhould runne, miſerable ſhall we be. This
is plaine. Take this word out of the land, all ſhall runne wrong.
Yet there is one word heere to be marked. He calles their going
forward walking: Borrowing the language from a man who is
going a iourney. Ye will ſee in the worde, many lawes, many
commands, many admonitions to put men forward in the way,
to go and run: but ye heere no precept in the Scripture, to ſit
ſtill, eat, drink, and take thy pleaſure, ſeeing thy life is ſhort. So
we learne, the Lord bids vs walke. The Lord hes not ordained
vs to reſt heere. Whatſoeuer calling he hes giuen thee, he hes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
thee a continuall walking and trauelling therein, vntill thou
come to the end of thy journey and then thou ſhalt reſt: he is a
fooliſhe bodie, who will promiſe to himſelfe reſt heere: if thou
reſt before thy journey be complete, it ſhall be to thy vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
And therefore doe as he hes bidden thee; albeit it be
painefull heere, yet in the end thou ſhalt find reſt.</p>
               <p>Now in the next words he defines this <hi>(vvalking)</hi> and calles
it <hi>to pleaſe God.</hi> It is a paine to a man to walke all day, from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to euening, and then to finde no reſt, nor fruite of his labor
at night: but, I ſay to thee, if thy walking be not to pleaſe God,
thou ſhalt neuer get any frute of thy walking: if thy walking
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16659:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be not euer to pleaſe thy God, thou ſhalt neuer get the right
way, thou ſhalt goe like a doting bodie, and be the farther from
that glorious butt, and in the end thou ſhalt effectuat nothing,
but in that great day thou ſhalt curſe all thy labors and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
and thou ſhalt ſay, Alas my labours are all loſt: I haue wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
my ſelfe, and now I am no better. But if thy walking be to
pleaſe God, thou ſhalt finde a ſweetneſſe in thy labor, and joy
in the end thereof: And when that bleſſed day of reſurrection
ſhall come, thou ſhalt ſay, Bleſſed am I in my labours, that I
wrought to pleaſe my God, for now I haue gotten the butt: I
finde the frute of my laboures. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, 1. Cor. 9. 26. <hi>I runne,
but not to an vncertaintie.</hi> Learne neuer to runne to an vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but euer runne to a butt; effectuat ſomething by your doing.
The onely way to make you runne well, is to pleaſe God. A
Miniſter, or any other in the world, who woulde runne right,
muſt run to pleaſure their God, and then they ſhall finde ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in their running. Now well is the ſoule that can endeuore
the ſelfe to pleaſure God: for, ther is no joy in the creature, but
when it is ſet to glorify God night and day in this world: for, to
this end are we ſet in the world. 1. Cor. 10. 31. and if we doe this,
he ſhal ſet vs in the heauens to glorifie him.</p>
               <p>Now in the next verſe, he takes themſelues to be witneſſes
that he had ſet before them the preceptes and lawes, whereby
they ſhould walke in the journey. <hi>Ye knovve vvhat commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vve gaue you by the Lord Ieſus.</hi> It is an happie thing to a
Miniſter in his calling, when with a good conſcience, he appeals
the conſciences of the people, that he cried to them and ſaide, ô
people I bade you goe, I preſcriued you rules to goe into, your
blood be on your owne head; I haue diſcharged a faithfull due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to you. Brethren, what auailes it vs if we ſhould euer preache
the Goſpell, if we be not ſaued thereby? And when we teache
you the Goſpell, we alſo ſtir our ſelues forward to come to that
butt Chriſt; our owne teaching is the meane whereby we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
as it is the meane whereby ye are ſaued. Therefore, let all
goe forward together in the rinke.</p>
               <p>Now, in the verſe following, he beginnes to ſet down to them
the rules of walking and going forward. That which he had
ſpoken by tongue, being at Theſſalonica, the ſame thing he
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16659:88"/>
puts in writ, by his pen. It is a fooliſh thing to a man, to ſay, The
Apoſtle ſpoke one thing, and wrote another. No, brethren, <hi>Paul</hi>
neuer ſpake one ſentence to confirme any people, but it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
to vs. It is blaſphemie, to thinke, that, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi>
&amp;c. wrote not that, which they ſpoke: it is follie; for, there was
no ſentence they ſpoke pertaining to our ſaluation, but it is
written. Then, the rule is, <hi>The vvill of God, vvhich is your ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
That is, that ye be holie in your ſoules, and the whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
thereof; in your bodie, and all the members of your
bodie, and all the actions of your members. So, he drawes the
whole rules, which are to be obſerued in this courſe and rinke,
we haue to Heauen and life euerlaſting, to holineſſe and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
Then, in one word, there is the manner, how thou ſhalt
goe forward to this butt. Be holie, be holie, thou muſt be holie,
holie in heart, hand, mouth, foot, in all the members of thy body:
ſeparate thee from the worlde, which is full of ſinne, full of
foull affections, diſpleaſing the eye of thy God, and put on ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.
Who euer they be, that goe forward in holineſſe, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redlie
they ſhall come to the marke. Liue thou an holie life,
what vocation that euer it be in, aſſure thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou ſhalt come to
the priſe of the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus. Philipp. 3.
14. To turne it ouer againe. Buſie thy ſelf as thou wilt, if that thy
buſineſſe be not in holineſſe, thou art fooliſhe, the faſter thou
runneſt, thou art the farther behinde. Alas, how many are there,
who buſies them ſelues in wickedneſſe, and the more they wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
themſelues, the farther are they from Heauen: Bleſſed are
they, who can goe forward to Heauen. Stryue to holineſſe, and
ſay. Lord, I am on my journey, I cannot goe forward, except I
finde an holie heart, to thinke; an holie mouth, to ſpeake; an holy
hand, to touch: Lord, ſanctifie them, that I runne not in vaine.
The way to runne holilie, is to keepe euer before thy eies, God,
that holie one, in the face of Ieſus; and to cry, O Lord, guide me
in holineſſe: And I aſſure thee, if thou wilt ſtriue to liue holilie,
and cry to God, to guide thee in holineſſe, thou ſhalt come to
that endleſſe joy: But, if thou let God out of thy eye, thou ſhalt
periſhe. Brethren, this life will away, and therefore, ſet your harts
to run to that euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Nowe, hauing ſet downe the generall, he deduces it in parts,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16659:89"/>
and the firſt part, he takes vp, is cleanneſſe of the bodie: as he
would ſay, fyle not the bodie with fornication; fyle thou thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
with fornication, thou ſhalt not thinke a cleane thought,
ſpeake a cleane word, or, doe any cleane deed. Surelie, all ſinnes
pollutes, and fyles: The ſinne, that comes from the heart, if it
were but an euill motion, it goes back againe and leaues a foull
blot behinde it: a rotten deed, leaues a blot behinde it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a foull
worde in the mouth, goes back, and leaues a foull blot in the
hart: when thou haſt ſpoken a word, thou art not quite thereof,
but, it comes back againe and fyles the ſoule. It goes not from
thee ſo lightlie as thou troweſt, no, it leaues ay a foull blot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
it. So, this corruption growes daily. Brethren, I tell you,
all ſinnes fylles the bodie: yet, of all ſinnes, harlotrie eſpeciallie
fyles the bodie. Looke the compariſon, the Apoſtle vſes 1.
Cor. 6. 18. The bodie of an harlote, of all bodies is the foulleſt.
Alas, ſuch a fyling of the bodie and ſoule, followes vpon adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
that it is wonderfull to tell. Seeing, therefore, ſpeciall pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the bodie, followes on fornication. I beſeech you, (as
ye would preſent your ſelfe before God in cleanneſſe) abſtaine
from harlotrie: An harlot will trauell long, ere he come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
thy heart and bodie muſt be ſanctified, before thou come
to Heauen. And ſo as thou would come forward to Heauen,
ſtryue to keepe a cleane bodie and ſoule to God; and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie,
abſtaine from this vyce of fornication. Lord
keepe vs from it, vntill we come to the end
of our journey, that we may be preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
clean before chriſt. To whom
with the Father, and holie
Spirit, be honour and
praiſe for euer.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue in hand, Brethren, the third parte
of this Epiſtle, written by <hi>Paul,</hi> to the
Theſſalonians. In this part, ye haue heard,
the Apoſtle exhortes them to a godlie
life and conuerſation. This kynde of
doctrine he vſes verie oft, in the reſt of
his Epiſtles. The exhortation, ye heard,
that was in the beginning of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
vvas, not onelie to liue vvell, to vvalke in holineſſe, but, alſo,
it vvas, to excell more and more, to ſtryue in that courſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
euen, to ſtriue to ouercome, not onelie others, that ranne
vvith them in the rinke, but, alſo, to ouercome themſelues: if
they ranne faſt this day, that, they ſhould run faſter to morrow,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ugh to ſtriue, but we muſt runne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtriue lawfullie, as he
ſpeakes to <hi>Timothie, 2.</hi> Timoth. 2. 5. There are certaine rules
and lawes, according to the which we muſt runne in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
courſe. As touching theſe rules according to the which
we muſt runne, the Apoſtle ſhowes to the Theſſalonians, he
hes preſcryued them to them alreadie, vvhen he vvas among
them.</p>
               <p>Novve in the text vve haue preſentlie red, hee beginnes to
call the lawes to remembrance againe, and to repeate them to
to them. (For vvhat euer thing he ſpoke by worde being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
that ſame thing in effect he hes left behinde him, regiſtrate
in vvritte, and this day by Gods grace it is come in our hands.)
He dravves the vvhole rules and lavves to be keeped in this
courſe, wherin we runne to this butt of ſaluation and to Heauen,
to be partakers of that glorie: Firſt to a generall law, which is,
the law of ſanctification and holineſſe. <hi>For, this is the vvill of
God</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>euen your ſanctification.</hi> Thereafter he commes
to the ſpeciall poyntes of ſanctification. The firſt is, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining
from fornication. The next in the wordes red, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining
from doing wrong to ourneighbour, either by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
craft or deceite. Now to ſpeake of the firſt, as God
ſhall giue vs grace, and to take vp euerie word. <hi>This is the vvill
of God,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>euen your ſanctification.</hi> Learne then firſt. The
vvhole lavves and rules according to the vvhich vve ſhoulde
vvalke and runne in this rinke, vvherein the Lord hes placed
vs in this lyfe, are reſolued in a generall, called the Law of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
The law of a ſanctified lyfe; He or ſhe, that in this courſe,
or in this rinke will preaſe to be holie in all the pointes of their
lyfe, ſhall run and ſtriue (to ſpeak vvith the Apoſtle) lawfullie:
and running and ſtriuing lawfullie, in the end they ſhal be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But they who in running towardes the marke, ſtryues not
to an holineſſe of lyfe, they runne not lawfullie; they keepe no
rule in their running. They runne and waits not how; they are
miſerable in their running. And as they runne vnlawfullie, ſo,
they ſhall neuer be crowned with glory: they ſhall runne long
ere they come to the marke and priſe of that high calling to
be with God. Then in the courſe of this life, in this rinke which
the Lord hes placed vnto runne in, vntill we come to the marke
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:16659:90"/>
of that glorious reſurrection, we muſt runne holilie, keep in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
heart, an holie hand, keepe holie ſenſes, keepe an holie foot in
running; in a worde, we muſt be holie in the whole powers of
the ſoule, be holie in the whole members of the bodie, ſeuer all
from the pollution of this world, dedicate all to God, and ſo, ye
ſhall come to the end of the rinke.</p>
               <p>Now to goe forward in the text. To moue them to this ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
and to embrace this rule of running forward to the
marke.<note place="margin">Gods vvil a ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reaſon of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> He ſayes, <hi>For, this is the vvill of God.</hi> He giues no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
but this: It is the will of God to be ſo. Howbeit we heare no
word of any other reaſon but this: it is the will of God to doe
this worke, or that worke, it ſhould ſuffice vs: we are ſo obliſt
to that Lord, and ſo bound to his obedience, that, if we know of
no other reaſon, wherefore we ſhould doe any thing, but onelie
that it is his will, we ſhould obey it. And the man who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandes
it is the will of God when he is doing any thing, and wilcloſe
his eies, lead captiue his own reaſon, ſubject his will to the
will of his God, and goe and follow on him, if it were through
Hell (if he bid thee goe throgh Hell, go throgh it, cloſe thy eyes,
follow on, howbeit thouknoweſt no out-ſight) ſurely, that man
ſhall get a bleſſed iſhue, he ſhall get a crowne: neuer ſoule vvas
diſapointed that ſet themſelues to follow God. Who euer ſettes
themſelues againſt their affections to ſerue God, they come at
laſt to Heauen. By the contrary, when a man thinks himſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
wiſe, and will not followe on Gods will, except he ſee a faire
out-ſight, and get great reaſons wherefore he ſhould doe this, or
that, and thinkes it not eneugh to ſay, it is Gods will; but will ſay,
wherefore is it Gods will? The Lord will let him followe his
owne will, and his will and reaſon will lead him to deſtruction.
There was neuer man whom the Lord gaue ouer to his owne
will but he ran to his owne deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Now to go forward. He comes next to the ſpeciall pointes of
this ſanctification. There are ſundrie ſorts of holineſſe, therefore,
he will lay it down in parts, euerie part thereof in the owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And the firſt part of ſanctification and holineſſe of lyfe,<note place="margin">Firſt part of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteening from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

he makes it to be <hi>absteening from fornication,</hi> abſteening from
harlotrie. It ſtands in keeping of an holie and cleane bodie. In
running on this courſe, in the rinke that conuoyes to the laſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16659:91"/>
butt, and life euerlaſting, thou muſt keepe an holie perſon. But
to marke the wordes more natrovvlie. Firſt he recommendes
<hi>abſtinence.</hi> He vvho runnes in a rinke, and ſtriues, ſayes the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
1. Corinth. chap. 9. verſe 25. that man he is continent in
all thinges, he keepes a goode dyet; ere he enter in the rinke
he vvill dyet himſelfe and abſtaine from many thinges vvhich
othervvayes he vvould vſe: So we vvho runnes in this rinke of
Chriſtianitie to be partakers of that Crowne; vve muſt abſtaine,
vve muſt not follow our appetites, vve muſt not put our hand
to euerie thing our appetite biddes vs, we muſt not yeelde to the
luſtes of the fleſhe, there muſt bee abſtinence and dyet. And
therefore <hi>Paul</hi> in that ſame ninth chapter to the Cor. verſe 27.
ſhovves how he vſed himſelfe in running, to be an enſample to
vs. He ſayes, <hi>He held his bodie at vnder, and redacted it in a ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
and vvoulde not let it be his maſter. Let thou thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
be thy maſter, I promiſe thee thou ſhalt neuer ſee the butt.
But to come more ſpeciallie. What abſtinence muſt it be? He
names it <hi>from fornication.</hi> There are ſundrie ſortes of abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
vvhich is requyred of them that runnes in this rinke:
but among them all, this is a ſpeciall, Abſtaine from harlotrie,
and pollution of the bodie vvith fornication. Among all the
ſinnes that defiles the bodie and the members of the bodie of
anie man or vvoman, harlotrie is the cheefeſt ſinne, and makes
all vncleane and polluted in Goddes ſight. The Apoſtle 1.
Corinth. chap. 6. verſe 18. ſayes, <hi>All ſinnes that a man committes,
is out-vvith the bodie, but he vvho committe: fornication, he ſinnes
against his ovvne bodie;</hi> he pollutes and defyles his bodie in a
ſpeciall manner. Brethren, the bodie of a man vvhich is not
polluted vvith this filthineſſe, is a meete bodie to runne in this
courſe: it is ſvvift and readie to runne in this courſe: but if
the bodie be de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yled vvith harlotrie, it is not ſvvift and meete
for the courſe Learne it. Ye ſhall ſee for common, a goode
turne falles neuer out in the hands of an harlote: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
vnder the Sunne, that a bodie polluted vvith fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can doe holilie. As the perſon is vncleane in Gods ſight,
ſo all thinges he does are polluted, yea, that ſame verie action
that othervvayes is goode is ſinne in Gods ſight. Commeſt thou
to the Church, and heareſt the preaching, &amp; if thou be an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lote,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16659:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all is polluted in Gods ſight. Deale all that thou haſt to
the poore; lyeſt thou in harlotrie, all is ſinne. So in a vvord, an
harlot can doe no goode: and if he ſeeme to doe anie good, it
is nothing but ſinne in Gods ſight. Looke then vvhat eſtate an
harlote is in.</p>
               <p>Now to goe forward to the next verſe. He ſets downe the
ſpeciall remedie of this ſinne and vyce, whereby they may
keepe their bodie from this pollution.<note place="margin">Remedie of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> 
                  <hi>That euerie one of you
ſhould knovv hovv to poſſeſſe his veſſell in holineſſe and honour.</hi> The
firſt thing, that is requyred heere, is a ſcience, an habite in doing:
not a light faſſion in doing; a doing, as it vvere, off hand: but,
a ſetled doing, of a ſetled grace in the heart: a craft to poſſeſſe
and to keepe the bodie in holineſſe and godlineſſe. Thou that
vvould keepe thy bodie cleane, thou muſt haue an habite and
ſetledneſse. All thinges, we doe in this life ſhould come of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
habite in the ſoule, of an vſe and ſetled grace in the hart to
doe well: For, as the thing a Craftiſ-man does is of his craft: the
thing a Wright does, is of the ſcience of his craft: ſo, euerie one,
that vvould intende to do vvell muſt haue an habite and a grace
in the heart to doe vvell. And ſpeciallie, he, that vvould keepe
his bodie in cleanneſse, looke, that, he haue a craft of it: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
it may be, he vvill not play the harlote this night, or, that
night, becauſe he hes not the occaſion, but, the firſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
offered, hee ſhall be an harlote. So, all reſolues in this. The
beſt thing in this vvorld to banniſhe ſinne, is, to get an heart
ſetled and ſtabliſhed vvith grace. Get an heart once ſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vvith grace, then, thou ſhalt not be moued, but, thou ſhalt
ſtand faſt in all tentations, and thou ſhalt keepe a ſolide courſe:
Let the Deuill, the vvorlde, and all the enemies of thy ſaluation
vſe all the tentations to dravv thee avvay, thou ſhalt ſtand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable.
And therefore, learne the craft of vvell doing, and
get once the habite in the heart, of vvell doing, and then, vvell
doing ſhall come with ſuch facilitie to thee, that thou ſhalt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
thereat.</p>
               <p>Then, to come to the next words, <hi>That euerie one of you ſhould
knovv hovv to poſſeſſe his veſſell in holineſſe and honour.</hi> He ſayes, <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one.</hi> He exeemes none, neither riche, nor, poore, high, nor,
lovve, but he bindes euerie one, of vvhat ranke ſo euer he be of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16659:92"/>
to the ſcience of poſſeſſing the bodie with cleanneſſe and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Marke it brethren. There are none priuiledged to be an
harlot: not a King, nor Queen, nor Earle, nor Counteſſe, no none
of no eſtate hes this priuiledge, but all are bound to keep the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
cleane; and they who wil exeem themſelues, and thinke their
ranke to be a priuiledge to them, they ſhall exeeme themſelues
alſo from the rank of them who runnes in this rinke to Heauen.
Thou goeſt not ſo ſoone to be an harlote, but thou goeſt out of
the right way, and thou ſhalt neuer come to Heauen that way,
runne as long as thou wilt. Now what ſhould euerie one know?
Euerie one ſhould know to poſſeſſe his veſſell that is, his bodie,
not to be poſſeſſed of the bodie, but to poſſeſſe the bodie; wilt

Alwaies the thing that euerie one ſhould know, is to poſſeſſe.
To ſpeake of this poſſeſſion, it is a common ſaying: it is no leſſe
practick to poſſeſſe a thing after it be gotten, nor to acquire and
conqueſſe it. Yea, I ſay, there is greater practick to poſſeſſe that
well which is gotten, nor to get it. And there are moe in the
world, that can find the way to get it, nor the way to keepe that
which is gotten. But what thing is this they ſhould knowe to
poſſeſſe? There are many poſſeſſions in the world, but among
all poſſeſſions the cheef is, that a man poſſeſſe holilie his body,
which is a veſſell to keepe the ſoule. So the firſt poſſeſſion that
euer one gettes in this world, is his own bodie, and it is the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
poſſeſſion that any man keepes: Thou ſhalt be pulled from
thy heritage, lands, goods and riches; but as for thy bodie, albeit
for a time thou lay it down, yet thou ſhalt take it vp againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
thou ſhalt poſſeſſe it for euer; and it ſhall either be an houſe to
honour, or elſe to diſhonour to thee for euer. And ſo ſeeing this
bodie is the firſt poſſeſſion and the longeſt we haue, therefore
we ſhould be carefull how we poſſeſſe this bodie. Be not ſo
carefull how thou keepeſt and poſſeſſeſt thy land, as how thou
poſſeſſeſt thy bodie. There are ouer many that are ſo carefull to
poſſeſſe their lands, that they forget to poſſeſſe their bodies; and
yet their land ſhall they leaue behinde them. So the cheefeſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:16659:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thing thou ſhouldſt ſeek to poſſeſſe, is thy veſſel thou carieſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with thee.</p>
               <p>But, how ſhould thou poſſeſſe thy veſſell? Firſt, he ſhowes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
what maner they ſhould poſſeſſe it, and then, after what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they ſhould not poſſeſſe it. The maner how to poſſeſſe it is,
<hi>vvith holineſſe and honour.</hi> Fy on thee, thou wilt keepe thy pot, or
thy pan cleane to thy meat, the vylleſt veſſell in thy houſe, thou
wilt keepe it cleane,<note place="margin">Maner of poſſeſſing the veſſell of the bodie.</note> and will haue it waſhen euerie day once;
and yet, thou wilt not be carefull to keep cleane that veſſell, that
keepes thy ſoule. And yet, more. It is not en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cleane, but, thou muſt keep it in honour. There are ſundrie ſort,
of veſſels in an houſe, ſome veſſels to diſhonor, and ſome, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
They that are euen to diſhonour muſt be keeped cleane;
but, they that are to honour, muſt both be keeped cleane and in
honour. Thy bodie, which is the veſſell of thy ſoule, ſhoulde
not be keeped cleane onely, but, in honour alſo: for, it is the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of a honourable ſoule: Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes 1. Cor. 6. 19. <hi>It is the
dvvelling of the holie Spirit:</hi> which is more, nor thy ſoule. Thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is dearer boght, nor al the veſſels in this earth: it is boght with
the precious bloud of Chriſt; fy on thee, who pollutes and defiles
the bodie, which is boght with ſo precious a bloude. Aske ſome
men and ſay to them; why defileſt thou thy bodie? He will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvere,
My bodie is my ovvne. But, I ſay to thee, thy body is not
thy ovvn, it is Chriſts, he hes boght it vvith his precious bloude;
if it be not Chriſts, it is the Deuils, and he ſhall poſſeſſe it in the
end. And therefore, ſeeing, that bodie of thine is the Temple of
the holie Spirit, boght vvith the bloud of Chriſt, keep it in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and honour: and if there were no more to moue thee, but
becauſe it is the veſſell of the ſoule, thou ſhould keepe it holie
and cleane: For, an harlots bodie, as a priuy, ſtincks ſo in the
noſe of the ſoule, that the ſoule ſhall ſay, Lord, if I vvere out of
this ſtinking bodie: O, hovv much more vvill it ſtincke in the
noſe of the Lord. And vvhoſoeuer keepes their bodies cleane,
all that they haue is cleane, their heritage, their moueables and
vnmoueables, all are cleane and honourable; but if thy bodie be
polluted, thou art foull, all is foull: put thy finger to thy meate,
it fyles it; all that goes out of thy body is foull, ſtinking and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted,

               <p>Now to the next verſe, which containes the vvrong vvay of
poſſeſſing thy bodie. The vvordes are. <hi>Not in the luſt of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence.</hi>
There is the vvrong vvay. Weigh the vvordes. <hi>Not
vvith the paſſion.</hi> The vvorde paſſion ſignifies a firy flame,
which breakes out of the bodie, inflamed vvith foull luſtes,
vvhich proceedes from the heart, and ſettes the bodie in a fire.
The luſt beginnes at the heart, and breakes out through the
whole members of the bodie, vvith extreame paſſions, and the
bodie ſo exerciſed, is a ſicke and ſuffering bodie: the bodie of
an harlote is the ſeekeſt bodie that goes; it is brunt vp vvith a
fire within. The thing that is enemie to the bodie is ſickneſse,
and paſſions. And therefore, who euer would poſſeſſe their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
well, they muſt be carefull to keep the bodie from ſickneſse
and paſſions. Novv among all the ſickneſses that can come to
a man, the ſickneſse of foull luſt is the vvorſt and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
ſickneſse: another ſickneſse may well waſte the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of the bodie; but, if thou be ſanctified, the Lorde ſhall
make it a meane to ſanctifie thee: And oft times there vvill
not be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>holier bodie, nor that bodie, that is lying in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
but, this ſickneſſe of luſte, not onely vvaſtes the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the bodie, and dryes it vp; but, it deſtroyes the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and honour thou ſhouldeſt haue: it is an enemie to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.
It is a ſickneſse that vvill neuer ſanctifie thy bodie,
but, deſtroy it; and the longer thou ly in that ſickneſse, the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
and vnholier art thou. This is the nature of the ſickneſſe,
thou ſhalt not onely be conſumed in bodie with ſickneſſe, but,
thou ſhalt loſe thy holineſſe in thy ſoule. And this is a fore
matter. A ſicke man in another ſickneſſe vvill cry to the Lord,
for comfort, but, in the ſickneſſe of harlotrie, he vvill neuer
haue a voice to cry vnto the Lord for mercie, if he repent not.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:16659:93"/>
So abhorre this ſickneſſe, aboue all other ſickneſſes. The Lord
makes all ſickneſſes and deathe to vvorke to the beſt to his
ovvne, but this ſickneſſe deſtroyes the ſoule and the bodie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together.</p>
               <p>Novv to moue men to abhorre this ſickneſſe: He bringes in
the enſample of the Gentiles, and he ſayes, <hi>euen as the Gentiles,
vvho knevv not God.</hi> As he vvoulde ſay, It is a ſhame to you
to be like the Gentiles, among vvhom this foull vyce raigne
firſt. It is ſhame to you, vvho are called to this holineſſe, to
be lyke theſe foull Gentiles: Brethren, a bodie, vvho ſees not
God nor Chriſt, is a prophaine blinded bodie. And he ſeeing
a murtherer, going before him in murther; a thiefe in thiefrie,
he vvill follovv and committe the lyke vvickedneſſe: and ſo the
blinde following the blinde, both falles in the pit together. But
he vvho hes gotten a ſight of God, and a glance of the glorious
face of Ieſus Chriſt, in vvhoſe face, the glorie of that Majeſtie
ſhinnes, vvhen he ſeeth an harlote, he vvill bee ſo farre from
following him, that he will ſcarcelie looke to him, but he vvill
abhorre and deteſt him. For, in the light of the face of God,
that a man ſees in the face of Ieſus Chriſt, as in a faire mirrour,
he will ſee the filthineſſe and foulneſſe of ſinne. None know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
how great a ſinne the ſinne of filthineſſe and blaſphemie,
&amp;c. is, but that ſoule that lookes in the glorious face of Ieſus
Chriſt. That mirrour is ſo faire and glancing, that, looking
thereto, and in it ſeeing the foulneſſe of ſinne, he will be mooued
to hate and deteſt ſinne and darkneſſe. And I ſay, there are none
who are truelie illuminated with the light of God, but the more
they ſee Idolatrie, harlotrie and ſinne, the more they deteſte
them. It will neuer giue me in my mynde, that they who will go

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16659:94"/>
all miſchief, is this darke ignorance in the ſoules of men, they
know no more of God, nor the Gentiles did. Thou who wilt
follovve an harlot knovves no more of God, nor a Pagane, or
Heathen. Yet more I learne heere. The cheef vice that rang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Gentiles, was the vice of luſt. Read the Hiſtories and
ye ſhall finde it to be true. Looke the 1. chap. Rom. There the
Apoſtle ſpeakes of the pollution of the bodie that rang among
the Gentiles.<note place="margin">Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fin of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</note> Will ye looke to murther, it raignes more in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
nor it did there; oppreſſion, falſhood, and ſuch ſinnes raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
more in Scotland nor euer they did among the Gentiles. So
the chiefe ſinne raigning among the Gentiles, was the pollution
of their bodies one with another. Now the ground of this, the
Apoſtle makes the ignorance of God: they ſaw not, nor knew
not God, in Chriſt, and therefore, each one runne, and ſtraue to
pollution. <hi>Paul</hi> Epheſians chap. 4. verſe 18. 19 ſayes. <hi>They had
their mindes darkned, as strangers from the life of God;</hi> the light of
God vvas not in them: the cauſe vvas <hi>throgh ignorance, vvhich
vvas throgh hardneſſe of heart:</hi> and vvhen they had loſt ſenſe and
loſt conſcience too, then, they gaue themſelues <hi>to vvantonneſſe,
and to commit all kinde of vncleanneſſe, and that, vvith all greedineſſe,</hi>
A vvanton bodie is greedie of filthineſſe, it vvill ſvvallovv vp
ſinne, and can neuer be ſatisfied. In the 1. Rom. he telles, the
Gentiles vvere vvilfullie ignorant, they vvould not knovv God,
nor the light. Such vvas the maliciouſneſſe of their heart, they
put out their eies and vvoulde not ſee him; they knevv him in
nature: the Sunne, the Moone, the Heauens, all teſtifies, there is a
God. Yet, the Gentiles, for all that ſight they would not knowe
God: Therefore, the Lord gaue them vp to a reprobat ſenſe, to
follow their owne counſell and their foull affections. So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
telles vs, that, the pollution of the bodie is the plague and
vengence of God, that followes on impietie; it is not onely a
ſinne, but, a puniſhment that followes vpon ſinne. When one
wil not know him, nor heare him, the Lord commonlie plague<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that bodie vvith the ſinne of pollution. It is the plague vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Lord plagues many of the Earles houſes in Scotland:
It is the plague that eates vp men, wyfe and children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all
things that the great men of the land hes: becauſe the Earle, the
Lord, the Laird, the Ladie, they are prophaine, they will not

heare God, nor know him. Therefore, the Lord giues them ouer
to pollution, to be a puniſhment to their bodie. The Lord will a
great deale more plague vs, who haue ſo great a light of God &amp;
knovvledge offred to vs, if we contemne God and his precepts;

               <p>Now, to go forward ſhortly. He hes done with the firſt point
of holineſſe that concernes a man himſelfe, and his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in this rinke: which is to keepe an holie bodie, and ſpecially
from harlotrie: Then, the next is, keepe thy heart and hand from

ouerhaile, or, circumveen another man, <hi>or, defraude his brother, in
any matter.</hi> Why? <hi>The Lord is the auenger of all ſuch things.</hi> Then,
ye ſee the firſt, It is not eneugh to him, that would runne in this
rinke to Heauen, to be cleane one way, but, he muſt be cleane
many waies. There are many who beguyles themſelues, they
thinke, if one vertue be in them, if they haue one grace, that that
one grace will vpſet many vyces and ſinnes. If he be a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Gentle man, and haue a faire behauiour a liberall hand, he
will thinke, what matter, although<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vertue will hide the vyce, and I will be borne with? Who will
beare with thee? Men may well beare with thee, but, God will
not beare with thee. Another man will pride him in abſtinence
and temperatneſſe in mouth, and otherwaies abſtaining from
harlotrie alſo. In the meane time, he will be an oppreſſour and
deceauer; and he will thinke, that this one vertue of temperance
will hide all other vices. No, brethren, the Apoſtle ſayes, 1. Cor.
6. verſe 9. Beguyle not your ſelues. He who ſuyes, the harlote
ſhall neuer inherite the kingdom of God: he ſayes alſo, the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
auaritious man ſhall neuer inherite the kingdome of God.
<hi>Iames</hi> ſayes chap. 2. verſe 10. He who ſinnes in one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
is guiltie of all. Count me all the preceptes of the
commandements ouer; keepe nyne of them, breake the tenth of
them, be a murtherer, or, an harlote; breake one, thou art guiltie
of all: and if thou repent not, thou ſhalt die, as well, as if thou had
broken all. I tell you truelie: if there be a foull affection, or, a
raigning ſinne, which hes dominion ouer the bodie, (as, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſample,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:16659:95"/>
If fornication raigne in thee, if murther raigne in thee)
I cannot ſay thou haſt any ſparke of Regeneration, or true ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification;
thou mayeſt play the hypocrite, thou in vvhom
harlotrie raigneth, thou mayeſt counterfait liberalitie: but, I
ſay, it is no true liberalitie; for if this vyce of harlotrie raigne
and rule in thee, thou art an hypocrite for in him who is truelie
renewed there is no affection in the bodie, but in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
it will be renevved. The vyce may be in thee, but looke
that it raigne not in thee. No, let no man thinke he hes anie
true grace, all are but ſhadovves of grace, if anie ſinne raigne
in thee.</p>
               <p>Now to marke euerie word ſhortlie. <hi>Let no man oppreſſe, or, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumveene
his brother, in any matter.</hi> He exceptes no man. The
Earle, the Lord, the Laird, beleeues his power be giuen him to
ouerhaile, to oppreſſemen. No, no, if thou runneſt ſo, thou ſhalt
neuer win to Heauen. Thou thinkſt the Lord hes ſtrengthned
thy hand to oppreſſe the poore; no, not ſo, no man is exeemed,
looke thou oppreſſe none, or, elſe, renounce the name of Chriſt;
for, thou cannot be an oppreſſour and his member. The word
ſignifies to climme vp vpon a bodie and to tread him downe.
The ſecond thing is, that, they ſhoulde not circumveene, not
by deceite beguyle anie man. The firſt is, that none doe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
The next is, that none deceyue. The one as euill as the
other: and vve ſhall finde as many deſtroyed by deceit, as by
violence; and a faire clocke of juſtice caſten ouer deceite. And
in vvhat thing ſhould they not circumveene? In any manner
of dealling or, trafficking. The Lord, ſo long as it pleaſes him
that we remaine in this worlde, hes appointed a mutuall buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſelling, otherwayes, we could not liue: and he hes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
this buying and ſelling to be ſo, that bothe the parties
winne, the buyer winne, the ſeller-winne and he vvho blockes
aright, and deales vvithin his neighbour; according to the word
of God aright, he vvill not be content to vvinne himſelfe alone,
No, the conſcience of him will ſay, and muſt ſay, I vnderſtand,
as I haue made my ovvne vauntage, ſo ſhoulde my brother
make his vauntage alſo. But, alas, ſuch is our ſelfe loue, that,
vve can neuer thinke, vve get aduauntage, except our brother
get loſſe. Alas this ſin is ouer much vſed in Scotland. The Lord
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:16659:95"/>
amend it. The Lord is the auenger of ſinne. And if in blocking
thou ſeeke not the aduauntage of thy neighbor that blocks with
thee with thy aduantage, thy aduantage ſhall be a curſe to thee,
and thou ſhalt curſſe the time that euer thou got that aduantage.</p>
               <p>Whom ſhould they not deceaue? He ſayes, <hi>a brother.</hi> Thou
ſhouldſt not beguyle any man, neither Turke nor Pagane, much
more ſhouldſt thou beware to beguile a Chriſtian a brother, or
ſiſter: for, I aſſure thee, God will not ſee them wrongde. The
Lord that is thy maſter, he vvill repaire the vvrong. He that is
made a brother to the firſt begotten of the Father, the Lord
vvill not ſee that brother vvrongde. The Apoſtle 1. Corinth.
chap. 6. verſe 8. ſettes dovvne that matter as a great indignitie,
ſaying, Ye doe injurie, ye doe hurt to your brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and them
vvho hes giuen their names to Chriſt, ye ſhame your ſelues
to beguyle your brethren. But to open the matter more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
There are manie conjunctiones the Lorde hes ordained
to be among men, as of bloude, affinity, ciuile ſocietie, &amp;c. and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
one of theſe conjunctiones obliſhes them to do no wrong
to that perſon, with whom they are conjoined. But, when this
Chriſtian conjunction commes in, in our elder brother Chriſt,
when we are all members of one bodie, in one head Chriſt, not
ſundrie bodies, as brethren on earth are; this conjunction aboue
all conjunctiones bindes me and thee to deale truelie in anie
blocke vve haue vvith our brother. So, vvhen thou art dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
vvith anie man, ſay this vvith thy ſelfe, he with vvhom I
deale is my brother, and a member of that bodie of Chriſt,
and therefore, farre be it from me, to deceyue him. Alas, if men
coulde thinke on this, at their blocking, that they vſe to deale
vvith a brother in Chriſt, and member of that bodie, for all
the vvorlde they vvoulde not ſet themſelues to beguile their
brother. Many teſtifies, by their deceite, they are not brethren
in this bodie, for, if they vvere brethren indeed, for all the world
they vvoulde not deceaue them. Novv, there is heere another
thing. I ſee among all conjunctiones that euer hes beene in any
ſocietie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or, conjunction in this earth, the moſt powerfull conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to keep men together in one ſocietie, and mutuall loue and
concord, is this ſpirituall conjunction of vs in the Lord: All the
lawes and conjunctions that euer hes been in any commonwel,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:16659:96"/>
ſince the beginning, are not ſo powerfull to keepe men in ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie,
as this conjunction we haue together in one head. Marke
it. I tell you, if men and wemen be not joined together in one
head, by a ſpirituall vnion, it may be there be a face of vnitie in
the Countrie: but no ſocietie and ſinceritie in loue, except the
Lord be the binder and conjoiner together, no true conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
If Chriſt be not the conjoyner and the binder of the man
with the wife, the father with the ſonne, no true conjunction. I
will not ſay, that that Romane and Grecian Common-well, that
had no part in God through Ieſus Chriſt, had euer any true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
or, ſinceritie in loue. No ſinceritie in concorde, but, that,
that is made vp in Ieſus the Lord: when we runne all in, to be
members of one bodie, and he ſitting and joyning vs altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as peeces of that bodie, then, there will be a ſweete conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
Alas, ye ſee this ſweete harmonie and vnitie is not among
people; yea, alas, among them that profeſſes Chriſtianitie, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
outcaſts, nor among Turkes, The cauſe is, there are manie
and ouer manie, that call themſelues Chriſtians, and takes vpon
them to be in the bodie, that hes no part in Ieſus, and hes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
adoe with him. It is ſhame, that, they ſhould take this name
vpon them: for, it is true, if thou wert a true member of that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
thou wouldſt not ſeuere thy ſelfe from the reſt of the bodie,
by thy murther, oppreſſion, deceit, &amp;c. Theſe homicides and
murtherers does teſtifie, men and wemen are not truelie conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

The reaſon is terrible, and it telles vs, God ſees all, and
teaches vs, that in this rinke to Heauen, if we be not hedged in

God hes appointed faire promiſes to exhort men to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
ſaying Goe forward, thou ſhalt get a faire Crowne: So, on
the other part, knowing faire promiſes will not doe the turne,
he threatens judgements, ſaying. Goe thou out of the way, my
vengence ſhall ouertake thee: yea, he does more, nor this, and
caſts in greater terrors (he knowes, that, wordes will not doe

and in the ſight of the world, he will teare him in peeces, and let
men ſee, that the vengence of God followes on ſin and wil ſtrike
him with ſuch a ſodaine death, that men will feare to doe the
like. We ſee daily ſuch experience of Gods judgements: whiles
he vvill take an oppreſſour, vvho hes oppreſſed men in this
world, and wil tred on him with his feet, to terrifie the world,
and this is his daily doing in this world. Now, taking this man,
and that woman, now and then puniſhing them, to let the world
ſee, that, puniſhment is for ſinne, and ſin craues judgement: yea,
and let them ſee, there is a day of judgement comming, when
he wil tak ſoule and bodie and caſt them into hel. For, theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
judgements, are but as many tokens, to tell vs, there is a
day comming, when all oddes ſhall be made euen. When ye ſee
a man plagued temporallie, ſtand not there, but thinke on the

and after that large congratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein he rejoiſed for the grace the
Lord had beſtowed on the Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
not after a common manner, but in
great aboundance. He ſets downe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes
of manners, concerning an holie
lyfe, and a godlie conuerſation in this
worlde, and he comprehendes them all, firſt in a generall, and
he calles it ſanctification, holineſſe in lyfe and conuerſation,
for whatſoeuer duetie appertaines to vs to be done in this lyfe,
the whole may be taken vp vnder this one word, <hi>ſanctification,</hi>
which ſtandes in holineſſe in ſoule and bodie. When he hes
ſette downe the generall, he diuydes it in parts, and the firſt part
of ſanctification, of holineſſe of lyfe and conuerſation, he takes
it vp to be in abſteining from fornication, it reſpects a man, or

bodie that God hes giuen them, in holineſſe, vnpolluted vvith
filthineſſe. The ſecond part concernes our neighbour, that we
doe him no wrong: He is an vnholie man that hurtes his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
that vvill vvrong him in anie dealling or trafficking
with him. He is hurt two manner of wayes: firſt, he is hurt by
deceite, vnder colour, by fraude, beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yling or circumvention
He is ſecondlie hurt by plaine violence and oppreſſion. Both
theſe two ſortes of wronges and injuries are vnholie: He that
circumueenes his brother is vnholie, he that oppreſſes his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is vnholie. Novve to perſvvade them to this ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſtanding in theſe tvvo partes, he vſes ſundrie argumentes.
The firſt argument ye heard of before, vvas from the vvill of
God. This is the will of God (ſayes he) your ſanctification. It
is the Lords vvill that ye be holie. It is not an hid vvill, but a
reuealed will and oft reuealed, that ye be holie in your ſelfe,
holie in reſpect of your brethren, and holie all manner of vvaye.
Brethren, if there vvere not an argument to moue vs to be holy,
holie in reſpect of our ſelues, holie in reſpect of our neighbour,
this onely reaſon, to vnderſtand it is Gods will we ſo doe, may
be ſufficient. For, albeit we knovve of no other reaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vve ſhould be holie, but onely that it is his vvill, it bindes
vs to holineſſe. For, this reuerence tovvarde the Creator, and
Redeemer of the world, ſhould be in euerie creature, that they
vnderſtanding anie thing to bee agreable to his holie vvill,
ſhould ſtoup: knovving his will, they are bound to acquieſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
and reſt there, ſeeking no farther, and to cloſe their eyes at all
their reaſones; hovvbeit the thing that is injoyned to them,
ſhould ſeeme to be an impoſſibilitie. The Apoſtle ſpeaking
of his vvill Roman. chap. 12. verſe 2. ſayes, His vvill is euer
goode; it is good vvhat euer he vvilleth, it is perfite, yea, it is the
rule of all righteouſneſſe. So euerie one ſhould reaſon vvith
themſelues. Is it the vvill of God? Then it is moſt juſt. I vvill
follovve and obey it, my reaſon ſhall not ſtay it, my reaſon is
vvrong and out of rule, his vvill is the rule of righteouſneſſe.
I inſiſt on this rather, becauſe I knovve how hard it is to make
the vvill of man plyable, and to frame it to Gods vvill: and
vvhat diſcrepance is betvveene the vvill of God, and the vvill
of man. So if thou giueſt thy ſelfe ouer to thy ovvne nature,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16659:98"/>
there is nothing God willes, but thou willeſt the contrare therof.
And therfore our praier ſhould be continually to God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
our froward will to his wil: this ſhould be our praier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie,
what euer come to vs, be it proſperitie, or aduerſitie:
Lord do thy will, &amp; giue me not my own will; for, if I get my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wn
wil, it will be my wreak; but, Lord, rule my will according to
thy will, for thy will is onely the right will, and the preſeruer of
my life, and euen now while we haue time, we ſhould cry, Lord,
thy will be done: we are thy creatures, Lord let thy will be done
in vs. And, I aſſure thee, if thou get thy will conformable to his
wil, and be content with any thing he layes on thee, life or death,
certainly thou ſhalt find comfort, &amp; all ſhall come well to thee.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument taine from the vengence that falles on
the tranſgreſſours. He ſaies, <hi>For the Lord is the auenger of al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſuch
thinges.</hi> He auenges the deceit vſed by vs, and the violence done
againſt our neighbour. This ſecond argument followes well on
the other; for, one of thoſe two muſt be, either the will of God
muſt be done by vs or elſe vengence muſt be for diſobedience.
If the will of God moue thee not to doe that which he craues of
thee,<note place="margin">Puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to gods vvill.</note> to liue in holineſſe before him; let the feare of vengence
and puniſhment moue thee. For, Brethren, the will of our God,
is, in the ſelfe, a thing ſo holie and inuiolable, that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
perſon yet, that diſobeyed that will, from ould <hi>Adam</hi> to this
houre, if it were but in a litle thoght of the heart, let be a deed, in
a motion of the ſoule, let be an action, but that diſobedience and
tranſgreſſion of that holie and inuiolable will of God was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
either in the perſons ſelf, or in the Mediator Ieſus Chriſt.
So inuiolable a thing is the juſt will of God, that the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to it cannot eſcape puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. God is not like man, impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
it is that thy diſobedience to him, (if it were but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or ſoule, or elſe thou muſt haue refuge to the Mediator, and it
ſhall be puniſhed in him. For, if thou be in Chriſt, thy diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is taine away in his obedience. And therefore thinke it
no childiſh play, to play with his will, if it were but the leaſt

ye finde in thoſe who ſpeakes in the name of the Lord, (they
will denounce once, twyſe, and thryſe that ſame judgement) tels

is in God himſelfe. The Lord is conſtant in his vengence on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
ſinners, he alters not, howbeit he delay the vengence
vnto his appointed tyme, yet the vengence ſtandes faſt: he is not
like man. Man is changeable, he will brag the night, and ſay, I
will be auenged, to morrow all is away. Man is vaine and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
the Lord is an vnchangeable God, he will perſeuere with
an vnchangeable mynde to vengence. Of this it commes, that
thoſe whom he ſendes to denounce vengence in his name, will
preache vengence to them this day, vengence the next day, and
ay will tell you, the Lord will be once auenged on you. The
Lord will auenge thy harlotrie, thy deceit, thy oppreſſion, and
ay conſtantly cry on. to let you ſee, the judgements bides on the
impenitent ſinner, he will not change his ſentence for all the
vvorld: If God vvere changing, ye vvho ſpeakes in his name
would change, and he wold not haue warrand in his conſcience
to ſpeake conſtantlie: but, God being conſtant and vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in his purpoſe, of neceſſitie the preacher muſt be conſtant,
And it hes not beene ſeene of before, but the conſtancie in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
vengence by the ſeruants of God againſt impenitent
people, hes euer been juſtified with a ſenſible judgement, &amp; the
vengence they threatned conſtantly, it lighted. Now, brethren.
we neede not to goe far off for enſamples. This conſtancie in
threatning hes beene oft vſed in Edinburgh. This hes beene oft
tolde you: if this be not amended, the famine, the Peſtilence ſhall
ouertake this Cittie. Now judge ye this day, if the effect juſtifies
not our ſaying. It is follie to men to thinke, that one word of
threatning of judgement ſpoken by the true ſeruants of God,
will fall to the ground: no it cannot be The Lord may well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay

judgement, then followes the heauy judgement. And therefore
we ſhold judge holilie of the truth that hes been ſpoken by the
mouth of his ſeruants, and glorifie God al maner of wayes, count
God to be true, and let all men be lyers.</p>
               <p>In the next verſe, we haue the thirde argument, to moue them
to holineſſe. The argument is taken from their calling; <hi>For, God
hes not called vs to vncleanneſſe, but, to holineſſe.</hi> This calling is our
chriſtian calling, whereby we are tranſlated out of the kingdom
of darkneſſe, to the kingdom of Ieſus Chriſt: we are called out of
Hel, to Heauen: from darkneſſe, to light: we are called to a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and glorie prepared for vs. Now, he reaſons from this their
calling.<note place="margin">Our chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhold moue vs to holines.</note> This calling is not to vncleanneſſe, to be an harlot, to be
a deceiuer of thy brother, to be an oppreſſor, but, thou art called
to be an holy and a clean perſon: thou was called out of the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the world, and tranſlated to cleanneſſe; therefore, thy
calling is holie. Of all the callings in this earth, the faireſt calling
is the calling of one to holineſſe. The calling to an earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is not ſo faire, as the calling of a man to holineſſe. This
Chriſtian holineſſe, it permittes no ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t of vncleanneſſe in this
world, no, not ſo much, as a foull thought: but, it craues of him,
who is called to this Chriſtian vocation all kinde of cleanneſſe
in the world. Learne euer to diſtinguiſh betweene thy own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and this faire calling of Chriſtianitie. If thou be vncleane
and filthie, it commes not of this Chriſtian calling, but, of thy
own perſon. And therefore: let no man, when he ſees a man, or,
woman, that keepes that name, and enjoyes that calling to be
called a Chriſtian (the faireſt name, that euer man gotte) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an harlote, an oppreſſour, a deceyuer, a murtherer: lay
not the fault on the holie calling, but, on the foull perſon, that
is vnvvorthie of the calling, for, he is but a vyle creature, that
is ſo called. That Chriſtian calling permittes not ſuch vyle
ſinnes: it is the vyle perſon, that committes this ſinne. This
hes beene an oulde cuſtome. When men ſees theſe men, vvho
profeſſes Chriſtianitie, fall in ſinne, the mouthes of the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are openned to blaſpheme that vocation of Chriſtianitie, and
to ſay, Take vp your Chriſtian and holie man now, there is
your puritie, that, ye doe now profeſſe; and ſo, the blame is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
more laid on the calling, and not on the perſon. The
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:16659:99"/>
Prophete ſayes, Through you, my name is reproached among
the Gentiles. Eſay chap 25. verſe 5. Take head to this. When
thou, vvho art called, committes anie ſinne, wicked men vvill
lay the faulte on the calling, and not on the perſon: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
be carefull, to keepe holie thy perſon, that thy perſon be
not a ſlander to thy holie calling. I tell thee, harlotrie is a great
ſinne, indeede, that offendes God; but, the exponing of this
Chriſtian calling, to be euill ſpoken of, is a greater ſinne, to
thee, nor harlotrie, murther, or, anie other ſinne, that can be
commited, and at that day, it ſhall be ſorer puniſhed, nor any
ſinne. There cannot be a greater ſinne, nor to giue wicked
men occaſion to ſpeake euill of that holy calling. And trow
ye not, that this ſinne is the ſpeciall cauſe of this judgement this
day? It is not ſomuch thy murther, thy harlotrie, thy oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
&amp;c. as the ſlandering of thy holy vocation and calling:
And therfore hes Scotland moſt juſtlie procured the juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God.</p>
               <p>Another thing I ſee heere: I perceiue this Chriſtian calling
ſhould be the rule and ſquare, whereby our actiones ſhould be
rewled. So, that, in no calling vnder the Sunne, we ſhould do any
thing, that is vnſetting, or, vnſeemlie to this Chriſtian calling:
but, all our actiones ſhould bee ruled conforme to it. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
King is bounde to rule all his actiones, by the rule of this
Chriſtian calling: a Chriſtian ſubject ſhould follow the rule of
this chriſtian calling. Play the marchant, but, as a Chriſtian man:
play the part of a man of law, but, in the meane time, forget not,
thou art a Chriſtian man, &amp;c. Let al thy actions in thy own craft
be ſquared by this rule of thy Chriſtian vocation. There is a
great aduantage: when any man in any vocation behaues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
as a Chriſtian man, the labour is pleaſant in the ſight of
God, and it is bleſſed. If a Chriſtian man ſeeke the glorie of
God in his calling, then, he ſhall be bleſſed in his actiones: but,
when in doing any thing, the Chriſtian calling is forgot. and the
Lord Ieſus is not before the eye of a man, then, the action is
vnholie, yea, howbeit otherwayes it be lawfull: if the doer, in
doing, doe not vvith a Chriſtian heart, reſpecting the glorie of
God and Ieſus Chriſt and haue no regard of his calling in Ieſus,
it is vnholie: and what euer is done, without hauing Chriſt, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:16659:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a reſpect to Gods glorie in Chriſt, before thee, it is vncleane.
What euer ye doe, whither ye eate, or, drinke doe all to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of God, otherwayes, all is ſinne. Brethren, ſeeing we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to a kingdome, why ſhould we doe any thing, that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvorthie
of ſo glorious a calling? It vvould ſeeme to ſome, that
this Chriſtian calling bound the hands of men, that they cannot
vſe their calling, with ſuch libertie, as they would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is not a
new calumnie. I anſwere. This Chriſtian calling binds thy hand
from doing any thing, that is vnlawfull, and againſt the vvill of
God. It cloſes thy hand, that thou doe no vvrong. Thou vvho
woulde be an harlot, it bindes thee, that thou be not an hatlo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſo, the oppreſſor, it bindes him, that he oppreſſe not, and in the
day of Iudgement, it will ſtand vp, as a witneſſe againſt him,
that he was not worthie of that calling. But, as to any calling on
earth, as, to be a King, to be a ſubject, it will not ſtay thee to doe
thy exerciſe, but, giues libertie to thee to doe and bleſſes thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſquares all thy actiones to thee, and makes thee holie.
This chriſtian calling neuer hindred a man to do any thing, that
was lawfull, but, lowſed his handes to doe all good thinges, and
ſanctified all his actiones. Therefore, the Apoſtle 1. Cor. chap. 7
verſe 20 ſayes, <hi>Let euerie man, that is called, abyde in that vocation,
he is called to.</hi> Is he a King? Let him byde ſtill and be a King, and
doe all the actions, that concernes a King, chriſtianlie. Is he a
ſubject? Let him doe all the actiones pertaining to a ſubject.
Whereby he meanes, that, this Chriſtian calling ſtayes no man
in his lawfull calling, but, ſanctifies it to him.</p>
               <p>He ſayes, we are called to ſanctification, not to vncleanneſſe,
Ye ſee the end of this calling is, to be holie and cleane. All graces
ſpirituall, and all bleſſinges of God in Ieſus Chriſt, ſerues to this
end, to make vs holie. We (ſayes the Apoſtle) are choſen, that
we ſhould be holie. Epheſ 1. 4. The end of our vocation, is clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and holineſſe.<note place="margin">Holineſſe the end of all ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al graces.</note> Lykewiſe, we are juſtified in the bloud of
Ieſus. to this end, that we may be holie, and renewed againe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Image of God, which we loſt in the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
And therefore, the end of our clectiona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cere is holineſſe. What
meanes this preaching and hearing, but to make thee holy and
cleane. Our juſtification, our ſanctification, &amp;c. ſerues all to this
end, that we ſhould be renewed againe to holineſſe. So, in one
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:16659:100"/>
word: The happineſſe of man ſtandes cheeflie in holineſſe, if
thou be happie, be cleane and holie; for, we count happineſſe to
ſtand in the end. So, the man that is cleane in ſoule and bodie,
that is the happie man. And by the contrare, the foull adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
an vnhappie bodie: a murtherer, an vnhappie bodie, &amp;c.
And where holineſſe is, I cannot ſay, that, there wants a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
Art thou vnholie in lyfe, and will tell me of election, that
thou art choſen to lyfe, before all eternity? I ſee no warrand thou

ſay, thou art happie, thou haſt onely the bare name of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.
Art thou vnholie? What warrand haſt thou, to ſay, thou
art called, thou art juſtified in the bloud of Chriſt? Vocation,
Juſtification are to holineſſe. So, lackeſt thou holineſſe? What
token haſt thou of thy happineſſe? So, the end of all, of thy ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
of thy vocation, of thy juſtification, of thy ſanctification,
is holineſſe: and according to this, try thy ſelfe, and judge of the
thinges going before: It is a vaine thing to thee, to liue lyke a
dog in this world, and then, to boaſt thy ſelfe of thy election,
juſtification &amp;c. Now, thou is as far from Heauen, as a dogge,

in thee.</p>
               <p>He ſayes not ſimplie, we are called to ſanctification. But he
ſayes, <hi>God hes called vs.</hi> There is a great motiue to holineſſe: it is
God, who called vs. So, there are two thinges in this verſe, that
ſhould moue vs to holineſſe. The firſt, our calling, which is to
holineſſe:<note place="margin">God the caller a great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</note> the ſecond, the caller. It is God, that calles vs. The
worthines of ſuch a perſon, as hes called vs, hes no ſmall weight
and moment, to moue vs. The glorious God calles on vs, and
ſtraynes himſelfe to ſpeake to vs, with his owne mouth. If any
King ſhould call a man to any thing no doubt, the man would
thinke himſelfe bound to obey, not onelie for the commoditie,
he would get, by obeying that calling; but, alſo, becauſe of the
perſonage of him, that hes called him. whom he is bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey:
So, then, if it be a ſinne, not to obey a glorious perſonage on
the earth, when he calles: how great ſinne is it, not to obey the
Son of God, when he calles thee to holineſſe? Brethren, thinke
of Gods calling and of his perſon, who hath called you, as you
wil, this is moſt ſure, When God calles thee to holineſſe, it is
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:16659:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
impoſſible, but, that calling muſt be effectuall in you, either one
way, or, other; and that, in reſpect of the caller. No, that glorious
perſon cannot open his mouth in vaine, for, Gods word muſt
take effect. No word euer came out of his mouth, but it hes the
ful effect. When he cals thee to be holie, thou muſt be holie, and
his word muſt mak thee holie: when he cals on thee being dead,
to liue again, his word muſt work life in thee and quicken thee:
or, elſe, when he cals on thee to be holie, if he make thee not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
by his word, be aſſured, that word ſhall ſlay thee. If thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
him not calling on thee, in holines of life &amp; conuerſation,
thou ſhalt periſh in filthines eternalie. And all ye, to whom this
word ſounds daylie, calling you to holines: (for, all our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is it, but, to call men from wickednes &amp; vncleannes, to
holines? the murtherer, from his murther; the adulterer, from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie;)
I ſay to thee, if this word calling thee to holines, be not
effectuall in thee, and draw thee not out of the vyle ſinne thou
lyes in, to holines, certainlie, it ſhall ſlay thee, and bring damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on thee: all this preaching ſhall bring on thee the heauy
judgement and vengeance of God. And yee all, vvho heares

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this day, if your conſciences challenges you of anie vice; I
call you now by the word of God, from that wickednes: and I
pronounce, if ye come not out of this wickednes, in reſpect of
this worde, that calles, and God, that is calling on you; his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
ſhall ſeaſe vpon you. And now, it is no time to thee to ly
in vncleannes, when the Peſt is at the doore: woe to thee dying
therein being in the puddle of vncleannes, but, well is thy ſoule,
that turnes to God, howbeit thou die in the peſt of the body.</p>
               <p>Now followes another argument, to moue vs to holines. He
who wil not be holie, when God calles on him, <hi>diſobeyes not man,
but, God.</hi> As there are two thinges, to moue vs to holineſſe, firſt
our vocation to holineſſe; ſecoundlie, the caller: ſo, there are
two ſinnes, that accompanies the diſobedience of that calling:
one ſinne, againſt the holie calling; another ſinne, againſt the
holie God the caller.<note place="margin">Conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of God &amp; the vvord, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſinne.</note> There is no ſinne by the ſelfe allone: One
ſinne muſt euer haue another with it, and committing one ſinne,
we ſinne manie waies. Compare theſe two, the ſinne againſt the
calling, and the ſinne againſt the caller; by all appearance the
ſecound is the greateſt. The greateſt ſinne, that can bee, is, to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16659:101"/>
contemne God. Thou that playeſt the harlote, thy ſinne is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
firſt by thy harlotrie thou ſinneſt againſt thy calling thou
was called to: and this is a great ſinne; but the other is greater:
Thou contemneſt the voyce of the high Majeſtie of God that
called thee. The oppreſſor ſinnes by his oppreſſion, but his ſin
is the greater in that he contemnes his caller. And in the latter
day ye ſhall finde by experience, the challenge ſhall not be ſo
much againſt the adulterer, for his adulterie, as, for that, in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
he contemned the voyce of God calling him from adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.
This ſhall be a chiefe challenge &amp; dirtlay, eſpecially, of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
who hes heard this word and Goſpell of God, that, they
contemnd the majeſtie of God, who called them by this word &amp;
Goſpell. And ſurely all theſe particular judgements of God, that
falles on men and theſe particular judgements on Scotland, and
on Edinburgh this day, either the Peſt or the famine fals not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
for vncleanneſſe and other ſins, as for the contemp of the
Goſpel, and God that calles thee by this baſe miniſtrie. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
the right cauſe of all theſe judgements, is the contempt of
God calling vs to holineſſe: For we haue not onelie ſinned in
committing of ſin, but in contemning God calling vs from ſin,
and we haue ſpitted, as it wer in his face. Put away the contempt
of the word of God, if ye put it away, who wait but but God wil
be mercifull? If we contemne ſtill, looke for greater judgement.
The contempt of God and of this foode of the ſoule offred by
the baſe miniſtrie, hes cauſed this plague of famine and the Peſt
fall on this land. The Apoſtle ſayes, In reſiſting, ye reſiſt not
men, but God. There is no bleſſing in tyme that God giues but
he miniſters it by men He wil not come out of Heauen to ſpeak
to thee but he will ſpeak to thee by the miniſtrie of ſelie ſimple
men. He tels thee of remiſſion of ſins, of juſtification, of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
&amp;c. &amp; if thou diſpiſe the miniſtry of baſe men, though thou
wer Monarch of all the earth, thou ſhalt neuer get remiſſion of
ſinnes, ſanctification nor glorification. Now this is the thing
that beguyles the world: When they looke to the vyle mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie
of men, they cannot ſee God in it. They looke to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
man; they goe no farther. Who ſpeakes? A ſelie man ſpeakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Who calles me? I heard a ſelie man, and ſo through the man be
looks not vp to heauen, to ſe God ſpeaking by, the miniſter. And
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:16659:102"/>
from this flowes the contempt: and reſiſting man, thou reſiſts
God that is the principall worker. The word is then contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
when the man is contemned in ſpeaking it. Reſiſting man,
thou reſiſts God who ſent the man. Can any man reſiſt God,
and not be plagued therefore, if there be no repentance? So they
who are called to the miniſtrie, let them care for nothing but to
ſpeake the word of God, and open their mouth to glorify God:
And if he be reſiſted, he is not reſiſted, but God who ſent him,
is reſiſted. And at that laſt day it ſhall be ſeene it was not man
thou reſiſted, but God. Happie are they therefore who gettes
a ſight of this in tyme, and that giues obedience to the worde.
Happie is the bodie that receiues this word, as the word of god,
and not of man.</p>
               <p>Now the laſt argument followes, Who, ſaies he, <hi>hes giuen vs his
holy Spirite.</hi> Looke now what he hes done: He hes choſen vs
from all eternitie to be holielie and hes giuen vs his Spirit, and al
graces to this end to be holy. When the Lord hes begun to call
vs to holineſſe,<note place="margin">Spirite of god d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling in vs bindes to holineſſe.</note> if he ſtand there, and doe no more, it will not doe
the turne: if he giue vs ouer to our owne nature and free vvill,
and take away his Spirit when he hes broght thee on a point of
holineſſe and leaue thee there, thou ſhalt neuer enter in Heauen.
And therefore when he hes done all theſe thinges to thee, then
he will put into thy ſoule and bodie his Spirit of grace to cleanſe
the foulneſſe out of thy ſoule and bodie: to bring in holie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
actions and ſpeeches; So that thou art made now (as <hi>Paul</hi>
ſpeakes 1. Corint. 6. 19.) the Temple of the holie Spirit, and then
that ſame glorious perſon the holie Spirit, comming from the
Father and the Son, will dwell within thee in ſoule and bodie,
as aſſuredlie as we are within this Church preſentlie; and thy
ſoule and bodie ſhall be as ſure Temples of this Spirit, as this
Church is to our bodies. And is not this a great honour that in
ſubſtance this glorious perſon will dwell within vs? So this
learnes vs, that all is of grace the beginnig of grace, the midſt
of grace, the end of grace. Our predeſtination in God, our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
our juſtification and ſanctification, all in God, our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification
in God. Brethren the higheſt eſtate we can come to in
this life is ſanctification. We paſſe from predeſtination to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
from vocation to juſtification, from juſtification to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16659:102"/>
we cannot reach higher ſo long as we are heere. We
may growe in this eſtate but we cannot come higher. As to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification,
we get it in the lyfe to come when we leaue this life.
All our actiones heere are imperſite, and all mingled with the
corruption of nature, but heereafter all will be perfited. For
when we leaue this lyfe, we goe not backward, Thinke not that
bodie that ſleepes in Chriſt, that he goes backward. That body
is predeſtinat, called ſanctified heere in ſome meaſure, after this
life paſſes a degree vpward, and commes to glorification: for
holineſſe in this life, it paſſes vp to glorie: we are holie heere,
but glorious in the life to come: We are not called to be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this lyfe, but to be ſanctified: when we end our life in Ieſus
Chriſt we paſſe vp to a wonderfull glorie. Now how comes
this glorie? Comes it on any thing we haue done heere in earth?
Comes it of our workes or merites? No, as holineſſe in this life
comes of the free mercie of God in Chriſt; ſo the crowne of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in that life onelie comes of the mercie of God in Chriſt. We
ſhall be glorified in Heauen, but hovv? Through the grace of
God that he will giue vs in Chriſt. And as the crowne of glorie
ſhall be giuen vs of free grace, ſo the ſtanding in that eſtate of
glory ſhall indure for euer of grace. So all comes of grace. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance
of holineſſe in this lyfe, is onely by the grace of God.
All perſeuerance in glorie in the life to come of grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
nothing in earth nothing in Heauen, but free grace in mercy.
Wherefore is this the Lord will haue nothing in Heauen nor
earth, but mercie? To this end, that all the glorie of our ſaluation
may be giuen to him: and he that glories in it ſhould glorifie
him. Grace, free mercie, onely in him. And let this be our ſong
on earth, vvhen vve ſpeake of the grace of God on earth
Glorie to God, mercie to vs onelie in God The Lord
giue vs grace that we may giue al and the onely
praiſe of mercie and of glorie in this life,
and in the life to come. To this God
with the Son and the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
be immortall praiſe
and glorie foreuer.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle, brethren, after hee hes ſet
downe his general exhortation to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and holineſſe. This is the will of
God, ſayes he, euen your ſanctification:
that ye be holie in ſoule, holie in bodie, &amp;
holie in all your actions, within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
He diſcends and comes to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culare
parts of this generall exhortation.
The firſt part of it reſpects a man or vvoman in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that they keepe their perſon to God, as the veſſell of honor:
keepe it from fornication which is a ſinne that eſpeciallie and in
the higheſt degree fyles the perſon of a man, both in bodie and
ſoule, which ſhould be keeped in holineſſe to God who made it.
The next part of this ſanctification concernes our brother, our
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:16659:103"/>
neighbour; that wee doe no wronge, nor oppreſſe him by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
we circumvene him not by fraude and guile in buſineſſe
concerning this life, but in all affaires we be as carefull he haue
aduantage, as we are that our ſelues haue aduantage. When thou
art onelie ſet to make vantage to thy ſelfe by thy own ſelfe loue,
that aduantage is wrong. We heard the arguments the Apoſtle
vſes to moue them to this: Firſt, the will of God. If the will of
God will not moue thee from harlotrie, from doing euill vnto
thy neighbour, let the vengeance of God moue thee, (for that is
the ſecond argument,) and it ſhall ouertake thee in the end, if
thou continue therein. Then he came to that holie and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
calling, that ſhould moue vs to liue holie. We are called to
be holie; let vs keepe therefore our owne perſon holie; let vs be
holie to our brother; let vs be holie in our hand, holie in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
Then he goes forward to another argument. He that
will not be holie when he is called by man, he ſaies, it is not with
man he hes adoe, but with God. It is God that bids thee keepe
thy bodie cleane from harlotrie, thy hand from wrong: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou diſobeying, thou diſobeyes not man, but God. What
is it to diſobey me or him that ſpeakes? It is that great God that
thou rebelleſt againſt, and in that great day thou ſhalt be chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
as a rebell to that great God. Theſe argumentes are all
ſet downe to this end, to moue vs to holineſſe. Then at laſt in the
end of the laſt verſe, he caſtes to an argument from the holie
Spirite giuen vs by God, to this end. Getſt thou the holie Spirit,
to play the harlote? getſt thou that holy Spirite, that glorious
gift, the third perſon of the glorious Trinitie, dwelling in thee,
as in a Temple, to the effect thou ſhouldſt commit filthineſſe?
No, as all things obliſhes thee to be holie ſo eſpeciallie the holie
Spirite of God dwelling within thee (crauing an holie Temple)
craues holineſſe: otherwayes with thy filthineſſe thou ſhalt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludge
him and anger him, vntill at laſt he ſhall depart from thee,
and then that foull ſpirit of wickedneſſe ſhall poſſeſſe thee.</p>
               <p>Nowe to come to the text. In the firſt part thereof he goes
forward to another particulare part of this ſanctification, which
is brotherlie loue. So the third part of this ſanctification ſtands
in brotherlie loue, called beneficience and liberalitie to thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
a grace and vertue crauing an open hand, to beſtow on the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16659:104"/>
neceſſitie of thy brooher. So when he hes exhorted not to doe
wrong to thy neighbour, not to oppreſſe him by violence, or
ſurpriſe him by deceite: then he exhorts that thou be beneficiall
to him, liberall to him, to ſupport his want and neceſſitie. Hee
ſayes then, <hi>But as concerning brotherlie loue</hi> (bountifulnes towards
thy brother) <hi>ye neede not that I vvrite vnto yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

What need haue I who am a man to be ouer diligent in teaching
outwardlie, when God is the inward teacher of you; and when
he teaches this point of doctrin in ſpecial, to loue euerie one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?
Ther is the ſubſtance of the firſt words. Now to obſerue
ſomething on the wordes. Ye ſee it is not eneugh not to do euil,
but true ſanctification craues that we do good alſo <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

craues that we benefite him, we beſtowe on him a goode

of this which we call ſanctification, holines of life, (that are as

                  <hi>I need not,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>teach you, the holy ſpirit hes taught you all thinges,</hi>
and in the mean time he is teaching them continually; yet when

when he is making a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of the grace in them, he ſaies,
it is not needful to exhort you to the grace, ye haue a better tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
nor I,<note place="margin">Teaching of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirite.</note> God teaches you; therfore I need not to teach you: the
Lord teaches you by working in your harts by his holy Spirit,
what needs me to teach you by my pen? Brethren. Ther are two
ſortes of teachers, God and man. Men teaches, Philoſophers in
ſchooles teaches, Miniſters out of pulpets teaches, many ſorts of
teachers. If man be the onely teacher of grace and vertue to be
embraced by the auditor, and if Gods Spirit ſhould not concur
inwardly to inſtruct the ſoule and heart, there would neuer be a
good ſcholler in the ſchoole of chriſt; none of you to the worlds
end would get good by teaching. It may be men teaching thee
vvill informe thy minde, and make thee to vnderſtand vvhat is
ſpoken: but man can neuer teach the hart, that is, to embrace that
is ſpoken: no it will paſſe mans power to reforme the hart: if the
holy ſpirit moue thee not to embrace that which is ſpoken, thou
wilt neuer embrace it, for all that man can ſay. As for example.
I may ſtand vp and lay out before you this whole grace of libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie
and beneficence, and paint it out in all the colours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and make you vnderſtand this whole vertue in all the parts:
But when it commes to the heart to be practiſed in your life and
conuerſation, if the holy Spirit go not down to reforme the hart,
ye ſhall neuer be the better, but the worſe, for the knowledge
ſhal but ſerue to aggreadge your condemnation. Then be neuer
content with the voice of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but euer cry for the inward do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
the Spirit of God from Heauen. And ſay, Lord come with
this word, and teach my heart, otherwaies, all is but winde, and
ſhall be an aggreading of my condemnation at the laſt day: It
is thou Lord who is the onely inward teacher, and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thou teach me, I ſhall not be taught. So except that holie
teacher be with vs in teaching all is but loſt tyme.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the wordes. What is this the Lord craues of
them? what teaches the Lord them? <hi>that euerie one ſhould loue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
He teaches not onely loue, but loue that meetes loue; he
will not teache thee onely to loue him, but him to loue thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:16659:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This is mutuall loue. As he teaches thee to loue me, ſo he
teaches me to loue thee.<note place="margin">loue muſt be mutual.</note> Friendſhip ſtandes not in the one ſide,
but friendſhip muſt be conjoyned to friendſhip. There is no
bond in that bleſſed bodie of Chriſt, except there be a mutuall
bond: if I loue thee neuer ſo well, if thou loue not me, thou ſhalt
neuer be in the bodie: For as the reſt of the members of Chriſt
loues thee, ſo thou muſt loue them againe, or elſe thou haſt no
fellowſhip in the bodie. Marke the order which the Apoſtle v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in teaching. When he inſtructes men in any grace (there are
ſome fundamentall graces that are ſo called, becauſe they are the
grounds of al graces, to wit Faith, Hope and Charitie: firſt Faith,
then Hope and Charitie, then followes al other graces on them.)
When God inſtructs a man in any grace, he firſt layes down this
fundamentall grace, and teaches him to loue, then he buildes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
grace vpon it, and puts on liberalitie on it, and biddes thee
bee beneficiall: firſt he biddes him loue, and then hee biddes
him be beneficiall. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Corinth. chap. 13. verſe 3.
Speaking of that ſame grace of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, ſaies, <hi>If I ſhould take
all my ſubſtance and deale it to the poore,</hi> if this liberalitie come
not from the heart and proceed <hi>not from loue, it auailes nothing.</hi>
Giue all that thou vvilt giue, if thou loue not the perſon thou
gueſt it to, thou haſt loſt thy thankes at Gods handes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in teaching liberalitie, that thy beneficence may turne to
thy ſelfe, and doe thee good, as it does to another man, he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
thee loue: For if my gift redound not to my owne well, woe
is me. Then the vvay to get goode of the gift thou giueſt, is
to loue him thou giueſt it to. The Philoſopher he teaches the
childe vertue, but as for loue he cannot worke it. He will teache
thee liberality and deſcriue it to thee, but as for the hart he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
inſtruct it. It is the Lord that teaches this fundamentall
grace of Charitie, without the which, all thy doinges are as an
houſe builded without good ground.</p>
               <p>In the next verſe, he proues that they are all taught of God
by their doinges. <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>and that thing verelie ye doe to all
the brethren, that are in Macedonia.</hi> Ye are not ſpeakers and brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
but, doers; it is not ſpeaking, that wil do the turne, but, doing
beneficence muſt be in the hand and not in the mouth. This age
is full of talke, as euer any age was, and all our goodneſſe is only
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16659:106"/>
in our mouth and tongue, our faith in our mouth, our charitie in
our mouth, our liberalitie in our mouth; little in heart, as little in
hand, nothing in action. Take head. All this teſtifies, for all the
doctrin and preaching of the grace of God in Chriſt, commonly
God is not the teacher. God when he teaches a man to be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
as he layes the fundamentall grace, vvhich is loue, ſo he
makes it bud forth in the hand, that is he drawes it out in action;
he draws it not out in the tongue, to clatter of it, but he draws it
in the hand to doe well with it: and ther cannot be a ſurer argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that God is the teacher of any grace, nor when we ſee the
action of the hand conformed to the profeſſion. Count of them
by their workes. Haſt thou faith? the beſt argument to knowe
thy faith by, is thy worke. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaies chap. 2. verſe 18. <hi>Let me ſee
thy faith, not in thy tongue, but in thy vvorks.</hi> Would thou knovve
if a man hes a liberall heart? Looke not to his tongue, but to his

                  </gap>, and not a ſpeaker.</p>
               <p>Yet ere I leaue the wordes, marke this. He ſaies, <hi>to all the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
Loue to all the brethren, not to him, nor to her nor to one
part, but all in whole Macedonia, that is, the whole Countrey
about you: As if the liberalitie of Edinburgh were extended to
whole Scotland, and to all the brethren in it. Marke then the
maner of Gods teaching. As he layes downe the ground Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and builds ther on beneficencie, and bringes the grace from
the heart to the hand: ſo he will not open one peece of the hand
and ſhut it out to this bodie, or that bodie onely, and then draw
it in againe: but he opens out the hand wide to all the brethren,
and all the members of the bodie of Chriſt. Looke all the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoures
of Philoſophie, when they diſcourſe of this vertue of
beneficence, and liberalitie, they lay, doe goode to thy friendes,
and kinſ-men, aduance them: doe goode to them that doe well
to thee: thy enemie, meete him againe, with an euill turne: yea,
vvith tvvo euill turnes for one. And this precept is ouer vvell
keeped in Scotland. But God, when he and his miniſters teaches,
he bids thee be beneficiall to all men, ſhowe thy good deeds to
all men yea to thy enemies. Loue thy enemies, ſhow not only a
good countenance to thy enemie, albeit he loue thee not, loue
him: &amp; by ſo doing coales of wraith ſhall be on his head. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

the vengence to God, and he ſhall ſurely repay. Rom. 12. 19.
<hi>Vengence is mine ſayes the Lord,</hi> O would to God men could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

Reſpect (ſaies the Apoſtle) ſpeciallie them, <hi>vvho are of

there are degrees of liberalitie, we are not bound to loue all men
alyke, albeit we be bound to loue all men, yet we ſhould loue
them beſt, who are members of that bodie with vs in Chriſt.
This difference muſt be keeped.</p>
               <p>Now, when he hes left off to exhort them to beneficence. In
the end of the verſe, he ſaies, the leaſt thing I can doe, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
you, <hi>to increaſe more and more.</hi> This ſhould learne vs, that
when we ſee the grace of God in any perſon, we ſhould not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
long to exhort them to that grace; for, when God is teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
few wordes may ſerue them, to ſtirre them vp to that grace:
but, they, whom the Lord teaches not by his Spirit, a thouſand
wordes will not teach them. So, they, that would releeue the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of paines, let them ſeeke earneſtlie, that, God vvoulde be
the inward teacher in the heart, and then thou ſhalt be taught.
Now,<note place="margin">Neceſſity of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> brethren, albeit there be not a neceſſity to inſiſt, to exhort
men to the grace, they ſee, in any perſon, yet, there is a neceſſity
to exhort them to perſeuerance in that grace. There are none
ſo indewed with any grace, as, with liberalitie, patience, loue,
yea, faith it ſelfe, the ground of all graces, but, he hes need, euery
day to heare the voice of exhortation to goe forward: For none
hes made ſuch progreſſe in the courſe of Chriſtianitie (for, we
are all in the rinke, running to the butt, Chriſt) when we haue
runne all our dayes, vntill vve be gray haired, yet, vve are farre
from the butt; and vve are ay falling back: and ſo, vve haue ay
need of this voice crying after vs. Runne on, thou art running,
thou haſt ouercomde him, who ranne with thee: ſtryue to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
thy ſelf: Ran thou faſt the day? run faſter to morrow: amend
thy pace euery day. There are none of vs, who ſtandes ſo faſt
in grace, but, we may fall back againe: and therefore, we haue
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:16659:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
need, continuallie to heare this exhortation: And the Lord hes
appointed his miniſtrie to cry after men, vvho are running in
this rinke. And ſo if thou heare not the voice of his miniſtrie
ſtirring thee vp to runne, if thou contemne the voyce of the
crier, look, how faſt thou euer ran forward, thou ſhalt run as faſt
backward. So, there is no better way to hold a man forward in
this courſe of Chriſtianitie, and to cauſe him grow in all grace,
vntill he come to the end of the rinke, nor the crying of this
miniſtrie, I denounce thee, contemne thou this miniſtrie, thou
ſhalt neuer come to the end of the rinke, to get inheritance in
Heauen. Men will not beleeue this, vntill they ſee it.</p>
               <p>Now,<note place="margin">Quyet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</note> in the laſt roume, after he hes exhorted them, to abſtein
from fornication, not to do wrong to their neighbour, to be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall,
and to loue their brother, laſt, he exhorts them, <hi>to ſtudy to
be quyet.</hi> The word is. Be ambitious of quietneſſe. As euer ye ſaw
men ambitious of the honour of the world, be ye ambitious of
quyetneſſe: Among all the parts of vncleanneſſe, and of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſitie
and foulneſſe of this our nature, this is one, called cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie,
ouer great buſineſſe in other mens affaires, in the thing,
that concernes not vs, nor, our calling: Euen ſo, by the contrair, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all the properties of holineſſe, this is one, To haue a ſober,
content eſtate. For, theſe two are opponned to other, a curious
ſpirite and a quyet ſpirite: the one plaine contrair to the other,
one is a vyce; the other, a vertue. And as I ſaid before, They
who hes not quyetneſſe, in ſome meaſure, in their ſoules, but, in
vvhom this curioſitie raignes in higheſt degree, I cannot ſay,
they haue any part of ſanctification: For, there is ſuch an vnſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
bond of the graces of the Spirite, that, where one is, in
ſome meaſure all muſt be Glory neuer of one, nor, of two, nor, of
three graces, except thou finde the whole graces, and euery one
of them, in ſome meaſure, in thee.</p>
               <p>Now, when he hes commended the grace it ſelfe, he comes to
the effect of the grace,<note place="margin">Effects of quyetnes.</note> what auails any grace, without the effect?
It is an vnprofitable grace? And the firſt effect of quyetneſſe, is,
<hi>To euerie man, to doe his ovvne buſineſſe.</hi> To keepe him within the
bounds of his owne buſineſſe, and be exerciſed in his owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and not in the affairs of other men. So, the effect of quyet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
is not to ſit idle, but to be exerciſed in well doing: but, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16659:107"/>
not that, which perteins to another in their calling, but, that,
which God hes appointed thee, in thy calling: Be as buſie as
thou canſt in that, night and day. There is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
a quyet perſon and an idle perſon: a quyet perſon is
the beſt exerciſed perſon in the vvorlde; for, all his buſineſſe
is vvithin the boundes of his exerciſe, he is doing that, vvhich
the Lord hes bidden him do (doe thy labour, but, goe not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the compaſſe of thy calling) and in the meane tyme, he
is idle in other mens turnes: But, as for an idle man, I ſhall tell
you his nature (no man can be altogether idle, but, he muſt be
euer exerciſed in ſomething, ſo long as there is breathe in his
mouth.) An idle perſon does not a turne, that pertaines to his
ovvne calling, but, in other mens calling he is euer buſie, he is
exerciſed in this thing and that thing, that perteynes to another
man, and in the meane tyme he is a vagabound, vvithout any
ſhift. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of theſe buſie bodies. 2. Theſſal. chap. 3.

exerciſed in other mens affaires, while as they are idle, in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne
calling.</p>
               <p>The ſecond effect, is a particular kinde of exerciſe; handie
labour, vvorking vvith a mans ovvne hand, not vvith his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
handes. And therefore, the vvord is, <hi>your ovvne proper
handes.</hi> This vvoulde ſeeme ouer ſtraite. It may be, that, many
vvill be content to be exerciſed in an honeſt and liberall action,
ſo, that, they may keep their hands clean: but, when it commes to
an handy work, and to put to their hands and file their fingers,
to the bowing of the back, and of the head, ô, that is ouer ſtrait,
it is ouer ſore, to a Genle-man, to doe that, it ſettes him not: He
is a Lords Sonne, ſhould he fyle his hands with labour? But, <hi>Paul</hi>
ſayes, Labour with thy owne handes, rather ere thou be idle in

               <p>Now, to be ſhort. He ſayes, <hi>He denounced theſe things to them,

mouth: he that wil not labour, I command, in Gods name, that, he
eate none. It is the will of God, that they, who vvill not vvorke,
and may worke, that, they ſhould die for hunger. They who are
ſtrong and may get labour, and will not vvorke, there ſhould be
an inhibition laid on them, not to eate: and they, who eate, if they
eate not the bread conqueſt with their owne labour, their eating
is curſed to them. It is not permitted to a King, to eate bread, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

Brethren, we ſhould be honeſt, if it were no more, but onely
for our enemies cauſe, for regard of our holy profeſſion. The
Enemie, the Pagane, lookes vpon thee, vvho art an idle body,
and labours not, and ſees nothing, but a bellie and a denourer
of the creatures of God, and then, will he not ſlander thy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?
Therefore, if it were but to ſaue this profeſſion from the

the Apoſtle writes, they were not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorant of the eſtate of them vvho
departed this life. No queſtion, they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode
and knew the reſurrection of
the dead: for not knowinge that, vvhat
could they know of Chriſtianitie? Yet as
appeares of this place by the Apoſtle, it
was not a ſetled knowledge in the heart they had: they knevv
no ſo as they ſhoulde haue done the reſurrection of the bodie.
And therefore when their friends whom they loued wel, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
their dolour was exceſſiue. When they ſaw the godlie who
profeſſed in the beginning, drawne to torments, martyred and
execute, they tooke diſpleaſure out of meaſure: euen as if they
who departed this life, had periſhed altogether, and ſhold neuer
haue bene more. The Apoſtle vnderſtanding this, among other
things he writes to them, he caſts in this doctrine of the eſtate of
them that are departed; to the end they ſhould leaue off that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue
ſorrow and lamentation, and not lament as the Gentiles
who were vvithout hope. Then to come ſhortly to the wordes
and purpoſe of the Apoſtle. He ſettes downe this propoſition,
<hi>I vvould not brethren, haue you ignorant concerning them vvhich are
a ſleepe;</hi> the end wherefore he would not haue them ignorant, is,
<hi>that they ſorrovv not as others vvho hes no hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now concerning the eſtate of thoſe that are departed, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs
them in ſundry heads of it: Firſt, he telles them that they
are but a ſleep, that is now their preſent eſtate in graue. Then he
teaches them what ſhall follow; the riſing again; when that they
haue ſleeped a time, as one after ſleep awakes, ſo ſhal they awake.
Next he inſtructes them of the honor they ſhall haue in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
vvhen they ſhall meete the Lord of glorie. Suppoſe
they be dead firſt, they ſhal not be laſt in meetting the Lord: yea
they who ſhall be aliue at that day, ſhall not be firſt, but they
who are departed, ſhall be in the firſt rank to meete the Lord in
the clouds. Of this he taks occaſion to ſpeak of the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
&amp; of the glory thereof; to this end that euery one in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vpon theſe things ſhold receiue comfort. Ther is the ſumme
of this doctrine. <hi>I vvoulde not haue you brethren ignorant as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

thoſe vvho are at ſleepe.</hi> That is, I vvoulde not haue you
ignorant of their eſtate, vvhat is their eſtate while they lye in
graue, vvhat their eſtate ſhall be thereafter. Of theſe and ſuch
things I vvould not haue you ignorant. Now the leſſon is eaſie.
There are none of vs but in ſome meaſure vve ſhoulde knowe
what is the eſtate of them who are dead; vvhat is their eſtate in
the graue, vvhat ſhall be their eſtate after the graue. It apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
to euerie Chriſtian to know the eſtate of the dead in ſome
meaſure, as well as it pertaines to them to know the eſtate of the
liuing not paſſing the reuelation that the Lord hes made therin.
Dreame not anie eſtate to the dead, knovve no more of it nor it
pleaſes God to reueale, nor deſire to know no more. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
paſſes in curioſitie, and can not be ſatiſfied with the Lords
reuelation: but let vs be content with the reuelation of the Lord
vntill that great reuelation come. Alwaies it pertaines to vs in

brings a great deale of ſorrow vvith it. The effects of ignorance.
in things, vve ſhould know, are diſpleaſure and ſorrow. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the things, vve ſhould know, and eſpecially of the eſtate
of thoſe departed this life, brings joy &amp; conſolation. Ignorance
made <hi>Iacob</hi> exceſſiuelie to mourne for his ſonne <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> without
anie cauſe, thinking he was dead, when he was aliue. Being fred
from his ignorance, and knowing the eſtate of his ſon, and that
he was aliue. he found joy and conſolation. So light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
brings joy. The blinde opinion of this dreame of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
that the Papiſts hes inuented, hes brought exceeding great
diſpleaſure to many. To thinke that the ſoule lovvſed from the
bodie ſhould be tormented in Purgatorie, ere it enter in glorie.
But men being fred from this ignorance, and knowing aſſuredly
that the ſoule, immediatlie after it ſeueres from the bodie, paſſes
to eternall joy, men and vvemen knovving this in the pointe of
death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no queſtion, they are exceeding glad. Then brethren, to
ſpeake it againe; Ignorance brings great diſpleaſure; knowledge
bringes joy: when vve knowe the eſtate of thinges as they are
indeed, then there is joy. Therefore the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>That ye
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> not, as others vvho hes no hope.</hi> That is, as the Gentiles. An
ignorant and hopeleſſe bodie who hes no hope of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
who knowes nothing of the reſurrection; and therefore
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:16659:110"/>
hopes not for it, his mourning and ſorrowe will be exceſſiue.
This is the meaning of the Apoſtle. Ignorance bringes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
in death, it makes a man hopeleſſe, not to hope for a lyfe after
this lyfe, nor for a reſurrection to lyfe, and being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
what joy can he haue? a bodie dying without hope, no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
if thou bee not in hope when thou art dying. all the world ſhall
not make thee to rejoyce. By the contrair, ye heare by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
knowledge bringes hope; for hope is the effect of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and hope bringes joy and comfort in the houre of death.
None euer yet died in the hope of that glorious reſurrection,
but in the houre of death, they rejoyced with joy vnſpeakable.
The joy that hope bringes, being grounded on knowledge, is
wonderfull. It will not be conteined in the heart but the mouth
will open and glory in the joy it apprehendes, throgh the hope
of the reſurrection in Ieſus Chriſt. The Apoſtle Rom. chap. 5.
verſe 2. ſaies, We rejoyce vnder the hope of the glory of God.
I meane not, brethren, that, that knowledge that workes hope,
and that hope that workes joy, will take away from a man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
all diſpleaſure, all heauineſſe, all mourning in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of our friendes, and them we loue well. No, it will nor
nor ſhould not doe that. There is no grace of God in Ieſus, that
puts out any naturall affection: none will take away either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
joy, or diſpleaſure: no, faith and hope will not doe it, but
it makes that naturall affection ſanctified, and puts it in order:
Our dolour, which by nature is immoderate, it moderates: hope
will bring with it a meaſure, knoweledge will bring with it
a meaſure, and faith which is the fountaine of all graces, will
bring with it a meaſure. In a word, Faith, hope and knowledge,
will temper and mingle the affection of diſpleaſure, which is
bitter, with the affection of joy, and make a ſweete temperature
in that bodie: ſo that the bodie that hes knowledge and hope,
when it is mourning faſteſt, it will haue greateſt joy. Beware of
your mourning, and looke that it be neuer altogether without
ſome joy. Sobſt thou? ſighſt thou vnſpeakablie? Looke, that
thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ighs be mingled with joy vnſpeakable. Will ye haue my
counſell? Let neuer joy be the alone, but let euer joy be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with ſorrow: Haue not ſrrow the alone. but let it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be
mingled with ſome joy. So long as thou liueſt, thou art natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:16659:111"/>
inclined to ſinne, and ſinne procures ſorrow. And therfore
ſo long as ſinne dwelles in thy bodie, let euer thy joy be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with ſorow, but let neuer thy ſorow for ſinne be it alone, but
tempered with ſome joy in the mercie of God. This ſhoulde be
the eſtate of a chriſtian: in laughing forget not ſin, but ſorow for
it: be not vvanton vnder the burden of ſin. Againe, in mourning
let joy be for the mercie of Chriſt to vs. The Apoſtle ſayes 1.
Theſſ. 5. 16. <hi>Reioice euer:</hi> yea euen when thou art mourning, for
there is matter of eternall joy offered in Chriſt: and therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
vvith a ſanctified and with an holie joye. This is the firſt
leſſon.</p>
               <p>Then brethren, I gather on the vvords of the Apoſtle, <hi>As the
Gentiles vvho haue no hope of reſurrection;</hi> where there is no hope
there is no comfort? vvhere a mans hope is bounded within the
compaſſe of this life, and reaches not out beyond the ſame, there
is no comfort: make him king of all the worlde, if his hope be
onelie on the kingdomes of this earth, if he hope not for that
heauenlie kingdome,<note place="margin">Want of hope doth bring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire in death.</note> to be an inheritour there, he hes no joye
nor comfort: I meane that ſolide joye and comfort vvhich the
world neuer miniſters to men. Al the kingdoms in the earth will
neuer miniſter to thee ſolide joy, comfort &amp; conſolation. Novv
brethren, this is the eſtate of the Gentiles. <hi>Paul</hi> Epheſ. 2. 12. ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of their eſtate, ſayes; they liued in the world without God,
aliants from the Common-well of Iſraell, from the Church of
God, ſtrangers from the couenants of promiſe, without hope &amp;
without God in the world; and ſo hopeleſſe &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortleſſe. I can
not ſay, that euer any Gentile that liued as a Gentile, what euer
was their ranke on the earth, that euer they had any comfort: all
theſe Monarches that liued without grace in the world, I can not
ſay that in the midſt of their triumph &amp; greateſt glory they had
any comfort; much leſſe in the hour of their death had they any
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort &amp; joy: and when they ſaw there was nothing but death,
and all pleaſure was away, then there was nothing but ſorowe,
<hi>Hadrian</hi> the Emperour (I remember) who was one of the moſt
glorious Conquerours in the world, when he was on death-bed,
he flatters with his owne ſoule, to ſee if ſhe would haue bidden
within the body, ſaying, My litle ſoule, wilt thou bide within the
body? thou waits not where thou art going to; without hope he
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:16659:111"/>
was, and therefore comfortleſſe, and dies in diſpair. To let vs ſee
there is none that deceaſſes without the hope of lyfe, and of that
glorious reſurrection, but they die all in diſpare, from the King,
to the begger. Who euer died ſince the beginning of the world,
without Chriſt, and hope in him, (yea before he was manifeſted
in the world) but they deceaſſed in diſpare: So, as ye wold die in
joy ſtriue to get Chriſt. It is a thing fleſh and bloud wil not giue
thee, and it is a greater wonder to ſee Chriſt, nor to ſee a man
through a rock; ther are ſo many impediments to hinder his fight
from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Therefore we haue to craue, that the ſprit of Ieſus wold
lighten the eye of the mynde in vs aboue nature, to ſee him, and
then we ſhall ſee him, and ſo haue comfort in death.</p>
               <p>Now, to go forward in the wordes, and to come to the heades
in particulare, concerning them, that are departed. The firſt
thing he inſtructs them in (I take it vp, when he ſaies, <hi>Concerning
them, that are aſleepe.)</hi> is, in reſpect of their eſtate preſent, while
as they lye in graue.<note place="margin">Bodies of the godlie ſleepe in the graue</note> The bodies lying in the graue, ſayes he, is
not dead: Ye beleeue they be dead. No, death is one thing and
ſleepe is another. They are onely ſleeping; for, if ye will ſpeake
of death, what it meanes properlie: The death of the creature
properlie, is, the euerlaſing puniſhment and deſtruction of it
for euer. And they vvho dies, and are dead, they ſhall neuer
liue againe; at the leaſt, they ſhall neuer haue a ſenſe of joy. So,
the bodies of the godlie are not dead, but, ſleeping, and lying in
graue, and they haue a verie being: a man that is ſleeping, is a
man, and hes a being: a bodie in the graue hes a being, and bydes
lying in the graue in ſubſtance, and ſhall abide continuallie: And
if it ſhould be burnt in the fyre, or, drovvned in the vvatter, the
diſſolution of the bodie in the graue ſhall not deſtroye the
being thereof. The turning of it in aſhes, is no other thing
(to ſpeake of it properlie) but, a fyning of it; as the goulde is
fyned by the fyre, and the droſſe burnt vp, ſo, the bodie is fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the graue, and the droſſe of the bodie is but at vp, that at
the latter day, the ſubſtance of the bodie being purified may riſe,
as gold gliſtering, to be conjoined with the ſoule. The Apoſtle
1. Cor. 15. 53. 54. 55. when he ſpeakes of death, he ſayes, that, <hi>the
graue is not able to ſvvalovv</hi> the bodie, <hi>but, that, mortality</hi> (which is
ſin &amp; death in the body) <hi>may be ſvvalovved vp of immortalitie.</hi> So
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:16659:112"/>
it is the mortalitie and droſſe of the bodie that is burnt vp, and
not the ſubſtance, but the ſubſtance of the bodie is cleanſed
and purified, that it may raigne with the head Chriſt in glorie
for euer. Now, to ſpeake of this word ſleeping. The Scripture
when it ſpeakes of death cals it ſleeping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when Ieſus ſpeakes
of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he ſaies, <hi>Our friend Lazarus ſleepes, but, I goe to vvake
him vp.</hi> Ioh. 11. 11. And it is ſaid of <hi>Steuen</hi> Act. chap. 7. verſe 60.
He ſleeped. In the olde Teſtament commonly there is a word
added to it, he ſleeped with his Fathers, he was joined with his
Fathers. Now, to come to the purpoſe. There are two parts of
man. A bodie, and a ſoule. When it is ſaid, that, a man ſleepes,
thinke not, that, his ſoule ſleepes, referring this word ſleeping to
the ſoule. Some vaine men thinkes that the ſoule after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing
ſleepes, vntill the comming of Chriſt. No, the ſoule liues,
and ſleepes not; it liues and ſhall liue, in diſpyte of all the world,
either in paine, or, pleaſure, for euer. The ſoule of the vngodly is
tranſlated immediatlie after death to paine, and hes a wonderfull
ſenſe of paine, and a liuing in paine, a continuall paine, anguiſh
and torment. (If there were no more, to teſtifie this, but the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the rich Glutton it may ſuffice. It tels thee
that the ſoule of the riche Glutton had in Hell the own paine.
Luc. 16. 19.) The ſoule of the godlie againe after death liues in
joy. And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> Philip: 1. verſe 23. ſayes, <hi>I vvould be diſſolued, and
be vvith Chriſt.</hi> viz. liuing in ſoule. And 2. Cor. chap. 5. verſe 8
<hi>I loue rather to remoue out of the bodie, and to goe to God, to dvvell
vvith him.</hi> And God is ſaid to be <hi>the God of the liuing,</hi> that is to
ſay, of the ſoales that liues in glorie. Matt. 22. 32. So the word of
ſleeping is not to be referred to the ſoule, but to the bodyes of
men and wemen: for, as a bodie lyes downe in his bed; ſo the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
after diſſolution is laid downe in the graue, to ſleepe, vntill
the day of reſurrection. There is no ſleepe that by nature is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting
and vvhen a man hes ſleeped, and is ſatiſfied vvith
ſleepe he muſt waken: So, the bodie if it ſleepe in the graue, of
neceſſitie it muſt waken againe: If there were no more but this
word ſleeping it teſtifies that there ſhall be a reſurrection. Now
vnderſtand farther, that the word <hi>ſleeping</hi> in the Scripture is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the bodies, both of the reprobat and elect: The bodie
of the reprobat is ſaid to ſleepe: The bodie of the elect is ſaid
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:16659:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alſo to ſleepe. So <hi>Daniell</hi> ſayes, chap. 12. verſe 2. <hi>Many of them
that are a ſleepe in the dust in the earth, ſome of them ſhall riſe to lyfe,
ſome of them to ſhame and ignominie.</hi> We are all ſleeping, but, I
ſee a diuerſitie in reſurrection: the bodie of the elect ſhall riſe, to
euerlaſting glorie, the body of the wicked to eternall death and
damnation. And yet, albeit this word be common to both, yet,
moſt properly, it is aſcriued to the bodies of the godly: For, euen
as a man ſleeps, to this end, that he may riſe vp again more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and be more able to take in hand any handy-worke, &amp; do
his calling: So, it is the body of the godly onely, that ſleeps, to riſe
more chearfully to the actions and doings of that life eternall. It
is a wonderful change. It lyes down a weak and infirme body, it
will riſe again a ſtrong body: it lyes down in ignominy, it wil riſe
againe a glorious body, and there was neuer a man ſo altered &amp;
comforted by naturall ſleepe, as the body of the elect ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
and comforted by that ſleep in the graue. As to the bodies
of the wicked, woe to them: if they ly down with ſadneſſe and
wearineſſe, their riſing ſhall be with farre greater ſadneſſe and
wearineſſe. No, they ſhall think, it ſhold be well with them, if the
Lord wold let the body ay ly ſtill there. It is a black wakning. If
they ly downe with ignominy, they ſhall riſe with greater igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie.
So, to ſpeake it properly, the body of the reprobate is not
ſaid to ſleep, as it is, to ly dead; for, the riſing of it is but to death:
death in the graue, riſing to death, and ay deing, and neuer mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an end of death. Now, this, for the vnderſtanding of this word
<hi>ſleeping.</hi> Then, I note ſhortlie of this firſt head, that, <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructs
them in, concerning the ſoules departed. That, the bodie, that
lyes in the graue.<note place="margin">Sleeping of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

if it were not more, but to knowe that farre of it, this knowledge
miniſters comfort, both in our owne death, and in the death of
our friendes: Indeed, if we ſaw our friendes bodie caſt into the
graue, and knew, that, there were torment and paine there: no
queſtion it would bring great heauineſſe, and we would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
on our owne paine in the hour of our death, and it would
bring ſorrow to vs. So it is a benefite of God that the body lyes
in the graue without paine. And this is the thing the Apoſtle
will haue them to know.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the wordes of the next verſe. <hi>For if,</hi> ſaies he,

joy paſſe the earthly joy. So, this we ſhould know, that, the dead
in Chriſt ſhall haue full pleaſure and perfite joy.</p>
               <p>But, yet, ere we leaue the words. He grounds this reſurrection
of our bodies on two grounds.<note place="margin">2. grunds of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of our reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> The firſt it, faith in Chriſt (if, ſaies
he, <hi>vve beleeue, that, Christ died and raiſe again)</hi> But, faith in Chriſt,
firſt crucified, and dead: It auailes not, to beleeue in Chriſt, if thou
beleue not in him, as he is crucified &amp; dead: and this not eneugh
to beleue, that, he is crucified and dead, except thou with a ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
faith beleeue, that, he is crucified and dead for thy ſins. The
Deuill knovves, he vvas crucified, he ſavv him crucified, and no
doubt, he was preſent at the crucifying of him: (for, he vvas the
burrior of God, to him, at his crucifying) yet, the knovvledge of
Chriſt crucified does him no good, but, euill, becauſe he beleeues
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:16659:113"/>
not, that, Chriſt died for his ſins; and he cannot beleue, becauſe he
hes no faith. So, the firſt ground is faith in Chriſt crucified, and
that he died for thee. Yet, beleue more. He ſaies, <hi>and roſe againe.</hi>
Thou muſt beleue (as euer thou wouldſt riſe in the laſt day) that,
Chriſt was raiſed out of the graue, to the Heauens. And it is not
eneugh, to beleeue, that, he roſe, (the Deuill beleeues, that, he roſe
againe) but, beleeue, he roſe for thee, for thy juſtification, for thy
ſaluation, as <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes Rom. 4. 25 Then, this is our faith in
Chriſt, where-vpon our reſurrection is grounded; Faith, that he
died for me; Faith, that he roſe againe, for my ſaluation. Then,
to the next ground. <hi>They,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>vvho hes ſleeped in Ieſus.</hi> The
ſecond grounde is nothing, but, perſeuerance in this Faith in
Chriſt, euen, to the laſt gaſp and breath: So, that, in death and in
the pointe of death, thy ſoule take holde on Chriſt crucified,
and riſen, and ſticke by him in the diſſolution of the ſoule from
the bodie. It is requiſite, that, in all our lyfe-tyme and in euerie
moment of our lyfe-tyme, vve ſhould haue a grippe of Chriſt,
apprehend him, take holde of him and reſt on him: for, I aſſure
you, they vvho vvill not grip him, are in a ſtagring eſtate, but,
ſpeciallie in the houre of death, vvhen the greateſt tentation is,
and the Deuill is buſieſt to deceyue you, it is moſt requiſite, that,
the ſoule haue a grip of Chriſt, grip to his Croce, grip to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Reſurrection: for, there is no ſtanding, but, by the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of Chriſt: and if thy grippe goe, and his grippe goe off
thee, in that ſame moment thou art in Hell: for, no lyfe to anie,
but, to them, vvho are in Chriſt, as members of his bodie, to
them, vvho hes an apprehenſion of him, and of vvhom, he hes
a grippe. Therefore, ſeeing, the tyme of our departure is verie
vncertaine (vvho knovves, vvhen it vvill pleaſe the Lord to
call on him?) euerie one of vs, night and day, tyme and tyde,
ſhould ſee, vvhether we be in Chriſt, or, not, whether we haue
an holde of him, or, not: In the morning, when thou ryſeſt, the
firſt thing, thou ſhouldſt thinke of, is, Am I in Chriſt? haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a
grippe of him? or, hes he a grippe of me, or, not? A knaue will
ryſe and grippe to his ſtaffe, or, ſword, but, he hes no minde of a
grip of Chriſt. Alas, vvhen Chriſt grippes thee not the Deuill
caries thee, al that day, bodie and ſoule to wickedneſſe. Say, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Lord holde a grippe of me; for, I am as a chylde. (Neuer a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:16659:114"/>
childe was ſo ſtagring, as thou art, except thou leane on Chriſt.)
This is moſt true: It is not ſo much our apprehenſion we haue
of Chriſt, as his apprehenſion of vs, that holds vs vp: A chylde
that is learning to goe, albeit he grippe, he cannot holde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
vp, but, it is the grip of the Nourſe, that holdes vppe the
chylde: It is ſo, betweene God and vs, We are all infantes, Ieſus
hes vs in his hand, we make a glifring to grip him againe, but,
when he lettes vs goe, then, we fall: So, this is our comfort, that
vve are gripped by God, and his grip vpholdes vs, for, vvhen he
grippes to the heart of any man, his hand neuer lowſes againe,
and thou ſhalt neuer goe out of his grippe: yea, euen in that time,
when thou thinkeſt, thou art gone, and the Lord hes caſten thee
offyn the meane-time he hes thee in his grip and in that meane-tyme
vvhen thou appeareſt to be left, call to remembrance,
that, he hes gripped thee, and then, aſſure thee, yet he grips thee.
And ſay, <hi>Who ſhall be able to ſeparate me from the loue of Christ?</hi>
Rom. 8. 35. And Ieſus ſayes, <hi>None is able to reaue my ſheepe out of
my hand.</hi> Iohn. 10. 28. Who ſhall be able to lowſe his hand?
This is all in one vvorde: Seeke this apprehenſion, and ſtand
faſt in Chriſt, and death ſhall not ſeuer thee, from him, but lyfe
ſhall follow death; glorie ſhall follow ignominie; immortalitie
ſhall ſvvalovv vp the mortalitie, that vve are heere ſubject to.
Well then brethren, who wait when we ſhall be ſtriken? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let vs euer be prepared, and let vs not looke to the Peſt.
Nothing ſhall be able to ſeuere vs from God, if he haue gripped
vs, <hi>`Paul</hi> ſayes, Philipp. 3. 8. 9. that, he counted all thinges but
dongue, that he might be found of him, and knowe him, and the
force of his reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Yet, to inſiſt in the words expreſſing this reſurrection: he ſaies
<hi>that, God ſhall bring vs vvith him,</hi> that is, with Chriſt. So, our reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
what is it,<note place="margin">VVhat is our reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> but, a bringing of vs to God, to be joyned with
him, in that bleſſed ſocietie? Our felicitie and bleſſedneſſe, both
in body and ſoule is, to be joined with God. For, vnderſtand, ſo
long as thy bodie lyes in the graue, lyes in ignominie, in a maner
it is ſeuered from God. it is apart from God, in ſome maner, it is
not ſo near him, as it wil be: it is yet lying in ignominy. Now in
the reſurrection of the dead, that body that was ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
God and lay in ignominie for a tyme, ryſes to be joyned with
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:16659:114"/>
God, to the end it may be glorified for euer. This is the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the bodies of the godlie. But, it is farre otherwaies, with
the reſurrection of the vngodly. They riſe indeed, and muſt riſe;
for, they ſhall be pulled out of the graue; for, faine would they
ly ſtill: they muſt ryſe, to receiue that paine of damnation, they
ſhall ryſe, but, neuer to be brought to God. The Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſpeakes, that, they ſhall riſe, but, neuer to be broght to God,
but, they riſe to be ſeuered from God, more, nor they were. They
are ſeuered, when they are in the graue; but, when the body ſhall
be joyned to the ſoule, then, they ſhall be farther ſeuered. And
looke, how far is betweene the hie Heauens and the low Helles,
as far diſtance ſhall there be betweene God and the reprobate.
They ſhall not be conuoyed vp to meete Chriſt in the cloudes,
as the bodies of the godly are: No, but they ſhall ſtand on the
earth.</p>
               <p>Yet, to inſiſt. Are the bodies of the elect broght them alone
to God? No: what euer bodie muſt be brought to God in the
reſurrection it muſt be broght in companie, it muſt be in a ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and conjunction, ere that bodie be conjoined with God. He
ſaies, <hi>vvith Christ.</hi> That bodie muſt be brought to that glorious
ſocietie with God, but, firſt it muſt be joyned with Ieſus; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
thou ſhalt neuer riſe to God. Then, would ye haue the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of in this reſurrection (for, euerie one ſhall riſe
in order.) The firſt is Chriſt, Chriſt the firſt of them, that riſes; his
glorious body roſe firſt; Then, after that, they who are in Chriſt,
that is, they who ſtands in that conjunction with him, as imps
in the tree, vvho are ingraft in his bodie, then, they ſhall ryſe,
with him. Therefore, in one word. Wouldſt thou knowe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou ſhalt be joined with God, or, not, looke, if thou ſtandſt
faſt in that conjunction, and vnion with Chriſt, in this lyfe: and
if thou finde thy ſelfe vnited with Chriſt in this lyfe, then, in the
glorious reſurrection, with God ſhalt thou be. And ſo, this is a
thing, that, I euer aduertiſe you of. Looke euer, that, thou be a
member of that glorious bodie. Be either an eye or, foote, or
hand, be ſome part of the bodie of Chriſt. And certainly, being
joined with him, when he is joyned with God, euen God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of neceſſitie (thou being a member of the bodie) thou muſt
be joined with God. For, thy conjunction with God is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:16659:115"/>
but thou muſt firſt bee joyned with Chriſt, and being
conjoyned with Chriſt, thou ſhalt be joyned with God alſo in
glory.</p>
               <p>Now, vvho ſhall be the doer of this? It is a great vvorke to
draw vp this bodie out of the graue to Heauen, and ſet it in that
glorie. Will the bodie riſe the alone? where got it that ſtrength?
will any Angell draw it vp? No, all the Angels in Heauen is not
able to raiſe vp a bodie to Heauen: all the power in earth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
raiſe vp a dead bodie. Then who muſt doe it? No power
in Heauen nor earth, but the power of God. <hi>Paul</hi> Epheſ. chap.
1. verſe 19. calles it <hi>the effectualneſſe of the strong povver of God.</hi>
There is no vvorke in this vvorld vvherein the povver of God
appeares more, nor in the vvorke of the riſing, firſt of Chriſt,
vvhen he vvas dead, and then of our bodies that are in him.
The power and ſtrength of God as greatlie appeares in the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the bodie, as it did in making of the world, when before
it vvas not. It is as great a matter to make a thing to liue, as to
make it: There is as great power to make the dead to liue, as
to make any thing of nothing. And this povver is onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to God. The power of the world may put out the life: but
no power can giue lyfe, but, onely Gods. There are many ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
but, none to giue lyfe, but, onely God. Therefore, let vs glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
the God of lyfe. Then, marke two cauſes of our glorious
reſurrection.<note place="margin">2. cauſes of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> (He ſpeakes not of the reſurrection of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.)
The firſt cauſe, is, the conjunction with Ieſus, begunne in
this lyfe. The ſecond cauſe, is, the power and might of God,
in raiſing of them being found in Ieſus. Take any of theſe two
away, thou ſhalt neuer be brought to God. If thy conjunction
be not with Ieſus in this lyfe, the power of God in the latter day
ſhall not raiſe thee, to joyne thee to God. Take this firſt cauſe
away, the ſecond ſhall not follow. Then, againe, if the hand of
God at the day of the reſurrection ſhould not be put (as it were)
out of Heauen, to take vp thy bodie, thou wouldſt ly ſtill. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
joyne theſe two. Firſt, the conjunction with Chriſt, that is
by Faith: then, joyne, with Faith, the power and vertue of God,
and ſo, ryſe ſhalt thou, and be joyned with God in glorie. Now,
as to the power of God to raiſe vs, it is not extended to vs heere,
but, we ſhall ſee it in that great day: but, the thing, vve haue to,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:16659:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
care for, is to looke, that, we haue ſaith, and of neceſſitie, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
muſt follow. Haſt thou faith? and art thou joyned with
Chriſt, by Faith? of neceſſitie the power of God muſt reache to
thee, to raiſe thee, out of the graue. Thou needeſt not to feare,
if thou be found in Chriſt. All mercie, power and glorie is in
him: if thou be out with Chriſt, no glorie, nor mercie, but, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
for thee; for, the power of God ſhall be extended to thy
deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Now, to the next verſe. Yet, he goes forward and teaches them,
that, not onely they ſhall riſe and be broght to God, and be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with him, But, he ſayes, <hi>This ſay vve vnto you, by the vvord of
God, that, vve, vvho liue and are remaning at the comming of the Lord,
ſhall not preueene them, vvho ſleep.</hi> He ſpeakes, heere, of himſelfe, as
thogh he ſhould haue bene liuing at the day of judgement: and
yet, he died, more nor a thouſand yeere ſince: To teach vs, euer to
be in readineſſe: no houre, nor, moment ſhould be, but, we ſhould
look for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt; and think, we ſhall be liuing, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he commes. This is our vain thoght: we think, we ſhal die before
the day of judgment. No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſpok not ſo: we ſhould not ſpeak
ſo, but, be ay ready, to meet the Lord, at his glorious appearance.</p>
               <p>Now, the third head, wherein he inſtructed them, is, the order
and ranke of men, that ſhall meete the Lord, in the cloudes. All
that judgement ſhall paſſe by order. The God of order ſhall be
judge,<note place="margin">Order in meeting the Lord, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and all ſhall be in order, and men ſhall be in ranke: they
who ſhall be raiſed vp from this earth, to meete the Lord, ſhall
haue their own place and ranke. Now, the Apoſtle would teach
them, that, they ſhal haue this order. They who hes departed firſt
this lyfe ſhall not be preuented, they vvho ſhall be aliue ſhall
not be put in the ranke before them, but, they who are dead ſhall
be in the firſt ranke, and order, and ere euer that ſodain change
be made of them, vvho ſhall be found alyue, changing them
from mortalitie, to immortalitie (vvhich change ſhall be in the
twinckling of an eye) the dead in the graue ſhall be raiſed vp
firſt, by the power of God, &amp; their bodies ſhal be firſt glorified,
and then ſhall come on that ſodain change, of them, who ſhall be
aliue, &amp; then, all ſhal be reſt vp to the clouds: firſt, they, that were
dead, next, they, that were changed, and ſo, we ſhall come all to
meete our head Chriſt. This is the order. Now to be ſhort. This
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:16659:116"/>
ſame verie ſpeaking of the Apoſtle, and his inſtructing of them
in this preferment teaches vs, that, there ſhould be in vs ſuch a
deſire to meete with Chriſt, that we ſhould ſtriue, who ſhal meet
with him firſt: ſtriue to be firſt, and not to be laſt; caſt vs to haue
a parte of this preferment, and conſidering this preferment is
promiſed to them, vvho dies firſt, it ſhould make vs joyfull to
die firſt, and to ſay to them, vvho are ſtanding about vs, vvhen
vve are on death-bed, I vvill get a preferment. I am called to
death firſt, before you, I ſhall be preferred to you in meetting
vvith my Lord, in Heauen. Ye ſhall liue after me, but, I ſhall
meete firſt vvith my Lord. O, vvhat it is, to get preferment in
heauenlie glorie! Ye vvill count of preferment vvith Kinges of
this earth, and men vvill ſtriue, vvho ſhall firſt meete vvith the
King. O, then, ſhould vve not ſtriue to meete vvith the King of
Kings in Heauen. The Lord grant vs faith, that we may be join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Chriſt in this bodie, that at that laſt day ſoule and bodie
may be glorified in Heauen vvith Chriſt our Head. To vvhom

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle (brethren) in this preſent
text (by the way as it were) inſtructs the
Theſſalonians in that head of doctrine,
that concernes thoſe who are departed
this lyfe: Of the which either they were
ignorant, or thought not of it as they
ſhould haue done. And therefore, in the
death and departure of their kinſ-folke
and friendes whom they loued well, they mourned exceſſiuely,
as though there eſtate had beene miſerable: as though after this
world there ſhould haue been no more of them, but they ſhould
periſh like beaſts. And therfore the Apoſtle, to the end that for
death they ſhold not mourne ſo deſperatlie, he inſtructs them in
certaine heades of doctrine concerning the departed. The firſt
was, that they that died, died not ſo much as ſleeped: this death
is not ſo much to be called a death, as a ſleepe, for there ſhall be
a waking againe, as a man lying down to ſleepe, ſhall awake
againe. The ſecond point. Their reſurrection ſhall be glorious:
Being laid down in the graue they ſhall not ly for euer, but ſhall
be gloriouſlie raiſed againe: for heere he ſpeakes of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the elect and choſen. Now the third thing he inſtructs
them in is an peece of honour they ſhall haue in their reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They that are dead firſt, ſhall ſee the Lord before them that
ſhall be found aliue: for the dead ſhall ryſe firſt, and then the
change ſhall be made of them, who are then liuing. And as the
dead ſhall riſe firſt, ſo they ſhall be firſt in ranke among them
who ſhall goe to meete the Lord in the aire: firſt the dead after
their reſurrection ſhall be reſt vp to the cloudes: then they
who ſhall be liuing, ſhall be reſt vp after them. So the dead ſhall
get the firſt ſight of Chriſt, then they who ſhall be found alyue,
ſhall be changed and get the next ſight. This before ye heard
taught to you.</p>
               <p>Now in the text we haue red, the Apoſtle takes occaſion of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16659:117"/>
that which he ſpoke of immediatly before, concerning the rank<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
and order of thoſe that ſhall bee found dead on that great
day. To enter in this matter more deeplie, and to fall out in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the Lords comming in that latter day. He pointes
out the manner of it, and that glorie that ſhall appeare. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
he commes to that effect that ſhall follovv there-vpon.
The firſt effect, ſhall be the reſurrection of the dead; ere euer
they vvho are alyue be changed (vvhich ſhall be in a moment)
the dead ryſing firſt, ſhall be reſt vp to the cloudes, and then
they vvho ſhall be changed, ſhall be reſt vp after them. The
eſtate of both is, they ſhall meete the Lord, and bee vvith him
for euer. Then in the laſt verſe, he deſyres the Theſſalonians
vvith ſuch ſpeaches as theſe, euerie one to comfort another:
vvhether he ſorrovv for his owne or for anothers death, and to
ſpeake one to another of the reſurrection, and of the glorie
that ſhall followe on it. Now this text ſtandes in a narratiue
of the forme of Chriſtes comming, vvhereof I vvill ſpeake no
farther, nor I can gather thereof out of the Scripture, and with
as great ſhortneſſe as I may: For, it is follie to ſpeake any thing
heerein vvhich is not reuealed and ſpoken of in the Scriptures.
Now Brethren, I ſhall ſpeake firſt (according to the Scriptures
of God) of the ſignes and tokens that ſhall appeare in the world
before Chriſtes comming. For, ere he be ſeene, they who ſhall
be found aliue at that great day, ſhall ſee ſignes and tokens of
his comming. Next I ſhall ſpeake of his comming and of the
manner of it. And in the third rovvme I ſhall ſpeake of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes
that ſhall followe in the vvorlde immediatlie on his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p>As for the ſignes that ſhall be ſeene, ere he be ſeene. There
are ſome of them that ſhall goe before his comming immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
before he ryſe out of his Throne, vvhere he ſittes at the
right hand of his Father, euen immediatlie before his ryſing
there ſhall ſome ſignes be ſhovven to vvarne the vvorlde, that
the King of Glorie is comming. Then there ſhall be ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

it. The vvhole povvers of the Heauen ſhall be ſhaken: The
Sunne, the Moone ſhall be darkned, all ſhall be obſcured: the
Sunne ſhall haue no light, the ſtarres ſhall fall downe, or, at the
leaſt, ſhall appeare ſo, becauſe they ſhall giue no light, and light
ſhall be away, nothing in the face of the earth, but darkneſſe:
nothing in Heauen but darkneſſe. Ye may read this Matt. chap.
24. verſe 29. Luke chap. 21. verſe 25. Chriſt giues theſe ſame
ſignes himſelfe, that ſhall be immediatlie before his comming.
What ſhall be the eſtat in the mean-time of thoſe who are liuing
when theſe ſignes ſhall appear? Al conſciences ſhall be wakned,
all ſhall get vp, there ſhall be no ſleeping. The murtherer vvho
hes his conſcience ſleeping now, ſhall be wakned then: the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
conſcience ſhall waken. There ſhall be two ſorte of folke
found liuing then; ſome reprobate, ſome elect; the world is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vvithout theſe tvvo. As for the reprobate vvhen they ſhall
looke vp and ſee ſuch a wonderfull alteration, the ſhaking of
the Heauens, the darkning of the Sunne, and Moon, then they
ſhall beginne to ſhudder and to be ſtriken with ſuch a terrible
fear, that, they ſhal be as they wer dead: and for fear of that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that is to follow, they ſhall run and ſeeke holes and ſecret
places to hide them from the face of the Lord, and cry, <hi>Hilles fall
dovvn on vs, Mountains couer vs,</hi> Yea, euen ere they ſee the Lord
before his comming down, Read of this in Luke 21. 27. Reuelat.
chap. 6. verſe 16. &amp;c. Now as to the elect that ſhall be found
aliue at that tyme, they ſhall conceiue at the ſight of theſe firſt
ſignes an vnſpeakable joye, and ſhall not be afraide, but ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaite
for that Redemption, which they ſhall ſee to be at hand,
that full Redemption in the Redeemer the Lord Ieſus. And
therefore, they ſhall not runne away and ſeeke holes to hyde
them in, but they ſhall ſtand vp and lift vp their heades and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to the Heauens and ſhall looke greedilie for the comming of
the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: indeede it is true, they ſhall conceiue a
ſorrowe and ſhall be touched vvith a remorſe, and ſhall vveepe
bitterlie; but a ſweete weeping they ſhall weepe, that euer their
ſinnes procured the death of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that Lord
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16659:118"/>
of glorie. Therefore, they ſhall be both joyfull, and ſorrowfull:
joyfull, becauſe the Redeemer is at hand: ſorrowfull, for their
ſinnes, that Chriſt ſhould haue died for them; that they ſhould
haue peirced him through with them. Reade of this at length
Luke chap. 21. verſe 28. Zachary chap. 13. verſe 11. Reuel. chap.
1. verſe 7. yea, they who peirced him through, with their ſinnes,
ſhall bewaile him. All the godlie Kinges of the earth ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
him; all the elect ſhall ſorrow, that their ſinnes ſhould haue
procured the death of this ſweete and glorious Lord. This for
the ſignes immediatly going before his comming. Vnderſtand
(brethren) that there ſhall be a proceſſe of tyme in the day of
judgement, ſo that one thing ſhall (by a certaine ſpace) goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
another. It ſhall be ſodaine, but, not ſo ſodaine, but they
who are aliue, ſhall ſee one thing done by a ſpace of time before
another; it ſhall be ſo ſenſible, that euerie one that is liuing at
that day ſhall ſee euery thing done ſenſible.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the ſignes joined with his comming. At his
down comming,<note place="margin">Signes ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vvith the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt.</note> when the Lord riſes out of his Throne, before
he be ſeene, the whole world that ſhooke before he roſe, ſhal be
ſet on fyre, and there ſhall be a terrible diſſolution: All thinges
ſhall be diſſolued, and ſo ſhaken lowſe, that the world ſhall not
appeare, vnto the tyme it bee made a nevv Worlde, a nevv
Heauen, a new Earth, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes. Come to the particulares.
As to the Heauens, they ſhall bee burnt vp, and being burnt vp,
they ſhall paſſe away with a ſound and noyſe (ſaies <hi>Peter)</hi> as
the ſounding of Chariot-wheeles. The elements, the aire, the
water, all ſhall be conſumed with fire, and be burnt vp and eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.
The earth, and all the workes on the earth, planting, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
all ſhall be burnt vp with fire, nothing ſhall be ſpared.
Theſe ſhall be the ſignes that ſhall be joined inſeparablie with
Chriſts comming.<note place="margin">The ſigne of Chriſt.</note> In the meane tyme he ſhall come down, when
all the world ſhall be on a fire. And this is called by <hi>Matthevv
24</hi> verſe 30. the ſigne of Chriſt, the ſigne that ſhall be conjoined
with his comming. Reade of this whole matter in this 24. chap.
of <hi>Matthevv</hi> verſe 30. 2. Epiſt of Pet. chap. 3. verſe 10. 12. Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.
chap. 20. verſe 11. and chap. 21. verſe 1. Then brethren, if
there was ſuch a commotion in the heart of men, in the firſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
that paſt before, what commotion ſhall there be in the harts
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:16659:118"/>
of men, when they ſhall ſee the whole world on fire? A won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
thing. When all this conſumption ſhall be, no body ſhall
be burnt, but the power of the judge ſhall reſerue the bodies to
the judgement that is to follow immediatlie. <hi>Peter</hi> when he hes
tolde of theſe ſignes, ſaies, If ſuch a diſſolution of the world be,
what maner of men ſhould we be? how ſhould we ſtudie to
prepare vs to meete the Lord? So on that great day, all theſe
thinges ſhall not make the godly to ſhrinke, but they ſhall ay
preaſe forward to meete the Lord in the cloudes. As to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,
ô, that horrour and terrible feare that ſhall ouertake
them at his comming! Now this for the two ſorts of ſignes. The
firſt, going before his comming: the ſecond, joined inſeparably
with his comming down to judge the world.</p>
               <p>Now, ſhortly to ſpeake of Chriſts owne comming. And this
is it which the Apoſtle ſpeakes of in this place. Which for our
vnderſtanding I ſhall gather out of this and ſundry other places
of the Scripture.<note place="margin">Chriſtes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming.</note> Now as for the comming of the judge, he ſhall
not come from the Sea, from the Earth, from the Plane. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
commes all the Kings of the earth, when they are in their
triumph? The Romane Emperours came out from the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll
in their Chariots. But, the King of Kinges ſhall come from
the Heauen of Heauens, abone all theſe heauens that we ſee,
from the higheſt place. The maner of his comming is ſodaine.
Theſe ſignes that I ſpake of, ſhall come on a ſodaintie; and yet
there ſhall be a proceſſe of tyme in doing thereof. He ſhall
come on a ſodaine, as the deluge of <hi>Noah</hi> did, as the 24 chap.
Matt verſe 37. telles. The people knew not of the deludge, that
ouerwhelmed them, vntill it came: No more ſhall this miſerable
world know Chriſtes comming, vntill he come ſodainlie. And
therefore, conſidering this, in the Scripture the Lord giues a
watch-word to his Diſciples: Many hundreth yeeres are paſt
ſince, and repeate it heere, he ſaies, Matt. 24. 42. <hi>Watch, for ye
knovv not vvhen the Lord ſhall come.</hi> The ſodaintie &amp; vncertainty
of his comming ſhoulde make vs euer readie to looke for it.
The Chariot he ſhall be caried in, is the cloudes of the aire. As
in his aſcending the cloudes reſaued him from our ſight, ſo ſhall
the cloudes reſaue him at his comming. Such a Chariot got ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
Emperour in all his higheſt triumph, none of them was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:16659:119"/>
in the clouds. The company that ſhall conuoy him: he ſhal
come, ſaies Matt. chap. 24. verſe 30. with the Angels, and a flame
of fire, that fyre that ſhall burne vp the world, and ſhall burne
vp the reprobate in the owne tyme. 2. Theſſ. 1. 7. 8. Iude ſayes,
verſe. 14. He ſhall come with millions of Angels, there ſhall
not be an Angell, but all ſhall come in that conuoye, to let all
the worlde ſee, that, all the Angels are but ſeruants to that Lord,
and ſeruantes ſtanding about him, to obey his vvill vvhat hee
commandes, that his glorie and Majeſtie may be ſeene. In the
meane-tyme he hes no neede of them, for they neyther can
adde to his glorie, nor diminiſh it: yet it hes pleaſed him, ſo to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his glorie to the vvorld. And in that meane-tyme, when he is
comming, he will not come in ſilence. Ye ſee, when an Armie
marches forward, there is a great noyſe and crying, ſhouting,
and blovving of trumpets: So, there ſhall bee a noyſe in the
Lords comming dovvne. The Angels of Heauen ſhall blovve
the trumpets. So he ſpeakes Matth. 24. verſe 31. <hi>Paul</hi> in this
place ſayes, there ſhall ryſe a ſound: The worde in this place
is a vvorde of exhortation, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

vvhich the Mariners vſes to others, euerie one to moue others

ſhall pearce through the graue and eares of the dead, and ſhall
waken them vp. With the ſhout ſhall be conjoyned the voice
of the Archangell, and with the voyce of the Archangell, the
ſound of the trumpet of God, and this ſhall be the laſt trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
and neuer ſhall the voyce of the trumpet be heard againe,
and it ſhall be the ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

when the Lord in his comming downe ſhall come to the place
where he is ordained to ſit, to judge the worlde, which ſhall be
in the cloudes: Then all the Angels ſhall ſhowe their preſence,
and the Angels ſhall make a glorious Throne to the Lord of
glorie, and there he ſhall ſit. This much ſhortlie for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
and appearing. I ſhall be ſhort in this matter. For, I will
ſpeake nothing but make a narration of it out of other parts of
Scripture.</p>
               <p>Would ye vnderſtand the effectes that followes on his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming?<note place="margin">Effectes follovving Chriſts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming.</note>
Certainlie notable effectes muſt followe on it. The
Lord prepare vs for it. The Father ſhall be there, the Sonne
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16659:119"/>
ſhall be there,<note place="margin">co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming.</note> the holie Spirite ſhall be there vvith all their
power, and all their Majeſtie. The glorie of the Father neuer
appeared ſo glorious, as it ſhall appeare that day. The glorie of
the Sonne neuer appeared ſo glorious as it ſhall appeare that
day. The glorie of the holie Spirit neuer appeared ſo glorious,
as it ſhall appeare that day. Ye ſee in the Parliament the Kings
of the earth appears in their greateſt glory to the people; ſo, the
Lord of the world ſhall appeare with an infinite and vncapable
ſight of glorie. Now to come to the effects that ſhall follow on
his comming.<note place="margin">Aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly.</note> The firſt effect. There ſhall be an aſſemblie, a
conuention, the faireſt conuention that euer was ſince the world
ſtoode. There are none that euer tooke lyfe, but all ſhall bee
there: all ſhall be ſommonded with the ſhout of the trumpetuall
ſhall compeare: no excuſe, the graue ſhall not excuſe, death ſhal
not excuſe, dead and liuing, neuer man, nor, woman excepted, all
ſhall be there. So, the firſt effect that ſhal follow the comming of
the Iudge, ſhall be a conuention of the whole world, elect &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,
dead and liuing. And I ſhall tell you, after what order it
wil be, by the Scripture. The firſt that ſhall come there to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention,
ſhall be they who were dead, they ſhall preueene them
who were alyue. And <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> ſhall be with the firſt,
and in the firſt ranke. For before they vvho in the vvorlde ſhall
be changed (which ſhall be in the twinkling of an eye; and it
ſhall ſtand to them in ſtead of death) ere this change be made,
the dead ſhall ryſe firſt. 1. Corint. 15. 51 52. Some of them who
are dead, ſhall ryſe to lyfe and honour, to witte, the elect: Some
of them, to wit, the reprobat, to diſhonour, ignominie and death,
and a worſe death nor they ly in preſently. Then when the dead
is raiſed vp, and compeares firſt, then ſhall follow that ſodaine
change of them who ſhall be alyue: the elect that ſhall be alyue
ſhal be altred in a moment, in the twinckling of an eie, to a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
eſtate. The reprobat aliue, ſhall be altered to, but, if they wer
ignominious before, they ſhal be more ignominious then: for, not
only their ſoule, but ſoule and body ſhal be vgly, and if they had
any beauty,<note place="margin">Estate of the bodies of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</note> it ſhall bee changed in a wonderfull foulues. But, to
ſpeak of the body of the elect: for, the Scripture ſpeaks moſt of
them. <hi>Paul</hi> (1. Cor. 15. verſe 35.) moues the queſtion, with what
bodies ſhall they ryſe? what bodie ſhall the elect haue? For, he is
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:16659:120"/>
not curious of the bodies of the reprobate, but he markes nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowlie
the riſing of the bodies of the godlie at that day. And
the firſt qualitie he giues them, is, that, whereas their bodies wer
naturall, when they were laid down in the graue, their bodies in
that day, ſhall be made ſpirituall: Not, that our bodies ſhall be
changed in ſpirites; no, our bodies ſhall be bodies indeed, of that
ſame ſubſtance they haue now. The verie ſame ſubſtance of
the bodie thou haſt in this lyfe, the ſame verie ſubſtance thou
ſhalt haue in that lyfe, and no other. It ſhall be preſent at that
day, that ſame verie bodie, that ſame very hand and foote, &amp;c.
and no other bodie, nor no other hand nor foote, &amp;c. And there
ſhall be none of the aſhes of the bodie, but it ſhall be keeped,
vntill that day, and ſhall be gathered vp and joined better, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it was before. Then, the bodie ſhall abyde. Our lyfe ſhall be
much better. I liue heere a naturall lyfe, by a naturall power in
my ſoule, but, in the reſurrection, my lyfe ſhall be ſpirituall, and
I ſhall not liue a naturall lyfe: Now I liue by a naturall power
in my ſoule, but, then, I ſhall liue ſpirituallie, by a ſpirituall power
in Chriſt. Yet, there ſhall be more. Another propertie of the
bodie ſhall follow on this. This bodie, if it were neuer ſo faire,
yet, in reſpect of the glorie it ſhall take vp, it is but ignominious,
but the bodie ſhall riſe glorious and ſhyning as the Sunne; not
by this naturall skin and colour that we haue here; but by a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
light and brightneſſe, conforme to that brightneſſe of
Chriſt, when he was tranſformed on the Mountaine. (Reade
Matt. 17. 1.) and conforme to his glorie in Heauen, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
telles Philipp. chap. 3. verſe 21. Yet more, ye ſee our bodies
weake. The ſtrongeſt man is ſoone beatten downe for all his
ſtrength; all the povver of man is feeble and weake, but in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
the bodie ſhall be ſtrong and pithie. One man (to be
homely with you) ſtronger in the reſurrection, nor an hundreth:
yea, nor thouſands are now. For, all feebleneſſe ſhall be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
him in the graue, and he ſhall ryſe ſtrong, lyke the Angels
in glorie and ſtrength. Yet more then this. (What matter of all
this former glorie, if it were poſſible, that, this ſpirituall bodie
could periſh:) The Apoſtle addes to this. We ſhall riſe incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
immortail, to lyfe euerlaſting: when we ſhall ryſe in
that ſtrength, that power and freedome, immortalitie ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:16659:120"/>
after mortalitie, glorie after ignomnie, ſtrength after weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſpiritualitie after naturalitie. In lyfe we ſhall be ſpirituall,
in qualitie glorious, in tyme euerlaſting, there is no end of it.
This is the propertie that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of our bodies in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
               <p>Now to goe forward. There ſhall followe more in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention.
That ſame power that ſhall conueene all men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats.</note>
that ſame power ſhall make a ſeuering. The Angels, the
Miniſters of that glorious judge, ſhall ſtoppe in betweene the
elect and the reprobate, and putte them a ſunder. They ſhall
ſeuere the ſheepe from the goates, they ſhall put the ſheepe at
the right hand of the judge, and the goates at the left hand.
Reade Matt. chap. 25 verſe 33. Appearantlie <hi>Paul</hi> heere would
meane to vs another kynde of ſeuering: and yet all is one.
This appearantlie vvoulde be his meaning. They ſhal al be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together on the earth, and all ſhall ſtand together in a
troup, and then this ſeuering ſhall be made: Then all the elect
ſhall be reſt vp to the cloudes, to meete the Lord in the cloudes.
As for the reprobate, they ſhall all ſtand ſtill on the earth, and
ſhall not get that honour, to be reſt vp in the aire, but ſhall byde
on the earth, and receyue their judgement there. For, <hi>Paul,</hi>
vvhen he ſayes, they ſhall be reſt vp to meete the Lord in the
aire, he ſpeakes onely of the elect. Then, there ſhall be a ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
after which there ſhall neuer be a meetting againe: a great
golfe ſhall be betweene them that none may paſſe: We are all
mingled heere through other, and none knowes other: The
ſheepe oft-tymes are taken for the goates, and the goates for the
ſheepe; but, at that great day, the ſheepe ſhall be ſeuered from
the goates, and ſhall neuer meete againe, be it man with wyfe,
parents with children. There are two effects, a conuention of all,
and a ſeuering of all.</p>
               <p>Yet the Iudge and the power of the Iudge ſhall paſſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
and the third effect followes. When the Judge hes all
gathered together and none avvay: vvhen the rovve is called,
and all are preſent: Then vvhen one ſorte ſhall be placed at
the right hand,<note place="margin">Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</note> and the other at the left hand; then ſhall he fall
to judgement: He cannot judge before he ſeuere; the verie ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
telles the judgement: but, before the ſeuering, the judgement
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:16659:121"/>
ſhall not be pronunced. Then generallie he ſhall judge all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their workes. The bookes ſhall be opened, the book
of conſcience ſhall be opened, the booke of workes ſhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
and al their judgement ſhal be according to their works
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

his lyfe: but he ſhall be judged by his works as a teſtimony
of his faith in Chriſt and of the maner of lyfe that he hes liued in
the worlde as a member of Chriſt: So he ſhall be judged by his
workes; not as a cauſe, but as a token of the true cauſe, as ye
would judge a man by a witneſſe: for the workes ſhall be the
tokens of the true cauſe, which is, the onely juſtice of Chriſt
imputed vnto vs by faith. I dare ſay, albeit the reprobate wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

part of that glorie and felicitie of that lyfe. Novv is there no
more nor this? What matter if it vverfor a tyme vve vvere to be
with him? What matter of Heauen if Heauen laſted not? What
matter of a Kingdome that vaniſhes away? A man ſet vp on a
pompe to day, caſten down to morrow? what matter of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
glory, let be the earthly glory, if it laſted not? but the Apoſtle
ſaies we ſhall be with him <hi>for euer.</hi> Take vp then our bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
It ſtands in two pointes; firſt a paſſing and exceeding joy
and glorie: and ſecondlie in an eternity and euerlaſtingneſſe of
joy and glorie. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly and pithilie ſettes theſe two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
2. Cor. chap. 4. verſe 17. He calles it a weight of glorie, that
is excellent: Then he calles it an euerlaſting glorie. There are
two, a weight of glorie, and an euerlaſting vveight of glorie,
and more exceſſiuelie exceſſiue. He cannot get wordes to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it. It is a weight that will vveigh dovvne all the vvorlde, and
then a weight of glorie exceſſiuelie exceſſiue, and then eternall
and euerlaſting. So our felicities in glorie, and paſſing great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and an euerlaſting glorie. As for the paines of the reprobate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I will not inſiſt to ſpeake of them, becauſe the Apoſtle is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heere to comfort the elect.</p>
               <p>Now when the Apoſtle hes made a diſcourſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Chriſt, He makes his exhortation and ſayes, and ſo I ſay
alſo, <hi>Comfort one another vvith theſe vvordes.</hi> Brethren, many hes
ſought comfort, death is dolorous and weariſome in the owne
nature: and therefore, many of the Heathen hes buſied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to get comfort and matter of conſolation in the houre of
death. What matter of death, if there be a comfort therein? but
then is death dolorous when it is without comfort. But, vvas
there euer any that got comfort that knew not Chriſt, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
and a life after this life? no, neuer man; neither king nor
Emperor. As for all the comforts they had, all was but vanitie,
and dreames of comfort. Againe I ſay. Was there euer anie
that gaue comfort to a bodie in death, or that gaue comfort
to them that vvas heauie for the death of their freinde, but that
man that hes a ſenſe of that glorious reſurrection of Chriſt and
of his comming? And therefore, as thou wouldſt haue comfort in
death &amp; giue comfort for death; know, that, the Lord is to come
in the world: knovv, that, there ſhall be a glorious reſurrection,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:16659:122"/>
and after the reſurrection there ſhall be an eternall joy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in Heauen. And looke, that, this be not onely wordes in the
mouth. There are many vaine bablers of Chriſt, and of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
reſurrection: A knaue, an adulterer, a murtherer will flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
himſelfe, and clatter of that glorie and joy: but all is vanity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Wilt thou be a knaue, and then ſpeake of theſe thinges? The
Lord ſhall puniſh thee. Looke therefore, that, thy ſpeaking of
the latter day be not in vaine wordes; Heauen and lyfe euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
is not in wordes; but, looke, that, it be fectfull in the heart,
and that, of the aboundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeake. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou ſpeake, feele it in thy heart, and then ſpeake. So ſayes
<hi>Paul</hi> 2. Cor. chap. 4. verſe 13. <hi>I beleeue I ſhall ryſe, and therefore I
ſpeake to you.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayes, <hi>I beleeue, and therefore I ſpake.</hi> Pſal.
116. 10. And ſay, I pray God that I beleeue all theſe thinges that
I ſpeake to you. The Lord giue euerie one of vs grace, that, we
may beleeue all theſe thinges of Chriſtes comming, and of the
glorious reſurrection: For, vvithout Faith and Hope, of
theſe thinges, no comfort, no lyfe. The Lord giue
vs Faith and Hope, vntill he bring vs to the
full ſight and fruition of theſe thinges
throgh Chriſt. To whom with
the Father and the holie
Spirite, be all honour

the Lord Ieſus, the Iudge of the world in

They ſhall be with him for euer.</p>
               <p>Now to come to this text we haue in hand. The Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
hearing and vnderſtanding that the Lord will come from
heauen, Ieſus will come and judge the world, might haue moued
the queſtion to the Apoſtle, about the tyme of his comming:
when he will come? what yeer, what day, what houre, what time
generally ſhall we looke for him? The Apoſtle meetes this, and
anſwers, <hi>It is not needfull, brethrer, that I vvrit vnto you of the times
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:16659:123"/>
and ſeaſons: for ye yourſelues knovv perfectly that the comming of the

goe calculat dayes and yeeres to you? ſeeing that the Lord ſhall
come at vnwares, and on a ſuddainty: the world ſhal not wit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he come. And he proues this in the next verſe from the effect
of his comming. They who ſhall be found in a deadlie ſecuritie
ſleeping, they ſhall be ſtriken ſodainly: <hi>For vvhen they ſhall ſay,
Peace and ſafetie, then ſhall come vpon them ſodaine deſtruction, as the
trauaile vpon a vvoman vvith chylde, and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi> And
vpon that followes an exhortation to vigilance. Now to come
to the words of the text, <hi>I need not vvrit to you,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle,
<hi>concerning times and ſeaſons.</hi> It is not needfull (would he ſay) it is
not expedient, it is not profitable to you, yea more it pertaines
not to you to know it. As the Lord ſaies Act. 1. 7. when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
a litle before his aſcenſion was curious to know the times,
he ſaies, <hi>It is not expedient to you to knovv the tymes and the ſeaſons

                  </gap> By times is meant, all times leſſe or more,
whether it be the time of an houre, a day, a weeke, yeere, or any
greater tyme. It pertaines not to you to knowe anie tyme of
Chriſtes comming, yea to knowe in what age of the worlde, let
be, the moneth, weeke, yeere, or day it ſhall be. It pertaines not to

it is not for you to know this.</p>
               <p>Now to marke ſomething, for I vvill not goe deeplie in this
matter. We learne of the text immediatly going before. There
is nothing vnder the Sunne more ſure not this, that, Chriſt vvill
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:16659:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
come.<note place="margin">Certainty of Chriſts comming.</note> This is a thing that euerie one of vs is bound to knowe,
that Chriſt will come and ſit in judgement, and put an end to all
thinges in this worlde And this is an artickle of our Creed. <hi>From
thence he vvill come to iudge the quick and the dead.</hi> If thou beleeue
not that Artickle, howbeit thou beleeue all the reſt of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickles,
thy faith is nothing. Then the ſecond thing I marke of
this, is, the curioſitie of the Theſſalonians. This curioſitie hes
beene in all ages, that when any man heard tell that the Lord
Ieſus is to come againe, and to judge the world, and to put an
end to all thinges, in all ages there hes riſen vp men curious to
vnderſtand the tyme, and to ſearche when he ſhall come. The
Apoſtles begouth this:<note place="margin">Curioſitie in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tyme of Chriſtes comming repreſſed.</note> for, immediatlie before the aſcenſion of
our Lord, they vttered this curioſitie, asking the tymes and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of his comming againe. But incontinent their curioſitie is
ſnibbed and repreſſed by the Lord, Act. 1. 7. From that tyme
men hes neuer left off to be curious of theſe tymes and ſeaſons.
Men hes beene curious to lay an account if Chriſtes comming
ſhall be in this yeere, in this age: yea, men in our age hes done
this: but all is vanitie. Now thirdly, I note on <hi>Pauls</hi> part, and
his anſwere to them. Men ſhould not ſearch in curiouſlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
the tyme of Chriſtes comming. Men ſhould not ſeeke the
moneth, day, yeere nor age: that perteines not to them. There is
great difference betweene the firſt comming of Chriſt, and his
ſecond comming. As to the firſt comming, it was the will of the
Lord that the tyme of his comming ſhould be knowne to the
world: And therefore, he reuealed the yeere of his comming to
the olde Prophetes. As ye may ſee <hi>9 Daniell.</hi> And as <hi>Peter</hi> telles
1. Epiſt. chap. 1. verſe 10. <hi>They ſearched in to the very tyme of this
comming,</hi> and they did nothing but that which they ſhould haue
done. And Chriſt findes fault with the hypocrite Iewes, that
could take vp by the sky what maner of weether ſhould be, but
ſearched not the tyme of his comming. Luke 12. 56. But as to
his ſecond comming, he neuer tolde of the tyme of it. Yea, in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell</hi>
in his laſt chapter 4. verſe, there is a plaine inhibition to
ſeeke out the tyme of it. Therefore, it perteines not to men to
know it: yea, it is better not to know the tyme of it, nor to know
it. And this Chriſt means Matt. 24. 42. <hi>Watch therefore, for, ye
knovv not at vvhat houre your Master vvill come.</hi> Where he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:16659:124"/>
vs, that the ignorance of the tyme of his comming is verie
profitable for vs, becauſe it makes vs to watch and pray, wheras
the knowledge of it would make vs careleſſe.</p>
               <p>Ye may aske at me, May we on no wayes ſpeake or thinke
of the Lords comming to judge the quick and the dead, and the
tyme thereof? I anſwere. To define a ſpeciall tyme, either in the
cogitation or thought of thy heart, or in the words of thy mouth
thou canſt not, nor thou ſhouldeſt not doe it. But generallie to
thinke and to ſay, the Lord will come ſhortlie, whether this age,
or the next age, I know not: but, I know well, it ſhall not be long
when the judge ſhall come, it ſhall be ſoone: it is lawfull for thee
to thinke and ſay this. For, the Lord himſelfe hes ſaid, When it
is craued (Reuel. chap. 22. verſ. 20.) <hi>Come Lord Ieſus, yes</hi> (ſaies he)
<hi>I come ſhortly.</hi> When he ſayes, he will come ſhortlie, let vs beleue
it. The Hiſtorie in the Goſpell Matt. 24. 25. &amp;c. of the euill and
the good ſeruant, teaches vs what vve ſhoulde doe, vntill the
Lords comming. The euill ſeruant ſayes, My Maſter delayes
his comming home, therefore, he will begin to play the wanton,
and to drinke, and to ſmite his companions. The good ſeruant
will ſay, I am looking for my Maſters comming ſhortlie: he will
come at noone-tyde, or midnight, or Cock-crow, I will wait for
it, and therefore, I will be vigilant. And ſo this good ſeruant tels
that we ſhould euer await for the Lords comming diligentlie.
And ſurelie his comming is neare, and faine would the godlie
haue his comming, to end their miſerie, and to perfite the joy
and glorie he hes appointed for them. And therefore, the Lord
ſaies, I come ſhortlie, I ſhall not be long. And albeit we thinke
it be long ſince he promiſed this: yet, thinke not, he delayes his
comming. For, a thouſand yeeres, in the ſight of the Lord, are
but as an houre. 2. Pet. 3. 8. and in reſpect of him, there is neyther
long nor ſhort tyme. So, thinke euer with the good ſeruant, the
Lord will come ſhortlie, and he is daily comming: yea, and we
ſhould deſire him to come ſhortly euerie day, and we ſhould
euer patientlie waite for it. And therefore, this clauſe is added in
the Lords prayer, Let thy Kingdome come: Which deſires, that,
he would perfite that worke of glorie. Ye ſee <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, 2.
Tim. 4. verſe 7. 8. <hi>I haue fought a good fight, I haue keeped the
faith, I haue runne out my courſe.</hi> Then, he ſubjoines. <hi>But, vvhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes?

on a ſodaintie, and the certaine tyme of the comming of Chriſt.
If I knevv the Lord vvould come ſodaintie, it is follie to me
to trauaile to knowe the ſpeciall houre thereof: vvhen thou

verſe 42. And who euer hes trauailed in any age to count the
houre and tyme of his comming, the Lord hath lette them ſee
they are confooted of error, and the Lord hes condemned that
labour. It is a bolde thing to man to ſeeke out that thing the
Lord hes hid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men will ſtand vp and calculat ſuch a yeere of the
Lords comming. O vanitie, thou paſſes thy boundes, and thou
had no ſuch thing in commiſſion giuen to thee. The Lord keepe
vs from ſuch vanitie.</p>
               <p>But, to goe forward: in the the thirde verſe the Apoſtle giues
the reaſon of the ſodaintie of the comming of that day as a thief
in the night. <hi>For, vvhen they shall cry Peace, Peace, &amp;c.</hi> As he
woulde ſay, The effect ſhall ſhovve it, byde, vntill he come.
The ſodaine deſtruction at his comming ſhall ſhovve his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
comming. When they ſhall ſay, peace, &amp;c. and ſay, all is
well, ſhut the doores, and be merie, then, on a ſodaintie, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
ſhall ouertake them. Then, I ſee, that, the death, that
men ſhall die at Chriſtes comming, ſhall bee a ſodaine death.
Who euer ſhall die at Chriſtes comming, ſhall die ſodainlie. A
great difference betweene this death, which vve die novv, and
that death, which ſhall be at Chriſts comming. When men now
dies, they get leaſure to die. There is patience in God, there is
leuitie and long ſuffering: for, when we ſee we are on death-bed
neuer to liue againe, then, he drawes vs to repentance, and he wil
not ſodainlie ſtrike vs to death, but giues vs tyme to amend and
turne to him. A murtherer he will take him and caſt him in
priſon, and vvill let him a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yde there, to ſee, if hee vvill repent.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:16659:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So, there is patience now: But, in the day of judgement, there
ſhall be no lenitie, nor, patience. And if thou be a reprobate, thou
ſhalt not haue grace nor tyme, to ſay, Lord, be mercifull to me:
for, er thou end the word, when thou beginſt to ſpeak, thou ſhalt
be ſtriken. And what means this? Euen, that, this is the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
day, the day of Gods patience and long ſuffering. Repent
therefore. Sit not the tyme, for, certanilie, wilt thou ſit the tyme,
vntill that comming? no patience, no grace, no repentance, but a
change ſhall be in the twinckling of an eye. The Lord when he
giues vs tyme to repent, giues vs grace alſo to repent. Thinke it
a great bleſſing, when the Lord layes thee in paine, that he giues
thee that tyme to repent, and make vauntage of it.</p>
               <p>Now the wordes woulde be marked. <hi>For, vvhen they ſhall ſay,
peace, then ſhall come on them ſodaine deſtruction.</hi> In the chapter go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before, the firſt death was called a ſleepe, yea, the reprobate
when he is ſtriken it is called a ſleepe; and where ſleeping is,
there is a waking againe: But, the ſecond death is commonlie
called deſtruction, an vtter wreak and deſtruction, and no death.
In the 2. Epiſt. Theſſal. chap. 1. verſe 9. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſtes
comming to judgement and paine of the reprobate, he caſtes to
a propertie to this worde, and calles it <hi>an euerlasting deſtruction.</hi>
Heere, he calles it a ſodaine haſtie deſtruction. How can theſe
two ſtand? Well eneugh: for, in the comming of Chriſt, it ſhall
be ſodaine: and yet, albeit the comming be ſodaine, the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhall be endleſſe and not ſodaine. Well were them, if they
were beaſtes: for, ſo ſoone as the branes of a beaſt are beaten out,
then, the wreak of it is done: But, the reprobate ſhall ay be deing,
and neuer be dead, ay wreaked, and neuer an end of their wreak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
What matter, if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the end of ten thouſand yeeres, there could
be an end of their deſtruction. <hi>Paul</hi> in that place giues a
reaſon of that endleſſe deſtruction. (There is none of vs but we
ſhould vnderſtand this) Seeke the cauſe from the judge and
ſtriker: The cauſe is not ſo much in the man ſtriken, as in him
who ſtrikes, who is infinite. And therefore, the paine is infinite.
As for exemple. Let a King, or, Monarch take a man &amp; torment
him, and yet holde his lyfe in: Burne him, and boyle him with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yle, yet, that paine ſhall end. Let him pull the skin off him, doe
what torment he can to him, yet, that paine ſhall end. For, neuer
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:16659:126"/>
a Monarch yet could keepe a man in endleſſe paine: they may
well pyne folke, but that paine ſhall haue an end: all the judges
power is bounded and limited, and therefore, he muſt haue an
end in his tormenting: But, the Lord is inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t. And therefore, he
may torment in pain euerlaſtingly. Al torment here, is but childs
play, in reſpect of the heauy judgements of God: what matter, to
fall in mans hands: their wraith and power is nothing, in reſpect
of that infinite wraith of God, who puniſhes, without an end of
paine. Hell is not ſo light a thing, as men trowes. That terrible
day is not as men beleeues. Therefore, in vvhoſe handes that
euer thou caſt thy ſelfe, caſt not thy ſelfe in the handes of an
angrie God: No, rather chuſe to die ten thouſand tymes, ere
thou fall in the handes of an angrie God: If thou knew the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Hell, tho would be afrayed. So, the thing eſpeciallie
we ſhould care for, in this lyfe, is, euer to ſeeke, to ſtand in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with him, to be war of his wraith, and rather take on thee
the wraith of the whole world.</p>
               <p>Now, he notes the tyme, when this ſodaine deſtruction ſhall
fall. When they ſhall be ſaying, Peace and ſafetie, at this tyme,
ſcarcely ſhal he haue ended the word, when the ſtrok ſhal light.
We reade of <hi>Belſhazzar, Daniell 5. 5.</hi> who was prophaning the
veſhels of the Lords houſe and crying peace; but, he had not
ſpoken the word, when all his joints ſeuered, and the hand writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on the wall afrayed him. In the wordes, marke tvvo things.
Firſt, on whom ſhall this ſodain deſtruction fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſecondly, what
tyme ſhould this deſtruction be. Then, vvho is it, on vvhom
this ſodaine deſtruction falles? The vvord beares, men and we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
making mirth in this earth, without the care of God, or,
man. The thiefe when he breakes in in a houſe in the night,
vvho is it in the houſe, he oppreſſes? If there be a bodie, that
is founde ſleeping, he vvill cutte his throte, but, if there be anie
waking and on his guarde, that man vvill eſcape the thiefe:
So, the Lord, when he ſhall come and will compaſſe the whole
vvorlde (as it were in a ſpanne) whom vvill he oppreſſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainelie?
Him vvhom he findes ſleeping in the ſenſleſſe bed
of ſecuritie, vvithout thought, eyther of God, or, of the Deuill,
ſuch a man, the throate of him ſhall be cutted, and hee vvill be
caſten in Hell incontinent. But, vvho ſhall be ſafe? They who

are watching and praying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lying alſo in a ſecuritie, but in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
ſecuritie hauing an aſſurance of Gods grace, and mercie to
them. Their throate ſhall not be cutted. But when is it, that the
bodie ſleeping in a deadlie ſecuritie ſhall be deſtroyed? Euen
when they are in the higheſt degree of ſecuritie.<note place="margin">Degrees of ſecurity</note> Of this ſleeping
and ſecuritie there are degrees. The beſt that liues is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

he is on the hight of his ſleepe, eating and drinking, then he is in

ye to be free of it? No truely, the Peſt had neuer ſo ſoone come
on Edinburgh, except ye had beene ſleeping. And I pronunce,
in Gods name, if there be not a wakning in tyme, and aryſing
vp out of this ſenſleſſe ſecuritie, there ſhall be another kynde of
death.</p>
               <p>Now brethren. Then compariſon would be marked, whereby
he ſettes out the ſodaine judgement <hi>Euen as a dolour takes a vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
vvith chylde,</hi> So ſhall that paine ouertake them. The dolour
of a woman trauelling, and the dolour in Hell is lyke other, in
ſundrie points. And therefore the Scripture takes oft the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of it, to deſcryue the paine of Hell, as in this part. Ye ſee, the
woman beares the matter of her paine in her owne boſome, the
childe: and where ſhall be the matter of pains of Hell, which
is ſinne, but in the catiues owne boſome? lykewiſe as a woman
with childe will be full of childe: So, the heart of a knaue will be
filled with wickedneſſe and be heauie, albeit he leape and skip
on the earth. They are lyke in ſodaintie. For, as the ſickneſſe
commes on the woman ſodainlie: So, the ſtrok of hel ſhall be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
and ſtriken ſodainlie. Compair theſe two paines in ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
As the woman hes a ſharp dolour, which if it laſted, were
vntolerable: if the Lord gaue not leyſure to draw their breath,
betweene ſhowre and ſhowre (as they call it) it were vntolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
So the paines of Hell are exceeding ſharp and vntolerable.
(But, heere, they differ. The womans paine is but for a tyme, but,
the paine of Hell indures for euer.) Againe, when the paine
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:16659:128"/>
will come on a woman, ſhe may be at the table eating or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or ſhe may be ſleeping, and it will ſodainelie take her. So the
paine of Hell will come ſodainly, when the wicked are eating
and drinking and making merie. But, alas, when the Apoſtle hes
compared it to the paine of a woman trauailing with chylde, he
hes not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aulde all, no not the thouſand part of that paine. The
paine of Hell paſſes all meaſure. The Scripture for our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
ſettes downe a comprehenſible paine to ſignifie an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible
paine. O, the incomprehenſible paine of Hell! Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
when thou ſeeſt a paine intolerable, thinke on Hell. And
ſay, O Lord, this paine on me albeit it be in the fleſhe, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ſore: therfore, Lord ſaue me from that exceeding paine
in Hell.</p>
               <p>Now when he hes ſpoken of the tyme and paine of it. He
ſayes, <hi>they ſhall not eſcape.</hi> Some will ſay, May not men and we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
flee? He therefore ſeales and ſtampes the worde vvhich
none can open. Thou ſhalt not eſcape. Art thou one who hes
bene playing and liuing in dead ſecuritie? thou ſhalt not eſcape.
The bullet came neuer ſo ſodainlie out of the gun, as the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhall come on the knaue and murtherer. Men will flee
theſe earthlie judgements, when the ſword commes, a knaue wil
flee from it. When the Peſt commes, it may be, that, a knaue will
eſcape, better, nor one, that is worthie twentie of him. O, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of God! Knowe ye what God will be doing in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme?
It may be, he is reſeruing the knaue and oppreſſour to a
ſorer judgement nor the Peſt: he may be keeping him to the
day of Judgement, when hee ſhall be ſtriken with the ſodaine
paine of Hell. And this is true. The longer he is reſerued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentes
not, the heauier ſhall the judgement be when it lightes.
For, the keeping of him is an occaſion to heape ſinne on him.
Keepe a murtherer who hes ſlaine one to day, if he repent not,
he ſhall ſlay another to morrow, and ay increaſe in ſinne. One
ſinne is the puniſhment of another; and a wicked man will run
from one ſinne to another, vntill he come to the head of the
ladder, and haue filled the cuppe full, and holde it vp in his hand,
ſaying, It is full. What is the Lord doing? Hes he done one ſin?
The Lord heapes vp an heape of wraith for him: Hes he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
another ſinne? He addes to another heape of wraith, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16659:128"/>
ſo, vntill the cuppe be full, the wraith of God is daily augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
vntill it be powred out on his head. Alas, will not the viſible
experience of Gods judgementes moue vs? But how euer it be
that men eſcape now, vntill Chriſt ſhall come to the judgement,
yet there ſhall be no eſcaping at that later day. O, the hand
of the Lord will ouer-ſpanne all, the Lords hand will draw
thee out, be where thou wilt be. It is true, at that latter day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſtes comming ſome will runne to one hole, ſome to

thing moſt ſure and certaine, that the
Lord Ieſus will come againe to judge the
quicke and the dead; ye heard againe in
the beginning of this chapter the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of the day and houre of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
vvhat age he ſhall come in, vvhat
yeere he ſhall come, vvhat month, what
day, vvhat houre, vvhether in the morning, noone-tyde, mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
cockcrow, &amp;c. No man knowes, neither is it reuealed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it a thing to be knowne, it is not for our well to knowe it,
but for our wel to be ignorant of it; for, if we knew it, it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender
a ſecuritie in vs; the ignorance of it is, or, at the leaſt, ſhold
be, an occaſion to vs of waking and preparation of vs, for it
makes vs ready at what time ſoeuer he ſhall come to meete him.
Alwaies when he ſhall come to the vngodly there ſhall be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
Iudgement ſhall ſuddenly ouertake a great nomber of
men and wemen that ſhall be found alyue at his comming, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:16659:129"/>
theſe who ſhall be glorying in the face of the world, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
all is well, ſhall be ſuddenly ſtriken, as the dolor commes on
a woman with chylde, and they ſhall not eſcape,</p>
               <p>Now to leaue all thinges taught before and to come to this
preſent matter I haue read. The Theſſalonians to whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
writes, hearing, that, at Chriſtes comming there ſhall be a
ſudden deſtruction, might haue conſaued a feare, (as no doubt
ſome of them did) they might haue thought, that, that ſudden
deſtruction ſhould haue ouertaken them at the comming of
Chriſt. The Apoſtle meetes this feare, with a comfort, and he
ſayes, to them who were turned, who were tranſlated from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to light. Brethren (vſing an homely ſtyle) <hi>Ye are not in
darkneſſe,</hi> the ſudden deſtruction ſhall ouertake them onely,
who at the comming of Chriſt ſhall be found in darkneſſe, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in blindneſſe, not knowing Chriſt: but, as for you, brethren,
that day ſhal not come on you as a thief, that ſudden deſtruction
ſhall not light on you. Indeede, it is true, it ſhall come on you at
vnawares, but it is as true, albeit it be vnawares, yet, it ſhall not
deſtroy you: The reaſon is, becauſe ye are not in darkneſſe, ye
are tranſlated out of that darkneſſe ye were before into, to
light, to the light of Heauen, and ſo ye ſhall be found waking
when the Lord ſhall come, and ſo ye ye ſhall eſcape that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
that ſhall ouertake them who ſhall be found ſleeping
in groſſe ignorance at that day. This is the meaning ſhortlie
of the Apoſtle in this place. Now to marke ſomething. Learne
heere, firſt, when the judgementes of God are threatned, when
mention is made of that latter judgement, and of that ſudden
deſtruction that ſhall be at Chriſtes comming. Who are they
that feares and trimbles? vvho are they that are ſtriken vvith
feare and terrour? It is not the wicked of the world that is lying
in darkneſſe, in the ignorance of God and of Chriſt, that is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for any threatning of a judgement. Threaten on a yeere, the
wicked who is indured in heart will neuer be ſtriken with feare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

that ſhall be at Chriſts comming in the world, tell him,
there ſhall be a day of count, and albeit he ſeeme in the mouth
to acknowledge it; yet, he ſhall ſcorne it in his heart. Reade the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:16659:130"/>
ſecond Epiſtle of <hi>Peter</hi> chap. 3. verſe 4. There the mocker is
brought in, ſaying, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his comming, for ſince
the Fathers died, all thinges continue alyke from the beginning of
of the creation.</hi> Chriſt indeede ſhall come to judge the quicke
and the dead, there ſhall be a generall judgement, and a count
and reckoning for all our actiones and vvorkes done in this
world, good and euill, and a ſudden deſtruction of the world:
yet, tell the mocker of theſe thinges, he ſhall ſcorne them all,
and he will thinke, all are but vaine fectleſſe threatninges. Yea,
not onely will the wicked contenine all the threatning of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but alſo the verie judgement it ſelfe that is lighted on him,
except it be all the heauier, he will contemne it. Read <hi>Fſay 9. 10.
They ſay</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>in the pryde of their heart, it is but bricke and clay
houſes that are casten dovvn to vs:</hi> (when the judgement commes
on them) <hi>but vve ſhall build vp again houſes of ſtone.</hi> Se the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt
of the judgement of God. So except the judgement be the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier,
they ſhall contemne it, and ſcorne God in his face. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
telles this. The Earle, the Lord, &amp;c. wil ſay when his houſe
is caſten down in the juſt judgement of God, What matter that
this houſe be caſten down, I ſhall builde vp one farre better, but
the Lord may make that new houſe fall about thy eares. So, the
world will neuer know the judgements of God, vntil the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
light on them to their deſtruction. Well then if the wicked
fear not the judgments of God, then, who feares? the godly, they
whom to the judgment of God pertains not:<note place="margin">The godly feare gods iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</note> And I dar ſay, in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh
the godlieſt is euer moſt feared for Gods judgments.
The Lord is terrible when he commes in judgment. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that day of judgement. 2. Cor. 5. 11. he vtters the feare he
had of it himſelfe, <hi>Knovving,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>the terrors of the Lord, vve
bring men to the Lord,</hi> that when he ſhall come in that terrible
judgment we may finde mercy: Be not ſenſles at the threatning
of God. If men had not bene ſeuſles at the judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, by
famine theſe yeers bygone, this Peſt had not comde: &amp; if theribe
not yet a greater fear of God, he ſhal ſtrik on with his judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</p>
               <p>Next I mark of this place. Who is it that is comforted againſt
Gods judgementes?<note place="margin">Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belong only to the godlie.</note> To whom belongs conſolations, promiſes,
and ſpeaches of comfort in the Scriptures? Speakes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the Heathen that ly in ignorance and not conuerted to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:16659:130"/>
the faith of Chriſt? They feared not, where there is no feare nor
down caſting, it is fooliſhneſſe to comfort. Whereto ſhold I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them who are lifted vp in pride? wherto ſhold I preaſe to lift
vp him who is ouer high and conceatie alreadie. So, conſolation,
raiſing vp of the heart, promiſes of God, that ſerues to conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pertaines nothing to the wicked, that hes no ſenſe of miſerie,
and lyes in ignorance of God: nothing pertaines to them but
threatning vpon threatning, judgement vpon judgement. And
when they ſay, Peace, and all things ſure; I may ſay, a ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
ſhall ouertake them. And to the men in this land lying
in a dead ſleepe of this fleſhly ſecuritie, and crying Peace, when
they are in the midſt of harlotrie of murther, &amp;c. I ſay a ſudden
deſtruction and vengence ſhall fall on them. This ſhall euer be
my cry, vntill they feare and trimble, and haue a ſenſe of their
miſerie. neuer another word to them, but judgement out of my
mouth. Should I ſay to a man lying in darkneſſe, brother, ye are
in the light, judgement ſhall not come on you? No, no: But I will
ſay, the Lord ſhall come ſuddenly on thee with judgement to
deſtroy thee. So, conſolation pertaines to the godly onely: and
who euer ye be that feares not Gods judgements, I bidde you in
Gods name take no promiſe of comfort to you, no conſolation,
vntill ye be touched with a ſenſe of miſerie and feele your ſins.
Then to whom pertaines all the promiſes of conſolation in the
word of God? To the godly onely who hes their eyes opened
to ſee God in the face of Chriſt, hes their heart opened to feele
the grace of God through Chriſt, to them they appertaine: And
therefore, ye ſhall finde in all the Prophetes when a judgement
is threatned, immediately after the threatning, they ſubjoine a
ſweet conſolation to the godly, leaſt they ſhould think the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to pertaine to them.</p>
               <p>The third thing I note. Marke the cauſe heere, wherefore the
Theſſalonians ſhall eſcape that ſudden deſtruction: <hi>Becauſe ye
are not in darkneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Knovve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in Chriſt the cauſe of eſcaping iudgement</note> ſayes he, therefore, that ſudden deſtruction
ſhall not ouertake you. Marke this cauſe. The ground of eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this judgement, is, to be fred of darkneſſe, to be fred of this
groſſe ignorance, wherein we are inuolued by nature, and to be
tranſlated to the light of God, vvherein we may ſee the face of
Chriſt and Heauen, and the glorie thereof. There is the ground.

againe, who euer they be that at Chriſtes comming ſhall be

When the thiefe breakes in in an houſe, whom is it that he
ſuddenly oppreſſes? Whom but theſe whom he findes ſleeping

But when he breaks in on an houſe, and they who are in the

night in ignorance of God. Giue thee goode cheare, reſt, play,

day of Iudgement. The Lord giue euerie one of vs grace to
know him; that hauing the right knowledge of him which leads
to ſaluation, we may at his comming be elected of him to raign
in his euerlaſting glory in the Heauens.</p>
               <p>Novv that vvhich he had ſaid before of darkneſſe, in the
next verſe he makes it more plaine, and ſayes, <hi>for ye are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of light, and of the day.</hi> That is to ſay, the faireſt light that
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:16659:131"/>
can be poſſible. For vvhat in this vvorlde is fairer nor the
light of the Sunne and day light. As he vvoulde ſay, ye are not
in the common light, but in the light of the Sunne that ſhynes
moſt cleare; ye are not children of the night, but of the day.
Theſe tvvo vvill neuer ſtande together, to be the chylde of
the night and of darkneſſe; and to be the chylde of the light
and of the day. If thou be the chylde of light and day, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to thee for to be the chylde of the night and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
And if thou be the chylde of the night and darkneſſe,
it is impoſſible thou can bee the chylde of the day and light.
Theſe tvvo can neuer agree both together. Tvvo Kingdomes
cannot ſtand in thee. If God raigne not in thee, the Deuill muſt
raigne in thee: and if God raigne in thee, the Deuill cannot
raigne in thee. Indeed ſo long as vve are heere, light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
may be both in vs, for vvee are neuer free of this darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
neyther is this light of God perſite in vs, but both cannot
raigne together in vs: but hovvbeit darkneſſe be in thee, yet
it hes no dominion ouer thee. For vvhere any ſparke of the
light of God is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the light raignes, and God raignes in thee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
thou haue great darkneſſe in thee: For vvhereuer God is
in any meaſure, he euer raignes. He ſayes, <hi>Ye are all the children
of the light, and the children of the day.</hi> Marke the vvordes. For
they import a pithie meaning. They meane, that not onely
they are in a light, but that in ſubſtance in a maner they are
light. As I am light, and thou art light; if thou be the chylde
of light, in ſubſtance thou art light, euen ſo as in ſubſtance thou
art a bodie, in ſubſtance likevviſe a ſoule; So in a maner in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
thou art light. For ye muſt vnderſtand this, the chylde
is euer by nature of the ſubſtance of the Father and Mother.
Then if ye be the children of light, of neceſſitie ye muſt be in
ſome maner of the ſubſtance of light. <hi>Paul</hi> Epheſ. chap. 5. verſe
8. ſayes to the Epheſians, that ſome tymeye vvere Gentiles, <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme
ye vvere darkneſſe, but novv ye are light in the Lord, vvalke
as children of light.</hi> He ſayes not ye vvere in darkneſſe, but he
ſayes in verie deed ye vvere in a maner a verie lumpe of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Then againe he ſayes not ye are in the light, but ye are
light, your ſubſtance and nature is changed in the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rarie,
vvhere ye vvere in ſubſtance darkneſſe, novv ye are in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16659:132"/>
light, turned from the ſubſtance of dakneſſe, to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of light. Now the words this way exponed, take vp an
higher ground and of the eſcaping of judgement at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Chriſt; It is not enough to be found in the light onely,
but thou muſt be found to be light it ſelfe, and the child of light.
I ſhall make this plaine. There are two ſorts of thinges and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in this world that hes light. There are ſome bodies that in
themſelues hes no light in the worlde, they are darke in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yet they will be in the light: As for example, Ye ſee the
black floore ye ſit on, it hes no light, of it ſelfe it is black; but
when the Sun ſhynes on it, it hes light and ſhynes. There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bodies that are not onely in the light, but in the owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are light, as the Sun, it is not onely in the light, but it is light
the ſelfe, and there is no other light to giue it light except the
ſelfe. Now to apply this. There are two ſortes of men and we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the Church of God. I leaue Pagans, Turkes and Iewes,
and I ſpeak of theſe who are in the Church, and profeſſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to be Chriſtians: There are ſome of them in the light, in
the midſt of the Saintes of God, and profeſſing the worde as
the Saintes does, that hes no light of themſelues, the light they
haue is the light of others; as for themſelues they are but black
bodies and black ſoules; Hypocrites that hes nothing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
but blackneſſe (an hypocrite hes nothing but blackneſſe,
and yet he will be in the Church, and as farre in as any man,)
but ſhynes in the light of the word, and of the Saintes of God.
Againe there are ſome who are not onely in the light, ſhynes
not onely in the light of others, but in themſelues are light, and
ſhynes in their own light, and there are beames that commes
from them, and lightens both themſelues and others that ſittes
with them; as the Sun both ſhynes the ſelfe, and makes other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
creatures to ſhyne. Of the which ſort were the Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,
<hi>Paul</hi> writes to them, Philip 2. 15. and ſayes, Ye are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt
with Pagans and Heathen, <hi>and ye ſhyne in the midst of them.</hi>
So who euer gets this grace to haue this light and to carie it out
to the world, they are the children of light. Now in the day of
judgement, it will not be enough to be in the Church, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the faithfull and renewed creatures, and among them
who are light, to be at preaching of the word, except thou be
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16659:132"/>
light of thy ſelfe: what care I, if the light wherein I ſhyne be not
my owne, but the light that ſhynes from another. If thou haue
no more, thou ſhalt be ſuddenlie deſtroyed. Therefore if thou
wouldeſt be fred from this ſudden deſtruction, ſeeke light, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
illumination, and neuer reſt nor be glad vntill thou
find in ſome meaſure, the regeneration of thy nature, and thy
ſelfe to be light in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Againe marke heere the vniuerſall partickle <hi>(ye all)</hi> He ſayes
not ſome, but he cals all the Theſſalonians the children of light,
and of the day he maks no exception, he is not ſo preciſe as men
are now. This learnes vs both Paſtor and people, a good leſſon
to be obſerued, to thinke and to judge the beſt of euerie man
and woman, that hes once receiued the ſeale of Baptiſme, and
hes giuen their names in baptiſme to Chriſt, and profeſſes chriſt
outwardlie For, albeit many of them will be hypocrites yet it is
our part after the exemple of <hi>Paul</hi> to call them the children of
light. Thou art ouer ſeueare a cenſurer to call them who hes
taine the name of Chriſt vpon them, the children of darkneſſe.
Seuere not thou the popple from the wheet, the caffe from the
corne, the goates from the ſheepe, vntill the Lord come and he
ſhall ſeuere them. Put not men in Heauen vvhen thou vvilt,
and men in Hell vvhen thou vvilt, but be ware vvith this raſhe
judgement.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the next verſe. Vpon the groundes he hes
laid, that all are in light and not in darkneſſe, and that which is
more, that they are the children of light and not of darkneſſe,
he gathers his exhortation. Then, ſayes he, if it be ſo that we
are the children of light, <hi>let vs not ſleepe, but let vs vvatch and be
ſober.</hi> This is the effect of the wordes. There are two thinges
that heere are forbidden, and two things that are commaunded.
The two things that are forbidden, are ſleeping and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
for vnder ſleeping, as the text that followes makes plaine,
is comprehended drunkenneſſe. Theſe two thinges goe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie
together; a drunken bodie is ay doting and ſleeping,
for the ſenſes of him are ſo burdened with ſurfet he can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ly downe and ſleepe. Now there are two thinges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended,
watching and ſoberneſſe, theſe two agree alſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
for a temperate man who hes moderation in drinking,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16659:133"/>
that man is able to watch when others ſleepe, and to do a good
turne in the night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But to goe through euerie one of them, and
to begin at ſleeping, for he beginnes at it heere. There are two
ſortes thereof. Firſt, a bodilie ſleeping, vvhen the ſenſes of
this bodie are choſed,<note place="margin">Sleeping.</note> the eyes cloſed, the eare cloſed, and all
the ſenſes cloſed, ſo that they leaue their function, that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a bodilie ſleepe. There is another called a ſpirituall ſleepe,
and it is the ſleeping of the ſoule and ſpirite, vvhen the eye of
the ſoule is bound vp, ſo, that, it hes no ſight of God, the eare
of the ſoule bound vp, ſo, that, it cannot heare the vvorde of
God. In one vvorde. When all the ſenſes that ſhould grippe
God are bound vp, and the ſoule is lying in a deadlie ſecuritie;
That is ſhortlie the ſecond ſorte of ſleeping. Novv in this
place I vnderſtand not chieflie this bodilie ſleepe, but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
ſleepe alſo. For this bodilie ſleepe is naturall, and is
lavvfull: the Lord hes ordained that theſe bodies of ours ſhould
be refreſhed vvith ſleepe; and if thou be ſanctified thy ſelfe,
thy ſleepe is ſanctified alſo, and all thy actiones, eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſleeping, and the reſt are ſanctified (if thou be not ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
all thy actiones, eating, drinking, ſleeping, are vnhappie
to thee.) Next I doubt not but at the comming of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, there ſhall be found ſome ſleeping in the bodies,
who ſhall be waking in their ſoules. Chriſt ſayes in the 17. of
Luke. 34. verſe <hi>Tvvo ſhall be in a bad ſleeping, one choſen, and another
forſaken.</hi> And laſt, albeit the bodie be a ſleepe, and all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſenſes cloſed, yet the ſpirite of man will be waking, the
eye of the ſoule will be opened, the eare opened; and in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie
ſleepe, if it were at mid-night, a man will be waking in
Chriſt, and apprehending him. So I vnderſtand that ſpirituall
ſleeping, for he forbiddes not this bodilie ſleeping onely, but
this ſpirituall ſleeping, when the ſoule is ſleeping without ſenſe
eyther of Heauen or Hell, and whoſoeuer ſhal be found ſo
ſleeping with his a ſoule altogether ſenſleſſe of Heauen and of
the lyfe to come, that ſoule ſhall periſhe without exception.
Sleepe on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the Lord come when thou art ſleeping, die ſhalt
thou, thou ſhalt not eſcape. There is no eſcaping for thee. But
to ſpeake of the bodilie ſleeping ſomething. Men ſhould be
ware to yeelde ouer much ſleepe to the bodie: for certainelie
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:16659:133"/>
where the bodie is ouer much giuen to ſleeping, it is a token of
a ſleeping ſoule, and who delytes in ſleeping in the bodie, the
ſoule appearantlie is ſleeping, and all moderation ſhould be
vſed. The ſluggiſher the bodie be, the ſluggiſher the ſoule is.
The vvalkrifer the bodie be, thee vvalkrifer the ſoule is. Now
the next thing that is forbidden heere is drunkenneſſe.<note place="margin">Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> There
are tvvo ſortes of drunkenneſſe, the one bodilie when a man
takes on ouer much drinke oppreſſing the ſenſes. This is ouer
well knowne in Scotland, and we finde ouer great experience
heereof. Then there is ſecondlie a ſpirituall drunkenneſſe,
vvhen the ſoule is oppreſt vvith ſurfetting and immoderate
care of the vvorld, vvhen it drinkes in out of meaſure the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of this vvorld, through deſire, all the riches of this world,
through ambition, all the honour, through a foule appetyte, all
the luſtes, So the ſoule becommes drunken and ſtopped, an aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious
bodie a dotting bodie, a man ſet on pleaſures a dotting
bodie. Trow ye when the ſoule is ſo oppreſt vvith this world
that it will get the eye opened vp to ſee Chriſt? No, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.
Chriſt ſpeakes of both theſe ſortes of drunkenneſſe
Luke chap. 21. verſe 34. Novv brethren, in this place, ye ſhall
vnderſtand not ſo much the outvvarde bodilie drunkenneſſe,
as the invvarde ſpirituall drunkenneſſe of the ſoule. Woe to
that ſoule that ſhall bee founde drunken vvith the pleaſures
and luſtes of this vvorlde, and ſo conſequentlie ſleeping vvhen
Chriſt commes. Yea farther, brethren, the verie outvvarde
bodilie drunkenneſſe is much to be eſchevved. For it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vvith drunkenneſſe as it is vvith ſleeping; for vve get li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
to ſleepe, if vve vſe it moderatlie. But God gaue thee
neuer leaue to vſe drunkenneſſe. So it is a dangerous matter
to be found drunken. It is a thing vnlavvfull and forbidden,
ye ſhall finde that a drunken bodie commonlie ſhall haue a
drunken ſoule, and vvoe to that ſoule, vvoe to that bodie,
vvhere both are giuen to drunkenneſſe. The Lord ſaue vs from
this ſort drunkenneſſe.</p>
               <p>Novv before I come to the other tvvo thinges that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
vnto vs in this place, the argument vvhereby he
diſſvvades them it vvoulde be marked, <hi>Let vs not,</hi> ſayes he,
<hi>ſleepe as others doe.</hi> As if he vvould ſay, Fy on you that ye ſhould
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:16659:134"/>
be haue your ſelues as infidels. It is the Gentiles that are ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Let them ſleep on, but ſleepe not thou. The exemple of
their ſleeping ſhould be an argument to you to watch. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emple
of their drunkenneſſe ſhould he an argument to you to
be ſober. Now, how reaſons the world? Is not this the faſhion
of all men, therefore why ſhould not I doe ſo? all men ſleepes,
why ſhould not I ſleepe? He drinkes vntill he be drunken, why
ſhould not I drinke vntill I be drunken. Companionry is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
good, I ſhould do as others do. But <hi>Paul</hi> reaſons other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies.
It is the infidels that are ſleeping and drunken, therefore
watch thou ô Chriſtian and be ſober: <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romans chap.
12. verſe 2 ſayes, <hi>Faſhion not your ſelues after the maner of the
vvorld, but be ye changed throgh the renevving of the spirite.</hi> Follow
not this ould ſleeping drunken world, but be changed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
Sprit, and be waking &amp; ſober. And indeed let euery one
looke to their owne experience, they who are once tranſlated
and tranſlated out of this world (for tranſplanted muſt thou
be in ſome meaſure if euer thou ſee Heauen) the more they ſee
men running on the courſe of the worlde, the more they deteſt
the world; the more ſinne they ſee, the more they deteſt ſinne;
the more drunkenneſſe and ſleeping they ſee in men, the more
they abhorre it. So the following of the multitude and the courſe
of the world teſtifies that men were neuer tranſplanted out of
this world, out of darkneſſe vnto the kingdom of light, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
in ſpirite, and if they continue on, they ſhall periſhe, for
this world will periſhe, and they who followes the world will
periſhe.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the two thinges commaunded. The firſt is
waking,<note place="margin">Waking.</note> the other is ſobrietie. There are two ſortes of watching,
the bodilie watching, when all the ſenſes are waking and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to doe their owne functions naturall. The ſecond, when
the ſoule of man is opened, the eye of the ſoule opened to ſee
Chriſt and the lyfe to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to ſee theſe thinges that the eye
of the bodie cannot ſee. It is a wonderfull light the ſoule hes,
for it ſees thinges inuiſible, and ſees in as it were to the verie
heart of God to a bottomleſſe deepe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for God is infinite. Yet for
all this, the heart that is once illuminate by the Spirite, will ſee
him. So the ſpiritual watching is, when all the ſenſes of the ſoule
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:16659:134"/>
are opened and hes the fruition of God in Ieſus, and all exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
about the graces of God through Chriſt, that is the ſpirituall
waking, which is heere ſpeciallie meant of, not the watching
of the bodie, but of the Spirite. For the bodie may be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the eye looking vppe, and all the ſenſes exerciſed in their
functiones. And yet the ſoule of the bodie may be ſounde
ſleeping: When the murtherer is buſieſt at his murther, albeit
he be ryding and running, the quickell man in bodie that euer
was, the ſoule in the meane-tyme is lying in a deadlie ſleepe.
So I doubt not but if the Lord Ieſus would come in this houre,
alas the vengence that would ouertake many of them. So they
who are in harlotrie, and their ſenſes exerciſed moſt in harlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
then they are moſt ſleeping in ſoule. Trow ye if the eye
of the ſoule ſaw God, that for all the world they would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
in ſuch a filthie exerciſe. So he meanes chieflie of the
watching of the ſoule. Indeede it is true (as I haue ſaid before)
it is good to be walkrife in bodie, for if thou be ſanctified, thy
bodie waking ſhall be exerciſed in ſome good exerciſe. And
therefore Chriſt in the garden immediatlie before his paſſion,
<hi>Matthevv</hi> chap. 26. verſe 4. woulde haue his Apoſtles wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in bodie, aſwell as in ſoule, <hi>least they ſhould enter into tentation;</hi>
for they ſleeped vntill his enemies came,<note place="margin">Sobrietie.</note> and ſo for feare they
left him. Then the ſecond thing commaunded is ſoberneſſe.
There are two ſortes of it: The one of the body, the other of the
ſoule. The bodie when it is not ſurfetted with any exceſſe: The
ſoule when it is not drunken with the world and pleaſurs therof,
is ſober: for, as the bodie hes her ſobrietie, ſo the ſoule hes the
owne ſobrietie, and heere, I ſpecially vnderſtand the ſobriety of
the ſoule, but indeed the ſobriety of the body is to be joined to it.
For the ſobriety of the body helps much to the ſobriety of the
ſoule. As I ſaid before, when the body paſſes meaſure in drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes,
the ſoule is commonly drunken to: ſo when the body is
in ſobriety, the ſoule is in ſobriety and applied to godlineſſe. So
both the drunkennes of ſoule and body is forbidden. In the 21.
of <hi>Luke 34.</hi> He ſaies, <hi>Be vvare leaſt your harts be prest dovvn vvith
ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe,</hi> that is of the body, <hi>and vvith the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
of the vvorld,</hi> that is of the ſoule. Therfore keep ſobriety in
body and ſoule. Then, brethren, there are two thinges forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:16659:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and two thinges commaunded viz. ſleeping exceſſiue, and
drunkenneſſe in ſoule and body forbidden: watching and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie
in ſoule and bodie commanded.</p>
               <p>Now in the next wordes, he giues the reaſon wherefore they
ſhould not ſleepe and be drunken, but watch and be ſober. <hi>They
that ſleepe, ſleepe in the night, and they vvho are drunken are drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the night.</hi> Now he would ſubſume, ye are not of the night,
therefore be ye not drunken, but be ſober. So this argument is
taine from the inconnenientneſſe of the tyme, it is no tyme to
you to be drunken now, ye are not in the night. Men vſes to
ſleepe and be drunken in the night, men who does euill ſeekes
darkneſſe. Ye are not in the night, but ye are the children of the
day. Therefore it ſettes not you to be ſleeping or drunken, but
ye ſhould watch and be ſober. I take vp the leſſon ſhortly. In
all our actions and doings we ſhould haue a ſpeciall reſpect to
the tyme: for there is great moment and weight in the tyme,
when we ſhould doe this thing, or that thing, and ſpeciallie in
the two tymes, the day and the night. All actions muſt be done
in theſe two tymes. The day hes the actions of the day. The
night hes the actions of the night. The actions of the day ſhold
not be done in the night: The actions of the night ſhould not
be done in the day. This ſhould be commonly keeped, albeit
neceſſitie ſometyme compels otherwaies. There are ſome acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are ſeemelie to be done in the day that is not ſeemelie
to be done in the night. As for exemple: It ſettes a man to be
wakng in the day, it is not ſeemely to wake in the night, except
neceſſitie compell. Againe there are ſome actions that are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to be done in the night and not in the day, as to ſleep in the
night, and it ſettes a man better to drunken in the night, (if he
would be drunken) nor in the day. It is a ſhame to be drunken
before the Sun and day light. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Rom. chap. 12. verſe 11.
12. 13. ſayes, Men and wemen <hi>ſhould vvalke in comelineſſe</hi> all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of way. So ſoone as thou goeſt out to the ſight of the Sun;
albeit none ſaw thee but the Sun. it becomes thee to be comely.
So thou who would be drunken, drinke in the night. Fy o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t,
that a drunken bodie ſhould come to the Sun, if there were no
more but the light of the Sun, it cryes to God for vengence on
drunkenneſſe, albeit no man ſaw it. Now brethren, there are
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:16659:135"/>
ſome vnnaturall men and wemen who will turne the action of
the day to the night, and the night to the day. Fy on thee that
preuents nature. When this faire Sunne ryſes in the morning to
comfort them, to let them ſee the face of it, and to doe their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in that function the Lord hes called them to, What will they
then doe? off their cloathes and goe to their beddes. Nothing
the moſt part of the day tyme, but dead ſleeping, except they be
conſtraint otherwaies. Then when the Sun goes down, they are
glad, and ryſes to their villany. And ſo they teſtifie that they
deteſt the glorious light of the Sun, which ſhould rejoyſe vs.
Alwaies when others goe to their beds, then they begin to riſe,
to eat and drinke, &amp;c. and to take their pleaſure, this is not come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and I tell thee, the vengence of God will light on thee, if it
were onely for the preuenting of the order of nature. Let the
day be day, and the night be night. No queſtion, this peruerting
of nature procures the heauy vengence of God to fall on them
and their houſes. Trow ye that God of Heauen, who ordained
nature, can ſuffer nature to be ſo abuſed without auengement?
No, I dare ſay, thou that doeſt ſlaye before the Sunne, the Sun
ſhall beare witneſſe againſt thee, and ſay, Lord this villan ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominably
committed murther in my eye, thou ſette me in the
Heauen that none ſhould worke villany in my eye, but he ſet me
to litle auaile. The Sun no doubt is wearied and groanes, to ſee
the wickedneſſe of men and wemen, and the creatures groanes
to ſee their vyle ſins and faine would be releued thereof. This
earth they goe on, groanes vnder the burdene and would as
faine be releued of them as a woman with childe would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued
of her birth. Well then, if the Lord will reuenge ſo a ſinne
that is done before the light of this Sun that ſhynes, and if the
light of this ſame verie Sunne aggreadges their ſinne before the
Lord and maks their judgement the greater. O what greatneſſe
muſt be in ſin, and how fearefull muſt the judgement be, when
ſin is committed with an vplifted hand in the face of Chriſt,
that Sun of righteouſneſſe ſhyning to vs in his Goſpell! The
villane cares not to commit filthineſſe in Gods preſence, he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to vs viuely in the Goſpell. Well were it to thee, thou hadſt
neuer heard of Chriſt and the Goſpell. Then more tolerable
might thou haue ſinned. But when in the face of God and chriſt,

greater contempt thereof, the greater judgement and damnation
for it. No not ſo much ſhalt thou be puniſhed for being a thief,
a murtherer, &amp;c. as for that (will the Lord ſay) thou ſpat in my

(brethren) vnto the Theſſalonians, was
that they ſhould not ſleepe nor be drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
but by the contrare, they ſhold wake
and be ſober. Two things are forbidden,
ſleeping and drunkenneſſe: Two things
recommended, waking and ſobrietie; the
ſleeping which he meanes is properlie a
ſpirituall ſleepe, when the ſoule ſleepes in a deadlie ſecuritie.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:16659:136"/>
Drunkenneſſe is not ſo much this bodily drunkenneſſe (which
is alſo forbidden) as the drunkennes of the ſoule, when the ſoule
takes a ſurfet of theſe earthlie thinges, ſo that it hes not the care
not ſenſe of that life, but is ſet altogether on vain pleaſures. The
waking he recommends is a ſpirituall waking, wakrifeneſſe in
ſoule when the ſenſes of the ſoule are opened, the eie of the ſoul
to looke to the face of Chriſt, to the glorie and life to come,
the care of the ſoule likewiſe opened to heare and receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
the Goſpell, which is the word of God vttered by the
Miniſter. The ſobriety that is recommended is properly that te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
of the ſoule when the ſoule is content with a moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

it not, not paſſing the bounds of rejoicing in this life, but ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the joy and pleaſure on the life to come, that is the inwarde
ſobriety of the ſpirituall man. Now when he hes ſet down his
exhortation he ſubjoines reaſons thereto, and the firſt reaſon to
moue them not to ſleepe, not to be drunken, is in reſpect of the
time wherin they are and for the inconuenience of the time: It is
no time to be drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he that ſleeps, ſleeps in the night; they that
are drunken are drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the night, No night now, ſince Chriſt
is come in the world there is a continuall daylight. And therfore
ſince it is not night, it ſets not you to ſleep and to be drunken as
if it were night. For in all the actiones in this lyfe we ought to
haue a ſpeciall regarde of the tyme wherein we doe any thing,
and ſpecially of theſe two tymes, the day and the night. The
actiones that becommes the day, ſettes not the night; and by the
contrare the actions of the night ſets not to be done in the day.
The Lord ſo diſtributes the doings of men that he hes giuen the
night his actiones and the day his actiones, and in a maner it is a
confuſion of nature and of the ordinance of God, to doe the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiones
of the day in the night, and the actiones of the night in

               <p>But to come to this text. In the firſt verſe we haue red the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
giues the reaſon wherefore they ſhould wake, as he gaue
the reaſon wherefore they ſhould not be drunken. It is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the eſtate vvherein they ſtand preſentlie. <hi>But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if we ſhould doe euerie thing in the owne tyme that God
hes appointed thereto. So the condition of men and women
who does any thing ſhould be regarded in their doinges, euerie
one ſhould doe as becommes their eſtate, condition and calling;
thou that art of a calling, ſhould not do that which pertaines to
another of another calling, thy actions ſhould be in that calling
God hes placed thee in. Now there are two ſortes of eſtates and
conditions of men in this world eſpeciallie to be conſidered.
The firſt the eſtate of the children of light: The ſecond, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
of the children of darknes, there are none but of neceſſity
they are of one of theſe conditions. Either they are the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of

               <p>Now to goe forwarde in this verſe. As he recommendes to
them theſe tvvo thinges, vvakrifeneſſe and ſobriety. So he
recommendes to them in the thirde place armour, wherewith
he will haue them inarmed. <hi>Putting on,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>the brest plate of

this place what is he doing? Inſtructing a warriour, a ſouldiour
what he ſhould doe, teaching him to wake and not to ſleepe, to
be ſober and not drunken, to be marmed and not to be naked.
Ye know in the worldly warriour there are three things requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:

the banner of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt their captaine. And as it
is requyred in the earthlie ſouldioures that they be vvake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſe.
Euen ſo it is requyred in the Chriſtian ſouldiours. The
next thing that is requyred in the Chriſtian ſouldiour is tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
haue not a drunken ſoule, thou who wilt be a ſouldior vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Chriſtes banner, thou muſt not be drunken with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of this vvorld. Novv theſe tvvo thinges are not eneugh,
vvith vvakrifeneſſe and ſobriety therfore thou muſt haue an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ſoule: as the bodie of the vvordly vvarriour muſt put on
armour, ſo thy ſoule muſt put on armour. othervvaies, vvhen
the enemie makes the aſſault he vvill preuaile againſt thee; if
ſinne make an aſſaulte, if thou be vvithout thy armour, ſinne
vvill preuaile. Brethren, (ye knovve and it is heere meant
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:16659:138"/>
by the Apoſtle) The worldly vvarriour vvhen he armes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he hes reſpect in ſpeciall to theſe two partes of his bodie,
the firſt his breſt where his heart lyes, where the naturall life hes
her chief reſidence: therefore he puttes on his breſtplate. The
next parte of the which he hes a ſpeciall regarde is of the head,
where all the ſenſes lyes. The head is the fountain of all the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and mouing of the body, and ſo he will put on an Helmet to
ſaue his head. If theſe two parts be well preſerued from wounds
he will regard the leſſe of the reſt of the body. If a wound be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
in the heart, no life: A wound in the head and branes,
no lyfe, but a wound in the leg, &amp;c. may be mended againe. So
the Chriſtian hes a chiefe regarde to two parts as it were, to the
heart vvhere his ſpirituall lyfe lyes, vvhich is begunne in this
lyfe, and to the head vvhere all the ſpirituall ſenſes hes their
ground, and where his ſpirituall mouing is, to defend by armor
the lyfe ſpirituall. What euer other part of him be wounded, he
hes a ſpeciall regarde to theſe two. Now the Apoſtle bringes
in this by a compariſon taine from the worldlie armour vſed by
earthlie ſouldiours. The peece of armour that ſhould be put
on on the heart of the vvorldlie vvarriour, is the breſtplate.
The peece that couers the head is called the helmet. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
vvarriour hes his owne breſtplate and helmet. Yet more
ye ſee. There are two parts of the vvarriours breſtplate, the
breſtparte and backparte, and peece before, another peece be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,
that the heart receyue not a wound, neyther at back nor
breſt. So the breſtplate of a Chriſtian vvarriour is builded
vp of tvvo partes, the fore parte, Faith that embraces Ieſus, the
other parte vvhich vve may call the hinder and backparte,
Loue, and it flowes from the other parte, loue to our neighbour
it hanges on Faith to our God. As to the Helmet it is but a
peece, and it couers the vvhole head and ſenſes round about.
So the Helmet of the Chriſtian vvarriour is of one peece called
<hi>the hope of ſaluation.</hi> Hope, that he ſhall be ſaued and liue vvith
Ieſus Chriſt. And this is his head peece. So long as he keepes
this hope he ſhall ſaue his head and all his ſpirituall ſenſes,
feeling and mouing. &amp;c. keepe me hope, nothing ſhall deſtroy
thy ſpirituall ſeeing, hearing and feeling, and all the reſt of thy
ſenſes. And if thy head be bare of hope, thy ſpirituall ſenſes
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:16659:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhall ſoone be ouerthrowne by the aſſaults of the enemie. So the
ſumme ſhortly, the chiefe things whereby the ſpirituall life, the
ſpirituall feeling and mouing is keept within a man, are, theſe
three thinges, which is chiefly tolde of in the Scripture, Faith,
Loue and Hope. Faith in God and Chriſt. Loue to thy nighbor.
Hope to be ſafe in the grace of Chriſt. Keepe theſe three, thou
ſhalt ſtand inarmed to reſiſt the Deuill and all his works, keepe
one of theſe, thou keepeſt all; loſe one of theſe, thou loſeſt all.
Loſe Faith, thou loſeſt Loue; loſe Faith and Loue, thou loſeſt
Hope.<note place="margin">col.</note> It is otherwaies with the Chriſtian warriour, then with a
worldly warriour, he may haue his Helmet on and want his
breſtplait, but, I aſſure thee, if thou want a peece of this chriſtian
armour, thou haſt no part of it; haſt thou a peece of this armour
thou haſt all: haſt thou Faith, thou haſt Hope and Loue: The
ſpirituall graces that are wrought by the Spirit of God, wherein
ſtands our regeneration, are ſo linked together, either muſt they
be altogether in thee, in ſome meaſure, or, elſe, thou haſt none of
them. Either muſt all the powers of thy ſoule and al thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be renewed, or, elſe, none of them is renewed And therefore,
if thou would try if thou haſt theſe graces, looke if thou haſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one of them, for, then, thou haſt all. Looke if thou haſt Faith,
looke if thou haſt a loue to thy nighbor. For, I aſſure thee, if thou
haſt no loue to thy neighbor, thou haſt no Faith, ſpeak aſmuch
thereof as thou wilt.</p>
               <p>Now to the next verſe. When he hes ſpoken of the hope of
ſaluation, he groundes this ſaluation vpon the owne fundation,
that they might ſee the fundation of it where-vpon it ſtandes ſo
faſt and firmely, to the end they ſhould haue the certaintie of
the hope of ſaluation, and look certainly to be ſafe. The grounds
are two. The firſt, Gods eternall ordinance and his appointing
of them to ſaluation The ſecond, the death of Ieſus Chriſt. So
we ſhall goe through theſe two groundes. As to the firſt. <hi>For,</hi>
ſaies he,<note place="margin">The first ground of the hope of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, gods decree.</note> 
                  <hi>God hes not appointed vs to vvraith:</hi> that is to puniſhment.
<hi>But to obtaine ſaluation through the me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
Then I marke the firſt foundation of our lyfe and ſaluation, is,
in Gods eternall election, and it is decreed from all eternity Our
ſaluation ſtandes vpon the ordinance and appointment, decree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
and purpoſe of God before the foundation of the world: the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:16659:139"/>
foundation of thy ſaluation was laid ere euer the foundation
of the world was laid. Vpon this ground of Gods ordinance
ryſes vp the building of thy ſaluation. So as ſaluation it ſelfe is
grounded on this eternall decree, ſo hope of ſaluation is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vpon the ſight of this eternall decree. So that if thou get not
a fight in ſome meaſure of the eternall ordinance and decreet
of God appointing thee to ſaluation, thou cannot haue a ſure
hope of ſaluation: For what certaintie canſt thou haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ground. So of neceſſitie thou muſt haue ſome knowledge
of Gods decree to ground hope on. I ſpeak this for them who
faies it is a thing ouer curious to ſearch in in predeſtination. No,
no: For if thou get not ſome ſight that thou art in the decree
of ſaluation before the world was made, and ſay in thy ſelf (God
hes decreed that I ſhould be ſaued, therefore I will hope for it)
thou ſhalt neuer haue a ſure hope. Now the decree of God is
far of, it hes no beginning, and therefore it hes a farre ſight: for
the ſight of it is not gotten immediatly. Neither I nor any man
will be able to look in to Gods ordinance concerning ſaluation
immediatly, God will not take thee by the hand and lead thee in
to his ſecreet counſell and let thee ſee it: How then is it gotten?
Mediatly I knowe it by the effects, and by them one by one I
clim and aſcend vp vntill I come to that decree of God. <hi>Paul</hi>
Rom. chap. 18. verſe 30. <hi>Theſe vvhom God hes predeſtinate, he hes
called them effectually,</hi> and hes giuen them faith. For in faith
ſtandes our effectuall calling, <hi>and them vvhom he hes called, he
iuſtifies, and vvhom he iuſtifies, at laſt he glorifies.</hi> Then vvoulde
thou knovve that thou art appointed to lyfe before all eternity,
looke if thou haſt a beginning of ſanctification, looke if thou
be ſanctified by the death of Chriſt, and then go to thy calling.
And finde thou theſe in thee, aſſure thee God hes appoynted
thee to ſaluation before the worlde was made. If I feele with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
my ſelfe my effectuall calling by God out of this vvorlde
to God, I aſſure my ſelfe God hes decreed from all eternitie, I
ſhall liue with him in glorie. So to touch this againe, It is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe
to ſay that it is curioſitie for men to ſeeke a vvarrand
of their ſaluation. And neuer ſhalt thou haue an aſſurance of
thy ſaluation, if thou get not this hope grounded on this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.
The errour of the Papiſtes is heere rebooked, that
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:16659:139"/>
ſayes, there ſhoulde not be a certaintie of hope of ſaluation.
Folie, folie, For if I knowe the ground of my ſaluation, that it
is grounded vpon the ordinaunce of my God, I aſſure me of
that lyfe euerlaſting, becauſe I knovve the certaintie of Gods
ordinaunce, therefore I may juſtlie aſſure my ſelfe, that I ſhall
liue vvith Chriſt heere, and in the end I ſhall be glorified with
him for euer</p>
               <p>Yet to ſtick on the vvordes. He ſayes <hi>God hes not appointed
you to vvraith.</hi> Learne by the way. From all eternitie there hes
beene two ordinaunces of God concerning men and wemen.<note place="margin">2. decrees of God, one to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
There hes beene from all eternitie, and before the creation of
the worlde and of men and vvemen an ordinaunce to lyfe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane
there hes beene another ordinaunce, that ſome ſhoulde
goe to Hell: as there paſt an ordinaunce of lyfe in the counſell
of God, ſo there paſt an ordinaunce of death. And theſe two
decrees muſt ſtand. The decree of lyfe cannot be reſcinded.
The decree of damnation cannot be reſcinded. And in this
place the Apoſtle ſpeakes of them both. Now, brethren, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
deeplie in this matter it is not meete. But this vnderſtand. It
is not a naked permiſſion of God that men ſhould goe to Hell.
No, the Lord hes decreed it to be done by himſelfe, and not to
ſuffer it be done by another. As for exemple, As ye ſee a potter
makes a veſſell to honour, ſo of purpoſe he makes another to
diſhonour and for vyle purpoſes. Rom. chap. 9. verſe 20. So the
Lord hes appointed one ſorte to ſaluation, and another ſorte
to damnation. Take head. This appointing of God of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures
to deſtruction, as deſtruction is a juſt penaltie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from the judgement of God for ſinne, ſo it commes of
God, and he is the executer thereof. But if ye will take the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
not as a puniſhment but as an vtter vvreake of the
creatures, I vvill not ſay it commes of God. As it is a penaltie
of ſinne I thinke it commes of God, and he is the doer thereof
himſelfe, othervvayes not. Alvvayes all theſe groundes ſtandes
ſure, there is a ſolide foundation of life, and a ſolide foundation of
damnation. So this ſhould teach euerie one of vs to ſtriue to get
a ſight of that ſolide foundation of lyfe, and Gods appointment
of vs to life. It is ſure ſome are appointed to damnation, yea and
not a few nomber. Some will ſay, God ſorbid any ſhould goe to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:16659:140"/>
Hell, hes not Chriſt died for all ſinners? Alas, except thou ſee thy
warrand of Gods ordinance to thy ſaluation thou ſhalt goe to
Hell. God is juſt as he is mercifull. And as he will be glorified
in mercy toward the godlie, ſo will he be glorified in juſtice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the wicked.</p>
               <p>He ſayes, <hi>He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es appointed you to ſaluation by the meanes of Ieſus
Christ.</hi> Then I ſee ere euer Gods appointment to lyfe and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
take effect, there muſt of neceſſitie interueene a purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that lyfe that God hes appointed to thee, that lyfe he hes
appointed to thee before all eternity it muſt be boght. But by
whom muſt it be boght? by thee: by thy moyen: No, I giue thee
this doome. If thou thinke that any peece or leaſt tytle of the
deſeruing of lyfe ſtandes in thy hand, thou ſhalt neuer get it.
Then who ſhall purchaſe it? He ſayes, to be obtained <hi>by the
meanes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> If the Apoſtle had ſaid by thy
merites, then I would haue run on with the Papiſtes, and haue
cryed merites, merites as faſt as they do. But the Apoſtle ſpeaks
plainelie it is obtained by Chriſt. And therefore fy on him that
thinkes that he is ſafe by merite. It is a wonderfull thing, God of
free mercie appointes to ſaluation, and yet ere we come to it, be
will haue it boght. What free mercy is this? No, neuer thing was
ſo deare boght as thy ſaluation. For it was not boght with gold
nor ſiluer, but with the bloude of the immaculate Lambe Ieſus
Chriſt: And therefore he ſayes in the firſt Epiſtle to the Corint.
chap. 6. verſe 20. <hi>ye are boght vvith a pryce,</hi> he calles it a price, by
reaſon of the high excellencie thereof. As thogh there were no
pryce but onely the bloud of Ieſus to be eſteemed of, and yet it
is a free grace of God. How can it be afree grace and boght to?
If I buy it, and that with a deare price, how can it be free? Indeed
it is true, if thou hadſt payed the price thy ſelfe, it had not beene
a free gift; but ſeeing it is not boght with a price that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes out
of thy hand, but with the precious bloud of Ieſus, who is Gods
Son, it is a free gift to thee. For who gaue the Son but the Father?
Who gaue the price but he that receiued it? God gaue as it were
out of his owne purſe the price for thee. The mercy and loue
of God to his ſeruants is wonderfull. Wilt thou looke to thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
nothing but mercy in God: if thou haſt nothing to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in but free grace and mercie without any deſeruing; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:16659:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if thou joine any part of merite with mercie, and ſay, the
mercy of God and my merite did it, ſhame ſhall come to thee.
And therefore the Apoſtle ſayes we are onely ſaued by Chriſt,
and ſpeaks not of merite.</p>
               <p>Now to goe forwarde to the next ground where-vpon he
buildes the hope of ſaluation (As thou would haue an aſſurance
of life euerlaſting it is needfull for thee to ſpy out the grounds)
The next ground of thy ſaluation, is the thing that fell out in
tyme.<note place="margin">The ſec. ground of the hope of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, christs death.</note> He ſayes, <hi>Chriſt died for vs, that vvhether vve vvalke or ſleep,

                     </gap>ue together vvith him.</hi> As our ſaluation is builded
vpon God ordinance, ſo it is builded vpon the bloude of Ieſus
Chriſt, not liuing but crucified and ſlaine: And as the bloude of
Ieſus is the ground of thy ſaluation, ſo the ground of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of thy hope, is the ſight of Ieſus crucified. Except I ſee
Chriſt bleeding for my ſin I can neuer aſſure me that I am ſafe,
except I ſee that ſacrifice offred vp for my ſin (as it is a ſacrifice
offered vp for my ſin, ſo it is a merite to obtaine lyfe to me) I
will neuer thinke I am ſafe. How neceſſare therefore is it to me
neuer to let the bloude of Ieſus goe out of my minde: Men will
ſay, I wait well I am ſafe, and neuer will haue an eye to Chriſt
crucified and his bloude. But I ſay to thee, except thy eye be fixt
on the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, when thou faireſt, thou art ſafe, thou
lieſt falſlie. Therefore looke euer to Chriſt deying, and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his bloud for thy ſin. Another thing I ſee. There is no lyfe
but through death, he hes died for vs that we ſhould liue throgh
him, to learne men and wemen not to count ſo much of death
and to ſcare at it, for I tell thee this generall will ſtand, No lyfe
but through death, it ſpringes out thereof, as thou ſeeſt the ſtalk
of the corne ryſe out of the dead pickle. So except thy lyfe
ſpring through death, it is not poſſible to thee to liue. For firſt
death is the price of it, not thy death, but the death of Chriſt:
for he hes gotten lyfe by his death. Then after Chriſt hes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
lyfe to vs, yet the way whereby we muſt enter to lyfe, is
by the way of death. <hi>Through many troubles behoues it vs to enter
into the Kingdom of Heauen:</hi> Act. 14. verſe 20. for ſtraite is the
way to Heauen, thou muſt be drawen as it were through Hell
ere thou come to Heauen, and yet thy ſuffering and death ſhall
not merite. The onely merite ſtandes in Ieſus. Brethren, this lets
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:16659:141"/>
vs ſee how hard a thing it is to a ſinner falling from lyfe (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
fell and we all in him) to come to lyfe againe. Thinke it not
an eaſie matter. There muſt be a death, yea, two deaths ere euer
thou come there. O the great ſuffering Chriſt hes ſuffered for
vs land againe thou muſt ſuffer and die thy ſelfe ere thou gette
lyfe. Therefore learne how hard a matter it is to get lyfe. Many
difficulties interueenes, death muſt enter ere lyfe come: which
lets vs ſee what it is to offend God; be loath therefore to offend
God. The godly knowes this how hard a thing it is when they
haue offended to get againe the Spirite which they haue extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
the Lord will not looke on them for a tyme as it were.
Looke in <hi>Dauid</hi> after his fall. But ô the ſweetneſſe of mercie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the reſtorance! They who hes taſted in any meaſure of the
ſweetneſſe of Chriſt, giue them all the pleaſures of the worlde,
they will neuer get contentation, vntill they get a ſight of Gods

               <p>The Apoſtle heere ſaies, <hi>vvhether ye ſleepe or vvake ye ſhall liue
vvith Christ.</hi> Then ye ſee if Chriſt hes once died for our lyfe we
ſhall liue: That is the certainty and ground of our hope, that
Chriſt hes died for vs. Then when I feele this, nothing can ſtay
lyfe, nothing can hinder me to liue with him. There is nothing in
this world that will hinder thee to liue with him, but liue muſt
thou. Sleepeſt thou in thy bed, thy ſleepe hinders nothing, thou
liueſt in him: wakeſt thou? thou art liuing with him; liueſt thou
this lyfe? thou art liuing in him: art thou dying and drawing thy
laſt breath? yet thou art liuing with him; what euer thou art do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the worlde thou art ay liuing, eating, drinking, if thou be
one of the godly for whom he hes died, thou art liuing with
him. Yea, I dare ſay more if he haue once died for thee, thy ſin
ſhall not hinder thee from that lyfe to come. <hi>Dauids</hi> ſin his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and adulterie hindered him not from that life, but the Lord
turned it ſo about, that he made them worke all to his well. All
thinges turnes to the beſt to them who loues the Lord. Albeit
thou finde thy ſinnes many, yet ſtay not on them, nothing ſhall
hinder thee from Chriſt. Yet this ſhould not make thee to take
pleaſure in ſin: For if thou loue Chriſt well, thou wilt be loath to
offend him. Then if we in ſo many troubles in this life liue with
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:16659:141"/>
Chriſt, ſhall we not much more liue with him in that lyfe to
come, where there ſhall be no trouble, no impediments, and in
the midſt of all theſe troubles let vs comforte our ſelues vvith
thinking on the joy that we ſhall haue when we ſhall be in the
Heauens with our Lord and Sauiour. Now to marke the words.
He ſaies, <hi>that vve ſhould liue vvith him.</hi> Looke the nature of the
life that we get in the death of Ieſus. It is a life that we liue with
Chriſt, not a lyfe that we liue from him, there cannot be a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
lyfe from him. Death will not ſerue to lyfe, if thou be
from him, but thou muſt be with him. Thou muſt not onely liue
with him as a man will liue with an houſe and family, but thou
muſt liue in him. As by compariſon, the arme liues with the
head, ſo thou muſt liue with Chriſt. Ye ſee the conjunction na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
that is between the head and the members, that ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
muſt be betweene thee and the Lord Ieſus. If thou liue
with him, thou muſt liue as a member, he muſt be thy head, and
thou muſt be a leg, an arme, or ſome part of the bodie. Well is
that ſoule that is any parte of the bodie of Chriſt. Therefore
draw euer nearer and nearer vnto him, vntill thou be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
with him; we haue no lyfe except we be ingraft in him,
as the imp is ingraft in the tree, and ſo preaſe euer to grow in
that conjunction. Look how thou was joined in him yeſterday,
ſay, Lord make a nearer conjunction this day: and to morrowe
ſay, worke yet a nearer conjunction that I may draw nearer my
head. But, brethren, this full conjunction cannot be vntill we ſee
him face to face, we are far of now, but we ſhall be with him, we
are from him now for a lytle ſpace, but then we ſhall be with
him for euer; and then in that great day thy bleſſedneſſe
both in bodie and ſoule ſhall be perfited, we ſhall be
with him and ſtand for euer in that full conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with out head Chriſt in whom is all

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16659:142"/>
which is faith and loue, take away hope, faith and loue, he
is but a naked man in the world and ſhall ſoone be deſtroied, if
he be not clad with faith and loue in his breſt, and with hope
in his head, he will not be able to gainſtand.</p>
               <p>Followes now in the text ye haue heard another exhortation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and it is to vſe theſe meanes, whereby we may continue in wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifneſſe,
in continuall ſobriety and ſpirituall armour enarmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the enemy. There are the wordes of the exhortation,
<hi>Wherefore.</hi> As he would ſay, Seeing we muſt be wakrife, ſober
and enarmed in the Chriſtian warfare, therefore I exhort you
to get the meanes whereby theſe thinges are keeped. The means
are <hi>Exhort one another, euen as ye doe alreadie.</hi> So my exhortation
is that ye continue to the end. It is not eneugh to begin, except
ye continue to the end. Now there are the meanes. Then bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
this leſſon offers the ſelfe to vs The meanes not to ſleepe
in the ſoule, but to be wakrife, not to be drunken but to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
not to be naked, but to be clad with ſpirituall armour is,
inſtant exhortation. Stir vp men and wemen by exhorting in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in an inſtant building vp and confirming them in the
doctrine and knowledge that they haue once receiued. This
worke of building will not be done in one day, or two dayes,
or twentie dayes, but this building of the ſoule of men and we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
building them vp in that ſpirituall building muſt be raiſed
vp higher nor euer Babell was, yea it muſt riſe to the Heauen of
Heauens, and to the head Ieſus, who ſittes aboue all Heauens.
This building muſt be inſtant. In one word. The means to hold
men waking, and ſober, and temperate in the ſpirituall warfare,
and to holde this armour on them, is inſtant exhortation. Take
me away the voice of exhortation, take away building in the
doctrine ye haue receiued and edifying therein in ſtead of wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifeneſſe,
there ſhall come on you a dead ſlumber, in ſtead of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and ſpirituall temperance, thou ſhalt be drunken; in ſtead
of armour, nothing but nakedneſſe and ye ſhall be a pray to the
Deuill, this world and your owne cankerd nature, aſſay it when
ye will. So then brethren, in one word. See the neceſſitie men hes
of inſtant exhorting and edifying, not for one day or two, yea
if thou ſhouldſt liue <hi>Methuſalems</hi> dayes the voice of exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhould neuer goe out of thy eare: For there are a thouſand
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:16659:143"/>
thinges to draw vs downe to cauſe vs ſleepe, vntill we die in
ſleeping, many thinges to make thee drunken, to ly dovvne
lyke a drunken bodie vvithout ſenſe of the lyfe to come. Many
thinges to denude thee of armour, to ſet thee vp naked to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neme,
Would to God this world wold conſider the neceſſity of
inſtant and continuall exhortation to moue them forwarde in
the courſe of godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>Marke next. Who is this that ſhould exhort? Who is this that
ſhould edifie? who ſhould hold men waking in Spirit, hold them
in ſobriety, and hold on their armour by exhortation and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
who ſhould doe it? He ſayes not the Paſtor, ye haue Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
let them doe it, it is their office. It is true indeed, they haue
a ſpeciall calling for that effect, and are placed in the Church to
hold you wakrife, to cry in your eare vntill ye waken againe, to
exhort and edify continually to build vp that ſpiritual building,
and to build men and wemen vp as liuely ſtones in that ſpiritual
building. Therefore in the firſt Epiſtle to the Cor. chap. 14 verſ.
3. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes <hi>He that prophecies</hi> (that is the Preacher) <hi>he ſpeakes
to men,</hi> and whereto? <hi>to edifie in building.</hi> There is the end of his
ſpeaking to exhortation, conſolation. In the 4 chap. Epheſ.
verſe 11. He ſayes, <hi>When Chriſt paſt vp to Heauen,</hi> he left not his
Church voide or deſtitute of builders, but he ſayes, <hi>he gaue ſome
to be Apostles, ſome Prophetes, ſome Euangeliſtes, ſome Deacones
and Paſtours.</hi> And whereto? All <hi>to builde vp the bodie of Christ.</hi>
If a Paſtour be not a builder, he ſerues for no purpoſe. Yet not
withſtanding of this albeit it be the Paſtours ſpeciall calling
to exhorte. The Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Everie one of you exhort;</hi> ye men
and wemen euerie one exhort and edifie another. Thou ſhould
exhort thy neighbour, and let him exhort thee againe. Holde
thou him waking and let him hold thee waking hold thou him
in ſobrietie, and let him hold thee in ſobrietie againe; hold on
that ſpirituall armor on him, on her let him and her hold on thy
ſpirituall armor on thee again. So there are none of vs in Chriſts
Church, but we haue all this generall calling in the Church to
be builders edifiers exhorters euery one of others The ſimpleſt
in the flock is bound to exhort and builde vp the beſt of them
all that ſpeakes with a tongue: For the Lord hes giuen to the
leaſt member ſome peece of grace to builde vp and inſtruct
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:16659:143"/>
the bodie: For knowe ye what our calling is in Chriſt? As he
is King, Prieſt and Prophete; a King to rule a Prieſt in offering
vp that onely one propitiatorie ſacrifice for all; a Prophete to
inſtruct and teache: So there is not a true Chriſtian man nor
woman but they haue all theſe three offices, they are Kinges.
Prieſtes and Prophetes; Kinges to rule in the Church of Chriſt.
Prieſtes to offer vp in a maner a ſacrifice to God, Prophetes
to teache and helpe vp the building, I meane the vvhole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
vntill it come to the head Chriſt, that once the man, whoſe
head is Chriſt, and the bodie the Elect in the earth, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite.
So ſay not it is the Miniſters duetie to doe this, vvhat
haue I to doe vvith this? Nor vvhen one exhortes thee, ſay not,
art thou becomme a Miniſter? well it thou accept not ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of them, thou ſhalt die for euer, for the Lord hes opened
their mouth for thy edification.</p>
               <p>Now the third thing I marke in the laſt parte of the verſe,
<hi>euen as ye doe.</hi> I vvill not bid you exhort one another, as thogh
ye did it not alreadie. No, I acknowledge the grace of, God in
you in doing it alreadie, take your owne praiſe. Well then they
are doing the thing he exhortes them to, and yet he exhortes
them to doe it. When I ſee a man doe any thing what needes
me to exhort him to it? When I ſee a man exhorting and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what needes me to exhort him to exhort and build. Learne
then. There are none in this world but they haue need continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and inſtantlie to be ſtirred vp in their doing, we are far from
perfection, and albeit we be running on in the rink, yet we ar far
from the butt which is heuen, we are but running yet and ſo whil
we are running, let vs go forward, if it be a miniſter that exhorts
let him exhort on. Who euer they be that exhorts and edifies,
let them goe on in edifying and exhorting to the building vp of
the bodie. Now beſide this, conſider ye not the ſluggiſhneſſe of
our nature? our nature is ſo dead and ſtupide that ſearſlie will we
haue put our hand to the turne when we will fall from it. Ye wil
ſee a ſleeping bodie put his hand to a turne, and in the meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme
he will fall down and ſleepe. Our nature is ſo ſlippery that
when we are laying vp one ſtone in the building, if one cry not
in our eare, awake and be doing, vve vvill lette it fall. So when
we are exhorting, and ſearſlie vvill the vvorde of exhortation
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:16659:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be out of our mouth, when we will fall from that purpoſe. So
conſidering our nature the beſt of vs hes neede to be ſtirred vp
and exhorted: when we are doing faſteſt, then we haue need to
be ſtirred vp. Yet brethren, for all this exhorting he vvill not
misknow the grace of God in them. Take head when thou ſeeſt
men doing vvell that thou cloſe not thy eyes thereat, and ſay
not to them that they doe nothing; ſome are ouer ſore cenſorers
that vvill ſay thou doeſt nothing, thy exhortation is nothing.
No let euery man haue his owne praiſe. If they be doing any
good thing, be it neuer ſo litle, commend them and ſtir them vp
to it, by giuing them exhortations and praiſing them. This for
this exhortation. All this part of this Epiſtle is full of exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning Chriſtian behauiour.</p>
               <p>Followes now another exhortation which is more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare,
and concernes the duety that the people ought vnto the
Paſtors. I ſhall holde me by the wordes of the text. Then, to
come to the wordes. <hi>Brethren:</hi> There the ſtyle, he calles them
brethren, a louing ſtyle, to teſtifie that loue he bare tovvardes
them. <hi>Novv vve beſeech you.</hi> There the next worde, a word te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
the earneſtneſſe he had in exhorting them to doe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was a great matter, he bids them not ſimplie doe it, but,
he ſayes, I beſeech you doe it. When a great thing is to be done
by any man, certainly it requyres, we vſe an earneſt and not a
ſimple and ſlender ſpeech. The firſt thing he deſires of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is an <hi>acknovvledging.</hi> Whom of? of them <hi>vvho labours in the
vvorke,</hi> that is firſt. Then, <hi>of them, vvho are ouer you and aboue you
in the Lord.</hi> That is next. Then, <hi>of them that admoniſhe you.</hi> That
is laſt. The ſecond thing he deſires of the people, that they haue
them in a ſingulare and moſt ſpeciall loue.<note place="margin">col.</note> Loue them, not as ye
doe commonly any other man, or, woman, but, loue them after a
ſingular maner. Wherefore ſhould this loue be? Not ſo much
for the perſons ſake, as for the works, loue them for their works.
There is the ſumme of the wordes ſhortly. The exhortation
may be taine vp in two words. Doe your duetie to your Paſtor.
Yet he is not content with the bare wordes, but, he layes out the
miniſter before them in the whole ſubſtantiall pointes of his
calling, letting them ſee euerie peece of his calling after another.
And more then this which he ſpeakes of the peoples duety, he
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:16659:144"/>
layes not out their duety ſimplie, but ſubſtantiouſlie: knovve
him, acknowledge him; there one part; then haue him in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
loue, there is another part. And ſo, it is not eneugh, to haue
a ſimple knowledge of him, but they muſt knowe what a man a
Paſtor ſhould be. Men will ſay, I know him, he is a man ſtanding
vp in a Pulpet preaching with a gowne. No, the Apoſtle ſhewes
vs, to know him in euery pointe of his dalling, in this pointe and
that pointe of his calling, knowe him to be a Preacher ſet ouer
you, by God, know him to be an admoniſher and inſtructer, and
againe, when ye come to your owne duety, knowe the pointes
of your duetie; I ſhould doe this, I ſhould meete him with this
duety, with that duety other waies thou knowes nothing neither
in the Paſtor, nor in thy ſelfe. Therefore, the Apoſtle layes them
out openly to thee to know them.</p>
               <p>But, to come to the wordes. Ye haue firſt a ſhort deſcription
of a true Paſtor.<note place="margin">Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor.</note> The firſt pointe of the deſcription of a true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour,
is this, He is a laborer among the people, not an idle man;
He ſayes not, acknowledge them that ſittes idle, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
them that labours among you. He labours, and how? He
labours in the worke of God. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
in the firſt Epiſtle chap. 5. verſe 17. <hi>Elders,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>is vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of double honor, eſpecially thoſe vvho labours in the vvord of God,</hi>
he labours in opening vp the ſcriptures of God: the preaching is
thought by men to be no labour as though preaching were no
more, but onely to ſtand vp and tell a taile: yet the Apoſtle calles
that labour, yea, I ſay, they labour aſwell as they who holds a
pleugh labours. Wherein labor they? In word and Diſcipline:
in taking ordour with your maners. Not onely labour they in
preaching, but alſo they take ordour with the maners of the
people. Then to gather the leſſon. This part of the deſcription
of a true Paſtour excludes from the miniſtry and Pulpet; idle
bellies, Miniſters that beare the name of miniſters, and in the
meane-tyme are but idle bellies away with them: let them neuer
face the Pulpet. Fy on them that takes the Miniſtrie on them
for an idle lyfe and and to ſerue their affections; an idle Biſhop
that neuer opened his mouth to preach, an idle Pope that vvill
ſit vp in a throne fy on him, why ſhould he take the name of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Miniſter on him and doe no good therein? The next part of the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:16659:145"/>
deſcription of a true Paſtor is, <hi>they are ouer you,</hi> not vnder you,
but aboue you, ſet ouer you, as it were ouer your heads to looke
downe to you, in a kinde of ſuperioritie ouer you. Then a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour,
a Miniſter ſent of Ieſus Chriſt the Paſtour of Paſtours,
the great Paſtour. he hes a kinde of ſuperioritie and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
aboue the flock. But brethren, he is not ouer them as a
Lord (the onely Lord that is ouer the people is Ieſus Chriſt)
He is not ouer them then in thinges ciuill, in thinges bodilie,
concerning the bodie, concerning their temporall liues, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
thinges politicke, for entertaining of this temporall
lyfe, but he is ouer them in the Lord, not as a Lord, but in
the Lord, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Not ouer them in thinges ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
but in matters of the Lord, in thinges ſpirituall, in things Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick,
in things concerning the conſciences of men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes to <hi>Philemon</hi> verſe 8. <hi>I haue great libertie to
command thee as a ſuperiour;</hi> but how? Not of my owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
<hi>but in the Lord,</hi> I am ouer thee as a ſuperiour, but not as a
Lord. Take heede. There are ſundrie ſortes of ſuperiorities,
A Steward in a familie, in a maner, is ouer the familie he hes a
preferment by reaſon of the office: And yet for all this, if the
ſteward would take vpon him to bee Lord of the familie, he
would be a knaue, and would vſurpe the place of his maſter,
So, a Miniſter in the familie of the Lord, he is a ſuperiour, but
not ſuperiour as a Lord, but as a ſteward, to diſpence the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of God to the ſoule, and no other ſuperiour: for none can
ſit ouer the conſcience of any man, but onely the Lord Ieſus.
All the Kinges of the earth cannot haue a dominion ouer
the conſciences of men, the Lord is onely Lord and ſupreame
ſuperiour thereof; all the Miniſters and office-bearers in the
Church onely ſtewards, with ſpirituall ſtewardrie, diſpenſing
the ſpirituall foode. I meane the word of God. Now brethren,
this ſecond parte of this deſcription of the Paſtour condemnes
the Pope, who vſurpes a ſpirituall juriſdiction ouer the ſoules
of men, vvho vvill ſtryue alſo for a ciuill juriſdiction with the
Emperour and Princes of the vvorld.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the third parte. He ſayes, <hi>and admoniſhes
you.</hi> There is the laſt parte of the deſcription of the true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of God. Admoniſhing ſtandes in calling back againe
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:16659:145"/>
men in the vvay vvho hes made deſection, either in doctrine or
maners. In this poynte conſiſtes their labour. So, that, by this
word, I vnderſtand the whole parts of the office of a Paſtour,
as exhorting, rebuking, comforting and teaching. It is not for
nothing, that, he hes made a chuſe of this word admoniſhing,
to teach vs, if he could doe all theſe thinges neuer ſo well, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in teaching, comfort, exhort. If he cannot doe this, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe
a ſinner, tell him, ſinner thou art in the vvrong vvay;
if he faile in doctrine, tell him, thou faileſt in doctrine; if he
faile in maners, tell him, he failes in maners: if he cannot doe
this, he is not meete to be a Miniſter, if he cannot admoniſhe
them that are ſinners, if he cannot admoniſhe them that are in
the vvrong vvay, he is not meete to be a teacher. Now, ſee the
peruerſitie of our nature, for, manie there are, vvho vvill heare
comforting, exhorting, but not admoniſhing: but <hi>Paul</hi> teaches
thee, the Paſtour muſt be an admoniſher: There is the Paſtour
ſet downe in three parts of his calling.</p>
               <p>Now, to end this doctrine concerning them, I ſhall take vp
this one note. I gather of this, as it were, the nature of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie.
What is this Miniſtrie? It is firſt a labour, an exerciſe, not
an idlenes, but a labour, it is a burdene, and he that takes it not
on, as it were, a load on his back, he is not meete for it, he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be a Miniſter, he muſt lay downe his ſhoulders, and take
on his loade on his back, as you ſee an horſe take on his loade on
his back. So, it is a burdene and an heauie burdene: a labor and
an heauie labour. But, brethren, there are ſundrie ſortes of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denes
and labours in this world; There are ſome that are vylder,
ſome that are honourable. Now what a labour is this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie?
Indeede, it is true, this miniſtrie is thought a vyle bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene,
and of all exerciſes, the labour of the miniſtrie is thought
moſt vyle, in the ſight of our prophane, men in Scotland this
day. The verie name of a miniſter is thoght vyle in the earth, &amp;
ſo oft as they ſpeak of him &amp; names him, it is thoght a vyle name;
the name of a cooke is not ſo vyle as the name of a Miniſter. But,
in deſpyte of thee and all the vvorld, the Spirite of God vvill
call him an honourable labourer, a perſon exerciſed in an high
and honourable exerciſe. 1. Timoth. chap. 3. verſe 1. The King
is a labourer, but a honourable labourer. Euen ſo, euerie one
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:16659:146"/>
that labours and hes offices in the Church, are laborers, but yet
they are honorable laborers. So the Miniſters are laborers, but,
honorable laborers, for he is ouer thee, and is thy ſuperior. And
he hes a burdeene, but a honorable burdeene, and at the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Ieſus Chriſt in ſpyte of thee that contemnes him thou
ſhalt ſee his honor and glory, and thou ſhalt wonder at that day,
that euer he ſhold be promoued to that honor, for he ſhall ſhine
in the Heauen as a ſtar: this ſhall ſtand in deſpyte of the world.</p>
               <p>Well, come on now to the duetie of the people to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
(A Kings Maſter-houſhold will be accounted of, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-houſholde
of Chriſtes Church, what maner of honour
ſhold ye haue him in?<note place="margin">Dueties of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Paſtor.</note>) The firſt words that expreſſes the duety
of the flock are, <hi>knovve them,</hi> misknowe them not. The people
would misknow them very faine; yet what knowing is this? It is
the knowledge of the mind, when in mind we take vp &amp; know
that calling of the Miniſtry to be the Paſtor by Ieſus Chriſt the
great Paſtor to the Church, to be a diſpenſer of the miſteries of
God, and the in ſearchable riches of Chriſt, ſuch a diſpenſer as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
was in the world, not of bread and drinke as theſe world lie
ſtewards; No, but of the inſearchable riches of Chriſt, and that to
ſaluation and feeding of the ſoule to that life euerlaſting wherin
ſoule and body ſhal liue for euer. This is the knowing be ſpeaks
of heere. What more? It is not a ſimple knowledge, to know, that,
he is a Miniſter, but with knowing, to joine reuerence, giue him
his own honor. <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Cor. 4. 1. ſaies, <hi>Let a man count of him</hi> (not as
thou cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s of Chriſt) but count of him <hi>as a Miniſter and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
of the miſteries of Chriſt.</hi> giue him no more and curſed be that
beaſt of Rome that wold take the place and honor of Chriſt on
him. Now this part of duety of the flock, in reuerencing of the
Paſtor, is anſwerable to that part of the calling of the Paſtor; he
is a ſuperior, a ſuperiority craues reuerence, who euer he be that
is a ſuperior, whether in families, citties, or common-wels, or, in
Church, if he be ſet ouer you, honor him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is the ordinance of
the Lord, if the Lord haue ſet him ouer you, honor him, look not
to the man, but, to the Lords ordinance. And this, I continuallie
perſaue, there is a naturall hatred and contempt in the hearts of
the people euer toward any ſuperior, whether in Church, or, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
a naturall io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y: we are bred with it, and we entertaine it, and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:16659:146"/>
increſſe it. Thou haſt a naturall hatred againſt thy ſuperiour if
thou wert neuer ſo good, if thou wouldſt faine haue him away,
if thou wouldſt caſt of all yock, but this is a thing, the Lord is
offended with. For, I affirme this, all ſuperiour powers that are
ſet ouer vs, whether in Church, or, Policie, reuerence and honor
is craued to them. God ordaines it, and God will auenge the
contempt thereof. Now, to ſpeake generallie. There are tvvo
ſortes of ſuperiours. One in the Policie, ouer the bodies of men
in the world; another ſuperiour in the Church of God which is
nothing elſe but a ſtewartrie. Now ſay I, reuerence ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
giuen to both, reuerence the Magiſtrat, whiſper not againſt
him, but reuerence him, if it be poſſible holde out euill thoughts
out of thy heart, let be euill wordes in thy mouth. honour all,
beginne at the King and come to the loweſt, honour euery one
in their owne ranke. Againe in the Church honour the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie
as ſtewartes in a great familie, the familie of the Lord of
Lordes, honour him as a faithfull ſtewart in the houſe of the
Lord. If yee compare theſe two together, euery one of them
are bound to reuerence other, the Politick Magiſtrate to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the ſuperiours in the Church: Againe the ſuperiours in
the Church to reuerence the ciuile Magiſtrate, I tell you my
minde, mutuallie they are ſuperiours to others. The Church
man is inferiour to the Magiſtrate in things ciuile, and therefore,
as a common man is bound to reuerence him, and ſhould teach
all reuerence to them, in that eſtate. And by the contrare, the
Magiſtrate, if it were the King, ſhoulde be ruled by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
in thinges ſpirituall: and he who is a ſtewart in the Church
of God, the King is bound to take out of his hand the thing
wherevpon his ſoule feedes, and ſo, he, and all other Magiſtrates
are bound to reuerence him, as Gods ſtewart. If this mutuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
were keeped well were it to Church and Commonwel;
but, where it is not keeped, no well in Church nor Policie, and
I ſhall craue euer to get this mutuall reuerence keeped, and my
trauell and exerciſe hes been this yeere bygone to get it keeped,
God is my witneſſe. Now this is for the firſt part of the duetie
of the people.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing, he ſayes, <hi>haue them in ſingulare loue, for their
vvorker ſake.</hi> Not in a common loue, but, in a ſingulare loue. it
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:16659:147"/>
includes all the whole affectiones of the heart, and yet there is
more to be vnderſtood heere, the conſequentes of this loue, and
the effects that followe therevpon. If loue be in the heart, it will
break out in the hand. So there are two thinges heere. The one
the ſingular loue in the heart: the other the outward good deed
in the hand. If the Miniſters giue to you thinges ſpirituall to
enterteine the heauenly lyfe; is it a great matter to you to giue
them thinges temporall, thinges to enterteine this fraile lyfe?
Now, brethren, this point of the duetie of the people anſweres
to that parte of the duetie of the Paſtour, which ſtandes in
labour. A labourer would haue loue of them he labours for, if it
were but the ſeruant that labours in your kitching, ye ought to
loue him, loue them who loues you. Now he who labours not
in a vyle office, but in an honourable labour to your ſaluation;
how much more ſhould ye eſteeme of him honourablie and
reuerence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> An honourable labour woulde be honourablie
handled. Ye ſee the meeting that the Apoſtle craues. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour
lyes vnder a burdeene, and an honourable burdeene. On
the peoples parte he craues a meeting, becauſe the burdeene is
honourable, and the Paſtour ſhould haue preferment, therefore
he craues reuerence And becauſe the Paſtour labours, therefore
he cranes loue and entertaining of the people. It is a common
ſaying, Friendſhip wil not ſtand long on the one ſide. If this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be not of the people to the Paſtor, the Miniſtry cannot ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
and the men cannot be able to beare the burdeene. Brethren,
what ſhal I ſay, alas, experience telles vs, for fault of this meeting
on the part of the people, and ſpecially of theſe in Policie, to
whom this matter appertaines, this Miniſtry is not like for to
ſtand. And I affirme, if there be not a better meeting, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
care to reuerence this calling, and to loue and honour it, and
to prouyde ſuſtentation for them that laboures, the eyes of our
poſteriue ſhall ſee this Miniſtry decay. It is going away. Men
beleeues, it is well, if they get the teyndes, If the Lord and Laird
get the teyndes,<note place="margin">Teinds.</note> he will indent and ſubſcryue all with you. But,
either muſt theſe things be redreſſed, or, elſe, certainly there ſhall
be a decay, and then, farewell all grace. Shame and confuſion to
Scotland. Trowes Scotland, that, the common-well ſhall floo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe,
or, that, the eſtate ſhall be good, if this Miniſtrie goe away?
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:16659:147"/>
No, there ſhall be nothing, but deſolation. If they were heere
to whom this matter and this admonition pertaines, I woulde
charge them in the name of God, that they would ſhow a better
meeting to entertaine this Goſpell, or elſe, ſhame ſhall ouertake
them. Now this farre as the wordes of the text furniſhes to me I
haue ſpoken of the duety of the people.</p>
               <p>Nowe, there is another precept added to this exhorting to
peace.<note place="margin">Peace co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</note> 
                  <hi>Be at peace,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>among your ſelues.</hi> This is agene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
precept giuen to Miniſters, to people, and to all men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding
peace, loue vnitie and concord of mynde. This is the
fountaine of other graces. She goes before vs as a mother, other
graces as children followe her: If ſhe goe not before, no fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
of graces. Where peace is, there is grace; where peace
is not, there is no grace. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> firſt to Tim. chap.
2. verſe 1 ſayes, <hi>Pray for Kings:</hi> for what end? <hi>that vve may lead a
quyet and a peaceable lyfe in all godlineſſe and honestie.</hi> Where he
meanes, where peace is, theſe two followes, godlineſſe which is
the ground of the firſt table, and honeſtie which is the ground
of the ſecond table. Where peace goes avvay, farevvell theſe
tvvo. Will ye looke to your ovvne families, if there be not
peace betvveen the Husband and the Wyfe, tell me what grace
can be in the familie? tell me can godlineſſe, can grace be in the
familie, vvhere there is nothing but ſtryfe and enuy? can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
honeſtie be there? No, no grace, Go to a Cittie, where there
is nothing but diſſention, can therebe grace, godlines or honeſty
there. Goe to a Kingdom or common-well, where a Kingdom
is rent in peeces, can there be grace, holineſſe or honeſtie there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
So it is the peace in Ieſus Chriſt, vvhich is the mother and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
of all graces; where the hearts of men and wemen are
bound vp in peace, there is flooriſhing, either in Citty or houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.
But yet vvhat peace ſhould this be? Wherein ſtandes it?
It ſtands not in a faire vvord, in a faire goode morrow, nor in an
outvvard behauiour, or falſe fained ſmiling vvith thy mouth,
vvhen thou haſt no loue in thy heart; but this peace ſtandes
chieflie in the lenitie and conjunction of myndes and heartes.
<hi>Paul</hi> to the Eph. chap. 4. verſ. 3. ſayes, <hi>Studie to keepe the vnitie of
the Spirit in the bond of peace:</hi> where he earneſtly recommends an
vnion of myndes. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Philippians in the 2. chap. verſ. 1.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:16659:148"/>
ſayes, <hi>If there be any conſolation in Christ, if any ſolace, if any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the ſpirite, if any bovvels of pittie, fill vp my ioy;</hi> and
wherein ſtandes it? <hi>Be,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>of lyke minde and affection:</hi> There
my joy, let your affection be one, haue one loue, haue one minde
dwell with all your ſoules together. Ioyne ſo your hearts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as if they were one heart: joyne your ſoules together, and
make vp one ſoule of all. And as concerning your judgements,
he ſayes, <hi>be not of contrare opinions</hi> and judgementes: There are
ſome that euer delytes in contradiction. When one will ſay one
thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will make a contradiction to it. Now ye ſee wherein
this peace ſtands, and this is the peace that makes vp the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes to the Romanes 14. 17. <hi>The Kingdom of
God ſtandes not in meate and drinke, but in peace and righteouſneſſe
tovvards God.</hi> Indeed the Kingdom of men will be made vp of
an outward counterfaite peace. The Grecian Kingdom, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Impire ſtoode of an earthly peace, but all vanitie, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Chriſt is made vp of an vnitie of our ſoules, knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Chriſt. When our conſcience is peaceable, then our ſouls
is knit to him, Reade the 4. chapter to the Epheſians, ye ſhall not
finde ſo many arguments in no place as there, to exhort men to
vnitie, <hi>There is,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>but one bodie, one ſpirite, one hope of your vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
one Lord Ieſus, one faith, one baptiſme, one God, one Father of
all.</hi> Then if there be ſo many one thinges, why ſhould ye not be
one. Now the whole bleſſing of men ſtandes in vnion. Yea, the
bleſſedneſſe of God ſtandes in an vnion, the Father, the Sonne,
and the holie Spirite vnited together in one God-hood. The
bleſſedneſſe of our nature ſtandes in the vnion with our head
Chriſt, and in the vnion of the members among our ſelues.
Where this vnion is not, there is nothing but miſerie. In the
Kingdom of Heauen there is nothing but vnity; by the contrare,
there is no peace in Hell. If the father and the ſonne goe to
Hell together, trow ye there ſhall be any loue betweene them?
No, nothing but inuy, all inuy and hatred is among the Deuils:
all peace and vnity is in God, who drawes the ſoules of men and
wemen together, and makes one ſoule as it were in that glorious
bodie of Chriſt. The Lord giue vs this bond of vnitie and loue
that we may be joyned with the reſt of the members in one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to our head Ieſus Chriſt. To whom with the Father and the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:16659:148"/>
Spirite be immortall praiſe honour and glore world without

Theſſalonians. As for theſe, whereof we

that ſhould be in them, that ſoberneſſe,
that ſpirituall armour, vvherevvith they

               <p>Now, in this text we haue reade preſently, firſt, we haue three
particulare directions, concerning three eſtates of perſones: firſt,
concerning vnruely men: ſecondly, concerning feeble minded
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:16659:149"/>
men: and laſt, concerning them, that are infirme and vveake in
ſaith, vveake in the knovvledge of Ieſus Chriſt, and of the
thinges, that concernes him, not firmely perſvvaded of them,
as vve ſhall heare,<note place="margin">3. diſeaſes, vvith their remedies.</note> in the ovvne rovvme. So, there are heere
three diſeaſes, or, ſpeciall ſickneſſes: The firſt is vnrulineſſe, that
is, louſe liuing; the next, feebleneſſe of hart; the thirde is vveake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and infirmitie in faith, and in that perſvvaſion, that, vve
ſhould haue, tovvardes Ieſus Chriſt and the Goſpell. And as
there are three diſeaſes, So, the Apoſtle preſcryues three ſeuerall
remedies againſt theſe three diſeaſes. Marke it. For euery diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
he preſcryues the ovvne proper remedie and cure, for in
ordinate liuing and vnrulie lyfe, Admonition; for feebleneſſe
of mynde and caſting dovvne of the Spirite, Comfort, for weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in faith and infirmitie, bearing vvith, to beare vvith the
vveake and infirme in faith Now, to goe throgh theſe, and firſt
to the diſeaſes, and next, to the remedies thereof. The firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
is vnrulineſſe,<note place="margin">1. Vnrue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</note> inordinatneſſe. The Apoſtle 2. Theſſa. 3.
chap. verſe 6. telles vvho are theſe, he calles vnrulie, they, that
<hi>liue not according to that doctrine and inſtruction, he gaue them.</hi>
The vvord of God is the rule of lyfe. The man, that liues not
according to the vvord of God is vnruly. Yet, more plainely in
that ſame place, he deſcryues the vnruely He calles them, 11.
verſe, <hi>they, vvho labours not for their liuing,</hi> they, vvho haue not a
trade of lyfe. Then, he addes, <hi>that are buſie bodies,</hi> buſie, in other
mens turnes, doing nothing in their ovvne, and therefore, they
muſt be exerciſed in euill exerciſes, in thinges, that pertaines not
to them; pratling and babling here and there, puting their hand
to this mans and that mans offices. There are tvvo properties,
idle and exerciſed; idle in their ovvne tume, exerciſed in other
mens turnes: An euill ſort of men, theſe men are vnruly. Now,
to come to the remedie, ſhortlie. The remedie is <hi>admoniſhing,</hi>
reprouing. This vnrulineſſe it is an euill maladie, and eneugh
to cauſe a man die. What medicine ſhould vve vſe to ſuch
men? ſhall we foſter and entertaine them in their folie? No, he
ſayes, admoniſhe them, vſe them ſharply and ſeuerely in admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
tell them, they are out of rule. The 2. Theſſa. chap. 3.
verſe 10. he telles, hovv hee vſed them, hee denounced againſt
them, <hi>that, if they vvrought not, they ſhould not eate,</hi> but, their
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:16659:149"/>
mouth ſhould be bound vp, ſo, that, they ſhould die for hunger.
Alſo, in that ſame place, he giues a charge to all men of ſeuere
themſelues from theſe men, that they may be aſhamed of that
life, it is a good and an honeſt thing to ſee a man well exerciſed,
and that in his owne calling.</p>
               <p>Novve, to come to the ſecond diſeaſe and remedie for it.
The next diſeaſe is feebleneſſe of mynde;<note place="margin">2. Feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mynde.</note> vvhen the heart of
man is caſten dovvne, troubled, aſſaulted, heauie, ſo, that there is
no ſpirite, nor, courage, but, ay going in the vvay of diſpaire.
What is the medicine and remedie of this man? Deale not
roughlie vvith one, vvho is diſeaſed after this maner, adde not
affliction to affliction, afflict not him, vvho is afflicted, trouble
not the troubled, the proper medicine to ſuch, is, comfort. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them, that are dejected in ſpirit: <hi>Dauid,</hi> in the 41. Pſalme 1.
verſe, he pronounces a ſpeciall bleſſing, to him, that vvill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the afflicted, <hi>Bleſſed is the man, that iudges vvyſoly of the poore,</hi>
that is, that can haue compaſſion on a troubled conſcience.
Now, the arguments of conſolation, he vſes, in that Pſalme, are
tvvo. The firſt, from the promiſes of God, to be beſtowed on
them, in Chriſt. The other, is, prayer: Promiſe then grace, to
the troubled heart in Ieſus Chriſt, and then, pray for it. If the
hart be dejected, no comfort for it, but, from God. Al the world,
all the powers in Heauen and earth are not able to comfort and
raiſe vp the ſoule, but, onely the power of God, through Chriſt
and his bleſſed Spirite.</p>
               <p>Novv, to the third diſeaſe and remedie thereof. It is vveake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in faith,<note place="margin">3. Weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in faith.</note> vveakeneſſe in the knovveledge of Chriſt and
the Goſpell, vvhen a man hes not a through ſight and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of theſe thinges, that concernes Ieſus and the Goſpell,
when he knowes them not vvell, neither is confirmed in them.
Such, as, concerning diuerſitie of meates, all meates are ſanctified
in Chriſt, many knew not that, and therefore made conſcience, in
obſeruing diuerſitie of meates, and likewiſe, as concerning daies,
that put difference in daies and keeped them, theſe he cals weak
ones. The remedy is, beare with them, breake not the bruſed
reede, quench not the ſmooking ſlax; no, enterteine the leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of grace in the weakeſt body. A fire that hes ſmook in
the beginning, if thou enterteine it, it will, in end grow a faire
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:16659:150"/>
fire. What knoweſt thou, but theſe, that hes a little ſparke of
faith, if they be enterteinde, by proceſſe of tyme will grow to
an high meaſure of knowledge, and will be as ſtrong, as thou.
<hi>Paul</hi> 15. chap. Rom. 1. verſe ſpeaking of theſe ſame weake ones,
ſayes, <hi>We vvho are ſtrong in faith,</hi> that is, knowes the libertie in
Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>let vs beare the infirmities of the vveake,</hi> take their
burdene off their back and lay it on our ſhoulders, heape not on
them burdene vpon burdene, but releue them, <hi>and that vve pleaſe
not our ſelues</hi> and make off-caſts of others. Therefore, he addes,
<hi>let euery one pleaſe their neighbour.</hi> Pleaſe their neighbour, and
beare with him, that is the word: and he commes on, with Chriſts
exemple. Chriſt <hi>he bare not vvith himſelfe,</hi> ſelfe-loue caried him
not, as it does vs, but, as it is written, <hi>the reproches of them, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
thee, fell on me.</hi> He ſpared himſelfe ſo little, that theſe igne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minies
and reproaches, that ſhould haue lighted on vs ſinners, he
tooke them on him. He tooke our burdeene on him. There are
the wordes ſhortly.</p>
               <p>Marke our leſſons. This world is all diſeaſed; men and we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in this world are full of diſeaſes: yea, and they, that thinks
themſelues wholeſt are ſickeſt. I will not ſpeake of the diſeaſes
of the bodie. There are few without their owne diſeaſes, and
that is the rewarde of ſinne, yea and death followes on the end
of them, but, I ſpeake of the ſickneſſe of the ſoules of men and
wemen; neuer one but they haue their owne diſeaſes in their
ſoule. He hes this ſickneſſe in his ſoule: ſhe hes that ſickneſſe
in her ſoule; he is miſerable in his ſoule, another feeble in minde,
the third, weake, without a ſure knowledge of Chriſt; euery one
of theſe ſickneſſes are deadlie, euerie one of them, eneugh, to
cauſe a creature die: Art tho vnruely, if it continue with thee,
and be not cured in tyme, it ſhall cauſe thee die, not ſuch a death,
as the death of the bodie; it is a ſickneſſe in the ſoule, thy ſoule
ſhall die. The ſickneſſe of the bodie will cauſe the bodie die,
if it be not cured; the ſickneſſe of the ſoule will cauſe the ſoule
die, if it be not cured: Art thou feeble minded, thou ſhalt goe
to diſpare, if thou be not comforted: Art thou weake in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
thou ſhalt grow weaker and grow to nothing, if thou
be not cured in tyme. So conſidring ſo many ſicke bodies, and
an heape of maladies among many Chriſtans, there muſt bee
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:16659:150"/>
be many mediciners. A man is a man, a Miniſter if he be his alone
in a flock, if he were the beſt Miniſter, that euer ſpoke among ſo
many diſeaſed bodies, what can he doe? Therefore, looke, how
many men are in the Church, there ſhould be as many medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
euery one of vs is bound to cure others diſeaſes. Thou
bound to cure my diſeaſe and I, thine; thou haſt one that I lack,
I muſt labor to cure thine; I haue a maladie, that thou lackeſt,
thou muſt labor to cure mine.<note place="margin">Compete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s medicine to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mans diſeaſe.</note> I tell you plainly, none of vs, but
we are bound to doe it: Thinke not, this perteines onely to a
Miniſter, to admoniſh, to inſtruct, exhort and rebuke, thinke not,
the Miniſter ſhould doe all: but, if thou be a member of Chriſt,
this binding is laide on thy back, to be a curer of thy ſick bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and ſiſter. Now, ye knowe the ſpeciall vertue, that is cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in a Mediciner, is diſcretion, to knowe the nature of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
to tell, this is this diſeaſe, that is that diſeaſe, and thereafter,
to apply ſalue to the ſore. To apply the competent medicine to
the ſickneſſe. He is nothing worth, that hes but one kinde of
ſalue for all ſoares, and he will deſtroy the bodie, if he apply on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one medicine for all ſores; For, that, which is mending ſalue to
one diſeaſe, it is poiſon to another diſeaſe: So, in the ſpiritual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciner,
diſcretion is craued, to knowe the maladie of our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and conforme thereto, to apply the medicine, When I ſee
an vnruly body, that workes nothing, that perteines to himſelfe,
but buſying his head, about other mens callinges, then, I ſhould
take the medicine of ſharpe rebuke and lay it to the ſore, and
tell him the diſeaſe, and bid him take a lawfull calling, that he
may ſerue God therein, and ſuſteine his body. Againe, when I
ſee one caſte downe in ſpirite, I muſt not vſe that medicine to
him, but, muſt comfort him. <hi>Iude</hi> in his Epiſtle verſ. 22 ſaies, <hi>Put
a difference</hi> among ſinners, in the curing of them, <hi>to ſome, ſhovve
comfort and compaſſion,</hi> ſome bodies craues pitty and compaſſion,
as to others, <hi>ſaue them,</hi> how? <hi>vvith terror,</hi> that is the word, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vengence on them, and he addes, <hi>pull them out of the fire
quickly,</hi> as it were, by the haire of the head, they are burning, if
thou ſaue them not with a ſharpe doing, the fire will conſume
them ſhortly. All men wold be handled meekly and gently, and
the vnruly man would be handled as tenderly, as the body, that
is dejected. Is that the way to cure him, to put ſmoothing coales
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:16659:151"/>
on him? no, that is the way to let him burne if he lye in the fire:
ſmooth him ouer he ſhall burne: A miſruelie man he ſtands, as
it were, in a fire, and ſuch a fire, as ſhall burne him, if he be not all
the ſooner pulled out.</p>
               <p>Now, I will not inſiſt on theſe particular directions, but, I goe
forward, <hi>be patient tovvard all men.</hi> This is a generall direction,
not giuen for a particular diſeaſe, that concernes this man, or,
that man, this diſeaſe, or, that diſeaſe in ſpeciall, but, this concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
all men and all wemen and is, as it were, a generall medicine,
meete for all diſeaſes: Patience, lenitie, long ſuffering, meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
(to ſpeake it ſo) is a ſimple medicine, that muſt be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with euerie medicine:<note place="margin">Leaity me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for al diſeaſes</note> Put therefore lenitie and meekneſſe
in rebuking; lenitie and meekneſſe, in threatning; lenitie and
meekneſſe, in admoniſhing: lenitie and meekneſſe, in exhorting,
euer lenitie: For, I tell you, if this verie ſimple, to wit, lenitie, be
not mingled with all medicines, the medicine ſhall become a
poiſon, rather, nor a medicine: As, for example, rebuke a ſinner,
that deſerues rebuking, if there appeare nothing in thy rebuke,
but, bitterneſſe, ſeueritie, anger and wraith, I tell thee, thy rebuke
is a poyſon, thou poyſons the man, that thou rebukeſt, thou e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difieſt
him not, thou deſtroyeſt him. Therefore, holde thy
tongue, be thou Miniſter, or, priuate Chriſtian, that hes nothing,
but bitterneſſe and gall, in rebukes, for, the Lord forbids ſuch,
to ſpeake and to rebuke, becauſe they, who onely ſpewes out
gall and bitterneſſe, makes medicine, venome, and ſo, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the bodie. Brethren, as this patience and lenitie ſhould
be vſed towardes all ſort of ſinners, ſo all ſhould vſe it. a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
a priuate Chriſtian, man, or, woman, aſwell, as a Miniſter:
Looke, that, none ſpeake anie thing to anie brother, or, ſiſter,
except it be tempered with lenitie, except the bodie finde
ſome ſweetneſſe, or, meekneſſe in the rebuke, or, admonition.

bent to reuenge. He ſayes, <hi>See, that, none recompence euill, for euill,

ſpoken, but, I shall binde me to the words of the Apoſtle. Then,
to come to the firſt words. <hi>See,</hi> beware, look to it. The word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
an earneſt care and ſtudie. As he would ſay, take care,
be earneſt, beware in this turne, for, it will begyle you, if you
take not all the better heede to it. This verie vvord, he vſes,
lettes vs ſee the great difficultie and hardneſſe, that is, in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this precepte, in not randering euill, for euill, but, by the
contrarie, randering goode, for euill. For, brethren, there is a
wonderfull promptneſſe and bentneſſe in the nature of all men

euer to reuenge, the ſpirit of vengence is by nature in euerie one
of vs, yea, in the ſillieſt and ſimpleſt bodie, that is. This poynte
of doctrine, not to rander euill for euill, but, by the contrare,
good, for euill, abhorres from nature, and nature abhorres it. Say
to a naturall man, doe not euill, for euill, but, doe good, for euill,
he will ſcorne and laugh at it, and many in Scotland ſcornes it.

               <p>But, to come to the precept it ſelfe. What forbids he? and what
bids he? He forbids one thing, and bids another thing: he forbids
to doe euill, for euill; he bids doe good, to all men, and that, at all
tymes; mutuallie doe good euery one euer to another; extend
not your beneficence to the faithfull onely, but, extend it to
all, from the King to the begger, to the Turke, to the Iew, &amp;c.
But, to come to the negatiue, that is forbidden. Doe no euill, for

randering good, for good, is euery where commanded, as for
randering good, for euill, it is alſo here commanded: As to the
third, to rander euil for euill, here it is forbidden: As to the fourth,
randering euill, for good, it is much more forbidden. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeakes not here expreſly of it, for, in a maner, it is thought,
that, ſuch foull vngratitude could not be in a man; I thinke the

to the Law of nature. The Philoſopher made not a law, againſt
a man, for ſlaying his Father, becauſe, ſaid he, I cannot trow, that,
there can fall our ſuch an vnnaturall fact: So, to rander euill,

not only the action of the hand, or, the ſpeach of the mouth,
to ſpeake an euill word, to doe an euill deed, but, he forbids alſo
the inward hatred of the hart; the Law of God touches the hart.
And he ſaies, On paine of death, looke, that, thou keepe no ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
nor, rankor in thy hart, to him, that hes done euil to thee, for,
ſuppoſe thou would not do him euill with thy hand, and would
hold thy tongue, yet, if rankor and vengence be in thy hart, thou

Magiſtrat cannot puniſh thee, if thou keep thy mouth and hand
from euill; yet, the Lord, that ſees the heart will reuenge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
rankor of the hart: he forbids likewiſe, that thou ſhould do
euill for euill to another. Men are now very vyle, in this pointe,
they will ſeeme to do no euill themſelues, yet, by another they
are doing euil, he is not reuenging with his own hand, but, yet, he
is reuenging wrong for wrong, with the hand of another man. O,
but, God will not be ſcorned, thou ſhalt pay for it ſurely. The
Lord ſees all the conuoy very wel, it is worſe, then the other thou

in reuenging thy querrel, yea, euen, when at the Magiſtrats hand
thou ſeekeſt juſtice of them, who hes done any injury to thee, be

which the Apoſtle joines together.
The firſt is the precept of patience, in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
wrong and not rendering euill for
euill, but, doing good for euill. Of this, we
heard the laſt day. There is next the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of joy and peace of conſcience, in
the firſt wordes, we haue preſentlie red,
Laſt, there is the precept of prayer, ſeeking to God, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, for the benefites reſaued, in the next part of the text.
The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> not onely in this place joines theſe three to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
but, alſo, in the 4. chap. to the Philipp. ye ſhall finde the
ſame three precepts joined together, howbeit not in this order.
he beginnes there,<note place="margin">Patience, ioye and praier ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> at joy, and he ſayes, <hi>reioice in the Lord alvvaies,

all men: for, the Lord is at hand;</hi> And laſt, he commes to prayer
and ſaies, <hi>be not carefull for any thing, but, in all things let your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
be ſhovvne to God, in prayer and thankeſ-giuing:</hi> Then, he
commes to peace of conſcience again, <hi>and the peace of God, vvhich
paſſes all vnderſtanding ſhall preſerue your harts, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe three are
joined together: The precept of patience, joy and prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
theſe three graces of God, patience, joy and prayer are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable,
euerie one of them joined vnſeparably with another:
tak one away, thou ſhalt not get the other; tak praier away, thou
ſhalt not haue joy; take joy away, thou ſhalt not get patience in
ſuffering. So theſe three are ſo vnſeparably lined together, that,
if they be not altogether in the hart of a man, none of them can
be in the hart; and if one be in the hart, all ſhall be in it. Howbeit
patience be ſet down firſt here, yet, it is not the firſt grace, praier
is firſt; joy, next, and then, patience: for, praier firſt bringes joy;
then, this heauenlie joy being broght forth and entertainde by
praier, it bringes patience, in ſuffering troubles. Now, brethren,
what ſhal we mak of this, ere we come to the words? Only, this,
the graces of God, which are parts of our new-birth called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
are ſo inſeparably locked together, that, they cannot
be ſeuered, and therefore, he, that would haue any one of them,
let him ſeeke them al; he that would haue patience, let him ſeeke
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:16659:156"/>
joy; and he that would haue joy, let him ſeeke praier, let him
ſeeke them altogether; either ſeeke them all and get them all, in
ſome meaſure, or, it ſhall paſſe thy power to keepe any one of
them, either keepe all, or, want all: this is their nature, ye ſaw ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
a chaine ſo linked together, as theſe graces of regeneration
are linked. It may be, that, a man haue the outward ſhowe of a
grace, but, indeed, it ſhall paſſe his power to haue a true grace,
except he haue the whole graces of this new-birth, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
Many will ſeeme to ſuffer wrong, and yet, they will not
haue the joy of the holy Spirit; but, they, that wants the joy of
the Spirit, albeit they ſeeme to ſuffer many wrongs, yet, they are
but hypocrites. Therefore, ſeeke one, ſeeke all; want one, want
all; either haue all, or, want all.</p>
               <p>But, to come to the text and ſpeake of this joy, <hi>Reioice,</hi> ſayes
the Apoſtle, <hi>euermore.</hi> True rejoicing, or, joy, is that joy, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines
patience in ſuffering. Goe to experience and try it.
There is none of vs, that hes taſted of this heauenlie joy, but, we
will finde, by experience, it raiſe vp the hart of man and woman
aboue all theſe thinges earthlie, in ſome meaſure. It raiſes vp the
hart to an higher kingdome, nor all the kingdomes in this earth,
this heauenly joy raiſes vs vp, to the kingdome of God. <hi>This
kingdome of God,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, Rom. chap 14. verſ. 17. <hi>Is peace
and ioy in the holie Ghoſt.</hi> So, that, they, who hes this joy, are in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
kingdome, as far aboue theſe earthly kingdomes, as the
heauen is aboue the earth, and by this joy, they are lifted vp, to
heauen, and being vp there, they look downe to all theſe things
on the earth, the troubles, afflictions and perſecutions, as thogh
they were nothing, and thinkes them nothing: joy being in the
hart, it ſwallowes vp the heauieſt diſpleaſure, that, can be (looke
this by experience) A little meaſure of it in the hart will ſwalow
vp ſadneſſe, ſuffering of wrongs and injuries in this world. This
world is but a world of ſuffering. In the 5. chapter of the Acts,
verſe 41. ye ſee, the Diſciples of Chriſt after his aſcenſion are
drawen in, before the Councell; there, they are ſcourged, manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and threatned, that they ſhould not ſpeake in the name of
Chriſt. But, what doe they, when they are dimitted? They go
away with joy: is there matter of joy heere? they are beatten,
ſcourged and boaſted, yet, they goe away with joy, <hi>reioicing, that,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:16659:157"/>

                     </gap>, to ſuffer, for Christs ſake.</hi> Brethren, if
joy had not ſwallowed vp ſadneſſe, the Apoſtles had not rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
Reade the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> He beginnes with ſuch a ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in many of them all, that he would appeare to be in Hell,
and ere the Pſalme be ended, ye will ſee, that, he burſtes out
with exceeding great thankfulnes. This meanes, that, there was
a joy, and an exceeding great heauines in the hart, and there was
a battell betwixt them, and in the end, joy got the victorie and
ſwallowed vp ſadneſſe.</p>
               <p>But, now, what is this joy, that he meanes of, when he ſaies, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce

all vnderſtanding, ſtanding about the hart, as a guard. And to
ſpeake the trueth of this, it is the end and crowne of all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God in Ieſus Chriſt, it is that end, whereto all the graces of
God tends: and when they come there, they go no further. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
came Chriſt in the world, but that we ſhould haue peace
and joy in conſcience? Wherefore died he? that we ſhould haue
joy. Wherefore roſe he? that we ſhould haue joy in his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Wherfore are we all called to be Chriſtians? that we ſhold
rejoice. Wherefore are our ſins remitted? onely to rejoyce. This
is the end of all, joy. What is Heauen but joy? What is life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
but joy vnſpeakable? What is glorie, but joy? <hi>Paul</hi> joynes
theſe two together, joy and the crowne of glorie. 1. Theſſ. chap.
2. verſ 19. Therefore, in one word, what is true happines? nothing
but joy, joy in God, throgh Ieſus Chriſt. What is any thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Heauen without joy in the hart? If a man haue all the world
and all the honour and riches of the world, except he haue joy
in them, what auaill they? So, joy is the bleſſedneſſe of men and
women: And therefore, when the Apoſtle bids vs rejoice euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
what craues he, but, that we ſhould preaſe euer forward to
our bleſſednes and Heauen; begin thy bleſſednes here, or, thou
ſhalt neuer get bleſſednes hereafter Life euerlaſting begins here,
in a meaſure of joy, that is not perſite, and ends in the next life,
in glory, which ſhall be perfited.</p>
               <p>Yet, brethren, the nature of joy would be better ſeene and
knowen, that men be not deceiued with it. The joy, that is cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
of what kinde is it? There are ſundrie kindes of joy. Is it a

                  </note> that will be in the mouthes of prophaine
people; be merie, eat, drinke. Is that this joy? no, no. When <hi>Paul</hi>

Eate, drinke and be merie: The joy, that he craues, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thereof is not fleſhly: but, it is cleane, holie and ſpirituall.
To ſpeake the trueth, it is in the hart (all joy is in the hart of a
bodïe) but, it is not ſo much the joy, that is of the naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as it is the motion of the ſpirit of Chriſt within vs, vſing the
affectiones of our hart as a parte to reioyce in, when he is
dwelling in vs. When a man reioyces naturallie, it is his heart,
that reioyces, but, this is another kinde of reioycing. It is the
Spirite of conſolation, that comforts, the Spirite of Ieſus, that

with a worldly joy proceeding of a worldly thing, (if it were all

matter of it? there muſt be ſome cauſe of this joy. No joy, but
there muſt be ſome cauſe and matter, that moues it. Then, what
is the matter of it? There are two ſorts of things in the world,
that wakens vp joy in the heart of man. The firſt is earthly
things; ye know the things, worldlie honor, riches, they waken
vp joy in the hart: Another ſort is called ſpritual, heuenly, clean.
There is no other, but, theſe two, either things heuenly, or earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
to cauſe men to rejoyce. Then, are theſe earthly things the
matter of this ſpirituall joy he ſpeaks of? Examine the nature of
it, it is ſpirituall, it is the joy of Chriſt. Will theſe worldly things,
if there be no further conſideration of them, cauſe the Spirit of
Chriſt rejoyce within thee? Will a kingdome make Chriſtes
Spirit within the hart of a man, to rejoyce, if there be nothing
more, but, as it is a worldly kingdome? No, I ſay, they will not be
the matter of this joy: looke to theſe worldly things how thou
reſaueſt them, if they be not reſaued out of Gods hand as arleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennies
of heauenlie thinges, and tokens of better benefites and
of life euerlaſting, they ſhall neuer make the Spirit of Chriſt to

of meate, if thou take it out of Gods hand, as a token of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

No, they cannot. If my joy reſtes on earthly things, when
earthly things failes me, of neceſſity my joy muſt faile me. When

faile, therefore, the joy in worldly things muſt faile, and ſpecially,

ſpark of comfort and joy will be lying, as it were, ſmored vnder
an heap of aſhes, ſo, that, it will not be known by the perſons ſelf,
in whom it is, and yet, it will be lurking in this hart; and in ſpite of
the deuill and the world (that would driue men to diſpare) it will
break out. <hi>Dauid</hi> felt this, when he had angred the Spirite. and

the Spirit, albeit in the meantime this Spirit was within him. The
Lord keep vs, from angering this Spirit; if thou anger him, he wil
anger thee, and wil draw himſelf aſide, in ſuch ſort, that thou wilt
not know, thou haſt him; and, in the meantime, he will waken the
conſcience of ſin and make it accuſe thee, and as a tortor within
thee, to torment thee, as if thou wert in Hell. Therefore, anger not
the Spirit of Ieſus. This much for this precept.</p>

As if he had ſaid, when ye are troubled for any worldlie
thing, I tell you, if ye can call to God. for all thinges that falles
out, ye ſhall get contentment; Gods, Spirite ſhall guard you in all
trouble, the peace of God ſhall preſerue you; what haſt thou loſt,
when thou haſt loſt the world and gotten that heauenly joy?
When thou haſt gotten an heauenly thing for an earthly, what
haſt thou loſt? No, neuer man, in the want of an earthly thing
praied to God effectually, but, he got co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, he got that peace of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:16659:161"/>
conſcience. So, that, if the got not the earthly thing, he got heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thinges. Thou wilt finde ſuch joy in the hart, after prayer,
that it is vnſpeakable. Then, it is prayer, that foſters joy: For, I
tell you, homelines with God in prayer, makes joy, and keepes
Gods preſence in our eyes Euer ſeeke from him and euer ſpeake
to him, and that will keep the face of Ieſus before vs. Now, what
is it, that keeps joy in the hart? Onely the keeping of the face of
Ieſus in the hart. When thou haſt not the face of Ieſus, no joy.
Turne thy hart from the face of Chriſt, and turne thy ſpeache
from him, thou ſhalt haue no joy in hart. Againe, turne thy hart
to the face of Ieſus, hold thy hart before his face, of neceſſitie
thou ſhalt haue joy. Felt ye euer the ſpirituall joy, when ye
felt not Chriſt in the hart? Who euer felt comfort, that felt not
Chriſt dwelling in their hart? None. Therefore, <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes,
<hi>Beleeuing in him.</hi> (What is beleeuing in him, but, keeping him in
hart?) <hi>vvere ioyce vvith ioy vnſpeakbale.</hi> 1. Epiſt. chap. 1. verſe 8.
Would to God this were more, nor wordes. Our hart and minde
is ſo blinde and ſenſleſſe, that, Chriſt and all his graces is but
wordes and winde, that ſtrikes on the eare. Seeke the ſolide fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Chriſt in the hart. Thinke it not eneugh, to prattle of him
and to haue him in thy mouth, but, ſeek to finde him in thy hart.
Thou ſhalt neuer finde him, if thou finde him not in thy hart, it
is in the hart, he makes his reſidence; and if he be inthy hart, thou
ſhalt know: for, thou ſhalt find a ſenſible ioy poſſeſſing thy hart
and it ſhall open thy mouth, to ſay, dwel Lord, in my hart: The
Lord worke theſe things, that they be not words.</p>
               <p>Now, brethren, there are two ſortes of praier. One, in ſeeking
to beg and ſeeke at God,<note place="margin">tvvo ſorts of prayer.</note> for, we are all beggers. The other is in
thanking him, when we haue gotten any thing: Seeking muſt
come of need and neceſſity: a begger muſt be a miſterfull body,
otherwaies,<note place="margin">1. Seeking</note> he is a ſhameleſſe begger. He is ſhameleſſe, who can
ſtand before God and ſeeke any thing, if he haue no ſenſe of his
need and miſter? Our neede and miſter is double. For, we miſter
ay a new grace, euery moment, a new benefite: we neuer get ſo
many graces at once, but, euer there is ſome new grace we ſtand
in need of. God giues thee not all benefites at once, but he vvill
haue thee euer ſeeking: againe, when we haue receiued any grace,
we haue need of a new grace, to keepe it. Alas, we are ſo weake,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:16659:161"/>
that, we cannot but loſe the grace, that, God hes beſtowed on vs,
except the Lords hand follow on and keep it in our hart. There
are two needs of praier. One need of grace, another need, to keep
the grace, we haue receiued. So, there is two ſorts of begging: the
firſt is for grace; the next is for keeping of the grace. Neuer
wearie to aske. The Lord wold haue thee euer begging. Ay, ſay,
Lord, giue me. Then, ſay, Lord keepe this grace, thou haſt giuen
me, otherwaies, I will loſe it. For, I aſſure thee, if the Lords hand
be not euerie moment holding grace in thy hart, thou art ay rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to loſe it. Therefore, the Apoſtle ſayes, Pray continually. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
if we knew what thing we are bound to, we would diſcharge
a better duety to our God, we ſhould not paſſe the time in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but, we ſhould pray continually.</p>
               <p>Ye vvill thinke it an hard thing to be euer praying; ye vvill
ſay, ſhould we do no other thing, but, ay, pray, ſhould this be our
exerciſe continually? Take heed: By praying, is vnderſtood, not
preceeſly this outward forme of prayer, the falling down on our
knees, the lifting vp of our hands and eyes, ſo, that we do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
turne. No, I meane not ſo. Thou haſt a lawfull vocation,
go win thy liuing, according to thy calling. He that ſaid, Pray
continually, The ſame ſaid, Go labour and win thy liuing, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
thou ſhalt not eat. Avvay vvith Munkries and Nunries.
Then, when continuall prayer is craued, no other thing is craued,
but, that, thy hart and minde be euer exerciſed on God. Let thy
hart and contemplation of thy mynde be euer on him, be neuer
ſo diſtracted with any exerciſe of the world, but, keep God euer,
in ſome meaſure, before thy eyes, ſeeking his grace and bleſſing
to thy exerciſe. When thou art buſieſt in thy exerciſe, let thy
hart be ſeeking bleſſing thereto. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, 1. Cor. 10. chap. 31.
verſe, <hi>Whether ye eat, or, drinke,</hi> or, what euer ye do all to the glory
of God. If I eat to the glory of God, my hart muſt be bleſſing &amp;
thanking him for the benefit receiued, ſeeking a bleſſing of him,
that it may doe me good, deſyring, alſo, that heauenly foode. I
tell thee, this earthly foode ſhould be nothing elſe to thee, but, a
remembrance of heauenly things, and of Chriſt, that is onely the
foode of the ſoule. Then, in all thy exerciſes, euer hold thy hart
on God; let thy hart be praying, when thy tongue is ſpeaking of
theſe thinges, that concernes thy exerciſe, ſo, thy exerciſe ſhall
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:16659:162"/>
be in the Lord. The Apoſtle vſes to ſay, do this, and do that, in
the Lord. What means he, but, only, in that doing thy hart ſhold
be ſet on the Lord? Ay enterteine Gods Spirit. Thinke not, that,
the exerciſing of the hart on Chriſt ſhal hinder thee, in any thing,
in thy exerciſe. No, but, by the contrare, the face of God looking
on thee it brings bleſſing; keep him in thy eie and think on him,
and ſo, thy exerciſe ſhall be ſweete; keepe God in thy eye, and
thou ſhalt finde a wonderfull joy, and an helpe in thy exerciſe.
Now, I end, with this prayer. Lord, ſeeing there is no bleſſing but,
when we keep Ieſus Chriſt in our eyes, Lord, grant, that, the face
of Chriſt go neuer out of our eyes let neuer the remembrance of
Ieſus depart from vs. To this Chriſt, be honour and glorie, for
euer.</p>

which we haue in hand preſently, ſtands
in an exhortation to an holie lyfe and
conuerſation vvorthie of the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt. The laſt day, we ſhew you, there
are three preceptes joyned together; the
precepte of patience, to beare vvrong
and injuries in this vvorlde patientlie,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:16659:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not to rander euill for euill, as we are bent by nature, but, to
do good for euill. Then next, the precept of joy, the inward joy,
and peace of ſoule and conſcience, that paſſes all vnderſtanding
that, euermore we ſhold rejoyce. And laſt, the precept of prayer,
which ſtandes in two partes, the one, in ſeeking at the hands of
God; the other, in thanking him, for the grace receiued at his
handes. We ſhew you that conjunction that is among theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
patience, joy and prayer, patience is the effect of joy, and
the inward joy that is heauenly and ſpirituall is the meane to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteine
patience, and to make a man beare patiently the wrongs
he ſuffers in this preſent world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, in a maner, it rauiſhes him vp
aboue the world and all thinges in the world, and makes him
to looke ouer all theſe earthly thinges and injuries that falles
out in the world, as though they were not, and, in ſome meaſure,
he hes his contemplation with God, in Heauen. So, that, the joy
he hes will ſwallow vp all theſe earthly troubles, and the life of
God in him will ſwallow vp mortalitie and death. Againe, praier
is the meane to enterteine that joy we haue with God, for, it
keeps Gods preſence and the face of Ieſus in our ſight, and the
face of Ieſus is ſo joyfull, as no tongue can tell: For, all the light
and joy we haue in our harts proceedes from the face of Ieſus,
and from the face of God in Chriſt, and then, it ſhynes on vs.
And this face of Ieſus it ſhines in the Goſpell. And therefore,
bleſſed were we, if we could looke euer in the mirrour of the
Goſpell, where we ſhall get this light and the face of Chriſt, that
makes vs rejoyce: it appeares in a mirrour now, but, we ſhall ſee
him face to face, when the body of Ieſus ſhall be perfect; all is
but a beginning now, that, we haue here, he is far from vs, and al
the ſight we haue of him is but a blenke; let euery one looke to
experience; there are ſo many thinges goes in betweene vs and
him, that we can skarcely keepe his face, in the which ſtandes
our joy. Alwaies, it is prayer, that enterteines this preſence of
God; looke to it by experience, take away prayer that men pray
not to God, take away mediatation and thanking of God, take
away this communing with God, it ſhall paſſe thy power, to
haue any preſence of him, and without his preſence, no joy in
him. Then, ſhortly, to come to the matter in hand: This prayer
conſiſtes in two parter. In asking and ſeeking at him, according
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:16659:163"/>
to the needs and miſters we haue, we are ful of wants and miſters.
There is none of vs all, from the greateſt to the loweſt, from the
King to the begger but great is the need we haue; ſo, euery one of
vs hes need to be begging: neuer was there a begger at our doore,
that hes ſo great neede to beg, as we haue neede to beg at Gods
hand: beg things ſpirituall and things temporall; things for this
life, things for the life to come; for, if we beg not, we ſhall die for
hunger and plaine want of grace, and we ſhall, not onely loſe
this lyfe preſent, but a better life, life euerlaſting. The next part
of Praier is thankſgiuing; we ſpoke the laſt day of ſeeking. Now,
this day, firſt, in this text, we haue red, we haue to ſpeak of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing

no more, but this grace; in thy need, to get grace to ſeek grace, it
is a ſpeciall grace; thou art obliſt to thanke God, for that grace,
thou getſt, to beg grace. Againe the bleſſing and mercy of God

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:16659:163"/>
flooriſhing eſtate, thou art in, thou ſtandeſt in neede. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Monarch, that is in his greateſt flooriſhing, he ſtandes in
neede; and therefore, as he hes cauſe to thanke that God, that
hes exalted him, ſo hes he cauſe, to be a begger, to ſeeke more:
For, there is a Kingdome, that is aboue all Kingdomes; a glorie,
aboue all this glorie; riches, aboue all theſe riches; a pleaſure,
aboue all earthlie pleaſure; ſo, as long as thou art not come to
this hight; yet, beg, for, none ſhall come to that hight, neyther
King, nor, Monarch ſhall come there, but, by continuall begging.
Ye ſee <hi>Dauid,</hi> in his Pſalmes, he prayes and askes, when he is in
neede and in his neceſſitie. But, at that ſame very tyme, he alſo
thankes: Ye ſee, he will begin a Pſalme with great heauineſſe of
hart, but, ere he come to the end, ye will ſee, in that ſame Pſalme,
how he will rejoce, and with joy he will thanke. Then, looke
<hi>Paul,</hi> in the beginning of all his Epiſtles, he commonly ſayes, <hi>I
thank God for you;</hi> but what more? are ye in ſuch eſtate, that, I need
not pray for you? No. Therefore, he ſubjoynes, <hi>euer praying for
you.</hi> As he would ſay, as I am thanking God for you; ſo, I am
a begger for you. Brethren, learne to pray, by example of theſe
old fathers, who were better learned, nor we. When thou ſeekeſt
any thing at God, thanke him alſo; there is not a more forcible
argument to God, to mooue God to graunt any thing, nor to
thanke him: I cannot knowe what tune a prayer can haue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thanking: For, effectuall prayer cannot be vvithout thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
To let you ſee this, in one word. Read Rom. chap. 8. verſe
36. and there, ye ſhall finde, that, the Spirit of Ieſus interceedes
for vs. Well, if the Spirit of Ieſus raiſe vp in the hart ſighes, and
furniſhes thee prayer, it ſhall not be without thankſgiuing. And
if thy prayer be any thing worth, it muſt come from the Spirite
of God. Many vvill make a forme of prayer, but, vvithout the
Spirite, it is but pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nable.
Therefore, enter neuer to prayer, but aske the Spirite
of Ieſus to pray with. It is impoſſible to man to open his mouth
to pray feruentlie, except the Lord open it by his Spirite.
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſay in his 51. Pſalme, verſe 15. <hi>Lord, open thou my mouth
and then, I ſhall preache thy praiſe.</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> to the Corinthians,
ſayes, <hi>None can name the name of Ieſus and call him Lord, but by
the holie Ghoſt.</hi> 1. Cor. 12. chap. 2. verſ. if the Spirit open not thy

mouth, thou may bable of that glorious name, but, to ſpeake of
it to thy comfort, and as thou ſhould doe, without the Spirite
teach thee, it is impoſſible. Now, to returne to the matter. If the
prayer be any thing worth, if the Spirit of Ieſus requeſt for vs
with ſighes vnſpeakable, then, impoſſible it is, but God muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
thee. The Spirit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

without effect. If the Spirite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> prayer to thee, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
but thou muſt reſaue an anſwere. Rom. chap. 8. verſ. 26. it
is ſaid, <hi>The spirt interceeds vvith ſighes vnſpeakable: And the
Lord knovves the meaning of his ovvne spirite.</hi> A man ſighes not
ſo ſoone with the Spirite of God, but, as ſoone is the ſigh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
vp to the preſence of God. And to ſpeake it plaine, the
ſigh touches not the hart of man ſo ſoone, but, as ſoone it touches
the hart of God; ſo, of neceſſitie he muſt receiue an anſwere. The
very prayer makes a way and acceſſe to the preſence of God.
And brethren, all the joy in this world is in that ſight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God. Thou neuer knew what joy was, that neuer got a
ſight of God, in Chriſt. Then, what muſt joy bring out? (Prayer
to God gets Gods preſence, the preſence bringes joy) What muſt
joy bring out? Of neceſſitie, an hart, that rejoyces, muſt burſt
out in thankfulneſſe. If the hart rejoyce, the mouth muſt be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to thanke. Go to experience. Your harts was neuer touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with joy, but, either hart, or, mouth burſted out in thanking.
Ioy cannot be without thanking, and the proper effect of joy
it thankfulneſſe. Then, ye ſee, neither ſhould theſe two, Prayer
and thankfulneſſe be ſeuered one from another, neither can they
be ſeuered. It may be, our Spirit will make vs pray and vtter not
thankeſ-giuing; but, all that is partling and vttering of griefe,
and not prayer; but, the Spirit of God prayes not without thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, and againe, he thankes not, without prayer. Now, to
go forward. I haue made you ſee how theſe two goes together.
But, to come neerer the purpoſe: We ſaid, whatſoeuer forte of
prayer it be, whether it be asking or thanking, it ſerues to bring
out joy, all tendes to joy; for, in joy is our bleſſedneſſe: I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ould
you the laſt day, the bleſſedneſſe of man is in rejoycing in God.
So, that, he who hes not that ſpirituall joy, hes no bleſſedneſſe,
if they had al the world. Then, we ſee, prayer bringes joy, asking
bringes joy, ſo, alſo, vve ſee, thanking bringes joy, thanking of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:16659:164"/>
God riſes on joy, thanking of God ends in joy, thanking of God
ſtandes in the midſt. Prayer will begin with ſorrow, and it ends
in joy, vpon this joy commes thanking, vpon thanking commes
joy againe. So, all endes in joy. Would ye haue this out of the
Scripture? in that 4. Philipp. verſe 7. drawes not <hi>Paul</hi> that peace
of God, that paſſes all vnderſtanding, our of prayer and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing?
<hi>In all things, let your requests be ſhovv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n to God vvith prayer
and ſupplication, vvith thankeſgiuing.</hi> Then, he ſubjoines, when ye
haue prayed and thanked, <hi>that peace,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>that paſſes all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
ſhall guard your mindes in Christ.</hi> Then, peace riſes on
theſe two groundes, prayer and thankſgiuing to God. So, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brings joy, aſvvell as prayer.</p>
               <p>To go forward in the words. <hi>Thank him,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>in all things.</hi>
As he would ſay, in all thinges, that are incident and falles out
in the world, thanke him. As all is matter of joy, Proſperity and
aduerſitie; vvell, vvoe; life, death; ſo, let all be matter of thanking,
what euer he ſends, thanke him. Is it a great matter, to thanke
him in proſperitie, when thinges goes well with thee? But, I ſay,
thou haſt not the grace of thankſgiuing, except thou can thanke
him aſvvell in aduerſitie, as proſperity, aſvvell in death, as in life.
Then, I ſee, theſe three thinges, joy, prayer and thanking, they
haue a common propertie, which is continuance, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
in all maner of thinges, in proſperitie, in aduerſitie, in
well, in woe, in life, in death rejoyce euermore; in proſperitie, in
aduerſitie, in well, in woe, in life, in death, pray euer. And laſt, in
proſperitie, in aduerſitie, in vvell, in vvoe, in life, in death, in all
thinges thanke him: Will ye go through them. As for joy, thy
eſtate can not be ſo euill in the world, if thou be in Chriſt, but
thou haſt matter of ioy: Then, againe, vvere thy eſtate in this
vvorld neuer ſo good, yet, thou haſt neede to pray; for, ſo long
as thou remainſt here, thou getſt not all graces: And laſt, if thy
eſtate vvere neuer ſo miſerable, yet, if thou haue a grip of Chriſt,
thou haſt matter to thanke God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then, if this be true, hes not the
Apoſtle ſaid well? Reioyce euermore. Then pray continually,
then, in all thinges giue thankes to God: Let not therefore theſe
thinges be vvords onely, but, practiſe them in lyfe. There is
none of vs, but vve haue matter to practiſe our ioy. Who are in
ſuch a miſery, but they haue ſome matter of ioy; yea, there are
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:16659:165"/>
none of vs, but we haue cauſe, to vſe all theſe preceptes; Rejoice
euermore; pray continually; and in all things giue thankes.</p>
               <p>Now, to come to the reaſon, in the next wordes. <hi>For, this is
the vvill of God.</hi> In all thinges, in proſperitie, in aduerſitie, thanke
him. Wherefore? Becauſe it is Gods will, that, ye ſhould thanke
him, aſwell in aduerſitie, as in proſperitie; in death, aſwell as in
life, it is his will, reſt on his will. Yet, brethren, to ſpeake one
vvord of this vvill (I haue ſpoken of it ſundrie tymes before)
I ſay, and the Scripture ſayes, The onely light of this vvorld
is Gods vvill.<note place="margin">Gods vvil, the onely thinge to be knovvn, &amp; the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> And I ſay, the onely knowledge and wiſdome,
that a man can haue in this vvorld, is to knovve vvhat is Gods
vvill. Fy on all the knowledge and vviſdome of men in this
world, if they knowe not this. He will ſtart vp, and he will be
called a vviſe man. All the Philoſophers vvould be counted
vviſe men: but, vvhich of all the Philoſophers did knovve
vvhat vvas Gods vvill? And theſe tvvo partes of his vvill is
ſpeciallie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oulds vs in the Scripturel Firſt, vvhat vve ſhould
doe, that vve may ſerue him. And then, vvhat he vvill doe with
vs. A vaine Philoſopher hee knovves much of nature, but
knovves he the vvill of God? Knovves he it not? Then, he is
a plaine foole. Knovves he theſe thinges? Then, he is a vvyſe
man. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the Epheſians, chap. 5. verſe 17. <hi>Be not fooles, but
vnderſtand vvhat is the vvill of God.</hi> Then, wherein ſtandes wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?
To knowe what is the will of God. Who is the foole? He
that knowes not, what is the will of God. Who knowes Gods
will is wiſe, and the end ſhall proue it. Then as the onely true
knowledge and wiſdome in this world is to know Gods will: ſo,
the onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and ſquare of our life in the world, is the rule of
Godds will. There are two thinges, we haue to ſeeke, knowledge
and action. Would thou haue knowledge? Know Gods will.
Would thou haue action and do any thing that would merite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
commendation? Do according to Gods will. The rule, of all
actions that is truely commendable in Gods ſight is his will: for,
that man who hes the commendation of God, is onely the man,
that ſhould be commended; do any thing becauſe God hes wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
thee to do it; go not to thy, own will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, thou do, thy wil &amp;
maners not being agreable with Gods wil, ſhall lead thee to Hel.
Then, do nothing, but, according to Gods will. Firſt, know what
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:16659:165"/>
is Gods wil, and then, do nothing for al the world, but, that, which
is agreable thereto. If thou doeſt thy own will, or, the will of any
man, looke, that, it be conformable to Gods will and ſo, do it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwaies,
not, and then, do it, becauſe it is the will of God, and
not becauſe it is the will of man. Then, ſee ye not, how graue an
argument, the Apoſtle ſets downe, knowing it is Gods will, that,
we ſhould thank him ay, ſhould we not repoſe on his will? It
is Gods vvill, vvhich is the onely light and rule of all actiones.
Whoſoeuer knowes his will, they haue a faire light in all their
actiones. A man will neuer wander wrong, who hes ſuch a light
before his eyes. If thou ſee, that, it be Gods vvill that thou goe
through wilderneſſe, through darkneſſe, yea, through Hel, obey
his will and take journey, and I promiſe thee, thou ſhalt finde
the faireſt outgait, that euer was. Count not of the way, if thou
haue the light of the will of God before: It is not poſſible, that,
Hell ſhall preuaile againſt that bodie, that ſettes the ſelfe to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
God. Well is him, that ſets himſelfe to pleaſure him, who is
Lord ouer all, and who onely is able to pleaſure vs all. The
world ſhall not pleaſure thee, if God pleaſure the not. What mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to diſpleaſe all the world, if we ſet our ſelues to pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>Marke, further, he ſayes, <hi>It is the vvill of God, tovvardes you.</hi>
This is a ſpeciall will, that concornes all Chriſtians, not a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
will, concerning the world, but, a ſpeciall will, concerning
you, that are Chriſtians, vvho hes giuen your names to Chriſt,
and are tranſlated from this vvorld, that ye thanke him, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie
and aduerſitie, in vvell and vvoe, there is the meaning.
Then, ye ſee, in this place, a ſpeciall, vvill of God concerning
this calling vve ſtand in, and the ſpeciall, vvill of God, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vs Chriſtians, is, that vve thanke him: Chriſtian men and
vvemen are moſt debtfull to thanke him, and ought, aboue all
creatures, to thanke him: Fy on thee, that vvill take the name of
Chriſt on thee and not thanke him. Thanke him in all things, he
can lay before thee. It is his will, that thou thanke him, at leaſt,
ſtriue to thanke him for well and woe, proſperity and aduerſity,
for death, aſwell, as life. As for other men, Iewes, Turkes and
Pagans, &amp;c. that are not Chriſtians, God craues not this thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing
at them. A maruelous thing. The Turke he hes the glory
and wealth of the vvorld, and yet the Lord ſayes, I vvill haue no
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:16659:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thankes of thee, neither in vvell, nor in vvoe, becauſe thou art
not in Chriſt, all my glory is in Chriſt, all the ſeruice I craue in
the vvorld is in Chriſt. So, the pratling of the Turke and Ievv,
that makes them to thanke God, is all but vanitie, he craues it
not of them. O, hovv great a honour is it, to call a man to thanke
and to ſerue him. No, neuer King got ſuch great honour, as vve
get, vvhen vve are called to thanke and to ſerue that King of
Kings, all our glory ſtandes in ſeruing and making homage to
God; ſo bleſſed are they that are called to this honour, through
Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore, he ſayes, <hi>through Chriſt,</hi> meaning, that,
in Chriſt is the matter of all thankſgiuing. There is matter in
Chriſt, of all thankſgiuing. In vvell and vvoe, <hi>Chriſt is to me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage,
both in lyfe and death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ſayes <hi>Paul.</hi> If thou haſt aduantage
in death, vvhy ſhould not thou thanke him? In one word, where
Chriſt is, there is matter of thankſgiuing to God, in the greateſt
miſery we can be in the world. Againe, where Chriſt is not and
who are not in him, as members of that glorious body, ioyned in
ſociety with that glorious head, if they had all this broad world,
they haue no cauſe to be merie, nor to thanke, no, to open their
mouth to praiſe. And to ſpeak the trueth, they cannot be merie.
They may laugh, but, the true ioy is in God, he is the Lord of
ioy; a man may well laugh, but, he can haue no true ioy, except
he haue Ieſus in his hart. That man in aduerſitie and in the point
of death will laugh more ſweetly and vtter greater ioy, nor the
greateſt worldly man in the midſt of his proſperitie. So, I ſay,
and I command thee, looke, that, thou reioice not, without Chriſt;
I ſay, to all men, reioyce not, but, be ſad, if thou haſt not Chriſt.
The Lord hes not ordeined thee to be glad, it is his will, onely
that they, that are in Chriſt, reioyce, and be neuer glad vntill
thou get Chriſt. I counſell you, if ye had all the world, if ye
find not Chriſt in the hart be, neuer glad. What matter haſt thou
to be glad, when the great God turnes his back on thee? It may
be, he will caſt a kingdome to thee ouer his ſhoulder, as it were
a bone caſten to a dog, what is that to thee, if thou get not his
ioyfull preſence? Read <hi>Dauid,</hi> in all his Pſalmes, he was neuer
glad, but, when he had the preſence of God.</p>
               <p>Now, I come to the next precept. <hi>Quench not the spirit.</hi> The
wordes are few, but, they conteyne great matter. <hi>Quench not the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:16659:166"/>
spirit,</hi> put not out the holy Spirit of Chriſt. Take heed. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bene ſpeaking before of the graces of God. What is patience
in ſuffering wrong? What is joy? What is thankfulneſſe, but the
graces of the Spirit? He hes beene before ſpeaking of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and recommending them to thee. Now he commes to that
glorious perſon himſelfe, vvho is the giuer and vvorker of all
theſe graces, of Patience, of Joy, of Prayer and Thankſ-giuing.
The holie Spirit the third perſon of the Trinitie that God giues
to me and thee, if thou be Gods ſeruant. It is vanity to think that
a true Chriſtian man gettes onely the graces of the Spirit: they
get the verie Spirite. No, it is not the graces of the Spirite that
will dwell in the hart and ſoule and bodie of a man; no, but the
Spirit it ſelfe. The Spirit will dvvell as ſurelie vvithin thy hart as
euer a man dvvelt in an houſe. That Comforter that Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to his diſciples when he was going vp to Heauen, was not
the graces of the Spirit; no, but, the Spirite it ſelfe to dwell in our
hart, and to work it in al the graces. So, it is not the graces, but, the
ſpirit he ſpeaks of, here, when he ſaies, quench not the ſpirit. <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaies, Epheſ. chap 4. verſ. 30 <hi>Grieue not the holy spirit.</hi> It is a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

It is borrovved and not proper and it is borrovved from
a fyre or candle that vſes to giue light and heate. Then if it
muſt not be quenched: It muſt follovve that the Spirite of
Chriſt muſt be a fyre vvithin vs; It muſt follovve, he muſt be a
light inlightning our ſoules as a lanterne and lampe of light
ſet vp within the darke and dead ſoule, to let the ſoule and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiones
haue light; and the Spirite of Ieſus ſhynes vvithin
the darke ſoule of a man, as a lanterne ſhynes in a darke night,
and puttes out that maſſe of darkneſſe that is in the ſoule of
man. And therefore becauſe it is as a fyre, he ſayes, <hi>Quench not,</hi>

anſwerable to the word. Thou muſt feede him with holy moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

from him the matter he feeds on, but to giue him as it were poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

Alas if a honourable man would come in thy houſe and take a

thee out of the deuils hands, out of thy ovvne hands, for thou
vvould loſe both thy ſoule and thy body, if it vvere in thy hand.
He hes boght thee with the bloud of the immaculat Lambe, and
to this purpoſe to be a ludging of the holy Spirit to dwell in.
He is ſpeaking to harlots, he ſayes. <hi>Thou art not thy ovvn: Thou art
boght vvith a pryce.</hi> God hes boght thee with the bloud of Chriſt
to be a temple of the holy Spirit. Where the Spirit ludges, there
is the Father and the Son, the whol Trinitie. So in effect the man
boght with the bloud of Chriſt is a ludging to the Trinitie, the
Father, Son and holy Ghoſt. Alas, if thou could looke to this, for
all the world thou would not deſtroy that ludging of God. If
once this trueth of God could ſinke in mens harts, for all the
world they would not quenche this Spirit and defyle this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

eſtate they ſtand in for vvant of ſight and attention, for want of
regarding of the trueth we go to Hell. And if euer thing was to
be deplored in this world, this is to be deplored that the Spirit
of God is abuſed; when he commes to ſanctifie men and wemen
he gets villanie and wrong done to him: they wold pollute him
when he commes to ſanctify them. Indeed he is diſludged of his
ludging. Theſe murtherers takes him by violence, as it were,

a man failes to harlotrie, he ſmores the Spirit. As for exemple,

<hi>Deſpiſe not Prophecying.</hi> The thing he recommends is Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying.
To make the words plaine to you. By Prophecying here
I vnderſtand not the foretelling of things to come (as there was

that fortold either wel or w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that was to fal on the church in the
own time) this prophecying was not ſuch foretelling of things to
come, it is no other thing in this place but the opening vp of the
Scripture: and ſo this word Prophecying is taine in the 1. Cor.
14. chap. throghout all that chap. <hi>But he that Prophecyes,</hi> ſayes he,
<hi>he ſpeakes to men, to edifing, to exhortation and conſolation.</hi> That is,
he applyes the word of God to the preſent vſe for the tyme: So
that if a man needes to be edified, he edifies; to be comforted he
comfortes; to be exhorted, the exhortes. So then to make the
words plaine, <hi>`Deſpiſe not Prophecying:</hi> It is aſmuch as he would
ſay, deſpiſe not the preaching of the word, deſpiſe not this mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie
whoſe calling is to preach this word. Now, brethren ye ſee
heere among all the meanes whereby the Spirit of Chriſt is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteinde
in the hart of a man, the Apoſtle makes a choiſe in this
place of preaching, hearing the word of God ſet downe in the
Scripture opened vp and applyed to the right vſe. Certainelie,
this is to the great commendation of this ſame viſible miniſtrie,
and of this teaching of the word in the preſence of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and people of God. Shall I tell you? There is ſuch a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of the preaching of this word (for as baſe as it ſemes to men)
that if it be not holden vp, farewell the Spirit of Ieſus Chriſt.
If it be not, there ſhall not be in the earth a viſible Church, for
the word preached is the ſlandart that is holden vp on high to
the world, that men and women that would be ſafe may goe in
vnder it and make vp a Church. Take me away this ſlandart,
where ſhall men goe to? who ſhall knowe the Church? So take
me away this outward preaching of the word vnto the which
men ſhould reſort to ſeeke ſaluation, no Church. Will men goe
to experience (I ſhall but touch it) there is but ouer great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:16659:169"/>
in proces of time feele thy hart voyde of all ſenſe and feeling of
God, thou ſhalt loſe thy eyes, thy light and ſight of God, thou
ſhalt loſe the ſight of lyfe and Heauen, if that thou doe it in
contempt and malice, thou ſhalt grow as prophane as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaine

deed after euill deed ſhall fal out in thy hand. Looke to the great
men of this land. What is the cauſe he is ſuch a murtherer? Onely
the contempt of this word preached. What is the cauſe he is ſuch
an adulterer? only the contempt of the word. I cannot tell if there
be any great mens houſes (at leaſt there is verie few) but thou
may ſee the contempt of this word hes heaped judgement on
judgement on them. Ye who wold read of Prophecying which
is the opening vp of the word in the face of the Church of God,
and who would read of the powerfull working of it in the hart
of men. read 1. Cor. chap. 14. verſe 1. <hi>Seeke after ſpirituall things,
but ſpecially after Prophecying.</hi> And in that ſame chapter 24. verſe
by ſuppoſition he lets vs ſee, by compariſon betweene Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying
and ſtrange language, what prophecying works: When a
man is teaching the word, then commes in at the doore an infidle
that hes no vnderſtanding, he layes to his eare and heares, and
he hears himſelf rebuked; incontinent his conſcience wakens and
lets him ſee the filth that is within him. So the poore man hauing
his conſcience wakned, he falles down on his face and ſeeks mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and then he will be mooued to make a confeſſion, and ſay, It
cannot be but this man hes the Spirit of God that maks my ſin ſo
manifeſt to me, it cannot be the ſpirit of man, but it muſt be the
power of God whereby he ſpeakes. I will not inſiſt, Brethren.
I ſhall ſumme vp to you in few words the diuerſitie of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

toward the Spirit and the word, which two things onely
ſaues men. There are ſome that cares neyther for the Spirit nor
the word, ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> dogges; atheiſts, men liuing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God in the world; ſpeake of a Spirit to them they will ſcorne
it; a prophane bodie that hes not the Spirit, the name of a ſpirit
is but a ſcorne vnto him, tell him of ſpirituall lyfe he will laugh
an heedfull laughter. Lykevviſe ſpeake to him of the vvord,
and tell that ſaluation muſt be by the word. the prophaine dog
vvill laugh and ſcorne at it. Theſe are the vvorſt men in the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:16659:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
world. There is another ſort that clames to a Spirit. They will
acknovvledge the Spirite of God, but vvhen it commes to
the vvord of God, they vvil feuere ſo the vvord from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as though the vvord had nothing adoe vvith the Spirit, nor
the Spirit vvith the vvord: And as though all the ſpeaking to
the Church vvere not by the vvord preached but by other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations:
they will binde the Spirit to vaine fantaſies, illuſions
and dreames. Theſe are Anabaptiſts that dependes on theſe
illuſions of the deuill and their owne fantaſies and fooliſh reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
The third ſort wil acknowledg the Spirit, ſo wil they the
word and Scripture, but they think it is eneugh to read the word.
He will ſay, I will ſit at home in my chamber, and I will read,
ſometime of the olde and ſometime of the nevv Teſtament, and
what will the Miniſter tel me in the Pulpet but I will get it here,
and as for the opening vp of this word, he wil ſcorne is. This ſort
of men is verie euill; and they will finde in the end that the word
read and not preached vvill doe them little good. Novv the laſt
and beſt ſort vvho will get grace, are they who reuerences the
Spirit and word, and ſeeke by all means to haue them ludging in
their ſoules, not only reads themſelues if they haue knowledge,
but hes a pleaſure to haue it opened vp to the vſe of the Church,
and their vſe in the congregation. It is theſe men that by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
truely imbraces the word, <hi>for faith is by hearing.</hi> Rom. 10. 17.</p>
               <p>Now I goe forward to the text. In the next verſe is another
exhortation. <hi>Try all things, and keepe that vvhich is good,</hi> reteine it
after try all.<note place="margin">Tryall of doctrine.</note> In theſe wordes the Apoſtle ſettes downe the order
after the which a man or woman ſhall allowe or diſalow of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying,
that is preaching, when they heare it. The allowance
or diſallowance of it muſt be after a certaine order. The order is
this in one word. Try <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and then either allow
or diſallow. There are two ſortes of extremities in hearing of
prophecying. There are ſome that wil allow ere euer they try at
the firſt hand. Theſe are vaine heades. <hi>Peter</hi> calles them <hi>vnſtable
ſoules.</hi> 2. Epiſtle 2 chap. 14. verſ. Theſe are men that hes ſoules e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:16659:170"/>
ſpeake, incontinent will they fay, there was neuer ſuch a man in
the world, this is an extremitie. Another ſort is of them, that
will not heare preaching and giue audience, that there after they
may try: when a man preſents himſelfe to ſpeake in the name of
the Lord, they will not giue him audience; and certainly if there
were no more, but, the reuerence we ought to God, we ought to
heare him that ſpeaks in his name, but then try his doctrine, and
allow, or diſalow thereof, as it agries with the word. Now theſe
are the two extremities. The midſt is betweene them, and this
midſt is to be tain as beſt of al. Heare, and when thou haſt heard,

giues to the members of this Church, he giues this gift alſo, to
judge of that which they heare, to judge betweene true and falſe
doctrine, the doctrine that is lyke ſtubble that may not bide the
fire, and the doctrine that is like gold. The Lord in the Church
hes giuen ſome this diſcretion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and certainly if it were not ſo, the
Church ſhould ſpoue be poyſoned. Some gets this gift to taſte

This precepte is generall, and concernes aſvvell doctrine as
any other thing in the vvorld that can haue the appearance, or
any ſhovve of euill: As for the doctrine vvhen thou haſt heard
it, and haſt tryed it; if after tryall thou be not ſatiſfyed vvith it,
but yet there abydes a doubt in thy hart. Then, vvhat ſhould
thou doe? Abſtaine from it, meddle not vvith it, doe neuer

if thou doubt of the verie leaſt thing that is good, if thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

ſelfe is good if thy conſcience thinke it euill. If thou doe againſt
thy conſcience it is euer euill. Doe neuer againſt conſcience.
What euer is not of faith, it is ſinne; if thou be not perſwaded in
conſcience it is good, if it vvere neuer ſo good, it is ſin to thee.
So if there lyes any ſuſpition in thy hart of the doctrine, that it
is not altogether ſound, abſtaine from it, and meddle not vvith
it. As for other things, any thing in the vvorld that hes appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

what euer thou fight with (ſuppoſe it be euill informed)
for it is ſin. If it ſeeme to thee, to be euill, meddle not with it.
More, if it ſeeme to be euill to others, namely, to thoſe that the
Apoſtle calles vveake ones, albeit thou be perſvvaded of thy
chriſtian liberty; yet, for their ſake that thou make them not doe
contrare their conſcience, abſtaine: abſtaine for their ſake, albeit
not for thy owne ſake, from theſe things may offend their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,

that is, the outward coat that is ſpotted with ſin, touch not once

it wil ſpot thee if thou lay thy finger on it. Then, brethren, take it

how ſinſt thou, when at all thy ſenſes thou drinkſt it in, as it were,
water. The murtherer drinks in bloud, as it were water; the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lote

euill to allow of the appearance of it, how great euill is it to take
the whole bodie of ſin in thy arme and lay it with pleaſure to

men will take this viper of ſin in their hart. A murtherer can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

A blaſphemer can neuer be ſatiat vvith blaſpheming. Ye

this Epiſtle with a prayer to God. I ſhal be ſhort in it. <hi>Novv,</hi> ſaies

may be keept in ſoule and bodie in ſanctification to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded vvith praier.</note> that
is the effect of the words. All his exhortation is to holineſſe and
ſanctification: For, that is the generall he laid downe in the 4.
chap. 3. verſ. <hi>This is the vvill of God, euen, your ſanctification.</hi> Now in
the concluſion, what does he? He prayes. What prayes he? That
the Lord would grant them that ſame thing he was exhorting
them to. He was exhorting them to ſanctification; and he praies
God, to giue them ſanctification. This is the Apoſtles faſhion
in other places, to the Epheſ. 3. chap. 13. verſe, He beſeches them
to ſtand conſtant in the faith of Chriſt <hi>and faint not, for his tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
And then, he ſubjoynes, <hi>For this cauſe I hovv mykrees to the
Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that ye grovv not faint.</hi> So, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortes
them to conſtancie and he prayes God to giue them it.
<hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles neuer exhorted any Church to
ſanctification, to any good thing, as though it had lyen in the
handes of the people and Church to haue done it. But, in the
meane tyme while, he exhortes them, he was perſwadod that it
behoued God to giue them grace to doe it, and that it lay in the
hands of God onely whether they ſhould do it, or not do it. And
therefore when he exhortes them to doe any thing, he addes
praier, I beſeech God to giue you, the grace to do it. The Papiſts
thinks it lyes in the hands of a mans ſelfe to doe godd; they euer

               <p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:16659:172"/>
Now to the wordes. Whom to prayes he? To the God of
peace. <hi>The God of peace,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>ſanctifie your ſoules.</hi> Read all the
Canonicall ſcriptures, ye ſhall neuer finde that any of the ould
fathers directed their prayers to any Saints; either to <hi>Abraham,
Iſaac,</hi> or <hi>Iacob,</hi> or to any other holy men or Angels. But, this, by
the way. In all the praiers of the ould fathers, and all the Pſalmes,
there is neuer a prayer, but to God onely. Now how ſtyles he
him? He calles him <hi>the God of peace.</hi> The God who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and giuer of all peace.<note place="margin">Peace.</note> What peace is this? Euen the peace
that he calles, <hi>The peace of God, that paſſes all vnderſtanding, that

verſe. No other thing, but that ſame peace of the conſcience,
when we are ſurely perſwaded, that, all our ſinnes are freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vnto vs, in the bloud of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt and that through him we

grace is peace. Iuſtification ends in peace: our calling and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination
from all eternitie ends in this peace of conſcience in
the ſoule; regeneration ends in this peace. Now, looke, how this
ſtyle agrees with the matter, he is praying for ſanctification,
and he ſtyles him the God of peace, who is the Author of all
peace;<note place="margin">Both the means &amp; the end ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who is the giuer of our felicity, is he that giues vs all the meanes

in thy ſelfe. The beginning of grace is of God, the meanes is of
God, the end is of God, nothing in our ſelues, all in God.</p>
               <p>To goe forward to the petition. There are two thinges he

The next is conſeruing and keeping in that ſame ſanctification
and holineſſe. Firſt, he prayes, that, they may be ſanctified. Next,
he prayes, that, they may be keept, vntill Chriſt come againe.

but a new ſhaping ouer of them againe, as ye will ſhaip a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Apoſtles takes that ſimilitude. Brethren, we were
all well eneugh ſhapen in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> ere they fell, and we
had an exceeding good ſhape; but ſince they fell we become
all wanſhapen creatures and monſters. When thou ſeeſt an
vnregenerate creature, a murtherer rejoycing in murther, then
ſay, thou art a curſt monſter of a man. So, in <hi>Adams</hi> fall vve
became monſters of nature. Thou ſaw neuer ſuch a monſter
as an vnregenerate man. Now, we being monſters through <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
fall, in Chriſt we begin to take on vs a new ſhape, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the glorious Image of God. So our ſanctification is
onely as a renewing of vs againe, according to the firſt ſhape
of the Creator, in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. Novv vvhat is
it muſt be ſhapen ouer againe? What parte of vs is it that is
wanſhapen? The Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>The God of peace ſanctifie you
throughout.</hi> The whole man, through that foull apoſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
is become a monſter. Not a finger in thy hand, but it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a monſter. The eye a monſter, or, elſe, ſuch a foull looke
would not be. The tongue a monſter, or, elſe, ſuch foull language
would not be. The ear a monſter, or, elſe, we would not deſyre to
heare foull and euill ſpeaches. No part of thee, but, all are mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous,
except thou be renewed: And therefore, he prayes, that,
they may be renewed and made ouer againe throgh Chriſt, euen
in the whole parts of the body and ſoule. Therefore pray thou
and ſay, Lord renew, not this part, or, that part onely, but, renew
me wholly. The Lord renew the mynde and begin there; The
Lord renew the body, the Lord renew the eye, the ear, the hand.
The Lord renew all ouer againe. For, I tell thee, if therebe any
part of thee vnrenewed, thou ſhalt al go to Hel, for that vnruely
part. The Lord vſes not to renew one part &amp; not another, but, he
renews altogether. This ſhortly for the firſt part of the petition.</p>
               <p>Now in the next part he beſeches the Lord of peace to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
them throughout, and that their <hi>vvhole spirit, ſoule and body
may be keeped vvithout ſpot or blame, to the comming of our Lord
Ieſus Christ.</hi> He prayes, that they may be keeped in holineſſe
So, it is not eneugh, to get one grace, to get ſanctification and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
but, thou muſt be keeped ſtill on, in that grace, vntill thou
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:16659:173"/>
come to glorie. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> again, as grace is of God (al grace is of God)
So, the perſeuerance in grace to the end is of God. Thou haſt
no more in thy power when thou haſt gotten grace, to ſtand one
moment in grace, if God hold not his hand about thee, nor thou
had to tak that grace before thou got it. Thou haſt no power in
nature to ſtand in grace. So, perſeuerance in grace is of God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
aſwell as the grace is in Gods hand to giue. And as we muſt
pray for the grace, before we get it, and ſay, Lord ſanctifie vs; ſo,
we muſt pray for the continuance of it, and ſay, Lord, continue
vs in it, if thou Lord hold it not into my armes I will not get it
keeped. Therefore, Lord, keepe thou it.</p>
               <p>Now, to go forward. What ſhold be keeped blameles without
ſpot?<note place="margin">All the partes of man to be keeped blameles.</note> One part, or, peece, or, the whol man; ſhould I pray to God,
to keepe my ſoule onely in holines and not my bodie? my body
onely and not my ſoule? Wilt thou part them? or thinkeſt thou,
that, God wil keep one part of thee in holines and not the whol?
When men goes to Idolatrie, they will pray to keepe their hart
holie; When they will bow their bodie to <hi>Baall,</hi> they will ſay, my
hart is to God. No, if he keepe not all, if thou dedicate not all to
him, all ſhall goe to Hell. So, the Apoſtle ſayes, I pray the God
of peace, <hi>that, he vvould keepe blameleſſe your ſpirit, your ſoule and
bodie.</hi> In theſe three thinges he takes vp the whole man, within
and without. I will onely ſpeake this far. By the Spirit he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
the cleanneſt part of the ſoule. Epheſ. 4. chap. 23. verſ.
He calles it <hi>the Spirit of the mynde,</hi> that is, the light of the mynde,
which is reaſon. The reaſon is not common with the beaſts, but,
it is common with the Angels. So, it is the ſpeciall part of a man,
and thou may thanke God, that hes it, and thou ſhould pray to
the Lord, to keepe it. The next is the ſoule, whereby he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
the inferior part, wherein are the ſenſes, that part of the
ſoule that hears, ſees, &amp;c. Then, he ſaies, the bodie. So, ye ſee, God
muſt keep all in holines; and he that would be keeped of God,
muſt ſeeke to be keeped whole, and euery part of him, without
exception: For, I tell thee, no part of thee is able to keepe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The olde Philoſophers made a Queene of reaſon, as thogh
ſhe ſhould keepe all, and ſhould keepe the ſoule and body in
her light. It is ſolie, who can keepe her? God muſt keepe the
Spirit, that is, the reaſon, aſwell as the bodie: and the Spirite hes
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:16659:174"/>
as great need to be keept as the foote; for, ſinne will begin at the
reaſon, it is the firſt breaker of: ſo craue that he keepe all, or he
ſhall keepe none. Alas, what is man, without grace? What hes
he to boaſt of? Thou wilt boaſt of thy will and reaſon. If the
Lord withdraw his hand from thy reaſon thou ſhalt be a plaine
idiot, thou ſhalt fall to filthie wickedneſſe. So, brethren, theſe
wordes are of great weight. He ſayes not that he prayed that he
would keepe the Spirit, but the whole ſpirit; the ſoule, but the
whole ſoule; the bodie, but the whole bodie. So we muſt not be
keeped in the ſpeciall parts, but in the whole properties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
powers of the ſoule and body; if the leaſt haire of the head
be not keeped by the Lord, if the Lords prouidence extend not
to the keeping of the ſmalleſt part of the bodie, thou ſhalt not
be able to ſtand. Thinke not thou ſhalt ſtand, except the Lord
hold thee vp, no growing but in God. Therefore the Apoſtle
ſayes, <hi>Thou that vvouldſt glorie, glorie in Chriſt.</hi> 1. Corinth. 1. chap.

               <p>Now, how long ſhould we be keeped blameleſſe? He limits
the tyme, and ſayes, <hi>Vnto the comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue in hand preſently (welbeloued in
Ieſus) the concluſion vvhich is the laſt
parte of this Epiſtle. He begins it with
a prayer, crauing in his prayer euen that
ſame thing hee had exhorted them to,
to vvitte, holineſſe, ſanctification, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
and perſeuerance in holineſſe
and ſanctification to the end, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
God to bee the giuer of that ſame very thing
which he exhorted them to, and that it lay not in their hands
nor free will to will or doe any good, but all ſtands in the hands
of God, who is the giuer of all grace. He prayes, that, it would
pleaſe God to giue them that grace he exhorted them to, and he
would ſtir them vp to ſeek that ſame grace at the hands of God;
for it is vanity to ſtryue to any grace without God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as thou would do any thing, pray to God to giue thee grace
to doe it. Let thy eye be euer on God, and in the midſt of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
when thou thinkſt thou art beſt exerciſed, craue grace of
perſeuerance: for, I aſſure thee, he leaue thee in the beſt of thy
action, thou wilt fall backward. Therefore there is ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
that the eye be euer on God, that it is impoſſible to a man
to do any thing that is good, except his eye be euer on him, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
grace and perſeuerance in grace at his hands.</p>
               <p>Now he goes forward: and in the thinges that followes to the
end of the chapter and Epiſtle, there is ſuch a varietie that euery
thing here ſet downe is a ſeuerall heed of doctrine. Firſt, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
to them that ſame thing he had prayed for at God. Then
he maks a petition to them, deſiring them to pray for him. Then
to commend him to the brethren. Then he adjures them that
they read this Epiſtle to all the people. And laſt he bids them
fairewell, recommending them to the grace of Chriſt. Ye ſee
what varitie of thing she hes. I minde to be ſhort in them, ſeeing
they are almoſt things common in euery Epiſtle, making a choiſe
of that I thinke beſt for our comfort and neceſſity. Now he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
at the promiſe, <hi>Faithfull is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e vvhich calleth you, vvhich alſo
vvill doe it.</hi> There is the promiſe. The Apoſtle would ſay, that
that I pray God, that he will grant you; to wit; he will preſerue
you in the end in faith, that I am aſſured he will doe; He will not
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:16659:175"/>
leaue you, vnto the tyme he perfite his worke begunne in you.
There is the promiſe. Ye ſee firſt in this promiſe, the prayes that
he made immediatly before for them, praying to God, that he
would preſerue them in holineſſe to the end, is grounded vpon
an aſſurance in the hart, that God would grant that ſame thing
which he prayed for to the Theſſalonians. Marke it. And firſt,
learne, concerning prayer: All prayer for thinges heauenly and
ſpirituall concerning the life to come (I ſpeak not of the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thinges,<note place="margin">Confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in prayer.</note> but thinges heauenly and ſpirituall) ſhould ariſe on
ſome certainty and aſſurance of the hart, that God will grant to
vs the things we aske. Therefore <hi>Iames</hi> in his Epiſtle laſt chap.
15. verſe. he calles prayer, <hi>the prayer of faith,</hi> that is, that ryſes of
faith and aſſurance in the hart, that God will grant vs the thing
we aske. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, laſt chap. 14. verſe, he joynes
theſe two together, confidence or aſſurance, and prayer, and he
ſayes. <hi>This is that confidence vve haue in the Lord, that, if vve aſke
any thing according to his vvill, he vvill heare vs:</hi> There is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in prayer, that, when we pray, we ſhould haue that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that God will giue vs theſe things we ſeeke, not according
to our will, but according to his owne will. It is his will that we
ſhould haue theſe heauenly things, through the bloud of Chriſt.
And therefore our prayer for them ſhould riſe on confidence,
that God will grant them for Chriſts ſake.</p>
               <p>Yet farther, I ſee in this place three thinges joyned together.
Firſt, he exhorts them to a continuance in an holy lyfe to the
end. Secondly, he prayes for the ſame continuance in holineſſe,
that God would preſerue them to the comming of the Lord
Ieſus.<note place="margin">Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, praier and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned.</note> Thirdly, there is a ſure promiſe made to them of that ſame
thing he prayed for, that God would perfite his worke in them,
and neuer leaue his worke, vntill he crowne it, and theſe three,
continuance in holineſſe, prayer for it, and promiſe thereof, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be well ſeuered. It auailes not to ſtand vp and exhort to any
good thing, except the exhorter pray to God, that it would
pleaſe him to grant them that grace he hes exhorted them to:
the man that cannot pray for that grace he hes exhorted them to,
he is not meete to exhort. Then againe, prayer without promiſe
auailes little. A man who hes not aſſurance in his hart, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
grace from the hands of God vnto any people or perſon.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:16659:176"/>
is not meete to pray for any people or perſon. He to whom the
Lord hes not giuen that grace in hart to promiſe with aſſurance,
he is not meete to pray, for pithie prayer muſt ryſe on ſome
confidence in the hart. To be ſhort. In a Paſtor theſe three muſt
goe together. He muſt be a man that is meete to exhort, that hes
a grace to pray, and an acceſſe to God; and laſt he muſt haue an
aſſurance in his hart of that grace of God, ſo, that he dar be bold
to promiſe to them that grace he exhortes them to, and craues at
God. And that which I ſpeake of a Paſtor, I ſpeake of all men.
For all ſhould be exhorters, and euery one teachers of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and ſo euery one ſhould ſee if they haue theſe graces to
exhort, to ſtir them vp to godlineſſe, to pray for them, and to
promiſe to them grace with aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Now to goe forward. He ſets not downe his promiſe ſimply,
and barely, the Lord will doe it, but he layes downe the ground
and foundation where-vpon he builds his promiſe, vvhich <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
their effectuall and inward calling. <hi>He is faithfull that he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> called
you.</hi> So, the ground of this promiſe is their inward and effectuall
calling. By this calling, I vnderſtand no other thing, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
declaration of the eternall will of God in the hart of any
man concerning his ſaluation;<note place="margin">2. ſorts of calling.</note> To ſpeake the trueth, this calling
of a man by the word, is nothing but a reuealing inwardly in his
hart, that election and choiſing of God that was from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
He calles him when he reueales that eternall election to him,
and aſſures him that he hes choſen him before al eternity. There
is another calling when the word ſoundes in the care, without
perſwaſion of the calling in the hart. This is an outward calling.
Many are called this way, but few gets this inward calling in
their hart to ſaluation. Then this is the meaning of the Apoſtle,
as if he had ſaid to them, if ye be called (Theſſalonians) if ye find
the Lord to declare inwardly to your hart his eternall will in
your election, I dare be bolde to promiſe, that, that God who hes
made that declaration in your hart, ſhall neuer leaue you, vntill
he perſite his worke, and put you in Heauen. This ground
ſtandes ſure, that God ſhall neuer leaue you who hes gotten the
aſſurance of election, vntill he crowne his worke in you. There
are the wordes ſhortly. Then, marke, brethren; The promiſe
that one can make to another, that, God will not leaue them to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:16659:176"/>
the end, it muſt not be ſpoken abſolutely, but it muſt be conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall.
The condition is, of thy effectuall calling. This condition
holding ſure, that thou art effectually and inwardly called to
life, ſurely the promiſe may be made to thee, with aſſurance, God
wil neuer leaue thee to the end: And I or any man vpon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
may boldly make you this ſame promiſe, that <hi>Paul</hi> made
to the Theſſalonians, and I may ſay to you (this ground hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that ye are called inwardly, and that ye haue receiued an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
declaration, as it were, out of the mouth of God of your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
in Chriſt) I may promiſe you, that, God ſhall neuer leaue
you vntill he crown his worke. Then, if it be ſo, who euer would
haue comfort of the promiſe of God made in Chriſt, when lyfe
is promiſed, perſeuerance is promiſed, the crowne of glorie is
promiſed, who wold haue comfort in theſe promiſes, let him go
to the ground, looke if thou findſt in thy hart thy inward calling,
looke, if God by his Spirit inwardly aſſures thee that thou ſhalt
haue lyfes, if thou findſt it, aſſure thee the promiſe perteines to
thee; but if thou finde it not ſpoken inwardly by God to thee,
thou haſt no warrand, that the promiſe of grace perteins to thee,
thinke neuer thou wilt be crowned, and that he ſhall perfite his
worke in thee, ſeeing he neuer began to worke in thee. God will
neuer perfite the worke he neuer began. Therefore euerie one
of vs ſhould take heed when we read or heare the promiſes of
God in the Scripture, if we haue this ground or not; if I finde I
haue the ground, I may fullie aſſure me, there is no promiſe
but it is made to me; but if I ſee not the ground, no promiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines
to me. Then, on this, marke further Gods faſhion of doing.
This is his maner of doing:<note place="margin">Gods cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gable.</note> Firſt, he calles, that is to ſay, he lettes
men and women vnderſtand by faith inwardly, that he and ſhe
is one whom he hes taine purpoſe from all eternitie to ſaue.
There is the beginning. Then he goes forward and neuer leaues
them vntill he perſite his worke in them. No, if he beginne once
with them, and giue them aſſurance that they are inwardly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the gates of Hel will neuer preuaile againſt them, albeit they
be in Hell at that ſame tyme of their calling they ſhall end in
Heauen; he will draw them through Hell to Heauen, through
death to lyfe, all the world ſhall not alter his purpoſe. If he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
once he will end. Therefore, to the Philipp. 1. chap. 6. verſe,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:16659:177"/>
he ſayes, <hi>I am perſvvaded, that, he that hes begunne the good vvorke
in you, he vvill perfite it to the comming of the Lord Ieſus Christ:</hi> I
am perſwaded, there is neuer one, with whom he beginnes the
worke of their effectuall calling, but, of neceſſity he muſt perfite
it. A man will beginne a worke and draw his hand from it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and let it ſtand; but, God is not lyke man, he neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
the worke, but he will perfite it. And therefore, I ſay,
who euer they be that would end with him, and haue an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that God ſhall be with them in their end, and ſhall crowne
them with a crowne of glorie, they ſhould take heed vvhether
God hes begun with them or not. If I finde his hand begin to
worke with me, I will perſwade my ſelfe in ſpite of al the world
he ſhal perfite it; but if we find not God begin with vs, he ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
crown the work: Al ſtands in the beginning, al the grace we
get in this lyfe, ſuch as holineſſe, ſanctification, is nothing in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
but the beginning of grace. So that the thing we haue to do
in this life, if we ſhould liue a thouſand yeeres, is to enter in count
whether the Lord hes begun this worke or not. If I finde he hes
begun this worke in me, then in my death and letter houre I will
aſſure my ſelfe, the Lord wil end his worke with me, I will make
a ſweete end, and he will crowne me with glory.</p>
               <p>Yet, farther, he ſayes, <hi>Faithfull</hi> is he, <hi>vvhich calleth you, vvhich
alſo vvill doe it.</hi> He grounds againe this promiſe of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Gods grace,<note place="margin">Heigheſt ground of faith, the conſtant nature of God.</note> which is vnder this condition of effectuall
calling on an higher ground. If thou wold haue a ſute faith, thou
muſt haue many grounds, faith is not builded on the ſand, it muſt
haue ſure groundes: He grounds this ground of their effectuall
calling on an higher and ſurer ground, that all the world wil not
be able to ſhake, it is vpon the vnchangeable and vnalterable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, the conſtant nature of God, not fleeting and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as mans nature is. God is not like man. The word he ſpeakes,
it ſtandes, it neuer alters. The purpoſe he takes is vnalterable. To
the Heb 6. chap. 18 verſ. <hi>It is impoſſible, that, God ſhould lye.</hi> 2. Tim.
2. chap. 13. verſ. <hi>He cannot deny himſelfe, he abydes faithfull</hi> and ſure.
Then, brethren, if he hes ſaid to the hart inwardly, It is my will
from all eternity, that thou be one of theſe that ſhall be ſafe. Hes
he ſpoken it? that word ſhall neuer be altered, Heau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n and earth
ſhall all go to, ere there be one word of that altered, God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:16659:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the word he hes ſpoken cannot be altered: Therefore if he
hes called thee, giuen thee a ſight of thy election, it will neuer
alter. <hi>Paul</hi> knew this well, and therefore he aſſures them, that
he would perfite the worke begunne in them: on this condition,
that he hes called them inwardlie; this aſſurance ſhould be in the
hart of the Preacher, thou ſhould haue thy hart eſtabliſhed on
theſe ſame groundes, thou ſhould knowe the vnchangeable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, that he cannot alter: for, if thou knoweſt not, that he
cannot alter, thou haſt no certainty of faith. So, the ground of
faith is, the vnchangeableneſſe of God. it neuer reſtes vntill it
pearce into that infinite deepneſſe in God. To ſpeake it ſo, It is
not the word of God that is ſpoken that is the cheefe ground
of faith: for faith goes in through the word, and grippes in to
that vnchangeable Majeſtie. Then the cheefe ground of faith, is
the vnchangeable nature of God, and it neuer gets reſt, vntill it
get that vnchangeable God. And then when it hes gotten him,
it reſtes on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> reſtes then on his word, and obeyes his word;
if he then ſpeake to me, I will heare him and obey him. Then
God ſhould be painted out in his nature, ſo far as man can: But
who can doe it? He ſhould be knowne to be a mercifull, true
and juſt God, and none can haue faith but he muſt knowe theſe.
Alas, thou that wilt be content with the ſcrufe of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of God, and will not ſeeke in to the deepneſſe of God, and
take him vp in his properties, and pearee in to his nature and
reſt on him, thou ſhalt neuer get a ſetled faith. Therefore ſeeke
ay knowledge, and preaſe in to him, that thou may ſtand in ſome
ſetledneſſe.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the reſt of the text. When he hes exhorted
them, prayed for them, made promiſe to them: What then does
he? He commes downe and ſayes, <hi>Brethren pray for me.</hi> He

for them, promiſing to them as a ſuperiour far aboue them,
and ere ye looke about you he commes downe, and ſits downe
on the earth and his courſe about lookes vp to them and biddes
them pray for him: What learne we of this? There is none ſo
high mounted that hes ſo excellent graces in the Church of
God, if it were the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, but he ſhould hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
himſelfe, as it vvere, vnder the moſt humble and lovvlie
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:16659:178"/>
in the Church, and as hee hes prayed for them, ſo hee ſhould
pray them to pray for him againe. Pray for me as I haue prayed
for you; as I haue exhorted you, exhort ye me; as ye haue neede
to be prayed for by me, ſo haue I need to be prayed for by you.
So, nothing I can doe to you, but I haue neede of it my ſelfe. Ye

againe (brethren) the neceſſity of prayer.<note place="margin">Neceſſity of prayer.</note> The Lord grant this
that we could once knowe it well. There is no grace nor perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance

Yet to inſiſt. This ſalutation is to all the brethren, none excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
To ſpeake it in one word: Such familiar ſalutations as theſe,
ſalute them with a kiſſe and an holy kiſſe, they are not compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
betweene all ſorts of men; I perceyue not that the Apoſtle
ſalutes this way any of the Gentiles and Heathen; it is true we are
bound to wiſh well to all, to the prophaineſt in the world, yea to
the enemies of Chriſt, and I will ſay, the Lord turne euery enemy
of Chriſt to him: but certainely, when it commes to ſuch ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as theſe that <hi>Paul</hi> vſes, as to ſay, ſalute with an holy kiſſe,
they are proper onely to the domeſticks of faith, and therefore
he ſayes, ſalute all the brethren, not all that ye meete with, but
all the brethren. Loue pertaines to all, but there as a ſpeciall loue
that pertaines to the members of the bodie, as to brethren and
ſiſters, there are ſpecial ſalutations that ſpecially pertaines to the
members in the bodie, and therefore diſcretion muſt be had; all
ſalutations muſt not be had to al alike we ſhould haue a regarde
of the condition of the perſon whom we ſalute. There may be
a fault aſwell in this vndiſcreete doing, as when we leaue it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done;
giue euery one their owne duety. Thou art addebted to a
brother in a ſpeciall kindneſſe and ſalutation, and is not addeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

who are rulers in the Church, teachers of the common ſort, are
bound vnder the paine of the wraith of the Lord Ieſus to light

rulers of the Theſſalonians are charged to read this Epiſtle to all

letting the people of God remaine in ignorance without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Now to the laſt wordes. <hi>The grace of our Lord Ieſus be vvith
you,</hi> and he ſeales it vp with this word <hi>Amen.</hi> When he entered in
with them in the beginning of the Epiſtle, what was his ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Nothing but a recommendation of them to the grace of
Chriſt: at his firſt meeting with them he prayes that they ſhould
receiue the grace of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Grace vvithout merite vviſhes both in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ending.</note> When he bids them fare-well he
bids the ſame grace of God be with them; he wiſhes grace in the
beginning and grace in the end. Learne this, If the Apoſtle had
thoght that there had bene a greater thing in the world nor the
grace of Chriſt, he had wiſhed it either at the beginning or at
the ending; but knowing well the beſt thing he could wiſhe to
the people is Chriſts grace, as he began with it, ſo he ends with
it. And alas, what can we wiſhe more, for vnder the grace of
Chriſt all the graces and bleſſinges we can haue heere, and in
the life to come are comprehended: If one would ſet himſelfe
to wiſh the beſt thing in the world to another, what can he wiſh
better nor the grace of Chriſt? for all is in it. Now it is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
what is the grace of Chriſt. No other thing but the free
fauour of God in Ieſus Chriſt; I call it free, becauſe it is without
deſert or merite on our part, a fauour that commes not on our
deſeruing; for we merite nothing but Hell. Then, brethren, what
is this he hes bene ſpeaking to theſe Theſſalonians? Certainly,
I read not in all <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles of ſo high a praiſe of Faith, Loue
and Charitie of any Church, as he hes of this Church of Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica;
and yet for all this in the end he ſayes not, I beſeech God
that he conſider your merite, for ye haue deſerued well, and he
is much obliſt to your deſeruing (as that preſumptuous villaine
the Pope will ſay) Lord reward you according to your deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
No, he ends not ſo, but he ſayes, Indeede Theſſalonians ye
haue done well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet I commit you to the free mercy of God.
The thing I wiſh to you is not for your deſeruing, but againſt
your deſeruing. I wiſh to you the free grace of Chriſt, according
to Chriſts ſaying in <hi>Luke 17.</hi> chap. 10. verſ. <hi>When thou haſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> done all
that thou can doe, ſay, I am but an vnprofitable ſervant,</hi> I deſerue not
ſo much as a faire looke of Chriſt. Hell ſhall ouertake thee for
all thy doing, except mercy come betweene thee and thy God.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:16659:181"/>
Then onely mercie without deſeruing is our ſaluation. In the 2.
Tim chap. 1. verſe 16. he names one <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> and he reckons
out great kindneſſe that he had done to him (and that which
was done to <hi>Paul</hi> was done to his Maſter) he ſaies, <hi>he hes refreſhed
me,</hi> when I haue beene exceeding wearie, <hi>be thought no ſhame of
my fetters and bonds, and hearing tell I vvas at Rome he ſought me
out very diligently.</hi> Yet for all this, he ſayes not, <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
well at Gods hand, and I pray that the Lord would rewarde
him according to his demerites. No, but he ſayes, <hi>The Lord ſhovv
mercy on Oneſiphorus.</hi> And he doubles it ouer againe, and he ſaies,
God grant as I haue found mercy at <hi>Oneſiphorus, ſo he may finde
mercy at the Lords hands in that day.</hi> He ſayes mercie, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
but free mercie: and ſo I end. Nothing but mercy and free
grace; when we haue done all we can, nothing but mercy, mercy
in earth, mercy in heauen. On paine of lyfe when thou haſt done
all the good thou may doe, beware thou think of any deſeruing
at the hands of God But caſt thy ſelfe on thy knees, and hold vp
thy hands, and cry for fre mercy and pardon of thy ſinnes, and
ſay, away with all my workes, they are but dung and filth; I
craue pardon for my ſinnes of thy free mercy in that bloude of
Ieſus Chriſt: Except thou craue this, thou ſhalt neuer haue
ſolide joy in thy hart. And ſhall I ſay that one of theſe
falſe quenchers of the Spirit felt euer this ſweetnes
in Chriſt, which onely ryſes of the aſſurance
of the free mercy of God. Therefore let
our onely repoſing be vpon this free
fauour in Chriſt. To whom with

to haue beene written ſoone after the firſt. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

perſecuted and heauily troubled for the faith of Chriſt;
and lykewiſe there entered in amongſt them falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and deceiuers who went about to perſwade them that
the comming of Chriſt was inſtantly at hand, taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
as it appeares, by the Theſſalonians miſtaking of
certaine ſpeeches vttered by the Apoſtle in the firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
eſpecially theſe wordes in the fourth chapter, <hi>We
vvhich liue and are remaining in the comming of the Lord ſhall be

that Chriſt ſhould come before they died, and they
ſhould be on lyfe at his comming. The deuill to confirme
them in this errour raiſes vp theſe deceiuers who went

partly to admoniſh them that they giue not eare to theſe
falſe deceiuers, aſſuring them that before Chriſt come
the Antichriſt ſhould come, and there ſhould be an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
defection from the trueth. The Epiſtle may fitlie
be diuyded in ſix parts. The firſt part is the ſalutation in
the two firſt verſes in the firſt chapter. The ſecond is the
Preface, wherein he rejoyceth for their perſeuerance and
increaſe of Faith, of Loue and Patience in all their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
and tribulations, from the third verſe to the fift.
In the third part he comfortes them againſt the troubles
and perſecutions that they ſuſtained for the faith of Chriſt
from the fift verſe to the end of the firſt chapter. In the
fourth part he admoniſhes them that they giue not eare
to theſe falſe teachers that ſaid Chriſts comming was at
hand, ſhowing them that before the ſecond comming of
Chriſt the Antichriſt ſhould be reueiled, and there ſhould
be an vniuerſall defection from the faith of Chriſt Yet he
comfortes them againſt the feare of defection, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortes

gaue the grace, the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi>
to the Theſſalonians, I thought it meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
to goe forward in the ſecond Epiſtle:
for otherwayes the worke would ſeeme
not to be perfyted, and the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
in the ſecond Epiſtle, is very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to be inſiſted vpon And it appeares
very well among all the Epiſtles that <hi>Paul</hi> vvrote, that, theſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16659:184"/>
two directed to the Theſſalonians were the firſt: This ſecond
Epiſtle which we preſently haue in hand appearantly hes beene
written ſoone after the firſt. The occaſion of the wryting of it
appeares well of the purpoſe and argument it ſelfe. The Apoſtle
in this Epiſtle comfortes the Church of the Theſſalonians,
vvhich vvas perſecuted and heauily troubled for the faith of
Chriſt. Another occaſion we take vp in the ſecond chapter:
There entered in this Church (for the deuill can neuer be idle)
falſe teachers and deceiuers, who went about to perſwade the
Theſſalonians, that the comming of Chriſt was inſtantlie at
hand. The Apoſtle therefore taking occaſion hereof, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
them not to giue eare to theſe men; and he telles them that
before Chriſt come the Antichriſt ſhould come, and that there
ſhould be an vniuerſall defection in the world. I take theſe to
be the two occaſions of his wryting.</p>
               <p>There are three chapters of this Epiſtle. In the firſt after he hes
ſaluated them, and giuen thanks to God for them, he enters in to
comfort them againſt all the troubles they were in for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
In the ſecond chapter he admoniſhes them not to giue eare
to theſe falſe teachers, that ſaid that Chriſtes comming was at
hand. And therefore he prophecyes of the comming of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
and of the vniuerſall defection of men in the world
And in the third and laſt chapter he enters in (as his maner is) to
exhortations, and Chriſtian admonitions to the end of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle.
Now to come to the firſt chapter, firſt he ſalutes them,
next he commes to a congratulation for the graces of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by them, laſt he commes to the conſolation.</p>
               <p>As to the ſalutation, it is the common forme he vſes in all his
Epiſtles, and there is not one word altered from the ſalutation
he vſed in the firſt Epiſtle. And therefore becauſe I handled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
word in the firſt Epiſtle, I mynde not to inſiſt in it here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,

God at Theſſalonica: That Church, he ſayes, that is in God the

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16659:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wiſhes to the Church are theſe common graces he vſes in all
his Epiſtles. The grace of God, the peace of God, that is from the
Father, and from the Lord Ieſus his Sonne. Now onely this far:
by the example of the Apoſtle we learne of the ſalutation that
he permits before his Epiſtle. When we enter in to ſpeake of any
Church, to wryte to any people concerning faith, concerning
Ieſus Chriſt, to make a declaration in the entreſſe of that loue,
that beneuolence, that hartlineſſe, that we beare to that people,
to the end that they may be prepared againe to heare with alike
loue, beneuolence and hartlineſſe, and ſo the Paſtor vttering his
lyking to the people, and the people againe their lyking of the
Paſtour: the Paſtour may haue courage and libertie to goe
forward in doctrine: the people may giue audience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the better inſtruction. There is the end of all the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Now I goe forward to the thankſ-giuing, and I will ſpeake
ſomething of it as God will giue me the grace. <hi>We ſhould thanke
God alvvaies for you:</hi> He ſayes not we thanke God ſimply, but
<hi>vve ſhould thanke,</hi> we are addebted, bound and obliſt of duetie
to thanke him Then the leſſon is cleare. Thankſ-giuing to God
is a debt that we are bound and obliſt to pay to God;<note place="margin">Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

giue him not thankes for nothing: Ye will not beare the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſay, we thanke him ſimply, but ye will finde a matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he thanks him, euen for his graces and his benefites. There
are two ſortes of his benefites and graces, there are ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on our ſelues, ſome on others. As for them that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on our ſelues, out of queſtion, there is none but he vvill
confeſſe he is debt-bound to thanke God for them, at leſt he
muſt confeſſe this in word, thinke as he will. As for the benefites
beſtowed on others, we are bound likewayes to thanke God for
them. As concerning the Paſtor that hes adoe with any people,
if euer man was bound to thanke God for any benefite, he is
bound to thanke him for the benefite ſhowen on the people he
hes adoe with; becauſe their bleſſing is the frute of his labours
and trauels: and therefore he is bound to be thankfull for it. I
ſay more. There is no member in the Church of Chriſt but he
hes cauſe to thanke God for euerie bleſſing he beſtowes on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
I am bound to thanke God for the bleſſing he beſtowes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16659:185"/>
on thee, thou art bound to thank God for the bleſſing he ſhowes
on me. And euery one ſhould thanke God for others bleſſinges.
All is for the well of the bodie, the grace I get is for the well
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the bodie. The grace thou getteſt is for the well of the bodie.
We are al members of the body, and therfore we are al bound to
thank God for the benefites beſtowed on the bodie: I ſhall giue
you a familiar ſimilitude. Should not the hand of a man thanke
the man that hes cured the foote, if the foote hes bene ſore. The
eie likewiſe in a maner wil it not be thankfull to him that hes cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the hand; and ſo of all the reſt of the members. Now would
to God we were as ſenſible members of the ſpirituall bodie of
Chriſt, as the members of the naturall bodie of man are ſenſible
among themſelues, and could vnderſtand that euerie one is a
member of that bodie. But let our ſenſe be as it will, if thou be
a member of the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt, thou art as much bound
to be thankfull to God for any benefite beſtowed on another, as
the hand is bound to be thankfull for the graces beſtowed on
the foote; otherwayes thou ſhalt be challenged at that day of
judgement for vnthankfulneſſe. <hi>Paul</hi> 12. chap. to the Romans
15. verſ. ſayes, <hi>Reioyce vvith him that reioyces, and mourne vvith
him that mournes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to go forward. We ſhould thanke God <hi>

                     </gap>lvvaies.</hi> Then
(brethren) thankſ-giuing is an euerlaſting debt, a continuall debt
we ought to God, there is no end of it, there is no intermiſſion or
leauing of it day nor night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of charitie to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
chap. 13. verſ. 8. <hi>Ovve nothing to any man, but loue euery one
another.</hi> Charitie is a debt that ſhould neuer be payed out at the
ground, but ay continuing in paying. Euen ſo thankſ-giuing to
God is a debt we ſhould euer be paying but neuer put an end to
paying of it, for it can haue no end: in earth euer thanking: in
Heauen when we are with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im euer thanking, and our glory ſhal
be in an euerlaſting thanking of him: for why, if he could leaue
off to ſhow grace and could draw his hand fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, as men does,
then we had cauſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from thanking. But the graces of God
in Chriſt are endleſſe grace for grace. And therefore ſeeing his
grace hes neuer an end, why ſhould thou make an end of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him: when his hand is opened liberally to thee, why ſhould
thou cloſe thy mouth, and not render thanks to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:16659:185"/>
Yet further. <hi>We thank him alvvayes for you,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>as it is
meete.</hi> Marke the words, <hi>as it is meete,</hi> as it is worthie. The word
ſounds ſo in the proper language, as if he had ſaid. He is worthy
of all thanks, and therefore we ſhould thanke him. There is a
worthineſſe in God for the bleſſinges he beſtovves on vs, there
is a deſeruing in him, there is a merite in him; it is be onely that
deſerues and merites. There are two thinges, debt and merite,
(I but touch them) euerie one reſpectes other, where there is a
debt, there is a merite; and where there is a merite there muſt
be a debt.<note place="margin">God onely merits &amp; man is debtor.</note> Theſe two wordes anſweres to other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is
no merite vnder the Sunne but Gods merite when God hes to
doe with man. As for vs there is nothing but debt, no deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in vs, all that we can doe to our God is meere debt; as euer
a man was addebted to another. All the thankſ-giuing vve can
giue him is debt, all vvorkes vve can worke are debt, what euer
he gettes of vs, he merites and deſerues it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is the trueth, and
yet the enemies of the trueth will turne this euer againe, and will
aſcryue the merite to ſtinking fleſhe, and the debt to God. The
debt that appertaines to vs they aſcryue to God; and the merite
that appeartaines to God they aſcryue to vs. They ſette vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
God: for he who merites is aboue the debtor: Lord
what a change is this? <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romans chap. 11. verſe 35.
ſayes, <hi>Who gaue him firſt, that hes bound him to giue them againe?</hi>
Wilt thou be before him? gaue thou him firſt any good? if thou
can doe it, then thou merites; if not, then it is a blaſphemie to
thinke that thou can merite: Fy on thee, there is nothing in the
part of the creature but debt, yea, meere debt, nothing on the part
of God but merite.</p>
               <p>Now to goe forward in the matter of this thankſ-giuing that
neuer hes an end, that ſhould be without intermiſſion, and that
God deſerues at our handes. The matter and cauſe of thankſ-giuing
is grace: The firſt grace is <hi>Faith;</hi> not a ſimple faith, but
an exceeding grouth in faith; <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>your faith
grovves exceedinglie.</hi> The next grace is <hi>loue;</hi> not ſimple loue, but
aboundance of loue, <hi>and abounding in mutuall loue,</hi> ſo that the
hearts of them ranne ouer in loue, as a veſhell will doe when
it is ouer full. Well then, there is the matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and cauſe of this
thankeſ-giuing, an exceeding grouth of ſure faith, al <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>undant
<pb facs="tcp:16659:186"/>
mutuall loue that euery one bare to other. Then compare this
place with that which is in the firſt Epiſtle, chap. 1. verſe 3. He
thanked God for their faith and loue, not for their grouth, now
his ſtyle is higher: and he thankes God, not for faith ſimply, but
for grouth; not for loue ſimply, but for abounding in mutuall
loue. Then ye ſee ſince the firſt tyme the Apoſtle wrote the firſt
Epiſtle to them, the Theſſalonians hes growen in faith and loue.
There is the leſſon.<note place="margin">Grouth in faith in loue.</note> There muſt be a grouth in grace, grace muſt
grow in vs, and we muſt grow in grace. If thou grow not in
grace, faith and loue, if thou goe not forvvard, of neceſſity thou
muſt goe backward. Thinke not that a man will ſtand ſtill in
one eſtate of faith and loue, ſo that he will ſay, I wil fix my ſtalfe
here, and I will goe no further nor this pointe. If thou fix down
thy ſtalfe in faith and loue, thou ſhalt fall faſter backward nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thou came forward, and thou ſhalt neuer come to the end
nor mark. If thou fix thy ſtalf and neuer preaſe to go forward,
thou ſhalt neuer come to that glorious reſurrection; in plaine
talke, thou wilt neuer come to Heauen. To be homely with you;
We ſhould haue a care euer to grow in this lyfe; for ſo long as
we liue, we are either children, or at the fartheſt we are ſpringels
(to vſe that word) Then I aske, will a childe come to the ſtature
of a man or woman, if there be not grouth? No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Euen ſo if is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to one to come to the ſtature of that ſpirituall man
without growing: we are men when we come to Heauen, and are
joyned to our head, and no ſooner, and there our grouth ends.
Can thou come to a ſpirituall mans ſtature, if thou grow not in
faith and loue in this earth? And therefore, as euer ye vvould
come to Heauen and obtaine that glory; preaſe to grow in grace,
to ſpring in faith and loue in this world in ſome meaſure; marke
your grouth in grace as euer ye did in ſtature. He will be buſie
to ſee it he be higher this yeere nor he was the laſt yeere: but
whom marks if he be growne higher in ſpirituall things this yeere
nor he was the laſt yeere. This ſtature will away, theſe earthly
things will away, but this grouth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yet marke more. As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n the firſt Epiſtle 1. chap. verſe 3. he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16659:186"/>
thanked the Lord for faith ſimplie, and loue ſimplie, ſo here he
giues him all thankes for the grouth therein. Marke it. He
thankes not them for the grouth, he giues them not one part of
the thankes, and God the other, but he thankes God for all. And
good reaſon, for who is able to put one inche to his ſtature?
Art thou able to make thy ſelfe growe in this bodily grouth?
No, it is impoſſible. Then far leſſe is there any grouth in the
ſpirituall man, but that allanerly which God giues. No ſtanding
nor perſeuerance in grace but that which God giues. Al is giuen
by God. Fy on that ſtinking doctrine of the Papiſts. When God,
ſay they, hes giuen man a grace, he permits a man to his free will
to goe forward, as it were in mans owne option whether to goe
forward or not. I only touch this. As the graces commes of God,
ſo of neceſſity the increaſe &amp; grouth of graces commes of God
and not of any grace left in vs. In one word, Giue him the praiſe
of the beginning of grace, giue him the praiſe of thy progreſſe
in grace, giue him the end, giue him the praiſe of all: For he it is
that giues the grace, the progreſſe and grouth therein, it is he that
crownes his worke in thee, it is he that works all, that all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of grace may be giuen to him.</p>
               <p>Yet to inſiſt. What is this Faith? Faith is nothing but a joining
of vs with God in Chriſt. What is Loue? this mutuall loue? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a joyning of vs with the Church here on earth. What
is grouth of Faith? Nothing but a growing nearer and nearer
to God, to dravv him nearer and nearer to vs. What is the
growing in Loue? Nothing but a drawing nearer and nearer
to the Church, which is the bodie of Chriſt. Then draw neare
to the head, draw neare to the bodie ſeuere not thy ſelfe from it.
Then what is the matter of thankſ-giuing? Euen this, that they
were drawen nearer nor they were before to Chriſt, and to his
Church. Then, brethren, when haue we matter of thanking God
for any man for any people? Euen when we ſee any man or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
drawing nearer to Chriſt, and the body of Chriſt nor they
wer. If a man had al the kingdomes of the earth, there is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to rejoice for in him; if we ſee him ly aback from Chriſt, and
from his Church; if he draw not nearer and nearer to Chriſt and
his church in this life, I will neuer rejoyce for all his kingdomes.
Vnhappie is that man that ſunders from Chriſt what euer he be;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16659:187"/>
is he a Lord, an Earle, a King, and in the meane-tyme hes he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

worldly, if he be not joyned with God and the Church, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhall be his damnation.</p>
               <p>Then laſt here, looke what he ſpeakes of loue, and of the

and mutuall;<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to thy hart; and againe, the loue that commes from thy hart to
my hart that is mutuall and double; this is the loue that he prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the double bond of loue: and it muſt not be a double bond
onely betweene two: there are ſundry thinkes they loue wel-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neugh
if they loue one, and that one loue them again. No, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſayes here, Euery member of the body muſt loue all from
the higheſt to the loweſt: The hand of a man in the owne ſort
loues the whole members of the body, from the head to the foot,
honorable or vnhonorable, high or low, be what it wil, no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in the body but it loues all. So the loue the Apoſtle craues, is
that loue that one hes to all; and againe, that loue that all hes to
one. So that there ſhould be no member in the body of Chriſt
but it ſhould be linked in with loue to Chriſt, and euery member
of his body. There is no member of the body of man but it hes a
certaine linke whereby it is linked to the reſt. The finger of the
hand hes a link with the toe of the foot, albeit they be far diſtant.
So there ſhould be no member of the body of Chriſt, but it ſhold
be linked with euery one of the reſt of the members, albeit they
lay ten thouſand myles ſundrie. It lyes not in our power to cauſe
all men loue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it lyes not in my power to cauſe al men loue me,
nor in thy power to cauſe all men loue thee; but I tell thee what
thou ſhould doe, looke thou loue all for thy part, and if they loue
not thee againe, they haue to anſwere to God. For he cranes
this mutuall loue of vs. This is the mutuall loue that holdes the
brethren together, if it be not, the members cannot be joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the bodie. It is true, we will neuer get it perfite in this
earth: for ſo long as the deuill, the fleſh and our lulles abydes,
there wil be euer diſtraction; yet we ſhould ſtriue againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
and our owne cankerd nature to be linked and joyned with
the members of the bodie, vntill we be perfitely joyned with
Chriſt, where there ſhall be no ſeuering. If we were once perfitly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16659:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>

nor our owne corruption.</p>
               <p>Now in the next verſe he amplifies this their faith and great
loue. Their faith and loue was ſo great that he was forced to
preach their praiſes in all the Churches wherein he reſorted:
he came to no Church but remembring their great faith and
loue, he was compelled to preach their praiſes, and to ſet them
forth as an example to be followed. Before he thanked God for
them, and for their faith and loue; now he glories in the graces
they had receiued, before the world, men and the churches wher
he came in his journey. When he thanked God concerning them
he vtters neuer one word of their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> praiſe; but comming among
men, and ſpeaking to men and to the Church, there he praiſes
them. Mark this difference. Then brethren, there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in ſpeaking of the graces of men, when we ſpeake to God
and before him, when we ſpeak to men and before men. When
thou ſpeakſt to God of man, let no praiſe of man be heard before
him: be ware of that, but let God haue al praiſe and glory if thou
be ſpeaking to God, if it were of all the kings of the earth, vtter
no praiſe of any king there; for, in compariſon with God, kings
are but duſt, and worſe nor the duſt that is trode vnder foote. So,
let God haue al the praiſe of any grace he hes giuen to any man;
and ſay not, Lord I praiſe thee for this parte, of the grace, and
I giue man praiſe for that parte of the grace. No, but ſay, Lord,
I giue thee the vvhole praiſe of the grace, becauſe all the grace
he hes gotten is of thee. But when we ſpeak to men and tels them
of the graces of God men hes gotten, then we may glory in men,
but with this prouiſion, that it be in God. We may commend
men before men, for their faith, loue, patience, but looke that all
this commendation be in God firſt, and then to this end, to make
men whom thou commendſt as examples in wel doing. See that
thou look to the well of them thou ſpeakſt to, that they ſhould
follow them whom thou praiſeſt for wel-doing. If thy minde be
puft vp without reuerence of God, &amp; without reſpect to the wel
of him thou ſpeakſt to, thou derogatſt Gods glory; we ſhould be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16659:188"/>
ware when we ſpeak to the praiſe of any man, that we derogate
nothing from the glory of God.</p>
               <p>Yet marke further the order he vſes. He glories not firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men, and then begins to thank God; but firſt he turnes to
God and giues God the glory of the grace he hes giuen to them.
<hi>We ought to thank God,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>alvvaies for you, as it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Then
he commes to men and glories of their graces in the preſence
of men. Then, brethren, it is dew tyme to praiſe men and to giue
them their owne commendation for the graces God hes giuen
them: when firſt thou haſt glorified God, giuing him the firſt
praiſe and commendation. This is the order. When thou giueſt
God the firſt praiſe, and then commes to men and praiſes the
graces in them before men, that praiſe is in God and he allowes
of it. But vvhen thou beginnes in praiſing men to men, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
not God the giuer of all, thou ſpoileſt God of his
glorie. So vve ſhould take verie good heed hovv vve praiſe
godlie men: for verie narrovvlie ſhall vve eſcape derogation to
Gods glorie, except the Spirite connoy the vvhole hart and
mouth. And therefore in prayſing men vve ſhould be vvart
vve derogate nothing to the glorie of God, vvho is the cheefe
giuer of all. All the kings of the earth ſhould ſtoup and giue all
honour and glorie to God.</p>
               <p>Now in the end of this verſe he ſets dovvne the matter of this
his glorying, Faith namely, and with Faith he joynes Patience.
<hi>becauſe of your patience and faith in all your perſecutions that ye ſuffer.</hi>
In the verſe going before he made mention of faith without pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
but in this verſe he maks mention of faith and patience, &amp;
ther eaſon is, Becauſe faith in effect is nothing but the anchor of
the ſoule: As the Apoſtle to the Heb. chap. 6. verſ. 19. calles hope
<hi>the anchor of the ſoule:</hi> and as an anchor is caſten on ſure ground to
ſtick; ſo is Faith caſten on Chriſt and faſtned on him. Now there
is nothing in this world that the deuill, the world, ſin, which are
the enemies of Faith in this world enuyes more nor when they
ſee the ſoule of a man anchored on Chriſt, as on a ſure ground.
And therefore they ſeeke euer to ſeuere thy ſoule from Chriſt,
and to breake the anchor. He will ſpew out floods of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and tentation, javv after javv, to raiſe, if it were poſſible, the
anchor of Faith in Chriſt, that the anchor being away, the man
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16659:188"/>
may flow and fleete, and at the laſt periſh. Then what is the
remedie? It is needfull, that, faith be ſure grounded: if faith
be not grounded on Chriſt ſhe ſhall periſhe; and further ſhe
muſt haue a troup of graces about her, ſhe muſt be hedged on
all ſides with a varietie of graces.<note place="margin">Ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God &amp; of Chriſt are the cauſes of vengence.</note> And ſo it is, where euer true
faith is in Chriſt, there is a troup of graces about it. Now all
theſe graces that compaſſes her are as many branches that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
from her ſelfe as from the roote. There ſtands about her,
Hope, Loue, Patience, &amp;c. a number of graces of all ſortes, all
commes from her, for ſhe is mother of all. All ſerues her, for
ſhe is Queene of all; Hope, Loue, Patience, and the reſt, are as
many maids ſtanding about her to ſerue her. Now among all
theſe graces Patience is one; the duetie and ſeruice of Patience
is to ſtand betweene faith and the jawes of tentations and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions,
and to receiue all the jawes of tentations on her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that the anker of the ſoule which is Faith may ſtand ſure.
So, Patience ſtandes vp and holds the jaw off Faith, otherwaies,
thy faith will be broken: and it is impoſſible to him that hes no
Patience to abyde the ſpeaches, let be to ſuſtaine the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men; if Patience be not, Faith will not abyde ſure. And
by the contrare looke how needfull it is that Patience be joyned
with Faith, it is as needfull that Faith be joyned with Patience:
and therefore he joynes theſe, your Patience and your Faith in
all perſecutions. And as I told you, Faith is the mother of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and where the mother is not, the daughter cannot be: and
if this anchor of Faith be not anchored on Chriſt, Patience will
not hold off the jaw: for the ſolide ground to reſt on is Chriſt.
Where faith is not, Chriſt is not; and take him away no ſtanding.
So the cheefe ground of all ſtanding, is faith grounded on Chriſt
Ieſus, all the reſt are but branches to Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> faith is the cheefe
ground. The ſtanding of all is through Chriſt when the anchor
of the ſoule is grounded on him.</p>
               <p>Now one word in the end of this verſe. He ſpeakes heere of a
Faith in tribulation and perſecution, not of Faith in caſe, reſt, and
quyetneſſe, but of a Faith in trouble. The Faith of the Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians
was not a Faith in eaſe and quyetneſſe, but a Earth that
lay vnder a continuall exerciſe, lay vnder perſecution: for, the
Church of Theſſaloniea was exceedingly troubled, as appeares
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16659:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in this Epiſtle. Many will be content to beleeue, faith in Chriſt
is a wondrous faire thing: He would beleeue and ſhe would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue,
but looke what kinde of faith men would haue, a faith with
quyetneſſe in the world, with honor eneugh, with riches, and all
this worlds wealth. This is the faith that all men would haue. But
(brethren) the faith of Chriſt (which is the true faith) muſt be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
in the fornace, otherwayes it will be full of droſſe: Will ye
get fine golde that is not caſten in the fornace and fyned in it?
Trow ye to get a fyne and true faith that is not fyned in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
of trouble and perſecution, at the leſt, one vexation or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
all troubles are not alike, but of neceſſity faith muſt be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
in ſome fornace;<note place="margin">Faith fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by troubles.</note> thou muſt be in ſome tribulation, either
within thee, or without thee, in goods, riches or ſome thing: and
this is the faith that hes the commendation here, a fyned faith as
gold hes the fyneſſe throgh the fire. <hi>Peter</hi> 1. Epiſt. 1. chap 7. verſ.
tels the excellency of this faith compared with gold: gold when
it is caſten in the fire and the droſſe of it burnt vp will be far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
nor it was, and yet there was neuer gold ſo f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fine it oft-times ouer it may be ever the finer, but it ſhal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
in the end; but he ſayes, faith that is fined and tryed, <hi>ſhall be
found to your praiſe, glory and honor, vvhen Chriſt ſhall be manifeſted.</hi>
As he wold ſay, it ſhal not periſh, but at that great day of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it ſhal tend to thy euerlaſting glory Let vs not preaſe to feed our
ſelues in our fantaſies, thinking that we ſhall haue a faith in eaſe,
quyetnes &amp; honor. No, lay this ground down, if thou wold haue
a faith to abide till Chriſt come, aſſure thee thou muſt ſuffer, and
thou muſt abide the jawes of tentations till all thy faith be tryed,
and the whole dros waſhen away, and the fine gold ſtand vp. At
theſe are but dreames, to think that thou would hold Heauen in
the one arme and the world in the other arme. No, thou muſt let
the world go, and take Heauen in thy whole armes with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or elſe thou ſhalt loſe Heauen and get the world in thy armes
with damnation. Now this for the thankſ-giuing and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
for their increaſe of faith and aboundance in loue.</p>
               <p>Now come to the ſecond part, Conſolation: Making mention
of their perſecutions, he takes occaſion to comfort them, and I
thinke that be the principall purpoſe he hes to doe with them:
and the firſt argument he vſes heere, is that juſt and latter judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16659:189"/>
that generall judgement. He ſayes, the perſecution that
ye ſuffer for Chriſtes ſake, for the kingdome of Heauen, they
are ſure arguments that there ſhall be a juſt judgement, and that
Chriſt ſhall come to judge the world, and render to euerie one
according to his works. And therefore vpon the remembring of
this juſt judgement that ſhall be; ye Theſſalonians comfort your
ſelues,<note place="margin">Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones of the godlie, a ſure ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the day of iudgment to come.</note> for it ſhall try who did right and who did wrong. Then
take vp this, The perſecutions the godly ſuffers in this life, what
are they? they are very ocular demonſtrations (that is the force of
the word) of the generall judgement to come, wherein Chriſt
ſhall judge the world. And in the perſecution of the godly (as it
were in a mirror) I may ſee or thou may ſee Chriſt comming to
judge the world, &amp; to render to euery one according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts:
for looke how I or thou may reaſon: When I ſee a perſon
troubled for righteouſnes ſake, I will conclude, here is an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
man, here are godly people troubled wrongouſly, therefore,
of neceſſitie there muſt be a judgement wherein all ods muſt be
made euen; I looke certainly for a judgement to come: God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be God, if there be not a judgement, wherein he ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenged
for the wrong done to this man: I will not conclude a
particulare and an earthly judgement; I will not ſay, when I ſee
a godly man troubled, therefore, the troublers of him ſhall be
plagued ere they go off the world: it is ouer high. Indeede the
Prophetes of olde had this reuelation, but it is ouer high for vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
becauſe experience in all ages hes proued that ſome of the
greateſt perſecutors hes died in peace, and no viſible judgement
hes ouertaine them heere. But, this I am ſure of; when I ſee godly
men oppreſt, I may ſay, there ſhall be a day of generall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
vvherein God ſhall be anenged of the perſecutours, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
interceede not. Novv vvold ye knovv any token that
Chriſt ſhall come againe and put an end to the vvorld, and that
there ſhall be a generall judgement? Looke if ye ſee or heare tel
that the godly and innocent are troubled in the world, take that
for as ſure an argument as can be that a generall judgment ſhal
be. And as ſurely as the maſter is comming after the forerunner,
as ſurely ſhall the general judgment come after the ſuffring of
the godly, they muſt dravv on a judgment, and at the laſt they
muſt draw Chriſt out of Heauen to take vpon him the place of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16659:190"/>
a Iudge to rander to euery man according to his doing.</p>
               <p>Now another thing: He comfortes them taking his reaſon
from the generall judgement, he telles them there ſhall be a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
judgement, when a terrible judge ſhall come and ſit downe
in a judgement ſeat. What comfort is this? Ye ſee many vvill
ſhake and ſhudder when they heare of it, and faine would deſire
neuer to heare of it. It is true the promiſe of the generall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will neuer comfort the wicked, and they that troubles o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
the more that they heare of it, the more will they trimble
and ſhiuer. But it is as true that the moſt comfortable voice they
that ſuffers wrong can heare, is the hearing of the comming of
Chriſt in that latter day, and it is the matter of patience, it vvill
make them ly vnder affliction with exceeding joy; the thought
of the comming of Chriſt giues patience in all troubles, and this
may be found in experience: the cheefe joy of the godly is the
remembring of Chriſts comming: It is not mens judgement,
their abſolution and condemnation that we ſhould ſtand vpon.
What cares me, if all the world would abſolue me, if I be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by God? And againe, vvhat care<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> me if all the vvorld
condemne me, if God abſolue me? It is not mens abſoluing or
condemning, that bringes the true joy or heauineſſe to the hart:
but it is Gods abſolution and condemnation that will doe this.
And therefore as thou would haue comfort in that terrible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
doe well, and ſuffer wrong, and byde patiently, for ſurely
it will not be long; there is ſuch a crying of bloude, and ſuch
vvronges in this vvorld, that, truelie, in this decrepite age,
Chriſt muſt come ſhortlie. Then, this is the firſt argument of
conſolation.</p>
               <p>The other is more effectuall. I ſhall touch it. <hi>Ye that ſuffers
ſhall be thought vvorthie of the kingdome of God, for the vvhich ye
ſuffer.</hi> He commes nearer, as he would ſay, ye haue no cauſe to
trimble and feare, ye ſhall be abſoluted from that terrible judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ye ſhall be counted worthie of the kingdome of God.
The enemies of the trueth gathers of theſe words, that, there is
a merite and worthineſſe for ſuffering. But <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. chap. 8.
verſe 18. ſayes, <hi>All this ſuffering is not vvorthie this vveight of
glorie.</hi> So I anſwere. This worthineſſe is not our owne, but that
which is Chriſts worthines and properly pertaines to him, heere
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16659:190"/>
is improperly aſcryued to vs: for, throgh that ſtrate conjunction
we haue with Chriſt, he and we are made one, and therefore his
graces, after a ſort, are aſcriued to vs. I hauing Chriſt may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
his merite and worthines, his graces that he hes conquiſed,
as life euerlaſting, &amp;c. to me as euer man might challenge any
land or heritage. Therefore gather not here any worthines ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
without Chriſt. Alwayes, I ſee the cheefe cauſe of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the godly that ſuffers here, is not ſo much that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhall be puniſhed for euer, as that the godly ſhal be adjudged
to glory. There is the cheefe ground of my conſolation, Let a
man doe all the euill he can to me, my comfort is not that he ſhal
be puniſhed at that latter day, but that then God ſhall glorifie
me at that latter day. Deſire not ſo much the latter judgement
that then the wicked may be puniſhed, as that thou may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.
Look Gods purpoſe, he hes appointed this latter day, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to this end, that, the godly may be glorified. The other end of
the puniſhment of the offenders is not the cheefe end, for the
cheefe end that God looks to, is, that, he may be glorified in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
It is true, he will be glorified in juſtice, but he delytes moſt to
be glorified in mercy. He ſeeks to be glorified in all his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
in his wiſdome, power, &amp;c. But the mercy of the Lord
paſſes all, and he ſeekes aboue all, that, his glory ſhould ſhyne in
his mercy toward ſinners. And certainely Chriſt was ſent in the
world that his glory ſhould ſhine in mercy. His preaching was
to mercy. God hes greater glory in ſauing one ſinfull ſoule in
Chriſt, nor he hes in condemning of millions of the wicked. So,
brethren, wonder not that many goes to Hell, but, wonder, that,
euer a ſinner ſhould be ſafe, and maruell more at the mercy of
God, in ſauing of one ſinner, nor at his juſtice in the perdition of
ten thouſands. So the mercy of God is wonderfull, his power
and all is wonderfull, but, his mercy paſſes all his properties. To
him be glory for euer.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the firſt part of this chapter, ye haue
heard (brethren) next after the ſaluata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a preface, wherein he rejoyces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with them, for that increaſe and
grouth of the graces of God in them,
namelie, of their Faith, Loue and Charitie.
In rejoycing with them he giues God the
thankes and all the glorie of whatſoeuer
grace they had receyued. We entered the laſt day in the ſecond
parte, which containes a conſolation: For theſe Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ſuſtained affliction and trouble for the faith of Chriſt,
therefore the Apoſtle confortes them. We heard the firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of comfort he miniſtred to them, was from the juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God. Your troubles and afflictions ye ſuffer are all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16659:191" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſure tokens, that, Ieſus Chriſt will come one day and judge this
world juſtlie: Among all the aſſurances of the latter judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ths is one. The trouble that the godlie ſuffers in this world.
In the affliction and trouble of the godly, ye may ſee (as it were,
in a mirror) the Lord comming to judge the world, when we ſee
an innocent man troubled, we may gather our concluſion, there
muſt follow of neceſſity a day of count and reckning: it cannot
be, that the juſt Lord will ſuffer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnjuſt dealing to paſſe away
vnpuniſhed. Then, in the ſecond argument he drawes nearer to
them, and ſets downe the end of this juſt judgment that ſhall be,
the end ſhall be for their well: For, when the Lord ſhall come to
judge the world, they ſhall be counted worthy of that kingdom,
the kingdome of Heauen, for the which they ſuffered. Worthie,
not in themſelues (for, all the affliction vnder Heauen will not
make a man worthy of Heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but, worthy, in the righteous
merites of Chriſt, where-with one day we ſhall be clad, and for
his worthineſſe and merite ſhall be adjudged to life euerlaſting</p>
               <p>Now in the beginning of this text, he proues, that the day of
judgment they ſhall be adjudged to lyfe euerlaſiting and glory.
He takes his argument from the nature of that Iudge. <hi>It is a iust
thing,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>to God, to recompence tribulation to them vvho trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
you.</hi> As if he had ſaid, the Iudge is juſt, yea, by nature he is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
it ſelfe, and therefore, the judgement muſt be juſt, and in his
juſt judgement he muſt adjudge you to life, and he muſt render to
euery man his due; being juſt, he muſt render to them who hes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
you, affliction againe. <hi>And to you vvho are afflicted, he must
tender reſt, euen, as he renders to vs:</hi> For, I in my owne perſon haue
beene afflicted aſwell as ye haue beene, and I am aſſured, he will
render reſt to me, and ſo alſo will he to you: there is the meaning
of the words. Then ye ſee, brethren, here, he grounds their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance
in that latter judgment vpon the juſt nature of God: ye
may ſee our life euerlaſting vnto the which we ſhall be adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the day of judgment leanes on a ſolide foundation, euen the
moſt juſt nature of the Iudge; all the world is not able to ſhake
it, if thou can ſhake God, then thou may ſhake our life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.
Seuer juſtice from him, and ſeuer life from his owne,
both are alyke; do the one, if thou may do the other. And ſo, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
ye ſee where-vpon the aſſurance of your faith and hope
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16659:192"/>
of life euerlaſting is grounded, it is grounded vpon an inſight of
the nature of God, vpon a knowledge of him, what he is in his
owne nature, that he is juſt, he is righteouſneſſe it ſelfe, knowing
then that he is juſt, ſeeing, as it were, at the leaſt in ſome meaſure
in God, and in his nature that he is juſt, I take aſſurance that that
juſt God ſhall adjudge me to life, I make this more generall: all
aſſurance, all hope of any grace we haue to receiue at the hands
of God, what euer it be, muſt proceede from an inſight and
knowledge of the nature of God; how can I or any man looke
for any good at the handes of him vvho is not knovvne to me?
hovv ſhall I aſſure my ſelfe I ſhall get any good from him, I
know not? Therefore, the man or woman who would haue faith
in God, or hope of lyfe, or any good at his hands, muſt ſeeke to
pearce in to the deepneſſe of the infinite nature of God, ſo farre
as can be, to knowe him in his juſtice, wiſdome, power, mercy,
and in all theſe infinite properties in his nature; then knowing
him in theſe infinite thinges, he muſt aſſure himſelfe of ſuch and
ſuch graces at his hands; I know him to be powerfull, therefore,
with his power he will deliuer me; I know him to be mercifull,
in his mercy I am aſſured he wil ſhow mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on me; I know him
to be wiſe, therefore I am aſſured he will deale wiſely with me, he
that is skilfull and the God of order will deale skilfully with me.
Then, ye ſee, that, faith will neuer be builded vpon a ſcroofe and
ſuperficiall thing. The world thinks it ynough, to know, there is
a God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to know his name and no more. No, thy hart cannot be
builded on a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>roofe. It is impoſſible to any to haue that ſolide
and aſſured faith in God and that hope of lyfe, except they haue
a ſolide knowledge, in ſome meaſure, of his nature and of his
properties. And that bodie that preaſes not to pearce in to the
deepneſſe of God; cannot haue that Spirit of God: for, in the firſt
Epiſtle to the Corinth. chap. 2. verſ. 10. it is ſaid, <hi>The spirit of God
ſearches,</hi> and what? <hi>in to the infinit deepneſſe of God,</hi> and there he lets
thee ſee Gods minde towardes thee. So, that, if any be indewed
with that ſearching Spirit of God, of neceſſitie that Spirit muſt
conuoy their eyes, in ſome meaſure, in to the ſecreetes of God,
to the deepneſſe of that infinite nature: It is a wonderfull ſight
that a true and ſolide faith hes in God. It will peace in to the
infinite nature of God, and builde on that infinite nature the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16659:192"/>
ground of faith. I ſpeake this that ye may ſeeke to knowe
the nature of God.</p>
               <p>Yet to the wordes. <hi>It is a righteous thing vvith God,</hi> not to men,
but, to God. The meaning of the Apoſtle is, What euer ſeemes
right in the eye of man, this is righteous in the eye of God, to
render to euery man his due. Now the Lord forbid, that our life
or death euerlaſting hang vpon that that ſeemes juſt and vnjuſt
to man. Lord forbid, that Heauen or Hell hang at mans girdle,
or depended on his judgement, I aſſure you, many would goe
to Hell from hand. As God in nature is a juſt Iudge, euen ſo,
man by nature a wrangous and vnjuſt judge: Let him be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ouer to himſelfe, hee ſhall neuer judges one whit of that
which is juſt,<note place="margin">Differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betvvene the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and of men.</note> at the leaſt, he ſhall neuer judge ſincerelie of that
worke. I ſhall tell you the differences between the judgement
of God and man ſhortlie. Man when he judges is oft-tymes ſo
blinded, that he ſees not the thing that is juſt: for, he will take
vp the thing that is vnjuſt to be juſt, and the thing that is juſt
to be vnjuſt. Then againe, ſupponing by the light of the minde
he ſee the thing that is juſt, yet there is ſuch a peruerſneſſe in
his will and affection, that, in ſpyte of the light of the mynde he
will peruert juſtice; that thing he knowes to be juſt he will call
it vnjuſt. And the thing he knowes to be vnjuſt he will call
it juſt. But it is not ſo with God: for, firſt, he by that infinite
judgement in him ſees that thing that is juſt to be juſt, nothing
can begyle him, at the verie firſt looke he vvill knovve that
vvhich is juſt. And then againe, vvhen he ſees it to be juſt,
there is ſuch an vprightneſſe in him that he vvill decerne it to
be juſt. Then, brethren, it is vvell vvith vs that our lyfe and
death dependes not on men, vpon their judgement, their ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it is vvell vvith vs that our ſaluation and condemnation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
not on their blind and corrupt affection, but on him that
ſees euery thing, as it is, and judges juſtlie. There is the ground of
our ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Novv to goe forvvarde. The effect of his juſtice, vvhat is
it? The juſt Iudge ſitting in his judgement ſeate he renders to
euerie man their ovvne, his juſtice ſtandes in diſtribution: He
renders to the troublers, by the ſaw called <hi>Lex talionis,</hi> euen ſuch
thing as they did, to wit, trouble. But to the godly he giues reſt,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16659:193"/>
joy and comfort for euer. What ſhould he render to the afflicters
but affliction. To the troublers but tribulation againe. So what
euer man does, he gettes the lyke repayed to him againe in his
hand:<note place="margin">God rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the afflicters of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</note> afflictes he, he ſhall be afflicted: trouble he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſhall
be troubled, if all the world had ſaid the contrare. Indeed it is
true, brethren, the affliction that he receiues, albeit it be alyke
in qualitie: (for affliction is euer like affliction) yet looke to the
quantitie of that trouble the troublers ſhall receyue, It is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable,
in quantitie: for, in quantitie it ſhall be infinite. All that
which they may do to the godly is but finit and hes and end: But
that affliction where-with they ſhall be repayed home againe is
infinite. And therefore read the Rom. chap. 2. verſ. 8. 9. where
<hi>Paul</hi> telles of that rendring alike at that great day, he cannot get
words ſufficiently to expreſſe their affliction. They ſhall get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
then wraith, they ſhall be oppreſt with tribulation &amp;
anguiſh, and ſhall be caſten in the preſſe of affliction. Whereto
ſhould we ſpeake of this? Can any words expreſſe it? No, all the
words of the Angels of Heauen and men in the earth cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the affliction they ſhall be afflicted with in that day. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the afflictions: the godly ſuſtaines here may be ſuffered,
but the affliction the wicked ſhall ſuffer at that day ſhal be into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.
Now ye may ſay, how can this ſtand with Gods juſtice,
to repay a thing infinite for a finite thing; to render infinite affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for finite affliction; to render the paines of Hell for a ſhort
temporall paine? I anſwer. God in repaying wrong to them
that hes done wrong, lookes not ſo much to the wrong that one
man does to another, as to the wrong done to his owne Majeſty
that is infinite. Thou oppreſſeſt thy neighbour, thou troubleſt
a brother. The Lord when he commes to judge, he looks not ſo
much to the wrong thou haſt done to thy neighbour, or to thy
brother, as to the wrong done to himſelfe: He reſpects the wrong
done to him who is infinite, and therefore, thou ſhalt be repayed
with an infinite paine. This is Gods juſtice. Then againe. Neuer
a man that did wrong. and that hes tane pleaſure to do wrong,
did euer the wrong, nor was able to doe ſo great wrong, as he
would haue done, if he had gotten his will fulfilled in doing
wrong, there would neuer be an end of his wrong: If the
trouber had his vvill in troubling, no end of his trouble: If
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16659:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the murtherer had his vvill in murthering his bloodie ſvvord
vvould neuer be put vp, but he vvould euer be murthering,
he vvould be euer oppreſſing. And therefore, God in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lookes not ſo much to the thing thou doeſt, to the ſtroke
of thy hand, to the word of thy mouth, as he looks to the thoght
and will of thy mynde. It hes no end of euill. The Lord for thy
endleſſe euill vvill in hart, vvill render thee an endleſſe paine.
This much for the firſt rendering.</p>
               <p>The ſecond rendring is the rendring to the godly according
to Gods juſtice. What renders God to the godly? Not as he
did to the wicked, affliction for affliction, trouble for trouble;
but by the contrare, vvhere they vvere afflicted, lying tread
dovvne in the preſſe of affliction, then the Lord ſhall louſe their
bondes, and take the oppreſſours and vvrap them in the ſame
bondes, and tread them vnder his feete. So, the ſecond ſort of
rendering,<note place="margin">God ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite glory, to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted.</note> is rendering not alyke to alyke, but a thing that is
vnlyke, rendering to the afflicted relaxation for euer. Brethren,
there is no compariſon betvveene the afflictions of the godlie,
and that vvhich the Lord ſhall render to them for their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
That vvhich the godlie ſuffers is but a meane and ſmall
thing. It is not vvorthie to be ſpoken of, to be rent on the Raoks,
to be burnt quick, for the name of Ieſus, is not vvorthie to be
ſpoken of in reſpect of that wonderfull glorie we ſhall poſſeſſe.
The Apoſtle in that ſecond chap. to the Romans, 10. verſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get words to expreſſe their glory which they ſhall enjoy at
that latter day. <hi>Honour and glory,</hi> that paſſes all the ignominie that
can be in the world a thouſand ſtages, <hi>immortalitie,</hi> thou ſhalt
neuer die againe, <hi>lyfe,</hi> and lyfe that is without end, peace and joy
euerlaſting. There is no compariſon. In the 2. Corinth. chap.
4. verſe 17. <hi>Paul</hi> calles the afflictions of the godlie, <hi>the momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneall
lightneſſe of affliction:</hi> they are firſt light, then their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
laſtes but for a moment. Yet, ſayes he, <hi>they ſhall vvorke
to you an euerlaſting vveight of glorie, and glorie that is excellentlie
excellent:</hi> he cannot get vvordes to expreſſe it. The glorie is
in quantitie a vveight, in tyme it is euerlaſting; in dignitie it is
excellentlie excellent. Whereto ſhall I ſpeake it? All the
tongues that is in Heauen and earth is not able to expreſſe that
glorie as it is vvorthie to be ſpoken of: For, in the 1. Epiſt. to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16659:194"/>
the Corinth. chap. 2. verſe 7. it is ſaid, <hi>Theſe thinges hes not ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the hart of man that the Lord hes prepared for them that loue
him.</hi> And who are they, if not they who ſuffers for him? This
much for the rendring both to the one and the other according
to the juſt nature of God.</p>
               <p>Now in the end he addes to this word, <hi>vvith vs.</hi> He ſhall
render relaxation to you and to me alſo. I am troubled as you
are. And therefore I hope for the ſame deliuerance and relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
that I promiſe to you. Promiſe nothing to the people,
but the thing thou thinkeſt to get a parte of thy ſelfe. Promiſe
no reſurrection, except thou thinkeſt to get a parte thereof.
But the thing I marke is this. I ſee all grace and glorie is in a
ſocietie vvith the Saintes: reſurrection, lyfe euerlaſting is vvith
the godlie: For as there is a communion vvith the Saintes in
afflictiones 1. <hi>Peter</hi> chap. 5. verſe 9. ſo there is a communion
with the Saintes in reſt, in grace and glorie. Epheſ. chap. 3. verſe
14. 1. Theſſa. chap. 3. verſe 13. And this thing we may take vp
euer in this Apoſtle, he ſpeakes of no grace but euer together
vvith the Saintes, all is in one conjunction. Let none therefore
preaſe to come to Heauen but in this conjunction. Thou wilt
leape from the Church, but I aſſure thee leape as thou wilt, and
think to come to Heauen without that ſocietie, thou ſhalt neuer
come to Heauen, thou ſhalt neuer get relaxation but in this ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.
Thinke it no ſmall matter to be of the number of the godly:
thou ſhalt neuer be glorified in that latter day, if thou be not one
of that nomber. Then marke another thing. He ſayes, they ſhall
get relaxation with him. Then it followes that he was afflicted
with them. Who gettes reſt? but they who are troubled. Who
will come to Heauen? None but they who for Chriſts ſake on
the earth hes ſuffered ſome affliction, either within or without.
No, look not that a man will come ſleeping to Heauen. Heauen
is a relaxation out of bondes; who can be lowſed, but they who
haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ene bound? This may learne vs to take in patience to be
bound, to be euill ſpoken of, and to ſuffer either one thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the hope of that lyfe euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>Novv to goe forvvarde in the text follovving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ye haue a

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16659:194"/>
When ſhall affliction be rendered to the afflicters, and relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the bound and troubled? <hi>When our Lord Ieſus Christ ſhall
come to iudge the vvorld.</hi> Not till then. There is the dyet nothing
but patience vntill then. Thou art ouer ſudden. Thou would

<hi>1. Iohn</hi> chap 3. verſe 2. When Chriſt ſhall come he ſhall

Heauen accompanying that glorious Majeſtie. Then Hell ſhall
be ſeene, Heauen ſhall be ſeene faire and broad, lyfe ſhall be
ſeene, death ſhall be ſeene, all ſhall appeare then as they are. So,
byde ſtill a whyle, and byde in patience, thou who would haue

gether. Then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> brethren, in one word, Let not the Iew be bold to
ſay, he knowes God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he knowes not his Son; all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
a man can haue of God, when he knowes not his Sonne,
is nothing: for, God the Father cannot be knowne, but in his Son
Ieſus Chriſt, and without the knowledge of God in his Son, there
is no ſaluation from judgement. The Son is the Image of God,
and God will be knowne in him. Heb. chap. 1. verſe 3. He is <hi>the
brightneſſe of his glory, and the ingraued forme of his perſon.</hi> So, that
there can be no ſight of God, but in the face of Chriſt the man.
Ioyne theſe two together, know God know the Son, know the
Son that thou may know the Father; for, no ſight of the Father,
but, in the Son.</p>
               <p>This further wold be marked. When he ſpeaks of obedience
to Chriſt. He ſayes not, they that obeyed not the Lord Ieſus, but,
he ſayes, <hi>They vvho obeyed not the Goſpell of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> This is
ſpoken, to the commendation of the Goſpell, and of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, and this baſe miniſtry which men eſteemes ſo litle of.
Looke how he rankes this Goſpell and the preaching of it with
Chriſt himſelfe. He counts them that obey the Goſpell, to obey
Chriſt, and he counts them, who are rebellious to the Goſpell, to
be rebels to Chriſt. And therefore ſay I, boaſt as thou wilt, of
Chriſt, and of the knowledge of him, if thou deſpiſe this Goſpel,
and this baſe miniſtry, vengence ſhall light on thee: Thou wilt
ſay, thou knoweſt Chriſt and in the meane time, there wil be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16659:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thou doeſt this, ſay not, thou loueſt Chriſt. Thou wilt ſay in that
great day, Lord, where ſaw we thee hungring, where ſaw we
thee naked, &amp;c. But, the Lord then ſhall ſay, What euer thou did
to the Miniſters of the Goſpell, thou did it to me, thou ſtayed the

this tyme, and with draw not the moyen whereby this Goſpell
may be propagated in the world. I ſpeak no more of this matter.
One day will ſhow the trueth of theſe things.</p>
               <p>Yet, ere I leaue the words. Marke, further. He is ſpeaking of
the godlie, that were perſecuted, and he brings in the Lord Ieſus
rendring, and yet, he ſayes not, he ſhall render vengence to them,
that afflicted and troubled the godlie, he ſpeaks not of them, that
were afflicted. But, he ſayes, <hi>to them, vvho obeyed not the Goſpell
of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> So, he touches the groundes: perſecution and
troubling of the ſaints riſes euer on this ground, rebellion to God,
rebellion to Chriſt, no perſecuter, but a rebell to God, a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Goſpel of Chriſt, be is a contemner of God and Chriſt.
And in the meane-tyme, with this, he comforts the perſecuted
Theſſalonians, they ſhall not eſcape trouble, who hes troubled
you, becauſe the Lord hes his entreſt. And therefore, aſſure the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if there were no other thing, but, this rebelling againſt God and

this. Alas, there is ſuch a ſtupiditie in the hart of man, that he can
neuer beleue this. So, there the vengence, a perdition, and an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
perdition.</p>
               <p>Now, in one word. He reſolues this particular vengence in the
own grounds; there is, firſt, a perdition; then, an eternity of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In the next words, he lets you ſee the groundes, firſt, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and then, of the eternitie thereof. As to the perdition it
ſelfe, He ſayes, it commes <hi>from the face of God.</hi> The wicked ſhall
not ſee ſo ſoone the face of Ieſus Chriſt the Iudge at that day, but,
as ſoone they ſhall melt away, as the waxe at the fire; and as ye
ſee the matter of melting is in the waxe it ſelf; ſo, the matter of the
melting of the wicked ſhall be in themſelues. But, what matter, if
it had an end. And therefore, next, he layes downe the ground of

The power of the glorious Iudge is eternall, infinit and endles;
the power of man hes an end. He is a mighty monarch to day; but,

                  </gap>s vvhere-vvith for the tyme
they vvere exerciſed. The firſt and the
cheefeſt argument of conſolation vvas
taine from that juſt jugdement of God
when he commes: for the afflictions that
the godly and innocent ſuffers in this lyfe for the name of Ieſus
Chriſt, are as a mirror vvherein we may ſee the Lord Ieſus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

and to giue reſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> his own. The Apoſtle taking occaſion of
this argument, points out the Lord Ieſus comming to judge the
world. He notes the place from which he ſhall come, an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
aboue all theſe viſible Heauens; he notes the companie
where-with in his comming he ſhall he accompanied. Firſt the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16659:198"/>
Angels of his power enarmed with the power of the Iudge the
Lord Ieſus to execute his juſt judgement. The next company
is a flamming fire; This fire at the comming of the Lord Ieſus
ſhall burne vp the Heauen, ſhall melt the elements, ſhall burne
vp this earth, and all the workes that is in it, as <hi>Peter</hi> declares
in his 2. Epiſtle chap. 3. and at laſt ſhall conſume and deuore the
wicked, and that euerlaſtingly, euer burning without end. When
he hes painted out the Lords comming to judge the world, he
ſubjoynes the effects that ſhall follow vpon his comming and
judgement. The firſt effect is, he ſhall inflict vengence to them
who in this world knew not God, and would not obey the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And after this, he deſcryues this
vengence more particularlie, it ſhall be an vtter deſtruction, ſo
that they ſhall neuer get vp their head againe, and this deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſhall be endleſſe; a death without a death, the ſoreſt death
that euer man died; the cauſe of the perdition ſhall be the face
and angry countenance of the Iudge, his face ſhall be as fire, and
they ſhal be as waxe, the heate of his face ſhall melt them as the
fire melts the waxe: the cauſe of the eternitie of their perdition
ſhall be the glorie of his power, his power ſhall neuer haue an
end, and therefore their paine, anguiſhe and perdition ſhall
neuer haue an end. The power ſhall euer holde them ſtill in
a torment, and ſo this vvraith euerlaſting ſhall ſeaſe and feede
vpon them for euermore. And ſo they ſhall euer be doing and
neuer be dead.</p>
               <p>Now, in this text, we haue the ſecond effect, that, ſhall follow
on the comming of the Lord to his judgement. The firſt effect
concerned the wicked. This effect concernes the godly. To
come to the wordes, ſhortlie. He ſayes, <hi>When he ſhall come to be
glorified in his Saintes.</hi> The meaning is, this vengence of perdition
euerlaſting ſhall be inflicted on the rebels of God and Chriſt, at
that tyme, when he ſhall come to glorifie his owne, the Saintes,
that in their glory and lyfe euerlaſting he may be glorified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.<note place="margin">Chief end of Chriſts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is, to glorifie the ſoules.</note>
This is the meaning, ſhortly. Now, if ye will marke the firſt
wordes, <hi>When he ſhall come.</hi> Ye may ſee, that, the firſt and cheefe
end of the comming of the Lord Ieſus to judgement, is, not the
wrack of the reprobate, but, his cheefe end in his comming to
judgement ſhall be, the glorifying of his owne, that in their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,

in the glorifying of his elect cheefly ſhall God be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And ſeeing the Lord, cheefly reſpects his owne glory, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

               <p>To goe forward in the words. <hi>When he ſhall come to be glorified
in his Saintes.</hi> That is to ſay, when he ſhall come, firſt, to glorifie
his Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo, conſequently, to glorify himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, he cannot
be glorifyed in his Saintes, except he glorifie them firſt. And
therefore, it muſt be vnderſtood, that he muſt glorifie them, that
in their glorie, he may be glorified. Now, marke. As the firſt
and cheefe end of the comming of the Lord to judgement ſhall
be the glorifying of his Saintes: So, the cheefe meane, whereby
the Lord ſhall be glorified ſhall not be the damnation of the
reprobate, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſhall be the lyfe and ſaluation of the godlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in the godly at that day ſhall be manifeſted to the whole
world, the goodneſſe of the Lord Ieſus, his mercy, his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
power: in one word, his Majeſtie and his glory, cheefly ſhal
be manifeſted in them. So, that, the whole world, when they ſee
them ſtand vp, as it were, in a ſhout ſhall cry, Glorie, glorie, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
be to the Lambe, that ſits on the Throne, when they ſhall ſee
the elect ſo ſhining in glorie, they ſhall bruſt forth, in crying,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16659:199"/>
glorie, glorie, glorie, and nothing ſhall be heard but glorie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
more. Theſe are the thinges, we ſhall once ſee and heare, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to our euerlaſting glorie, or to our euerlaſting deſtruction.
It is true, the Lord Ieſus that day ſhall be glorified alſo, in the
damnation of the reprobat, and that, in his juſtice. Ye read, in the
14. of Exod. <hi>I ſhal be glorified in Pharao and his armie,</hi> in powring
out a vengence on them, I ſhall drowne them. But, yet, the juſtice
God, the juſtice of Chriſt ſerues not ſo much to his glorie, as his
mercie does. And it is a greater matter, yea and more glorie ſhall
come to him by the ſauing of one ſoule at that day, nor by the
condemning of an hundreth. Came Chriſt Ieſus in the world,
for this end cheeflie, that, God ſhould be glorified in his juſtice?
No. Chriſt came and the Goſpell of mercy is giuen vs, that,
men and Angels in that day ſhould glorifie God, cheeflie in
his mercie.</p>
               <p>Now, to goe forward. <hi>And to be made marueilous in all them that
beleeue.</hi> This is, in effect that ſame, which he ſpok of before, euen,
the glorifying of God; for, it is one thing, the Lord to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
and to wonder at him. The meaning is, ſhortly. When he
ſhall come. Firſt, he ſhal make the faithful wonderful, in the ſight
of the world, and then, in their wonderfulnes, all the world ſhall
wonder at him, who hes made them wonderfull. Now, marke.
The Lord Ieſus, in <hi>Eſay 9.</hi> chap. 6. verſ. among all the names he
gets there, he is called <hi>the vvonderfull</hi> and the maruellous one.
Now, this name, in effect ſhal ſhow the ſelfcheefly in that day of
judgement: for, cheefly in that day Chriſt ſhall be wonderful,
and all the world ſhall wonder at him. It is but a litle wondring

crucified him ſhall wonder at that day. And in one word, there
ſhall be nothing in that day in Heauen and earth but a wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
at the Lord Ieſus Chriſt and his Saintes glorified. Ye ſee
here next the cheefe mean that ſhall make the Lord wonderful,
to be the wonderfulneſſe of the glorie of his Saintes and elect,
whom in that day he ſhall make wonderfull. The world ſhall
looke in and wonder at them, and then they ſhall looke to the
Iudge and wonder at him. Then in that day they who hes bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in Ieſus in this life (looke what faith brings with it) ſhall be
bleſſed and made glorious: For firſt theſe faithfull ſhall be made
ſo maruelous in glory that they ſhall aſtoniſh the whole world:
I tell thee more, when thou ſhalt be ſo tranſlated, when thy vyle
bodie ſhall be ſo changed, thou ſhalt wonder at thy ſelfe: for the
eare hath not heard, the eye hath not ſeene, &amp;c. that wonderfull
glorie which then thou ſhalt enjoy. As for the wicked of the
world the troublers and afflicters of the godly, when they ſhall
looke to any one of the glorious elect, they ſhall weepe and
wonder. This is ſet downe in the 5. chapter of the booke of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
albeit Apocrypha. Firſt they ſhall mourne and weepe,
when they ſhall ſee the glorie of the godly, and ſay, O we fooles
and ſenſles bodies, eſteemed we not the life of theſe godly in the
world a miſerable lyfe? Then they ſhall come on with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
How is this that this vyle bodie ſo ſhynes, and that he is
ſo exalted? So they ſhall both mourne at this ſight and wonder,
and vveeping and vvondering they ſhall count themſelues to
haue bene fooles and ſenſles bodies. The Lord giue vs grace to
ſeeke that true wiſdome in tyme. For certainly that true wiſdome
is eſteemed fooliſhneſſe in this world, and he that would be wiſe,
let him be a foole firſt, he ſhall neuer be counted wiſe that day,
except he haue bene a foole firſt, and humbled vnder this foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
preaching of the Goſpell. It is true, the condemnation of the
reprobate ſhall be a meane to make the world wonder, and to
make the Iudge wonderfull. O, the paines that ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on the reprobate ſhall be wonderfull, and they ſhall be
ſet vp as ſpectacles of ſhame at that day, and the godly ſhall
wonder at their ſhame and confuſion. O, wonderfull ſhall that
weightineſſe of judgement be! they ſhall wonder that euer there
ſhould be ſuch a wraith in God, they ſhall wonder that euer the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16659:200"/>
arme of God ſhould be ſo heauy vpon them. O, Hell is lighted
now (will they ſay) the wraith of God is lighted now! O, what
a maſſe and weight of wraith is this that we ſee now! Men will
now leape here and there, and make litle count of the weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Lords hand, and ſecurely contemne threatnings and
judgement; but in that day, to their euerlaſting woe they ſhall
finde it the heauieſt thing that euer was: for by the weight of it,
they ſhall be ſo preſſed downe that they ſhall neuer be able to
preaſe vp againe. Alas, what a dead ſenſleſneſſe is this of men in
this world that they regarde neither Heauen no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

theſe thinges.</p>
               <p>Now to goe forward. Who are theſe that ſhall be made won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull,
that in them the Lord Ieſus may be made wonderfull?
In one word, He calles them, <hi>beleeuers,</hi> a baſe and ſimple ſtyle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vs. He called them before Saintes, holy ones; and now he
commes to the ground of their holineſſe, and calles it faith. It
will not be a faire, honeſt, ciuile dealing with our neighbour that
will doe the turne, albeit many men thinks ſo. No, but faith in
Chriſt muſt be the ground; any man that in any meaſure hes had
a ſenſe and feeling of that lyfe, he will finde in his experience he
can not haue hope or aſſurance of lyfe in the faireſt outwarde
dealing that euer men did, except he finde his hart ſetled on
God, and his anchor caſten on Chriſt. This is the onely cauſe of
thy ſaluation, faith in Chriſt. As for all thy good workes, they
are onely effects and tokens that thou haſt that faith in Chriſt,
which will doe the turne, and is the onely cauſe of thy ſaluation.
O, bleſſed for euer is that hart that hes faith keeped, let neuer thy
remembrance be off it. What euer thou thinke, or ſpeake, keepe
it; haſt thou it? be aſſured of thy ſaluation; lackeſt thou it? doe
all thou can, thou ſhalt die. Seeke euer to haue Chriſt in thy hart,
And ſeeing, we who are now liuing may die in one moment,
Lord, if we ſhould not ſeeke earneſtly to haue Chriſt dwelling
in our harts! It is onely his merites that ſaues vs.</p>
               <p>In the next wordes he defines them that he calles beleeuers,
and pointing them out, he ſayes not, they that beleeues in Ieſus
Chriſt, but <hi>they vvho</hi> in this lyfe <hi>hes beleeued my teſtimony,</hi> the

Apoſtles and Paſtors. So, take vp the nature of this faith and be
not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>egyled with it. It is not faith in Chriſt barely, but faith in
Chriſt preached. By whom? by a ſelie bodie. What was <hi>Paul?</hi>
a ſelie bodie. So looke neuer for lyfe nor ſaluation in that great
day, except thou humble thy ſelfe vnder the fooliſhe preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as men thinkes it) and beleeue the fooliſhe teaching of
the Goſpell. Thou ſhalt neuer come to grace and ſaluation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thou humble thy ſelfe vnder this preaching, which thou,
by nature and in thy judgement, thinkes fooliſhe. If thou beleue
not in this, take thee this doome, neuer ſhalt thou be juſtified in
that great day.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the laſt words in the verſe. <hi>In that day.</hi> There
is an Emphaſis in this word, that day, the Lord ſhall be glorified
in the godly, in the glory of his owne, in that day. It is true, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
at this time, in this ſame moment, the Lord Ieſus is glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Saints and faithful hes their own glory. But the glory
of Ieſus and his Saintes is not in that fulneſſe which ſhall be at
that day. Thou ſeeſt him now, as it were, in a mirrour darklie,
he is comming behind thee, and thou art looking in a glas, but at
that day thou ſhalt ſee him face to face with theſe bodily eyes,
thou ſeeſt him now in glorie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in that day thou ſhalt ſee him
in a ſurpaſſing and exceeding great glorie. It is euen ſo with the
Saints. We are the Sonnes of God now, we are glorious now; but
in that day we ſhall haue another kinde of glorie. The Apoſtle
<hi>Iohn</hi> 1. Epiſtle. 13 chap. 2. verſe, ſayes, <hi>Dearly beloued, vve are the
Sonnes of God novv, but it appeares not vvhat vve ſhall be.</hi> The very
ſight of him ſhall tranſforme vs. So that day in the 2. chap. to the
Rom. 1. verſe, is called <hi>the day of manifeſtation,</hi> all things ſhall be
manifeſted. Glorie, righteouſnes, Heauen, Hel, and all hid now.
But in that day all ſhall be brought forth to that light, and be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted.
The Heauen ſhall be opened to ſee that glorie in it, the
Hell to ſee that darkneſſe and ſhame in it. The Sun ſhall ſhine
then moſt clearly, right ſhall then appeare right in the own gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of righteouſneſſe; wrong ſhall be ſeene to be wrong; ſinne
ſhall appeare in the own cullour, euerie one ſhall ſee it perfitely,
all things ſhall be maid manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Now, in the next verſe to the end of the chapter, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
to conquiſe to himſelfe the beneuolence and good lyking
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16659:201"/>
of the Theſſalonians (why ſhould not the teacher haue the good

is for their cauſe. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>vve alſo pray alvvaies for you,
that our God may make you vvorthy of this calling,</hi> &amp;c. Well this
ſets out this part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Miniſter, as he teaches life to the people,
So, let his prayer be euer to God, to helpe them forward to that
lyfe and glorie he ſpeakes of. This for his part. Then, ye ſee
againe,<note place="margin">Prayer a meane to lyfe.</note> among all the meanes of bringing men to lyfe, Prayer

I call it the meane, not the cauſe: for, thy ovvne prayer vvill

               <p>But to come to the matter of his praier. He ſaies, for this cauſe
we pray for you, <hi>That, God vvould make you vvorthy of his calling.</hi>
By this calling he meanes life euerlaſting, by the meane he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandes
the end: for, he takes not the word <hi>calling</hi> properly,
but he takes it for the end of our calling, which is life euerlaſting.
Then, ye ſee, he craues this life and glory at the handes of God.
Then,<note place="margin">Life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting the gift of God.</note> learn. This life euerlaſting is the onely gift of God, thou
haſt it not by nature in thy owne ſelfe, it muſt be giuen thee,

one, or, two meanes, whereby we muſt come to this life, ſet down

to it, albeit thou would reaue a kingdome here, by tirannie,
yet, thou ſhalt not come to this kingdome, except thou haue a
former calling to it. And when haſt thou this calling? When this
ſame word of the Goſpell ſoundes in thy eare,<note place="margin">

in it. If thou lay not to thy eare here, thou ſhalt neuer be called;
and lackeſt thou that calling by the word, thou ſhalt neuer get
life euerlaſting. Then, the other thing, I ſee here, that goes before
life and glorie, is a <hi>vvorthineſſe,</hi> a dignitie, ere thou enter in that
kingdome, thou muſt haue a worthineſſe. Who will chooſe a
man to an earthly kingdome without dignitie and worthines?
Therefore, he ſayes, <hi>that he vvould make you vvorthie.</hi> O, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
it is not my worthineſſe, nor thy worthineſſe, inherent
in me, or, thee. No, it is that worthineſſe of Chriſt Ieſus, that muſt
be imputed to vs. Chriſts worthineſſe muſt be imputed to vs,
and we clad with it. When ye heare this word worthines in the
Scripture, take it neuer to be an inherent worthineſſe in thee, or,
in me, but the worthineſſe of that onely worthie one, Chriſt the
Lord, made ours, by faith.</p>
               <p>Then to the words following. He pointes out more clearelie
this lyfe euerlaſting, and ſayes, <hi>That he vvould fulfill all his good
pleaſure.</hi> Which good pleaſure? Which commes of his gentlenes
<hi>and goodneſſe.</hi> Then he addes. And that he would fulfill. What?
<hi>a vvorke.</hi> Whereof? <hi>of faith.</hi> After what maner? <hi>vvith povver</hi> and
might. Then there muſt be a power, or, elſe, faith will not be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.
Now to returne to euery word. <hi>That he vvould fulfill</hi>
Marke then. Lyfe euerlaſting, glorie euerlaſting is the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of a thing begun, of the decree going before, of lyfe
euerlaſting. Firſt, there muſt be an entrie to it, there muſt be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

going before, and then, life euerlaſting commes on, as
fulfilling of the thing going before. What is the thing that goes
before? It is his <hi>good pleaſure.</hi> By his good pleaſure is vnderſtood
the decree of lyfe, that was giuen out from all eternitie, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his owne. So, lyfe euerlaſting is but the accompliſhment of
a decree, that was made in that glorious kingdome of Heauen
before the world was made. Thy life beginnes at a decree that
neuer had a beginning and ends in a glorie that neuer ſhall haue
an end. He calles it not ſimplie a good pleaſure, but <hi>all</hi> his good

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16659:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with the decree of lyfe, all the meanes that ſerues to bring vs to
lyfe. There is not one meane to lyfe but all muſt come of this
decree. Art thou called in tyme? it commes of a decree. Rom 8.
28. Art thou juſtified? it commes of a decree? Prayeſt thou? it
commes of a decree. Nothing commes to thee in the mid-way
of thy journey, but all commes of a decree. What euer commes,

to bring thee to lyfe euerlaſting. 1. Pet. 2. 21. So, lyfe
euerlaſting proceeds of a decree from all eternitie. He calles it

forward in that worke and come to the end. It is ſaid Phill. 3.
chap. 21. verſe, When the Lord ſhall come, <hi>this vyle body ſhall be
tranſformed and made lyke that glorious body of Chriſt.</hi> What is the
meane? <hi>Throgh the effectualneſſe of his povver, vvhereby he is able to
ſubdevv all things,</hi> the deuill, ſin and death that would hold thee
aback from that glorie. There muſt be power in the Lord, to kil
ſin, Hell, and to ouercome the deuill and all thy enemies. And
the Lord by his power muſt giue thee power ouer all, before
thou be made conforme to him.</p>
               <p>Now, to come to the laſt verſe. He ſets downe the laſt end of
his praying. <hi>That the name of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt may be glorified
in you, and ye in him.</hi> Then, the cheefe reſpect he hes, in praying, is,
not their glory, but, Gods<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> glory. Howbeit he would haue the
Theſſalonians to be ſaued, yet, that is not his laſt end, but, al their
ſaluation is, that, God may be glorified in them. The end of his
praying is, that, God may be glorified in them; becauſe our glory
ſhould rend to the glory of God. Now, mark one rule in praying.
When we pray for life, either to our ſelues, or, to others, let not
our mindes be ſo much ſet on our and their glorie and ſaluation,
as,<note place="margin">Gods' gglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cheefly to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred, in our praier.</note> that, the God of glory may be glorified, and ſay, Lord, I ſeeke
glory and ſaluation, that in my glorifying and ſaluation, thou
mayeſt be glorified; and ſo, let euer that glory of God be more
pretious and deare to vs, nor all the glorie and life can come to
vs. And they that gets grace to pray this waies, they may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
they ſhall be glorified for euer. So, renounce all, Heauen it
ſelf, our joy, our glory, and our inheritance in Heauen, to the end,
that, he, to whom all glory pertaines may be glorified. This did
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> they craued to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>athema, that, God might be
glorified. And this ſhould be the deſire of euery man, ſeeke, if it
were thy owne condemnation, rather, ere God, who created thee
be not glorified; prefer Gods glory to thy owne ſaluation. Lord
giue vs this zeale to his glorie. What ſhall the end be? Troweſt
thou to loſe any thing by ſo doing. No, looke what God ſaies to
<hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 32. chap. 33. verſe, when <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to be ſcraped
out of the booke of life. No, the Lord ſayes, <hi>Moſes,</hi> thou, who ſo
earneſtly deſired my glory, I will glorifie thee, and will ſcrape
them out, that deſerues to be ſcraped out. Then, the way, to come
to life eternall, is, to renounce thy ſelf, to ſeek onely, that, thy God
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16659:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may be glorified. O, the joy, that is in the hart, when we find that
zeale, that we can prefer Gods glory, to our own ſaluation. That
joy ſurpaſſes all joy, that euer was.</p>
               <p>He addes to another thing, to this, He ſaies, <hi>That he may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in you and ye in him.</hi> Learne, there is no peece of glorie, that,
Chriſt gets, but it redounds to his elect. Is he glorified in thee?
that ſame glory commes back againe to thee and glorifies thee.
I ſhall tell you how it ſtands. Firſt, thy lyfe and glory, that ye call
euerlaſting lyfe, is nothing but, a faire glance, that ſtrikes from
the glorious face of Ieſus Chriſt as ye ſee the Sunne ſhining on
a man, makes him to ſhine: So, thy glory and lyfe is as a verie
glance,<note place="margin">

                  </note> that ſtrikes from the glorious countenance of Chriſt, as
the glance of the Sun ſtriking on a black body makes that body

on thee, make thee to ſhine. What was the ſhining of the
face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that made the people afraied, but, a glance of the
face of God. Then, when the glory of God hes firſt ſhined on
vs, we ſhine; and then, our ſhining again with a reflex goes back
to that Son of righteouſneſſe, it came from, and he of new ſhine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </note> Chriſt is both the beginning and the ending:
the ſhining begins at him and ends at him. And therefore, it is
ſaid Rom. 11. chap. 36. verſe, <hi>For, of him, and throgh him, and for him,
are all things: to him be glory for euer.</hi> Now, what ſhall be the
cauſe of this glorie of ours? He ſets it downe in theſe words, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the grace of our God and of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Grace is
the cauſe of our ſhining. Grace from the Father, grace from the
Sonne. Then, there is nothing, but grace, there ſhall be nothing,
but, grace in Heauen, grace in earth; no merite in this earth, no
merite in Heauen: No merite in this earth, but, Ieſus merite, no
merite in Heauen, but, onely grace, grace and mercy in earth: all
ſtanding here and in Heauen is only by grace. And ſo, the cauſe
of our euerlaſting ſtanding is euerlaſting grace, the onely grace
of God, in Chriſt. To whom, with the Father and the holy Spirit,
be all glory for euer.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the chapter preceding ye haue heard,
brethren, firſt of the ſaluation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
wherein he wiſhes to the Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians
grace, from God the Father, and
from the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Then we
came to his preface, wherein he rejoices
and giues thanks to God, for the increaſe
of grace, of faith, of loue they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
And thirdly, we came to that conſolation, that he miniſters
to them againſt the affliction and trouble vnder the which they
lay for the faith of Chriſt. Now to come to this chapter. In it the
Apoſtle firſt admoniſhes the Theſſalonians that they giue not
eare to deceiuers and falſe teachers, who would perſwade them
that the comming of the Lord Ieſus was at hand, and thereafter
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e enters in a refutation of this pointe of falſe doctrine and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.
Now to make this more plaine. The occaſion (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares)
of that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the Apoſtle wrytes in this chapter is this,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16659:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>
In his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt Epiſtle written to them and fourth chapter thereof
he ſpoke concerning the ſecond comming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Lord Ieſus,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>
                  </note>
and beſide other thinges, as we may read there, he ſpecifies theſe
wordes, <hi>We,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>vvhich liue and are remaining in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Lord ſhall be caught vp in the cloudes vvith them vvho
are departed</hi> this lyfe after their reſurrection. The Theſſalonians
reading this, incontinent concludes, Chriſt ſhall come ere euer

them who are departed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now in this meane-tyme the deuill
is buſie to confirme them in this error, and therefore he raiſes
vp deceyuers and falſe teachers that went about to perſwade
them of the trueth of this, as though it had beene true, that they
ſhould be liuing at the Lords comming. Theſe falſe teachers
alledged for them partlie the reuelation of the Spirite of God,
partlie a tradition of <hi>Paul,</hi> which both were falſe. Therefore,
the Apoſtle vnderſtanding this, tooke occaſion to vvryte this
Epiſtle, and eſpeciallie, this ſecond chapter, wherein he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
or rather effectuouſlie requeſtes them, that they ſuffered
not themſelues to be deceiued, as though the comming of the
Lord were at hand, and thereafter falles out in a refutation of
this error.</p>
               <p>To returne to the wordes. In the wordes we haue read in
the firſt verſe we haue the earneſt requeſt of the Apoſtle, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with an obteſtation adjuring them with all grauitie, by
the comming of the Lord Ieſus, by the aſſembling of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to him at his comming, that they ſhould not ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
ſo to be deceyued, as though the comming of the Lord
were at hand. Now to inſiſt in this firſt verſe, <hi>Novv vve beſeech
you</hi> ſayes he, <hi>by the comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and by our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
vnto him.</hi> The words bears a great obteſtation, wherein
he ſtraites them vnder the paine of lyfe and death, that, as euer
they wold look to haue joy in Chriſts comming and to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat
with his glory, they ſhold not ſuffer themſelues to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> brethren, ye ſee in requeſting and that in lenity, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
and adjures them in grauity and in ſome ſeuerity. He joines
and tempers two contrare things together, ſweetneſſe and lenity
on the one part, ſowrenes and ſeuerity on the other part Firſt, he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16659:205"/>
dravves them on and intreates them vvillinglie to obey that
vvhich he requyres of them; and then againe in a maner vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentlie
he pulles them. He both leades and dravves. Requeſting

as it vvere, violentlie. Commonlie ye ſhall finde he vſes this
forme of requeſting. In the 2. Epiſt. to the Cor. 10. chap. 1. verſe,

thinges heere vvhereby he adjures them to obey his requeſt.
The firſt is the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ing of Chriſt. The ſecond is our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

Lord Ieſus will come, and when he commes that we ſhall aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vnto him: for all obteſtations are made by things, which are
counted vndoubted trueths. The things whereby any man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures
and obteſts another man ſhould be ſure grounds. Now the
Apoſtle obteſts them by theſe two things. Therefore we ſhould

ſhall aſſemble vnto him. Yet compare theſe two together, the
firſt is the cauſe, his comming; the ſecond is the effect. our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
vnto him. The comming of the Lord ſhall be found effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
in that day to our recollection, to the gathering and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of the whole elect vnto him. The preſence and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Chriſt is euer effectuall to the meeting of the Saintes,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16659:205"/>
where he is, there muſt be a meeting, he cannot be his alone. In
the 24. of <hi>Matthevv</hi> 28. verſe. Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Where the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>on is,
the ther vvill the Egles reſort.</hi> So where Chriſt is, there ſhall the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
reſort. He came no ſooner in the world but ſome elect both
Iew and Gentile reſorted to him, ſo that there was not a Church
raiſed vp: But at ſecond comming there ſhall be another kinde
of aſſemblie. At that tyme all the elect from the foure quarters
of the earth ſhall be gathered, and neuer one ſhall be miſſed, all
ſhall be in that generall aſſemblie, when the Lord ſhall come in
that glorious day, and that aſſembly ſhall be through the power
and effectualnes of Chriſt. At his comming there ſhall come a
ſweet ſmell from him that ſhall draw all the elect that euer was
together vnto him.</p>
               <p>Yet to inſiſt. Theſe tvvo thinges are joyned together vvith
great diſcretion: He ſayes not onely by the comming of the
Lord, but alſo by our aſſembling vnto him: For if he had ſaid,
by the comming of the Lord onely, it had beene a great motiue
to haue terrified vs: For the ſpeaking of Chriſts comming with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any further conſideration and mention of our lyfe and our
aſſembling vnto him would rather terrifie thee nor comforte
thee. Therefore the vvicked deſires neuer to heare of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:
for vvhen their conſciences are vvakned they are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.
But when the godly heares that Chriſt ſhall come, and
that men ſhall be conjoyned to him and be partakers of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and that he ſhall not be glorified without them, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they neuer heare it without joy. Therefore if euer thou
would finde comfort at Chriſts comming, looke that thou finde
an aſſurance in thy hart that thou ſhalt be made partaker of his
glory at his comming Further marke in this obteſtation. This
vndoubted certainty of Chriſtes comming, and our aſſembling
vnto him, binds and obliſes euery one of vs to beleue the trueth
of the doctrine concerning his comming, and to ſlee and eſchew
all falſe doctrine thereof. As namely this pointe of falſe doctrine
that ſtands in limitating and bounding his comming at a certaine
tyme, as they would ſay, He will come in ſuch an age, in ſuch a
yeere, ſuch a day, an houre, all is falſe doctrine. So I ſay the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
of his comming, and the glorie vve ſhall receyue at his
comming bindes vs that vve beleeue nothing but the trueth:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16659:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in ſuch ſort, that, if we will beleue the trueth of his comming, we
ſhall be partakers of his glorie at his comming. If we decline any
thing from the trueth of the doctrine of his comming, we ſhall
hazard the glory, which othervvayes we ſhould haue. This
which I ſet downe vnto you in particulare concerning one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of our faith, is true in all the reſt: For, there is not one bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God in Chriſt, but it obliſes vs to beleue the true doctrine,
concerning that bleſſing, in ſuch ſort, that, if we will beleeue the
truth concerning that bleſſing, we ſhall be partakers of that
bleſſing, and if we beleue not the trueth ſpoken, concerning that
bleſſing, we depryue our ſelues of that bleſſing. To make it
plaine. The benefite of juſtification, whereby we are juſtified
before God, onely by the bloude of Chriſt and his merite, and
not by the merites of men, bindes vs to beleue the trueth of it,
in ſuch ſort, that, if we will beleeue and ſeeke juſtification in the
bloud and merites of Chriſt onely, we ſhall be juſtified. If, againe,
we refuſe to vnderſtand the true way of our juſtification and
repoſe on our vvorkes, vve hazard our juſtification. In the 9.
chapter, to the Romans, verſ. 31. 32. we reade, the Iewes ſoght
to be juſtified by the workes of the Law. (So does the Papiſts,
by their merites) But, vvhat came of it? The Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>They
attamed not to it.</hi> And why? <hi>Becauſe they ſought it not by faith,
but, by the vvorkes of the Lavv.</hi> Ye ſee, heere, that peruerſe and
falſe opinion, which the Iewes had, concerning mans juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
made them, not to attaine to juſtification. No more ſhalt
thou be juſtified, who will be juſtified by thy vaine workes. The
Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaies <hi>(Eſay 64. 6) all our righteouſneſſe is lyke a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous
clout,</hi> ſcarcely to be looked on, let be to be preſented as a
meane, whereby to be juſtified by God; if thou wilt ſeeke to be
juſtified by thy works, I denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to thee, in the name of God, that,
at that great day, thou ſhalt finde thy ſelf not to be juſtified. The
Lord giue vs grace to imbrace the trueth, and the onely way of
juſtification and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>In the next verſe, he commes to the thing be requeſted them,
not to doe. It is this, that, they ſhould not ſuffer themſelues to
be deceyued, as if Chriſtes comming vvere at hand. Novv, for
the better vnderſtanding heereof, I ſhall take vp this ſecond
verſe, in theſe three pointes. Firſt, vve haue that thing, which he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16659:206"/>
requeſts them not to doe. To wit, <hi>That they be not ſuddenly moued
in their mynde,</hi> and be not ſuddenly troubled; in one word, that
they ſuffer not themſelues to be deceyued. Then we haue the
means (which are thre in number) by the which the falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
vſed to deceyue them. The firſt is by reuelation pretending
falſlie the reuelation of <hi>the spirit.</hi> The ſecond is <hi>by vvord</hi> or tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
The third is, <hi>by letter, as it vver from him.</hi> In the third place he
ſets down the Hereſie which falſe teachers labored to perſwad
them to be true, to witte, that the day of the Lord was at hand.
Now to come back to the words. In the beginning of the verſe
he ſayes, <hi>I requeſt you, that ſuddenly ye be not moued.</hi> Conſider the
words, and then he ſubjoynes <hi>nor yet troubled.</hi> The firſt of theſe
two reſpects the mynde, next the hart, mouing from the mynde
reſpects the mynde, trouble reſpects the hart: for, the hart and
the affections are ſuddenly troubled. Now by the mynde I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
not euery minde: for, euerie man hes a minde, an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike
hes a minde, an Idolater a minde, but, I vnderſtand, heere, a
ſound minde and rightly informed, and ſpeciallie in this pointe
of doctrine concerning Chriſts comming: A minde that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,
not with the light of nature onely, but alſo, with the
ſpirituall light of faith in Chriſt. Now he requeſts them, that,
they be not moued, as it were, a jaw of the ſea (for, the word is
borrowed) And moued, to what thing? If the mouing be from
a ſound minde, and informed by the light of Chriſt, it muſt be to
a minde that is without faith in Chriſt, a minde peruerſlie inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
without the light of God. The maner, is <hi>ſuddenly.</hi> It is ſhame
to be moued from that which is good, but it is a greater ſhame
ſuddenly, as it were, with euerie light winde to be caried away.
Thefore, the Apoſtle marueiles, that the Galathians was ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlie
caried away to another Goſpell. Galat. chap. 1. verſe 6.
Now to come to the leſſon. Who is the man that is in his right
minde? Who is he that is in his witte? Is euery man in his wit?
No. Onely that man is in his wit, whoſe mynde is inlightned
by the ſupernaturall light of the faith of Ieſus Chriſt. Onely the
beleuer is in his right wit. Who is the man that is by his mynde
and is mad? Tharman (albeit otherwaies he had all the wit of
the world in his head) that wants this light of faith in Chriſt, is
madde, and the end ſhall kythe, and declare it, and the vviſer in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16659:207"/>
worldlie thinges; if he be without this ſupernaturall wit he it

                  </note> This then muſt followe. By nature we are all
borne mad and by our myndes, mad fooliſhe, witleſſe, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
borne. Therefore, the Apoſtle, to <hi>Titus</hi> chap. 3. verſ. 3. ſaies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>We alſo,</hi> lewes, aſwell as the Gentiles, <hi>vvere vnvvyſe, madde and by
our myndes,</hi> meaning, that, without Chriſt we are all mad fooles.
Brethren, there are two ſorts of this ſpirituall madneſſe, one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
common to all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> all are euer madde, till
they know Chriſt, euer continuing in madneſſe, till they beeleue
in Chriſt. The other ſort of madneſſe is, that is acquyred by the
defection and falling away from the knowledge of Chriſt, euery
Apoſtate is mad, euery one that hes known the trueth and falles
therefrom, becommes mad. Of this madneſſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks Gal. 3
chap. 1. verſe, <hi>O fooliſh Galathians, &amp;c.</hi> Now if ye will compare
theſe two madnes the one naturall, the other by defection. The
ſecond is more dangerous, nor the firſt. Madnes that commes by
Apoſtaſie, of all other is the moſt dangerous madnes: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Peter</hi> 2. Epiſtle chap. 2. verſe. 20. ſayes, <hi>The latter condition is
vverſe, nor the former.</hi> Madnes that commes of the defection from
the knowne trueth is worſe, nor the madneſſe we had before we
knew Chriſt. And ſo he ſubjoynes, <hi>It had bene better, neuer to haue
knovvne the vvay of Christ, nor, after knovvledge, to haue fallen back
againe.</hi> It is better to a man euer to haue bidden in the naturall
madnes, nor once to haue bene wiſe and inlightned and then, to
haue made defection. There is a recouerie after the firſt madnes,
but, after the ſecond, it is verie hard to get recouerie. An apoſtate
hardly recouers, but, oft, the Apoſtate will fall to blaſphemie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the holy Spirit. Therefore, let euery one ſtriue by al means
to keepe the trueth.</p>
               <p>Now the next thing he requeſtes, is that they be <hi>not troubled.</hi>
The vvord is borrovved, and in the ovvne language it ſignifies
that horror that ryſes in the hart of man, through the clamor,
or noyſe of any tumult. Ye ſee, men will be afrayed, when they
heare any tumulte. So vvere the Theſſalonians afrayed, vvhen
they heard, that, Chriſtes comming vvas at hand. Novv vvill
ye compare this terrour vvith the mouing out of the mynde,
it follovves verie vvell: For, the man vvho hes his mynde euill
informed, and not inlightned by the faith of Chriſt can haue no
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16659:207"/>
reſt and peace in hart. For ye ſee a madde man hes neuer quy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe
in his hart, but his affections are euer in trouble. So a man
ſpiritually madde without the light of Chriſt and ſaluation is
neuer ſetled in his hart. An Idolater is neuer ſetled in hart, an
Herotike hes neuer a ſetled hart, euer his affectiones on feare.
Therefore he who would haue that peace and joy that paſſes
all vnderſtanding, let him ſeeke light to knowe Chriſt, and to
know the trueth concerning him, otherwaies ſhall he neuer get
peace and joy. Then in one word I aske the queſtion. Who is he
that is happie? Who is he that hes a ſtable and ſetled hart? Who
is he that hes peace in his affectiones, and hes them ſet in order,
ſo that he may take reſt both day and night? I anſwere. The
faithfull who beleeues the trueth in Chriſt. This man is bleſſed
<hi>being iuſtified by faith vve haue peace tovvards God,</hi> ſayes the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.
Rom. chap. 5. verſe 1. If thou be not juſtified by faith in
Chriſt no peace, but euer trouble and vnquyetneſſe both with
thy ſelfe and vvith God. God ſhall make one affection to
fight with another, and to harle thee before his fearefull tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
Then who is he that hes not a ſtable and ſetled hart? Who
is he that hes not his affections ſetled? He that beleeues not in
Chriſt, he that beleeues not in the trueth of God in Chriſt, he that
knowes not the way of ſaluation, he hes not a ſetled hart. It is
truely ſaid <hi>Eſ. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> cha. 57, verſe 21. <hi>No true peace for the vvicked:</hi> for
they haue vnſtable harts; and when thou ſeeſt the jawing and
mouing of the raging ſea, thou may ſay, this is nothing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the trouble that the vvicked hes in conſcience: for the
trouble of the hart and vnquyetneſſe in the affectiones, of all
troubles is the greateſt; and ſurelie he vvho hes not the peace
of God, but is troubled in hart, vvould gladlie be turned in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing. When it pleaſes the Lord to make one affection riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
another, ô vvhat paine trovveſt thou that perſon ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaines?
And againe, ô hovv prerious a thing is faith in Ieſus!
Haſt thou it? nothing ſhall trouble thee. So preaſe euer to haue
faith in Chriſt: Haſt thou faith? thou ſhalt in joy peace and a
quyet minde: What euer be thy eſtate in the world, be thou rich,
both on poore, haſt thou faith in Ieſus Chriſt, thou reſts by day
and night, nothing troubles thee: yea euen in theſe things, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

               <p>Now in the ſecond part of the verſe we haue the meanes ſet
downe which the deceiuers vſed to deceiue the Theſſalonians
with concerning Chriſts comming.<note place="margin">

by spirit,</hi> that is to ſay, by dreames which men pretended to be
reuelations of the Spirit. The next is, <hi>neither by vvord,</hi> that is by
any tradition that they ſaid they had of <hi>Paul.</hi> The third is, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by forged wryting or <hi>Epistle,</hi> as if they had any which <hi>Paul</hi>
had written to them concerning Chriſts comming Now what
are the thinges that cheefly euer from the beginnig hes made
men madde, and hes troubled the harts of the people and the
Church of God? Euen theſe ſame three things. In all ages men
hes riſen vp that hes ſaid, We haue receiued reuelation extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinar
from the Spirit of God. Such as of olde were the Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
and Montaniſts, ſuch are the Anabaptiſts this day, ſuch are
many Papiſts, and Monkes in their cloſters. When they dreame
they pretend the reuelation of the Spirit; yea ſome of them hes
pretended a reuelation to ſlay kings. O but it is a falſe reuelation,
and it is not from Gods, Spirit, but from the Spirit of the deuill.
This is the firſt meane of deceyuing. The next which hes euer
troubled the world and broght men to madneſſe is. Traditions,
which the Papiſts extols ſo highly that they make them equall
with the holy writ. The laſt that hes made men madde is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
that hes bene ſtolne in into the Church of God vnder the
name of holineſſe, and yet written by wicked and profaine men.
Such as were the Goſpels of <hi>Thomas, Barthelmevv,</hi> and <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
and the Papiſts are full of ſuch writtes bearing the names
of men that neuer ſaw ſuch paltrie. So theſe three thinges hes
made and makes men madde. Now as theſe three makes men
madde, ſo there is one thing that keepes men in their myndes,
that is onely the Canonicall Scripture of the Olde and New
Teſtament, the writings of the Prophites and Apoſtles. Keepe
me the Scripture, hold by it onely, thou ſhalt be keeped in thy
right minde, and thou ſhalt haue an ſetled hart. Trow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no ſpirits, that is falſe reuelation of Spirits. Trow nothing
but that which is reueiled in the word: for I lay thee this as a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16659:208"/>
ſure ground. The Spirit of God will neuer reueale nor ſpeake
to thee any thing but that which is written in the olde and nevv
Teſtament. If any will come with a reuelation, aske at him, is
that conteined in the Scripture? Is it reueiled in the word? Trow
not theſe traditions and theſe vnwritten verities that is aſcry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to the Apoſtles: for vvith theſe the vvorld is deceyued.
Trow nothing but that which is in the word or may ſtand with
the word. And laſt, as for writtes, beleeue no writ but this writ
which is conteined in the olde and new Teſtament, and ſuch as
godlie men hes ſet dovvne agreeing vvith the olde and new
Teſtament. Keepe this ground of the Canonicall Scripture. I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thee, thou ſhalt be keeped in thy minde, and ſhall be reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
ſo till the glorious comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In the laſt parte of the verſe. The Hereſie is ſet downe, <hi>as
though,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>he day of Christs comming vver at hand</hi> Brethren,
it was an Hereſie to ſay the comming of Chriſt was at hand. Ye
will wonder at thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Sayes not <hi>Iames</hi> in his Epiſtle 5. chap. 8. verſe
<hi>The comming of the Lord dravves neare.</hi> Sayes not <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt
Epiſtle chap. 4. verſe 5. <hi>Christ is ready to iudge the quick and the
dead,</hi> and thereafter ſayes he not. <hi>The end of all thinges is at hand</hi>
and are not theſe dayes called the laſt dayes? Is not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turefull
of this? and ſo is not the day of the Lord neare hand?
How count ye it an Hereſie then to ſay, The day of the Lord is
at hand? I anſwere. There is a great difference betweene theſe
two: for theſe men who ſaid the day of the Lord was inſtant
preſcryued a certaine and definite tyme to his comming, at the
leaſt they thought that Chriſt ſhould come in that age and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
wherein they were, and ſo they bounded Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
till a certaine tyme. To ſay he will come in this yeere or
that yeere, in this age or that age it is Hereſie. Theſe men went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to perſwade the Theſſalonians that the Lord Ieſus ſhould
come in that age, which was falſe and pernitions; and that it was
falſe experience teaches vs. There are paſt ſince that tyme ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene
ages that is ſixteene hundreth yeere, and yet they ſaid then
that the Lord ſhould come in that age. Againe it is pernitious
and euill to limitate and bound Chriſts comming; for if his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
be not in that age which they calculate, it will fall out, thât,
either the godly that would faine haue his comming (for, they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16659:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſooke euer for it) will faint and fall away through impatience, or
elſe it will make the people to think that this doctrine of Chriſts
comming is but a fable. They will ſay, the tyme of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
which they ſaid was is by paſt and he is not come. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beware to preſcryue to it a particulare tyme. Now I marke
two pernitious Hereſies in the new Teſtament concerning his
comming. One that preſcryued a tyme, and ſaid, Chriſt ſhall
come ſhortly, in ſuch an age, in ſuch a yeere, as in this place: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
that ſaid he ſhall neuer come. 2. <hi>Peter</hi> chap. 3. verſ. 3. 4.
Let vs preaſe therefore to holde vs by the trueth, and keepe vs
from theſe extremities that the deuill preaſes to draw vs to.</p>
               <p>Now in the next verſe and in the beginning thereof he repeats
againe his requeſt and that in few wordes. <hi>Let no man deceiue you
by any meanes.</hi> It is the ſame thing which he ſaid before, but it is
contracted in fewer words. Now what needs this repetition and
doubling ouer? was it not eneugh to him to haue ſaid once be
not deceyued? Brethren, men can neuer beware eneugh of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers
and falſe teachers, and therefore the watch-men can neuer
ouer earneſtly and oft eneugh warne them to beware of them.
And if I ſhould ſtand vp from morne till night, crying, keepe
you from deceyuers, it will not be ſufficient; I ſpeak not ſo oft as
need craues. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Philip chap. 3. verſe 1. ſaies; <hi>It greenetly

and then he ſubjoins. <hi>Bevvare of dogs, bevvare of euill vvorkers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvare
of the conciſion.</hi> So I ſay, we can neuer be earneſt eneugh in
warning you to beware of falſe teachers, and namelie to beware
of Papiſts: for experience might haue teached vs within theſe
few dayes what neede we haue to warne you to beware of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie.
Now he ſayes, <hi>Let no man deceiue you,</hi> that is, be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
with any man without exception of perſon, in matters of
Religion beleeue no man for his ranke. Brethren, experience
teaches this daily. The perſons and authority of men deceiues
many ſimple men. The eſtimation of learning and dignitie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues
many. The Apoſtle knew this, and therefore he ſayes, <hi>Let
no man;</hi> and againe he ſayes, <hi>he no meanes,</hi> neither by this meane,
nor that meane: as he excludes all perſons, ſo he excludes all the
waies of deceit. The waies of the deuill that he ſuggyres to falſe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eachers to deceiue men by, are infinite. There is no end of his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16659:209"/>
waies. Hes he ſet one way? failles that way? he hes another way.
If that failles too, he hes another, and ſo forth without end. So in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
are his waies to deceiue the godlie. Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
knowing that the deuill hes many wayes to deceiue them,
forbids them to beleeue any of his meanes. Now the argument
whereby he deceiues them, is, all is deceite. What euer be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
what euer be the way, all is deceite. Therefore be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
There is ſuch a great loſe and domage in this one thing we
call deceite that there is no other thing that will vpſet it. The
loſe thou getſt by deceite will neuer be vpſet: all the kings
and doctors vnder Heauen will neuer ſet vp thy loſe thou getſt
by defection. Alas, what hes that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the world and loſt his ſoule by falling away from the trueth.
Now the Lord let euery man ſee that there is nothing compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to this hurt of deceiuing. What pleaſure can thou haue of all
the kingdomes of the world when thou haſt a troubled hart and
conſcience, when thou haſt an vnquyet ſoule within thee? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as we ſay, It is good to ſleepe in a ſound skinne. Change not
a ſetled minde and pacified hart with all the world, and preferre
a ſound minde inlightned with the knowledge of Chriſt to all
the honours and dignity in the world. And becauſe we are ſo
vnſtable mynded and ſo ready to alter that except we be ſurely
anchored on Chriſt we ſhall be euer beatten away with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
light wind of falſe doctrine. Therefore we haue
to pray that our ſoules may be anchored by a
ſure faith on Chriſt. The Lord therefore by
his grace anchor our ſoules on Chriſt.

heard the requeſt the Apoſtle makes in
the beginning of this ſecond chapter to
the Theſſalonians. He requeſts and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures
them by the comming of the Lord
Ieſus, and by our aſſembling vnto him
at his comming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they ſuffer not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to bee deceyued, or put by their
mindes, troubled in hart and affection, eſpecially in this head of
doctrine that concernes the comming of the Lord in the latter
day, and that they ſhould not be deceiued by falſe teachers who
we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about to deceiue them in this point, teaching that the day of
the Lord is at hand, he ſhall come incontinent, ye ſhall be found
aliue when he ſhall come. This age and generation ſhall not be
paſt when he ſhall come. This pointe of falſe doctrine that theſe
falſe teachers went about to perſwade the Theſſalonians, and
ſo to vnqiuet them, held them ay in vexation of ſprit and minde,
looking ay for Chriſts comming, aſſuring them that he ſhould
come ere that preſentage ſhould end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:16659:210"/>
Now in this text the Apoſtle enters to a refutation of that
falſe doctrine, and he proues that the day of the Lord was not
inſtant, that the day of the Lord would not beat ſuch a tyme,
that it ſhould not fall out in that preſent age. Now marke his
reaſons. If the day of the Lord were inſtant then there ſhould
not bee an vniuerſall Apoſtaſie and defection from the faith
of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, before the day and comming of the
Lord:<note place="margin">Vniuerſal defection must goe before the Lords co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> For, vvhy? This Apoſtaſie muſt craue a large ſpace
of tyme. Then, he ſubjoines, but, ſo it is, before that day ſhall
come, there ſhall be an vniuerſall Apoſtaſie and defection from
the faith and trueth of Chriſt Ieſus. And ſo, hee concludes.
Therefore, it is not ſo, as they ſay: The day of the Lord is not
inſtant and is not ſo neere hand, as they goe about to perſwade
you. Marke his reaſon. The propoſition and firſt part of the
argument is not expreſſed in the text. The next parte, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
is ſette dovvne in the text, to witte, The day of the
Lord ſhall not bee, before that an vniuerſall defection be firſt.
Now, before I come to the wordes, take vp ſhortlie this one
thing. The Theſſalonians, to whom he wrytes being deceiued,
thought, that, incontinent Chriſt ſhould come, and that they
ſhould be reſt to the Heauen with him, and glorified from hand.
The Apoſtle, to put them out of this conſaite, tels them, ere they
and the Church be reſt vp to Heauen and glorified there, that,
they ſhall ſuffer yet on the earth ſome trouble, there ſhall be yet
a great alteration and vexation in the Church of God. Brethren,
mark it. The battell muſt goe before the victory, let none looke
for the victory before he fight, thou wilt not come ſleeping to

This is that, which the Apoſtle teaches the Theſſalonians.</p>
               <p>Novv, to come to the vvordes of the text, and to make this
matter plaine, we ſhall inſiſt particularlie on euery word, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vp the meaning of Gods Spirite heere. And firſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>here
occurres this vvord <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> which muſt be before the day
of the Lordes comming. This Apoſtaſie is nothing, but, a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
avvay, a flyding aback. This Apoſtaſie is not a particulare
Apoſtaſie, or, defection of this man, or, that man onely, of any
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16659:211"/>
one perſon, or any two or three perſons onely. But it is an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal
defection of multitudes of men and wemen in this world.
For the word ye ſee is generallie ſet downe in the text to be a
departure without any reſtriction. It is not ſaid a departing of
this man or that man, but generallie a departing. Therefore the
Apoſtle muſt meane of a departing and falling away of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
and great multitudes. Now all the queſtion is, what Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie
meanes the Apoſtle of? I am not ignorant how a great
number of the olde Latine fathers in the Church, vnderſtandes
this Apoſtaſie to be meant of the defection of many Nations
from the Empyre of Rome. It is true indeede the Nations of the
world fell away from the Romane Empyre: But how well and
rightly they vnderſtood this Apoſtaſie of that falling away from
the Romane Empyre God knowes. And it is a wonder that ſo
many learned and quick ſpirited men ſhould haue erred toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this pointe ſo long: Indeede it is likly that when one of
them fel in this error all the reſt followed on in troupes without
further diſcretion or judgement. But I leaue them. What Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
is this then that the Apoſtle meanes of heere? I ſhall tell you.
It is an vniuerſall defection, not from an Emperour or earthly
King, but from the King of Heauen Ieſus Chriſt, and from his
faith. This agrees with the courſe of this text and with that
which followes immediatly of the Antichriſt the head of this
Apoſtaſie. This agrees with the ſpeaking of this ſame Apoſtle
in ſundry other places. In the 1. Tim. chap. 4. verſe 1. he foretels
of this vniuerſall defection from the faith. The wordes are, <hi>The
spirit ſpeakes euidently that in the latter dayes ſome ſhall depart from
the faith, and ſhall giue heed to ſpirits of error and doctrine of deuils,
forbidding to marie, and commanding to abſteine from meats vvhich
the Lord his ordained to be receiued vvith thankeſ-giuing of them
vvhich beleeue.</hi> There the ſumme of this defection whereof he
ſpeakes in this place. Looke alſo the 2, Tim. chap. 3. verſ. 1. 2. 3.
<hi>In the latter dayes there ſhall be troubleſome tymes, men ſhall be louers
of themſelues, louers of pleaſures and not of God, corrupt in mynde, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates
concerning the faith:</hi> There the Apoſtaſie from the faith.
In that ſame Epiſtle chap. 4. verſe 3. <hi>The tyme ſhall come vvhen
men ſhall not ſuffer to heare the ſound doctrine, but according to their
ovvne luſtes ſhall gather together heapes of teachers:</hi> to wit, orders
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16659:211"/>
of Monkes, Friers, and heaps of Ieſuites, and the reſt of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaine
and deuiliſh rable, that the deuill by his ſpirit hes thruſt
in on the people of God, and they ſhall auert their eyes from
the trueth and turne them to lies. <hi>Peter</hi> in his 2. Epiſtle chap. 2
verſe 1. ſayes, <hi>There ſhall be among you falſe teachers vvho ſhall bring
in damnable hereſies, and many ſhall follovv them to their perdition.</hi>
They ſhall goe to deſtruction with their Hereſies, and many
ſhall goe after them. And before them Chriſt himſelfe foretolde
of this defection 18. chap. of <hi>Like</hi> verſe 8, <hi>When,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>the Son
of man ſhall come, thinke ye he shall finde faith on the earth?</hi> No, there
be an vniuerſall defection. Then this vniuerſall defection is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, but this Apoſtaſie and defection from the faith of
Chriſt that ſhall be before Chriſts comming in the world. Now
ye ſee then this is a prophecy of the thing to come. Is this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
fulfilled yet or not? Is it come to paſſe? Is that vniuerſall
defection of the world from the church, from the faith of Chriſt
come, or ſhall we looke for it? There is the queſtion. I tell you,
it is come, I cry it out, it is come, and come long ſince, and verie
long ſince; It holdes on and ſhall hold on. <hi>Mahomet</hi> beganne it,
when he drew away not only the people from the faith of Ieſus,
but alſo drew away the verie name of Chriſtianity, ſo as there
durſt not one avowe himſelfe to be a Chriſtian. The Orientall
Churches ſo well planted by the Apoſtles of Chriſt, whereof
this Church of Theſſalonica was one, may beare witnes hereof.
Who followed on? <hi>(Mahomet</hi> ended it not then) The Popes,
that beaſt of Rome followed on. As <hi>Mahomet</hi> played with the
Orientall Churches: So the Papiſts played with the Weſter and
Occidentall Churches. The Pope hes drawen away this occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
Church of Chriſt in Europe, not indeede from the name
and outward profeſſion of Chriſt, for all are called Chriſtians,
but he hes drawen them from the faith of Chriſt, without the
which there can be no ſaluation. So this Apoſtaſie prophecyed
ſo long before is come now to paſſe.<note place="margin">Church militant ſubiect to errors.</note> But ere I goe forward mark
here. The eſtate of the Church of Chriſt militant on the earth,
ſhe is ſubject to errors and Hereſies, to be caryed away vvith
falſe doctrine, ſubject to defection, yea to an vniuerſall defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the whole viſible Church on the face of the earth. And,
brethren, euen godly men ſeeing this thing they haue bene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16659:212"/>
at tymes to doubt (they were ſo offended) whether if this
Church was Gods Church or not, whether if this building was
builded by God or not which they ſaw ſo beatten downe, and
lying ſo long dead. It is a lamentable thing to ſee the Church of
Chriſt ſo long vnder the dominion of the Antichriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord by his Apoſtle and others hes foretold of this v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall
defection that the godly may be comforted and ſtand:
ſeeing nothing commes to paſſe but by his prouidence and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight.
Then again ye know the Papiſts propoſition; the church
cannot ere. Now conſider this place and ye ſhall ſee it cannot
ſtand with that opinion. I aske how can that opinion ſtand with
this Prophecie of <hi>Paul</hi> who telles, not of a light error, but of an
vniuerſall defection from Chriſt? Either this muſt be falſe which
the Apoſtle ſaies, and which Chriſt ſpok before him (which wer
blaſphemie to affirme) or that which they ſay, that the Church
cannot erre muſt be a lye, and it is ſo. And all the Papiſts are
blaſphemous lyars, beleue them as ye will. No the godly are not
ignorant of their purpoſe in this their aſſertion. They hold that
doctrine to be a pretence to keepe the Antichriſtian Church
in her error and Apoſtaſie: for ſhe is altogether out of the way,
and if ſhe could thinke ſhe could be ſubject to error ſhe were
curable, but becauſe ſhe lyes in her ſtinking Hereſie and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie
and will not acknowledge it, therefore in the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God ſhe ſhall periſhe, perdition ſhall be her end, if the
Lord waken her not in tyme.</p>
               <p>Now to the wordes. The wordes are, <hi>That the day of the Lord
ſhall not be vntill the tyme that that man of ſin be reueiled.</hi> That man
of ſin muſt be reueiled ere the Lord come in the world againe.
This is one thing with that which went before of an vniuerſall
Apoſtaſie, the comming of an vniuerſall Apoſtaſie and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation
of that man of ſin the Antichriſt, is one thing in ſundry
wordes: For what is the Antichriſt but the head of this Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
and vniuerſall defection? and of all Apoſtats vnder the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
he is the cheefe Apoſtate. Now he is called heere <hi>a man,</hi>
the Antichriſt as though there were but one perſon. Marke it,
(for this place is miſtaken) When ye heare of this name of the
Antichriſt, who is here called the man of ſinne, be not deceiued.
The Antichriſt woulde perſwade you that this name of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16659:212"/>
ſignifies but one man ſome one perſon who ſhal be in the
vvorld at ſuch a tyme. No, the name of Antichriſt imports not
one man onely, but a ſucceſſion of perſons, one after another:
in one kingdome or tyrannie ouer the Church of Chriſt in
the vvorld; All this ſucceſſion of perſones is expreſſed by the
name of one man or one perſon, becauſe they ranne on all one
courſe, and euery one of them hes but one purpoſe to exerciſe
their tyme in oppreſſion of the Church of God. Therefore
the vvhole ſucceſſion is called but on man. But when ſhall this
reueiling of him be? He is ſaid to be reueiled vvhen his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and tyrannie commes to the height and full perfection
in the ſight of the vvorld: He beganne long before he vvas
reueiled, and he vvas in the dayes of the Apoſtles. When <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Peter</hi> vvas in the vvorld, he vvas. And beginning in their
dayes, he grovves on peece and peece in greatneſſe from a ſmall
beginning vntill hee came to ſuch a vvonderful and great
height that he makes the vvhole vvorld vvonder at him: and
this fell out in Anno 666. Reuel. chap. 13. verſe 18. He came

                  <hi>He ſhall oppone himſelfe against all, that ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

worſhipped in Heauen and earth. He ſhall oppone him againſt
all powers and magiſtrats, and againſt all thinges, that caries the
name of a magiſtrat, whether they be Princes, or, Emperors on the
earth, or, in Heauen, God and his Chriſt and from this oppoſition,
he is called an aduerſary, as the deuill is. As the deuil is called Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,

can take vp ſuch a man. Who is it in Europ, or, out of Europ, that
oppones himſelfe to Ieſus Chriſt the Lord, in doctrin firſt, in life
and conuerſation next? I tell you, if ye finde ſuch a man, he is the
Antichriſt. Now I ſhall tell you ſome points of Chriſts doctrine,
wher-vnto this aduerſar oppones himſelfe, that by them ye may
find out,<note place="margin">Pope the antichriſt</note> who is this Antichriſt. The Lord Ieſus ſaies and teaches
Thou ſhalt adore the Lord thy God onely, and him onely ſhalt
thou ſerue. What man of this world is it, that commes in and ſaies
No, thou ſhalt not worſhip him onely, worſhip Angels, worſhip
men &amp; the ſoules of men departed this life, worſhip Images, dead
mens bones called relicts, do reuerence to graues, and aboue all
thou ſhalt giue that worſhip, that is due to God only, to that brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
God in the Maſſe? Who does this and teaches it? Is there any
ſo ignorant, that knows him not? Againe, Chriſt forbids to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God with ſuch worſhip as men hes inuented, to worſhip him
with men traditions &amp; inuentions. Who is he that ſaies, he muſt
be worſhipped by infinit traditions, which are out with the book
of the Scripture, and many againſt the booke of the Scripture,
and bids ſerue him according to a rable of vyle traditions inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the brane of man. Yet more Chriſt ſayes, this Scripture,
the olde and new Teſtament is perfite, it is ſufficient to make
the man of God perfite, it conteines all thinges neceſſarie to our
ſaluation. Who is he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſayes, it is confuſed, difficle, mutilate,
manked, the mother of all Hereſies? Who ſayes this? Looke
ouer to Rome, who but the Pope. Woe to him and all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents.
Yet, further. Chriſt ſayes, I am the onely Mediatour
betweene God and man. Who is he, that ſayes, No, there muſt
be many moe interceſſours and mediatours? Is it not the Pope?
Chriſt ſayes, Iuſtification is onely by true faith in me. Who
ſayes, No, no, thy merite and goode workes muſt be a parte of
thy ſaluation and thou muſt deſerue it? Is it not the Pope? Chriſt
requyres of vs a ſure confidence, that in his bloude our ſinnes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:16659:214"/>
are for giuen, and that thereby, we ſhall be ſafe and get lyfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting.
Who ſayes, it is an high preſumption to beleeue ſo
firmely, and biddes thee doubt whether thou ſhalt get lyfe, or
not: Is it not the Pope? Chriſt ſayes, it is impoſſible to fulfill the
Law of God. Who ſayes, it is poſſible to fulfill i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of ſinne is my bloud. Who ſayes, I ſhall giue thee Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
and pardones for thy ſinnes? is it not the Pope? Chriſt
commanded to miniſter the Sacrament or the Supper vnder both
the kindes. Who ſayes the bread may ſuffice the laikes, let the
Prieſts take both? is it not the Pope? Chriſt permittes the vſe
of mariage to all perſones, without difference. Who commes in
with that doctrine of deuils, forbidding mariage, and meates
which the Lord hes commanded. Wherefore ſhould I be long?
Who is he, that oppones himſelfe to euerie article of our faith?
beginne at the one end and leaue at the other, he oppones to

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle, Brethren, ye heard, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
againſt the falſe teachers that the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming
of the Lord was not ſo neere hand
as they thought and as they teached. He
takes his argument from one thing that
was to fal out in the world before Chriſts
latter comming: Ere euer become (ſayes
the Apoſtle) there ſhall be an vniuerſall
defection from that faith of Ieſus Chriſt. This matter will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
a long proceſſe of tyme, and therefore would the Apoſtle
conclude, Chriſts comming is not ſo neere hand as they make
the people beleeue. He expreſſes not the name of the Antichriſt,
but for the name he hes a long deſcription and painting out of
him This deſcription we entered in the laſt day, and he lets them
ſee when he ſhall be, when he ſhall come. He pointes him out
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16659:216"/>
in his nature. Firſt in his very eſſence he ſhall be a man of nature
lyke other men. Then he commes to his properties. What ſhall
they be? Firſt, a man of ſinne, a wicked man as euer was or ſhall
be in the world. The next propertie, He ſhall be the ſon of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
a man long agoe ordeined to deſtruction. Then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
to his actions (when he ſhall come and reueile him in the
world) he ſhall oppone himſelfe againſt euery thing that ſhall
be called God or ſhall be worſhipped. That is, againſt euery ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
power and Majeſtie, whether earthly or Heauenly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God himſelfe and his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt Another action.
He ſhall not be content onely to oppone himſelfe in malice, but
in pryde he ſhall exalt himſelfe aboue all thinges that ſhall be
called God and worſhipped, either in earth, or in Heauen. Then,
he commes to two ſpeciall actions of his pryde; firſt, exalting
himſelfe aboue God, he ſhall ſit in the Temple of God in the
Church of God. (For ſo the Antichriſtian Church is termed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhee keepes ſome enſenzies of the Church of God, the
Word and Sacraments) He ſhall ſit there as God on the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men and wemen, to thrall and controle them at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
The other particulare action of his pryde, he ſhall ſhowe
himſelfe as God, in the properties perteining to God, he ſhall
take them all on him. This far we proceeded the laſt day in the
deſcription of the Antichriſt, whom the Apoſtle prophecyes
will come in the world ere Chriſt come againe, onely this I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe
you, as I did before. Take not this man whom ye call the
Antichriſt to be a ſingle man, one perſon, take him to be a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of men, euery one following another in one kingdome
and tyranny. The kingdome of Antichriſt, all is termed vnder
the name of a man. They are but one kingdome of all, one pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of all, to exerciſe tyrannie on the Church of God heere on
this earth.</p>
               <p>Now, brethren, to the text. He leaues off this deſcription for a
tyme vntill he come to the ninth verſe following, and there he
returnes againe. Now in the meane-tyme he falles out in ſome
ſpeaches and admonitions to them concerning the Antichriſt:
and in the firſt verſe we haue red, he confirmes the thing he hes
ſpoken of the Antichriſt, from the ſpeaches he had with them
when he abode among them in Theſſalonica. Concerning the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16659:217"/>
Antichriſt I wryte, would he ſay, no other thing to you now nor
that which I told you when I was with you. That which I then
ſpoke that ſame thing now I wryte vnto you. Then in the
next verſe he ſhowes to them that the Antichriſt and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtaniſme
is come and begun already in the world, albeit his
reueiling and his comming to his pryde is not yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
is come Antichriſtaniſme and fals religion is begun. Then
againe he telle, what withholdes him that he is not reueiled ſo
ſoone and haſtily. There is an impediment caſten in which I
told to you when I was with you: He inſiſtes on this impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and telles when this impediment ſhall be tame out of the
way, then this wicked man of ſinne ſhall be reueiled. And
laſt as he hes tolde of his comming out, and growing to an
height in his pryde, ſo he prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecyes of his decay and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>Now to returne to the wordes. <hi>Remember ye not</hi> (ſayes he)
<hi>vvhen I vvas vvith you I told you theſe thinges.</hi> To aſſure them
the more of the trueth of theſe thinges that he wrytes to them
concerning the Antichriſt, hee calles them to remembrance
of that which he ſpoke to them face to face concerning this
ſame purpoſe, and in doing this the vtters ſome peece of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
<hi>Remember ye not.</hi> He vſes ſome ſharpneſſe in wordes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were ſo obliuious, as to forget a thing ſo needfull
for their ſaluation. Now to take vp ſome leſſons ſhortlie on
theſe wordes. Then Apoſtle then beganne verie ſoone to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
the Theſſalonians of the comming of the Antichriſt and
of that vniuerſall defection that was to fall out ſo long after
that: (for this prophecie is eſpeciallie of that great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
who came not a long tyme after this.) The eſtate of the
Church of Theſſalonica was flooriſhing at this tyme, he caſtes
in a matter of diſcouragement heere. There ſhall be an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
defection.<note place="margin">Defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church euer to be feared.</note> Well, brethren, it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when ſhe is moſt flooriſhing to feare a decay and that her ſtate
will alter: For this is the nature of the viſible Church of God
heere on the earth, ſhe is not ſo ſtabled nor ſetled, but ſhe is
ſubject to alteration and trouble, to defection, to falling away
from God, from Chriſt and the trueth, and that both parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularlie
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16659:217"/>
and vniuerſallie, our ſetledneſſe is not in this world,
there are none ſo well ſtabliſhed but they may fall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhould be euer in a dread and feare of deſtruction and
alteration. And it is the parte of the Paſtour aboue all other, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in the flooriſhing of it, to be forwarning and foretelling of
an alteration and defection to inſew: For he as a watch-man
ſhould haue a ſharpe eye to foreſee, and he ſhould craue a
foreſight of God to knovve thinges to inſew that he may giue
aduertiſmentes to the people, and they may be prepared for all
dangers to come.</p>
               <p>Another leſſon. Ye ſee the Theſſalonians hes bene forgetfull
of that which the Apoſtle tolde them when he was with them,
and therfore that which he ſpoke then he wrytes now to them.<note place="margin">Naturaly vvee are forgetfull of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things.</note>
So obliuious we are eſpeciallie of thinges concerning our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
that we will receyue them in at the one eare, and let them
goe out at the other; we heare to day we forget to morrowe.
The ſeede is not ſo ſoone ſowne but the deuill as a rauenous
foull is readie to pull it out of the very eares that it be to vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a vaniſhing ſound: and therefore it is the Paſtors part e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to be calling to their remembrance the things that are heard.
Ye ſee in a ſchoole, the maſter conſidering the weakneſſe of the
memory of the youth is euer repeating the thing they haue
heard: as needfull it is to the Paſtour to be euer repeating the
thing he hes teached, for all are as infantes in thee ſchoole of
Chriſt. 1. Cor. 13. 11. and it is the peoples part to be as diligent to
heare ouer againe theſe things that pertaines to ſaluation, and to
craue that the Lord wold bleſſe their memories there in that they
may be the more able to gainſtand all aſſaultes of the deuill and
his ſuppoſtes: how canſt thou gaineſtand if thou be not furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the armour of the word of God? Therefore the Lord
grant me grace to forwarne you and ſanctify your memories to
receyue and keepe the things that concernes your ſaluation: for
it may be the day of tentation is neerer nor we beleue.</p>
               <p>But mark the forme how he cals it to remembrance: He does
it with a rebuke and reproofe. <hi>Remember ye not.</hi> They who are
forgetfull of thinges heauenly ſhould not goe away without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe,

                  </gap>tie. This is the thing I euer find this Apoſtle doing.</p>
               <p>Now to goe forward to the next verſe. Becauſe he ſaid before
the Antichriſt was not as yet reueiled. The Theſſalonians might
haue asked the Apoſtle. What withholdes? What ſtayes? What
impediment is there? Why is he not reueiled? The Apoſtle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
ſhortly. Ye know what withholds, it is not needfull I tell
you, I told you it elſe when I was with you, call it to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
it is not needfull that I ſhould loſe tyme by oft repeating
of it. Yet, brethren, albeit he knew it, and the Theſſalonians
knewe it, becauſe he had told them of it before, yet we knowe it
not for any thing he ſhowes heere. Therefore we muſt ſee what
was the impediment that ſtayed the reuiling of the Antichriſt
till his hight and pryde.<note place="margin">The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre, and publiſhing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes staying the reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</note> What was it? Both the olde and late
wryters agrees in this. It was the Romane Empyre that flooriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the tyme. The euent and iſſue of thinges declared this
to be true: For ſo long as the Romane Empyre ſtoode and the
Emperour keept his owne ſeat at Rome (which now is vſurped
by the Pope,) ſo long neither Mahomet in the Eaſt preuailed:
(for, he was one of the deſtroyers of the Romane Empyre) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Pope in the Weſt got vp his head: for the Empyre ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him not to come to his hight. But when once the Romane
Empyre decayed, the Emperour changed his ſeat, left Rome and
remained at Conſtantinople. Then vp gets the Mahomet his
ſeate in the Eaſt, the Pope in the Weſt, and he ſits downe in the
Emperours ſeate. This is one impediment. Latter writers joines
to this another impediment, that ſtaied the reueiling of the beaſt
and his comming to his hight, to wit, the decree of God, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the publiſhing of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt in the world:
Ere he ſhould come to his perfection, it behoued, that the Goſpel
ſhould be preached throghout the world: Ere there be any fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
there muſt be a ſtanding; ere there be any Apoſtaſie there
muſt be a receiuing of the word: It behoued, that, before apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
the word ſhould be vniuerſally teached. Therefore the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Empyre decaying, the courſe of the Goſpell comming to
an end, the Euangell being vniuerſally teached, the Antichriſt
breakes in and takes vpon him both the juriſdictiones, takes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16659:218"/>
on him the earthly power, and then the juriſdiction ouer the
ſoules of men, he killes the bodie with the temporall ſword he
killes the ſoule with the poyſon of falle doctrine. His kingdome
is euer ſlaying, either of the ſoules of men with falſe doctrine
and poyſon of Hereſies, or elſe if men will not obey, he ſlayes
their bodies with the ſword. Theſe are the impediments helde
him back vnreueiled. Then learne heere, it is the Lord vvho
ſtayes and holdes back euill from the world; and his maner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>;
he caſtes in impediments before the deuill and before wicked
men ere they riſe: The deuill and his ſuppoſtes is comming out
ruſhing on the people, the Lord caſts in impediments to them
and then they muſt ſtand vntill theſe impedimentes be ſome
way remoued: For, brethren, the power of the deuill and of
darknes and wickednes is ſo great on the earth that the Church
of God could not ſtand one day except the Lord did caſt in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
in the way of the deuil and wickedmen to hold them
off. And ſo all the glorie of the ſtanding of the Church in the
earth, is to be aſcriued to that God that holdes off and ſhall hold
off by his prouidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>ill they will they, the deuill wicked
men from their wicked interpryſes; and the Lord forbid the
Antichriſt ſhould preuaile; for if he preuaile, aſſure thy ſelfe if
thou ſtand ſteedfaſt: in the faith thy bloud ſhall pay for it: for of
all Tygers in the earth he is the moſt bloud-thirſtie.</p>
               <p>Now the wordes following telles wherefore theſe in pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are caſten in. <hi>That he ſhould be reveiled in his ovvne tyme,</hi>
As he would ſay, his tyme is not yet come, that article of tyme
God hes appointed and decreed from all eternitie he ſhould be
reueiled in, is not yet come Brethren, this is true, and al the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
makes it manifeſt. The Lord from all eternitie hes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
tymes, opportunities, houres, moments, when euerything
ſhould be done that falles out in this world, euery action hes the
owne moment preſcriued to it, be it good, or bad. The Lord hes
written the houre of it in his booke when it ſhould be done.
Now ye ſee by experience, the deuill euer ſeekes to preuent the
tyme, yea, the beſt of vs all when the Lord hes appointed a time
to our deliuerance, or to doe anything, cannot byde that tyme,
but are euer freatting and fuming. Therefore, the Lord caſtes in
ſtayes both to the deuill and to men on earth. When they are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16659:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>
running forwarde, he will caſt in a ſtay, and thou muſt ſtand
there, and thou muſt ſtand vntil that ſame tyme and article come
that he hes appointed, and it ſhall not ly in the power of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
and of all the earth to preuent that tyme.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the next verſe. There are two things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Antichriſt. The firſt, his comming in the world.
The ſecond his reueiling after his comming. There is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene theſe two: His comming to the height and his
reuelation. As concerning his comming to his height, it might
haue bene asked by the Theſſalonians, Is he come yet? we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
by thy ſpeaking, he is not reueiled yet, but is he come
yet? He anſweres, <hi>Euen novv the misterie of iniquitie is in doing:</hi>
ſhortlie the meaning is. The Antichriſt, the Antichriſtianiſme,
falſe religion, Heretical doctrine, is come alreadie, albeit it be not
reueiled and come to the hight. He calles Antichriſtaniſme ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie:
for, of all iniquitie, falſe doctrine is the greateſt iniquity,
and of all ſinners on the earth a falſe teacher and deceiuer of the
people of God is the greateſt ſinner. Therefore he is called the
man of ſinne, a man addicted to ſinne, as a ſlaue to his maſter.
Further he calles it the <hi>misterie</hi> of iniquitie. It is called a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie,
becauſe it came not to the light at the firſt, but, lay vp hid
in a miſterie. It was not knowne not detected in the owne cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
nor came not to an height that men might know it. Then,
marke, ye ſee, the Antichriſt and Antichriſtianiſme, that is, falſe
religion beganne verie ſoone, <hi>Euen novv there are many Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs,</hi>
ſayes <hi>Iohn 1.</hi> Epiſt. 4. chap 3. verſ. It beganne in <hi>Pauls</hi> and
the Apoſtles dayes. It was conſerued, as it were, in the mothers
bellie in thoſe dayes, but, it lay long and many yeeres hid vp in a
miſterie, and it lay long time lurking in Rome and in the Church
thereof, and then, at laſt broke vp there the great Antichriſt. It
lay ſo hid vp, not comming to the perfection, to the yeere of the
Lord ſix hundreth and three yeeres, and then, it was broght to a
great maturitie and perfection, by <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour and
Pope <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the third. It layth the mothers wombe getting
forme and grouth, ere it came to the reuelation, ſo, the Antichriſt

the number of a man, that is, an explicable number, eaſie to be

perfection, as that prophecy of <hi>Iohn</hi> tels and experience teaches.
Who makes him vp and perfites him? Euen, he who ſhould haue

cannot come higher.</p>
               <p>Now, brethren, to end this matter. Heare a little of his downe
going againe. As the Apoſtle heere prophecyed of his clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

of his decaying. The firſt part is his conſuming; the next part is
his aboliſhing. His conſuming is with a ſlownes; for, as he came

of the Goſpell, and that by the poore Miniſters, who are
deſpiſed in the world: He makes his Miniſters breath and blow
on the beaſt, and this breath of the Miniſters conſumes the
beaſt. When began this conſuming of him? Euen ſoone after he
came to his height. Ye heard of one <hi>Iohn W. ckle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he blew on the beaſt. <hi>Iohn Huſſe, Ierome de Praga</hi> in Bohemia,
albeit he was burnt and the beaſt got the maſtrie of him, yet he
conſumed the beaſt. Ye heard of <hi>Luther</hi> in Germanie, his name
ſhall not be buried. <hi>Melanthon, Zuinglius, Oe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

worthie memorie; and then good <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> in France, <hi>Viretus,
Farellus.</hi> they blew in their tyme on the beaſt. What ſhall I ſay?
To be ſhort, ſo many faithfull men as the Lord raiſes vp in the
miniſtry they are as many ſlayers of the beaſt with their breaths.
Now learne one thing. When the Antichriſt is come to his
height, who goes too to beate the beaſt downe from his height?
Is it the Emperour? is it this king or that king? No, no word of
them. Is it any power in this world? No, it is the Lord Ieſus. He
will haue the honour of the wreack of the Antichriſt. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as it were, in his owne perſon he will enter in combat with
the beaſt. Now what armour vſes he? Commes he on with this
wordly armour, gunnes and gainzies, I aske of thee? No, no
thing is ſpoken of them, but a breathing and blowing is told of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Ieſus Chriſt blovves on the beaſt and conſumes him vvith the
breath of his mouth. The word of the Goſpell is the armour he
vſes: that ſame armour the beaſt abuſes to hold vp his kingdome
vvithall, the Lord takes out of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and and ſlayes him vvith.
What inſtruments vſes he to this turne? He takes not Angelles
from the Heauen to breath on him. No, but ſillie ſimple bodies,
ſome out of the beaſts owne bodie, ſome otherwaies raiſed vp to
blow on the beaſt. Marke all theſe circumſtances. They all let
you ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in beatting dovvne of the beaſt onely Ieſus Chriſt
ought to haue the glorie of the victorie. Whether ye looke to
him who ſtrikes the battell, the armour, or, them, who are ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the battell, all lettes you ſee, the glorie ſhould be giuen to
Chriſt alone. What is more vyle, nor the vvord of the croſſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16659:221"/>
and this vyle miniſtrie, and yet he vvill haue him vvreaked and
conſumed with the word and miniſtrie. He chuſes not great and
mightie things, not kings and Emperours to this worke (wonder
not, nor be not moued, that ye ſee ſo many kings ſtand by the
beaſt, to ſee the Emperour, the kings of France and Spaine ſtand
for him) but the Lord will vſe baſe meanes to deſtroy the beaſt,
that the glorie may be giuen to him allone.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the other pointe, his aboliſhing. He is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
at the laſt. When ſhall this be? <hi>When Christ ſhall come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</hi>
How ſhall it be? The face and <hi>preſence of Ieſus ſhall deuoure
him.</hi> As ſoone as the Lord ſhall come downe, as ſoone ſhall he
vaniſh and be burnt vp, as caffe with the fire. The word of the
Goſpell conſumes him and burnes him, but, not quyte vp. But,
the face of Ieſus in that day ſhall burne him quite vp, and then,
that prophecie of <hi>Iohn</hi> Reuel. chap. 20. verſe 10. ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed:
<hi>He ſhall be caſten in a lack of fire and brimſtone</hi> which ſhall
neuer haue an end. Then, brethren, beware of this word; for, if
it worke not to lyfe, but be a ſauour of death to death; if it doe
thee no good in this lyfe, be aſſured, that moſt glorious face of
the Lord in the world to come ſhall deſtroye thee. Therefore,
looke, that, the word be an inſtrument to thy conſolation, and
the power of God to thy ſaluation. Looke how the word is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
to thee, in this life: for, ſo ſhall the preſence of Ieſus be
to thee in the life to come, either to thy ſaluation, or, damnation.
The face of the Lord ſhal conſume thee if the word hes wroght
no renewing of thee in this life. It is ſaid in the chapter precee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
verſe 9. They which did not obey the Goſpell ſhall be
<hi>puniſhed vvith euerlasting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord,
and from the gloree of his povver:</hi> one blenke of that face ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
in an inſtant, all the reprobate. Craue then, that, the word
may be powerfull, that ye may eſcape this fire of that preſence
of Ieſus in his comming. Then, heere, ye may perceiue, that, the
kingdome of the Antichriſt is not altogether aboliſhed, it takes
a long tyme, ere it be taken away. Wonder not, that, he hes ſuch
a power in this earth: for, certainly, this prophecie telles vs, that,
there ſhall be ſome face of the Antichriſtes kingdome, vntill
Chriſt come. Looke not, that, Papiſtry end, ere Chriſt come, look
not that euery reformed Church ſhall be quite of them, but, they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16659:222"/>
ſhall be as thornes in their ſides till Chriſt come, and let no man
ouer ſoone triumph, but let euery one make him for the battell.
There are none of the profeſſours of Chriſts trueth but they
ſhould prepare them for battell. Therefore, let euery one ſeeke
this armour, that being enarmed with that ſpirituall armour, ſo
far as God will giue the grace, echone may breath on the beaſt
to his conſumption, that, ſo, God may be glorified and then
ſhalt thou triumph for euer with him. To whom be praiſe and

In this pointe likewiſe Satan preaſes to be like God. When God
by his miniſter as effectuall, he not onely workes by his mouth,
or his hand or any outward member; but he workes by his ſoule
and inward affections cheefly. 1. Cor. chap. 14. verſe 25. it is
ſaid of the Prophets that God is in them. Indeed he prophecyes
not onely in the mouth but he enters in the hart, and thereby he
prophecyes aſwell as by the mouth: <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Cor. 4. 13.
<hi>We beleeue and therefore vve ſpeak.</hi> If the Prophet ſpeake not with
the tongue becauſe he beleeues in the hart, all his preaching
is deare of a pennie. See Coll. 1. 29. So Satan will be like God in
this pointe, he will enter in his miniſter, namely the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
he will poſſeſſe his hart and all the inwarde affections of
his ſoule, and by them he will be powerfull in them that are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined
for damnation before the world was made.</p>
               <p>Now to goe forward in the text following. The Apoſtle ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe
two meanes by the which the Antichriſt when he ſhall
come ſhall be effectuall in them who periſhes. Marke the two
meanes, and experience this day teaches the trueth of them. The
firſt meane he calles it, <hi>all maner of povver,</hi> then he expones him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
what he meanes by this power, <hi>by ſignes and lying vvonders:</hi>
wonderfull working that commes of a power. Another meane
in the verſe following. <hi>And in all deceiuableneſſe of vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
that is, doctrine that is firſt falſe, ſecondly fraudulent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
onely a cullour of the trueth. So to take it vp ſhortly. The
two meanes, the Antichriſt ſhall haue, is firſt working won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
next ſpeaking, vttering falſe doctrine; firſt worke and
wonders, and then word: Worke and word are the two means
whereby the Antichriſt deceiues you, by his worke he deceiues
the world, by his word he propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s falſe doctrine. Now to ſpeak
of the firſt meane: His firſt meane are wonders and miracles.
The Antichriſt ſhall be effectuall by working wonders in them
who are ordeined to perdition when he ſhall be reueiled in the
world. Brethren, as the miniſter of Chriſt is effectuall by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſignes and wonders, as the Apoſtles were, and before them
the Prophets in their owne tyme: So the Antichriſt the miniſter
of Satan he will preaſe to be like them, and he will be effectuall
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n theſe who periſhes by working of wonders and miracles.
But what wonders are theſe that the Antichriſt workes by?
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16659:223"/>
The Apoſtle calles them <hi>lying ſignes,</hi> and wonders, lying firſt in
reſpect of their end, wherefore they are wrought, to confirme
falſe doctrine and lyes to men; to eſtabliſh falſhood: and againe
lying, becauſe the wonders that are wrought are no true things
in ſubſtance, they are but iluſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and meere juglerie to deceiue
the people. Ye ſee the deuill would faine be like God, and in the
meane-tyme he is a plaine counterfairer, and to call it ſo the
ape of God, counterfaiting God: So the miniſter of Satan the
Antichriſt a plaine counterfaiter of Chriſts-Miniſter, an ape ſet
vp, as he hes ſeene the Miniſters of Chriſt worke, ſo he will
ſtand vp and counterfaite, all are but apes, all their miracles and
working but apes playing.</p>
               <p>Now, brethren, I thinke, ye would aske this queſtion, whether,
if Satan and the Antichriſt hes power to worke true miracles
and wonders, or, not? I anſwere ſhortlie, In trueth, I ſay, Satan is
not able to worke one true wonder, he hes not power to worke

is a worke, that is wrought aboue nature, againſt nature,
contrare to the courſe of nature, contrare to all ſecond cauſes, of
the which, when it is done, none in the world is able to giue a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
reaſon, wherfore it is ſo. There is the definition of a true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle:
I could let you ſee out of the Scripture many examples of
theſe, the rauiſhing of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> to the Heauen. Who can
giue a naturall cauſe, for the lifting vp of two heauy bodies
to the Heauen? The preſeruation of <hi>Noe</hi> with ſo many with him

I ſhall ſhovve you my opinion, vvithout the prejudice of

and his glory. Novv, I ſay, the Lord vvill not lend his povver to
Satan, to work one true wonder, to deface his owne glory and to
eſtabliſh falſe doctrine, and I think, I haue a ſufficient probation
of this, out of the 9. chap. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> 16 verſe. When Chriſt had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ſight to the man, that was blinde, the Phariſies made inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

vvonders,</hi> but, he hes wroght this wonder; therefore, we conclude
he is not a deceiuer. And the man himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who got ſight rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

me, therefore, he is no deceiuer. Then, ye will aske. What mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
are theſe, that, the Antichriſt vvorkes in the vvorld? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
Either they are onely deluſions, nothing in ſubſtance, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
juglerie, deceiuing of the ſenſes of men; or, if there be any

becauſe they are natural, they are not done againſt nature. O, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

which we cannot take vp, and therefore, knowing the nature of
things, and hauing ſlight in vvorking, vve thinke the things that
are done ſo, to be wonder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> albeit in effect they be no wonders. So
in one vvord, Satan neuer vvrought one true miracle, but, either
they haue bene deluſions, or, elſe, vvorkes agreeing vvith nature,

multitude of pilgrimes, out of all countries offering to her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

God to open mens eyes, none needed to doubt who it is. Is it any

               <p>Now I goe forward to the next meane, whereby he ſhall be

is falſe doctrine;<note place="margin">2. falſe doctrine.</note> it is doctrine in ſubſtance, but, falſe
doctrine, then in cullour it is fraud and deceiuableneſſe, a falſe
cullour; it hes a cullour of the doctrine of Chriſt, but a cullour
onely. So the Miniſter of Chriſt is powerfull in the elect by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and the word preached. So the Antichriſt is powerfull by
doctrine in theſe that periſhes and are in the Antichriſtian
Church, ſo, that, he preaſes to be like Chriſts true Miniſters in

he is falſe. There is another marke whereby we ſhall knowe
him. As falſe miracles was one marke, ſo, falſe doctrine, doctrine
of deceite is another marke. Who is he that propones ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
as this, that firſt is falſe, and next hes a faire cullour that
deceiues the world, who will ſpeake fairely of Chriſt, his work,
his nature, his ſubſtance, his incarnation, and pretends his glorie

The Antichriſt is fained: the Antichriſt vnder the pretence of

This we haue to rejoice in, the effectualneſſe of the Antichriſt
is bounded; it is not ſaid, that, he ſhall be effectuall in all men:
No, God forbid, but his power is bounded; it ſhall onely be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall

that are ordeined to perdition are ſubject to that finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
by the Antichriſt, that his deceite may be as a chaine to
bind them to perdition. Lord if they who are bound with the
chains of the Antichriſt hes great cauſe to ſearch out the ground
of their election, whether they are ſuch as are ordeined to perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſeeing they are in the wrong way. Goe out of Babylon,

not ſubject to theſe deceiuing errors and Hereſies of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
as the reprobate: They are not ſubject thereto finallie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
for a tyme the Lord will ſuffer them to be drawen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay,
to the end they ſhould knovve themſelues to be diſſolute
Chriſtians. <hi>Matthevv</hi> chap. 24 verſe 24. Chriſt ſaies, <hi>falſe Chriſts
and falſe Prophets ſhall do ſuch vvonders, that if it vvere poſſible they
ſhould ſeduce euen the elect,</hi> meaning that it is not poſſible the elect
ſhould fall in this finall defection. Who are they then in whom
the Antichriſt preuailes? Onely they who are ordeined to perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
That is, ſuch an object as is diſpoſed and prepared before
all eternitie to be deceiued by the Antichriſt in tyme: they are
the matter that is periſhing and is ordeined to periſh. I wil make
this more cleare by an exemple: When the fire burnes vp the
caffe and dry timber, ye ſee, the cauſe of the burning not onely
in the fire; for, if a ſtone, or, iron were in the place of caffe, it wold
bide the fire: ſo the cauſe is not in the burning heate of the fire
onely, but alſo, in the caffe that is the matter thereof: Euen ſo it
is with them that are deceiued by the Antichriſt, the cauſe of
there deceite is not onely in the force of the Antichriſt, but alſo,
in the euil diſpoſition of the men that are deceiued. In plain talk,
many are ordeined to Helles fire, and therefore when the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
lights on ſuch folkes they are readily and eaſily deceiued.
And yet, I ſee, God hes his parte: Who gaue this diſpoſition?
Who hes ordeinde it? Who hes ordeinde men to damnation? It
is God in his eternall counſell. So the Antichriſt is not able with
his effectualnes to doe any thing in man, but, that, which God hes
determined. Firſt, the Lord of all creatures he diſpones, he makes
ſome veſſels to honor, ſome, to diſhonor. That eternall decree of
God giues ſuch a diſpoſition to the creature, that, in tyme it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of good meanes, to life; capable of deceite, to deſtruction.
So, it is God in his eternall counſell, that juſtly diſpenſes, and the
Antichriſt in his time works according to Gods diſpenſation. So
the Antichriſt hes not the glory that he can doe any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God, neither needs the godly to be offended nor affrayd for
the Antichriſt, nor to be diſcouraged when they ſee men daily
falling away from the truth. Nothing can be done without Gods
decree. Chriſt was crucified, a foull fact, yet, it is ſaid Act. 4. verſ.

               <p>Now to goe forward. He ſubjoines, a cauſe of the perdition of

no thou art a contempner of my Goſpel. That ſhall be the cheef
cauſe of thy perdition: for, it is the mother cauſe of all ſin, becauſe
if men would imbrace ſincerely the trueth of God and loue the
Goſpel, if they wold imbrace Ieſus in their hart, O, if he wold not
keep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from many inconuenients! It is the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of the goſpel
that leads thee to thy ſins, it is the contempt of the Goſpell that
makes thee a murtherer, an adulterer, &amp;c. Thou contemned the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16659:227"/>
Goſpell of Chriſt, and therefore the Lord caſtes thee away and
giues the ouer to thy owne affections, to commit ſin with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe,
to be a blaſphemer, an adulterer, and to commit other
ſinnes. So the mother cauſe and ſpeciall ground of all ſinnes is
the contempt of the light and the word of Ieſus, and this may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
be ſeene in this land, eſpecially in great mens houſes.</p>
               <p>Now he ſayes not, becauſe they receiued not the trueth, but
he ſayes, <hi>becauſe they receiued not the loue of the trueth</hi> There are
many will ſeeme to receiue the trueth, and who will take heed
to the Goſpel ſo diligently as they? And therefore the firſt thing
that men ſhould take heede to, is the hart, looke if in the hart
there be an vnfained loue of God and his trueth. It is not thy eare
in hearing of the word, nor thy mouth in ſpeaking well of it
that will make thee a good receiuer of the trueth, but it is the
hart. Looke there be an vnfained loue to the trueth, in it, and then
hold vp thy eare, and it will ſinke in ſo ſweetly in thy ſoule that
thou ſhalt feede on it ſo joyfully as no tongue neither of man
nor Angell can tell. It is not the outward profeſſion nor the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
receiuing (if thou ſhould ſit a thouſand yeeres hearing) that
will bring thee to life: Firſt thou muſt haue hart and ſoule diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
inwardly with an vnfained loue to God, to Ieſus Chriſt and
his Goſpell, and then Heauen and earth ſhall got together ere
thou periſh. An hart that loues Chriſt and this light ſhall neuer

not ſaue thee in the day of the Lord, if there be not a peece of this

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE dayes bygone (beloued brethren in
the Lord Ieſus) we haue heard a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of that uniuerſall Apoſtaſie that
was to come, and of the reueiling of the
Antichriſt, who ſhould be the head and
ring-leader of this vniuerſall Apoſtaſie.
We heard of the Antichriſt to be reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
he is painted out and deferyued in his
owne collours before he was reueiled, euen as we ſee him this
day: For <hi>Paul</hi> could not haue ſet him out more viuely in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
properties and actions, if he had ſeene him nor he hes done
in this Prophecie: for he deſcryuos him euen as if he had ſeene
him with his eyes. He hes deſcryued him from his nature, He
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16659:228"/>
ſhall be a man, ſayes he not a ſingle man ſimplie, but he meanes
by this word <hi>one man,</hi> a ſucceſſion of men in one kingdome. As
for his properties, he ſayes, he ſhall be a man of ſinne, and addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
ſlaue to ſinne. Next he ſhall be the ſonne of perdition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
to deſtruction and euerlaſting perdition from al eternity.
As for his actions firſt in malice of his hart he ſhal oppone him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
againſt all thing that is called God, and is worſhipped ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Heauen or in earth. He ſhall oppone himſelfe both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Majeſtie of God in Heauen, and againſt the majeſties
of Kings and Princes on earth. Againe in pryde of his hart he
ſhall lift himſelfe aboue euery thing called God. More, in the
pryde of hart he ſhall ſit in the Temple of God, as God in Gods
ſeate vpon the conſciences of men, to control them, which thing
properly pertaines to God. No creature hes power ouer the
conſciences of men, it is proper to God onely. More, he ſhall
ſhowe himſelfe in all his ſtyles dignities and names as God. He
ſhall reaue theſe from God and ſhall cloath himſelfe with them.
Laſt, he is deſcryued from that effectualneſſe and powerfull
working which he ſhall receiue of Satan, and which at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
he ſhall haue in the harts of men, partly by working won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
partly by falſe and fraudulent doctrine. But in whom? He
ſayes, in them that periſhes, that is, in them that are ordeined to
deſtruction before the foundation of the world was laid; in theſe
he ſhall be powerfull, they ſhall beleeue him in all that he does
and ſayes. Then he ſets down one cauſe of the perdition of theſe
men in whom the Antichriſt is and ſhall be effectuall. To witte,
their owne merite and deſert, they will not receiue the loue of the
trueth, they contemne the light of the Goſpell, and therefore
periſh ſhall they. God indeed hes decreed from all eternitie that
they ſhall periſh; but, before the decreete be put in execution,
their merite ſhall interuene, and in tyme they ſhall contemne the
trueth of God, which ſhall procure that damnation, to the which
from all eternity they were predeſtinate.</p>
               <p>In the firſt verſe we read the Apoſtle ſhowes by what order
damnation and perdition ſhall follow vpon the contempt of the
light of God in Ieſus Chriſt. Marke this. Damnation ſhall not
follow vpon the contempt of the trueth immediatly, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhal interueene, firſt there ſhall follow one plague of God:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16659:228"/>
for <hi>he ſhall ſend vpon theſe men ſtrange illuſions,</hi> that is, he ſhall
hound out the Antichriſt with his effectualneſſe, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
with the effectualneſſe of Satan ſhall deceiue them, he
ſhall blinde them, as it were, and put out their eyes. What
ſhall followe on that? Being blinded they ſhall goe forwarde
in their ſinne and ſo goe downe toward Hell, as it were, by
another ſteppe. And as they contemned the light before, ſo
now, being deceiued, they ſhall embrace greedilie lies. And
what ſhall followe vpon this? Embraceing lyes and vanities
damnation ſhall enſue. This is the meaning of this verſe. Then,
ye ſee, a man is not ſhot in Hell at the firſt. No, when a man
hes committed one ſinne, God will not put him in Hell at that
ſame inſtant, but he ſhall make him goe to Hell by degrees,
from ſteppe to ſteppe, and from ſinne to ſinne in his juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he ſhall make him ſtop from a ſmaller ſinne to a greater
ſinne: and this he will doe by plaguing of him and inflicting on
him either ſpiritual or temporall judgements, and being beatten
he will not amend. No, mark this. A reprobate will neuer mend,
all the temporall judgements in the world will not better him,
but he will be ay worſe and worſe, ſo that if he ſinned before,
now being plagued he ſhal go to a greater ſin, and ſhal not make
an end of ſinning till he end in judgement.</p>
               <p>Marke another thing here. Ye ſee what the Antichriſt is with
all his force and effectualneſſe, his wonders and his doctrine
whereby he is effectuall in them that periſhes. Is he without
God trow ye? No, he is no other thing but a burrio ſent from the
Tribunal of God to plague the ingrate world, as the king would
ſend an hangman to hang a thiefe or murtherer; God in his juſt
judgement ſends him to execute juſtice vpon this ingrate world
for the contempt of the light of the Goſpell. The Pope is Gods
burrio whom God ſendes, for to plague this ingrate world for
the contempt of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt. When this great v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſal
apoſtaſie began the great Antichriſt was ſent by God to
be the worker of it. And, brethren, what trow ye is the cauſe of
this trouble ſent in our Church this day? This high contempt
of the light of the Goſpel hes beene the cauſe, and if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in this contempt, troubles ſhall not leaue off. This ſame
Antichriſt the Pope by his ſuppoſts ſhall make adoe amongſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16659:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs, the Lord ſhall ſend an auenger to plague the ſoules of men
that will not beleeue the Goſpell. Another thing marke here. He
ſayes not that God ſhall ſuffer him, and ſuffer ſtrong illuſions to
be wrought by him, but he ſayes, <hi>he ſhall ſend</hi> them, he ſhal be an
efficient, a doer, and a principall directer of this turne. Then ye
will aske, Is God the author of euill? I anſwere, there are two
ſortes of euill, there is one euill that they call the euill of a fault,
there is another euill that is called the euill of puniſhment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that ſaying of the Prophet, <hi>There is not one euill in the
cittie,</hi> (that is, there is no puniſhment in the cittie) <hi>that the
Lord doeth nor.</hi> As to the euill of a fault in ſinne, he is not the
author and worker of it, but ſuffers it to be wrought by euill
men. And as to the other the Lord is the author of it, as that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Prophet before vttered by me witneſſeth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Hell as it is a puniſhment, is ordeined by the Lord, and ſo
this place is to be vnderſtood. Who hardned the hart of <hi>Pharao?</hi>
Who giues vp men to a reprobate mind? Is it not the Lord to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
their ſinnes? But I will not inſiſt in this matter.</p>
               <p>Laſtly I note in this place, that, this plague the Apoſtle ſpeaks
of here, is, a blinding and deceiuing of the minde. There are two
powers of the ſoule, the minde and the hart. This plague is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the plague of the minde. I ſhall make this cleare to you.
There are two ſortes of lightes in the minde, there is a naturall
light wherewith we are borne, and ther is a ſupernaturall light,
which we get by the word and Spirit of Chriſt. Now there is
ſuch a conjunction betweene theſe two, that, if a man, when
the ſupernaturall light is offered from Heauen, refuſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
it, looke what will follow. The Lord from the Heauen
in his juſt judgement ſhall pluck from him the naturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and ſet him vp blind in thinges naturall and common, he
ſhall pluck the common ſenſe from him, that is, he ſhall render
him ouer to a reprobate mynd without al judgement and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
What ſhall follow then? Then like a mad man he ſhall run
here and there to fin; he ſhall paſſe ouer the bounds of common
honeſty, he ſhall leape ouer all the lawes of the ſecond table, he
ſhall be a rebell to God and man, he ſhall be a murtherer and a
theefe, and he ſhall follow all concupiſcence in the world, and as
for the firſt Table, which is concerning godlines, he ſets himſelf
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16659:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>
againſt: He will be an Idolater, an Heretike, an Athiſt, a man
of no religion, and all this commes of a reprobate mynde which
is procured of Gods juſt judgement becauſe that ſpirituall light
was ſo contemned that he would not ſuffer it to be conjoyned
with that naturall light. Therefore when we ſee theſe light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynded
men, and theſe that will be counted Lords and Peeres
in the Land, repyne to this glorious light of the Goſpell, take
vp the judgement of God that lightes vpon them. The Lord
ſuffers them to paſſe the bounds of common honeſtie, they are
wrapped vp in a reprobat ſenſe. Count no more of them then of
madde men whom the Lord in juſtice ſhall confound for euer.
No, if they were here, I would ſay they were mad men, running
headlong vnder the vengence of God to deſtruction. The Lord
giue them eyes to ſee this and harts to vnderſtand that they may
be reclaimed from this fearce wrath of the Lord. They want
both naturall wit and ſupernaturall: for he that will not ſuffer
this light of the Goſpell to be conjoyned with this natural light,
he hes no wit at all, he is a madde bodie, he will not care to doe
whatſoeuer euill he may both to himſelfe and others. The Lord
ſaue vs from this ſort of men.</p>
               <p>In the verſe that followes firſt we haue the effect that enſues
vpon this ſinne of beleeuing of lies; vpon the firſt ſinne the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
of the trueth followes; the next ſin of beleeuing errors
and lies, vpon this ſin againe followes judgement and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>that they may be condemned,</hi> ſayes he. In the next part of the
verſe he repeats the two ſinnes vpon the which damnation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
the firſt is inſidelitie, <hi>vvho beleeued not the trueth;</hi> the ſecond
is beleeuing of lies and vntruth, and all maner <hi>of vnrighteouſneſſe.</hi>
He joynes theſe two together, not beleeuing the trueth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
lies, and they go together neceſſarly: for if thou beleeue
not the trueth, of neceſſity thou ſhalt beleue vntrueth. If thy hart
repoſe not on God and his trueth, of neceſſity thy hart ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
on the deuill and vntruth; the hart cannot want ſome faith.

                  </gap>ſhal make this plaine. The hart of the creature cannot
ſtand alone, but eſpecially the hart of the ſinfull man cannot
ſtand vp, except it haue a leaning-ſtock or prop to vphold it.
The harts of all the kings of the earth cannot ſtand alone, but
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16659:230"/>
they muſt repoſe on ſomething:<note place="margin">Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>shart muſt ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtand on God, or on Satan.</note> for this is the difference betweene
God and the creature, God will ſtand him alone, he needes not a
foundation or leaning ſtock, as the creature needes: for it muſt
lean euer on ſomething or elſe it is impoſſible to it to ſtand. Now
there are two thinges whereon man repoſes, either man repoſes
himſelf on God &amp; his truth, or elſe on the deuil &amp; his falſhood. If
thou leanſt not on God on Ieſus Chriſt and his Goſpel, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
thy confidence ſhal be on Satan the Antichriſt, vanities, lies,
and falſhood. Wel then when thou haſt leand thee ouer on Satan
and lies thou wilt ſtand no longer nor does vanities and lies, yea
nor the deuill will ſtand, and he will not ſtand ay, albeit he haue
ſtrength for a time, yet he and vanity and lies ſhal fal downe and
thou ſhalt fal downe with them: for if thou be found leaning on
lies and on the Antichriſt thou ſhalt periſh with them.</p>
               <p>The word he vſes is to be marked. He ſayes not, they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued
lies, but <hi>they that had pleaſure in vnrighteouſneſſe.</hi> Euen as we
ſee and finde by experience repoſing on God and his trueth is
with a joy of the ſoule. So when a man is leaning on the deuill
and on vanitie he hes a kinde of pleaſure and delite in his repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
on them, but it is a falſe and deceitfull pleaſure, a fained
reſt and joy, and heere I take vp the plague of the hart (as I
did before of the mynde) when he makes the hart with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to reſt on Satan and vanitie, vvhen the hart is beatten with
a ſenſleſneſſe that it cannot grippe a ſolide thing, but grippes
vanitie, and leanes on it, as if it vvere a ſolide thing: vvhen it
thinkes fleeting vanitie to be ſolide, vvhen it is fleeting in the
Aire it beleues it be on the ground. So that the plague of the hart
is when it is made ſenſleſſe that it cannot grippe a ſolide thing
but vanitie and lies, and this plague is of Gods juſt judgement.
Marke then here the order. Wickednes and malice begins at the
hart firſt, ſo that when the truth is offred to the minde, the malice
of the hart oppugnes and will nor let it enter in the minde. Rom.
1. 28. Epheſ. 4. 18. vpon this God beattes firſt the minde and caſts
the man away in a reprobate ſenſe. But, lets he the hart alone? No,
the hart that beganne the miſcheefe eſcapes not, but he beattes
the hart that would no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to liue vpon lyes and vanities, and ere ſhe knovve of her ſelfe
ſhe and her leaning-ſtock ſhall be both beatten downe to Hell.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16659:230" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So beware of this malitiouſneſſe to the trueth: for if thou haue a

and therefore I caſt him away. Well ſince election commes
of loue, it is not without cauſe when we ſpeake to the elect that
we call them the beloued of God. This is a token of loue when
God hes elected a man from all eternitie, and there is not a man,
(looke to your experience) there is not one, I ſay, when they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eele their election, (for thou ſhould feele it and finde in thy
hart that thou art choſen of God) but they will feele it with
ſuch a joy and ſenſe of loue of him that hes choſen them as is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable:
for there is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>one gift of God but when we feele it
and conſider it, it brings with it a ſenſe of the loue of him that
gaue thee the gift, and it wakens vp the joy of the hart excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
What matter of the benefite, it with the benefit beſtowed
on vs the ſenſe of loue be not communicated: for the leaſt and
ſmalleſt benefit giuen with a ſenſe of loue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> not a great
benefit and gift without the ſenſe of loue. When God caſtes
a kingdome to a man in hatred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is no joy nor ſweetneſſe
in it, becauſe there is no ſenſe of loue; no if it were but a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell

Therefore whateuer God giues thee, be it little or much, labour
to feele that it is giuen of loue to thee: otherwayes there is no
true pleaſure or joy in it: for all true joy is when the loue of
God is ſhed abroad in the harts of men by the holy Spirit Rom.

and what meanes vſes he to call men by? Euen the Goſpell of
Ieſus Chriſt, which is the voice of God: For what is the word of
God but the voyce of God ſhouting and crying vpon thee? So
calling is by a word and voice. Now, calles he thee by the voyce
of the Law? No, long would thou haue lye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the voyce of the Law, the more it cry vpon thee, thou
wiltly the longer dead. What is the voice then? The ſweet voice
of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, when it is tolde to thee that the
Sonne of God is incarnate for thy ſake, he hes ſuffered and is
riſen that thou may get remiſſion of ſinnes and life euerlaſting:
in one word, the ſpeach of the croſſe of a dead man, it is the
ſpeach that puts life in thee, and ſo no faith without calling and
no calling without the voice of the Goſpell, and no life without
the voice of the Goſpell. Thou ſhalt neuer ſee the face of God
without thou heare the voice of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Yet marke. He ſayes, <hi>our Goſpell,</hi> that is, that I <hi>Paul</hi> and my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
laborers miniſtred. Then I aske, what is the mouth out of
the which the voice of the Goſpell ſounds, and by the which the
Lord calles the dead man: Euen the mouth of ſillie ſimple men;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16659:233"/>
and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> cals it his Goſpel. <hi>Pauls</hi> mouth <hi>Peters</hi> mouth,
and the mouth of all the faithfull miniſters are the voice of God
to the end of the world calling thee to faith, and therefore doe
they call this Goſpell their Goſpell. The Lord hes ſo ordeined
that without the mouthes of ſillie men no voice of God ſhould
be heard in the earth. Goe to thy chamber, read as thou wilt, thou
ſhalt nor come to Heauen if thou contemne the mouth of ſillie
men: for without the voice of ſillie men that ſoundes this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
there is no voice of God calling thee to faith. And therefore
without this baſe miniſtrie is no ſaluation for thee. I ſay
farther, If the mouth of this miniſtrie whereby the Lord ſpeaks
be contemned by thee, there is no faith, no life appointed for
thee God hes ſo bound himſelf to this miniſtrie, that if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
this ordinance thou ſhalt neuer ſee Heauen. He will haue
thee ſafe by a fooliſh preaching, or elſe thou ſhalt neuer ſee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
Say not might he not ſend Angels? No, cloſe thy mouth: for
by fooliſh preaching thou ſhalt be ſafe and by no other means.
Mark this ye that contemne the preaching of the word of God
out of the mouthes of ſillie men.</p>
               <p>Now in the end of the verſe he ſets downe another end of this
calling, the firſt end was faith: the other is the participation <hi>of the
glorie</hi> of Heauen <hi>in Ieſus Christ,</hi> all is in Chriſt, glorie is in him, ſo
thou ſhalt not get either grace or glorie if thou get not Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
this is an end both of election, and vocation, life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.
Election is from all eternitie, vocation is in tyme, and lyfe
euerlaſting followes as the onely effect and end of both. Now
the calling beginnes here, and what other thing is al our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but this, come to Ieſus Chriſt the Anchor of your faith and

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> exhortation

                  </gap>euere to the end. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is a prayer conceiued by the Apoſtle to God the Father and
to the Lord Ieſus, that it would pleaſe them firſt to comfort the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16659:234"/>
harts of the Theſſalonians, next to eſtabliſh them in euery good
word and worke.</p>
               <p>Then ſhortly to come to the text. We haue ſet downe in the
firſt words an exhortation to the Theſſalonians that they ſhould
ſtandfaſt. But firſt we ſhall conſider how this exhortation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
on the doctrine paſſing before. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſayes he. Then
it muſt be inferred by a conſequent vpon the doctrine precee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
The cauſe of their ſtanding and perſeuerance muſt be in
the text preceding, to wit, their eternal election to ſaluation, their
ſanctification, their faith in the trueth of Ieſus. their effectuall
calling to lyfe euer laſting, and the glorie of Chriſt: vpon theſe
grounds he inferres this; <hi>I herefore, brethren, ſtand faſt:</hi> as if he did
ſay, ſeeing ye are ſo ſure grounded, therefore ſtand faſt on your
ground. Then theleſſon is, when a man findes in his owne hart
that God hes choſen him to ſaluation from all eternitie, when
he findes he hes faith and the Spirite of ſanctification, and finds
the Lord from Heauen to call on him and to put out his hand
as it were, and to take him by the hand againe, and to leade him
forwarde to that ſaluation to the which he hes appoynted him
from all eternitie Then though Heauen ſhould fall and all the
world goe to ruine, though thouſands of men ſhould fall away
from the trueth at this tyme, yet it becommes him not once to
ſhudder, or to ſuffer himſelfe once to be ſhaken in the middes
of all confuſion, and that not throgh any confidence or ſtrength
in himſelfe (for then he will be beguilde) but onely through the
power of the grace of his God which he hes found in experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:
ground himſelf on that ground which we haue Rom. 11. 29. <hi>The
gifts and calling of God is vvithout repentance,</hi> if once the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to beſtow theſe ſpirituall bleſſings, and to call a perſon to
the glory of Chriſt effectually, Heauen and earth ſhall goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ere that perſon periſh.</p>
               <p>Now ere I goe further to the words I would ſolue a queſtion
that may fal out here. Hes not the Apoſtle euen now before cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
theſe Theſſalonians of their election from al eternitie out
of the which it followes neceſſarly that they are placed out of al
danger of finall defection: for it is impoſſible that they that are
elected from all eternity can fall away finallie and periſh: how
is it then that he exhortes them to ſtand conſidering this their
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16659:235"/>
ſure election is vnchangeable? I anſwere ſhortly. It is true the
choſen of God are placed outwith all danger of this defection,
vnto the which the reprobate is ſubject, and it is impoſſible that
they can fall away finallie. indeed they may haue their owne
ſtumblinges and ſtoppings; but as concerning their finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
it is a thing vnpoſſible that they can be ſubject to it by
vertue of their election: for, brethren, ſo many as are ordeined to
life, of neceſſity they are ordeined to finall perſeuerance; if thou
be ordeined to life, of neceſſitie thou muſt ſtand faſt to the end
in ſome meaſure: but it is as true on the other part that they that
are ordeined to perſeuerance they are ordeined to ſtand by ſuch
and ſuch meanes: and of theſe meanes this is one, exhortation;
another is, admonition; another is teaching; another rebuking,
(for if need be we ſhould rebuke, euen the choſen of God, and
threatten them) yea the prayers alſo of the Saints and Paſtors
are meanes to make the choſen to ſtand faſt. And failing theſe
meanes by the which the Lord hes ordeined that they ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere,
and eſpeciallie if thou contemne theſe meanes, exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
admonition, rebukes, doctrine, and prayers of the faithfull,
thou ſhalt faile of perſeuerance, and failing of perſeuerance thou
ſhalt fall finally away. And if thou fall finallie away, thou ſhalt
finde that thou wert neuer one of theſe that were choſen to life
euerlaſting. And therefore, brethren, ſeeing theſe are the means
of God to hold thee vp to the end till he glorifie thee, thou
ſhould be glad when thou art admoniſhed exhorted and taught,
for they are the tokens to thee of thy election if thou take
them in a good part. Beware then that ye contemne not any of
theſe meanes.</p>
               <p>Now to goe forward. When he hes exhorted them to ſtand
faſt, then immediatly he ſubjoines (as it were) the definition of
this ſtanding what it is. <hi>Standfast</hi> (ſayes he.) What is that? Hold
a faſt and a ſure grip. Whereof? <hi>of the doctrine I haue taught you
either by vvord or vvrit,</hi> ſtand faſt by it. Marke then. Ye ſee the
perſeuerance he craues is the perſeuerance in the faith, and in
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight of the word; the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt is the light of
the world, and perſeuerance in knowledge of this word is to
hold it faſt. To make this plaine. There are two ſorts of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance.
One is the perſeuerance in the trueth, in the Goſpell,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16659:235"/>
in the faith of Ieſus and in the light,<note place="margin">tvvo ſorts of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance.</note> and all theſe are one. There
is another perſeuerance, and that is an holy life, well doing, and
in a godly conuerſation. Marke them both: if ye will compare
them together, the firſt which is perſeuerance in faith or in
trueth muſt be the cauſe of the other, and the other is the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar
effect of it; where perſeuerance is in the light of neceſſitie
there is a perſeuerance in godlineſſe: for a man that perſeueres
in the light of neceſſity that man walketh in the hie way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in his action and maner of liuing, and muſt goe the direct
way to ſaluation; but once take away the light, and let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and contemne the light and veritie of Chriſts Goſpell, he
ſhall not goe one ſtop rightlie, but he ſhall decline from the hie
way. Take the Goſpell and the light of Chriſt out of his eyes
and hart, he ſhall neuer do one right action, he may ſeeme to be
good and haue a faire outward ſhowe, and his words may ſeeme
gliſtring, ſo that he ſhall not ſeeme to be a murtherer, a theefe, or
an harlot: but if the Goſpel be out of his hart, all is but hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
and there is nothing in his hand that pleaſes God, all is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
and his rewarde for all his faire doing ſhall be with
the hypocrites in Hell. So let not man pleaſure himſelfe in his
doing, if his eye be not ſet on Ieſus Chriſt ſhining in the Goſpel:
If he walke not in the light of Ieſus Chriſt, he is in the wrong
way when he thinkes he is in the righteſt way. Lord giue men
this grace that when they think they ſtand, they may grip to this
light of te Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Yet to marke more narrowly theſe wordes. <hi>Keepe,</hi> ſayes he,
hold a grip and ſtand faſt. How ſhall I ſtand? By keeping of a
grip, no ſtanding for man but by a gripping, if thou let thy grip
go fall ſhalt thou. Now what ſhall they grip? <hi>Doctrine,</hi> keepe
light, the beſt thing in the world is to keepe knowledge. There
is no ſtanding for men, except by keeping light and knowledge.
Yet what doctrine is this he willes them to keepe? He ſayes,
<hi>vvhich I haue deliuered and teached you.</hi> There is no ſtanding but
by gripping of doctrine. And what a doctrine? Euen the doctrin
of the Apoſtles, grip to it onely: For grip as faſt as thou wilt
to the traditions and vanities of men they will not all make thee
ſtand: for there is no ſtanding but by gripping of the doctrine
of the Apoſtles, <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> and the reſt of them, there is no ſtanding
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16659:236"/>
but on the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles.
<hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Epheſ. 2. 20. ſpeakes of their building, <hi>Being
builded,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles.</hi>
Thou ſhalt neuer be builded on Ieſus Chriſt, if thou be not buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and if that
be not, then there is no ſaluation for thee, goe to Spaine, goe to
Rome as thou wilt, thou haſt noght ado with Ieſus Chriſt if thou
ſtand not grounded on the doctrine of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
Then would ye ſee what ye call true perſeuerance in
faith?<note place="margin">VVhat is perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and apoſtaſie.</note> Euen that is true perſeuerance that is in the doctrine of
the Prophets and Apoſtles onely, and no more, and no leſſe.
Then what is Apoſtaſie that is contrare to perſeuerance? If per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance
be in keeping of the doctrine of the Apoſtles, then
that is Apoſtaſie when thou falles away from their doctrin. No,
brethren, the falling away from that Roman Antichriſt is no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie.
The Lord at his comming in that great day ſhall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
this, and ſhall judge that Church to be a falſe and an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Apoſtatike Church, and whoeuer joines with it if they
repent not, ſhall be adjudged that day to damnation; and they
that departs from it and ſtickes to the doctrine of the Prophets
and Apoſtles ſhall be judged to be the holy ones of God.</p>
               <p>Now followes in the end of the verſe two ſortes of teaching
of them, that the Apoſtle vſed. The firſt is by word, when he
ſpoke to them face to face. The other is by his Epiſtle. The leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is eaſie. Men are taught aſwell by writ as word, all teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not tied to the perſonall preſence of men. No, men are as
ſurely taught by writ as by word. And ſeeing it hes pleaſed the
Lord to ſhowe this mercy on vs that the writtes of the Apoſtles
are comde in our hands, which are read in your audience, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we haue <hi>Paul</hi> to be a teacher to vs aſwell as the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
had. Therefore conclude ſurely that it is not ſo much this
Miniſter or that Miniſter teaches you, as it is the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
and Chriſt Ieſus in him: for euery Miniſter is not ſo guyded as
he was the miniſters may erre and hes erred, but the Apoſtles
could not erre: for they were immediatly called of Ieſus Chriſt,
and were in their writting direct fully by the holy Spirit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
think that ye haue the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt to be your
teachers, and as for a Miniſter if he goe a ſtray breadth off that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:16659:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ground of the Apoſtles, he teaches falſe doctrine; and ſo the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
teachers that we haue are the olde Prophets and Apoſtles
that cannot erre. Thinke it not a ſmall mercy that the Lord hes
made their writs to come to vs; and no doubt Chriſt when he
tooke good-night of the Apoſtles had reſpect to this. Matt. 28.
chap. 19. verſ. <hi>Goe your vvay and teach all nations, baptizing them
in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, and loe I am
vvith you vntill the end of the vvorld:</hi> as he would ſay, ye in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſhall bide and liue till I come againe, if not in your perſons,
yet in your writte, and I ſhall accompanie your writte, as I did
accompany your perſons in the world: and ſurely the Spirit of
Chriſt accompanies this ſame writ and word as euer he did their
dreſence on earth.</p>
               <p>Now I will anſwere one doubt that he ere occurres before I
go forward. Ye that hes red any thing knowes that the aduerſars
preaſes to make aduantage of this place, keepe that that I haue
taught you by word or writ: Then cry they out traditions, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
The Apoſtles, ſay they, hes left traditions beſides their
writs, verities vnwritten, and therefore as great credite ſhould
be giuen to them as to the written verity, and they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
with as great reuerence as their writs. Brethren, it is true
the words importes a diuerſity, but if ye will looke well about
you ye ſhall find that there is no diuerſity in the matter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
but onely in the maner and forme of teaching: as if he
ſhould haue ſaid, Keep that which I haue teached you either by
word or writ, which is all one thing: for that which I ſpoke I
wrote, and that which I wrote I ſpok; this is certaine. But giuing
this to them, ſupponing the Apoſtle had ſpoken ſomething
which he had not written at this time, what is it to the purpoſe?
<hi>Ergo</hi> wrote he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not afterward? Supponing the Apoſtle had not
written this whole doctrine to the Theſſalonians, yet wrote he
it not to the Romans, Epheſians, &amp;c? and in one word, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpoke nothing by mouth which he regiſtred not in writte.
The ſame doctrine he ſpoke by mouth, the ſame he left in regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in writ to be red by the world.</p>
               <p>Now then to return to the matter. When he hes ended the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
he ſubjoines prayer, and the ſame perſeuerance he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
them to, he begs to them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hands of God. Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, al

exhortation,<note place="margin">Teaching vvithout the ſpirite povverl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

moue not the hart and affections of men all is but vanity and
winde. Now the meane ye ſee to get the Spirit to the preaching
and hearing of the word, is prayer. And therefore take the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
A man ſhould neuer preach nor heare preaching but the eie
of his ſoule ſhould be lifted vp to him that is able onely to giue
the power and increaſe: In preaching the Miniſter ſhould be
begging power, and the people praying and ſaying, Lord as this
is thy word, which is thy power vnto ſaluation, ſo by thy Spirit
make it powerfull in me. If thy eye be on the man, and thy hart
be not lifted vp to God, thou ſhalt goe as empty home as thou
came abroad. Therefore ſet thy eye and hart on him who is only
able to giue power to thy life, and vpon him who giues only con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſolation
when thou haſt need, and finally on him that giues ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
to all that beleues aright, to wit, the Lord Ieſus: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him there is no grace to be beſtowed on man, be what he wil.
Prayer is the meane to get the preſence of the Spirit concurring
with the word: for the word, without grace and power be giuen
to it to open the hart, is powerfull to cloſe the hart. The Goſpell
is an inſtrument to obdure thy hart, if it be heard without praier
to God and preſence of his Spirit. Therefore pray that in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ye may vnderſtand, and that ye may walke according to the
knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>Now then to come to the wordes. There are three thinges in
this prayer. Firſt, the perſons to whom it is directed: The ſecond
is the arguments whereby he will aſſure the Theſſalonians that
the praier ſhal be granted to them. And the laſt is, the things that
he prayes for to them. To come to the perſons, <hi>I pray,</hi> ſayes he,
<hi>the Lord Ieſus Christ.</hi> He names him firſt, for the ſweetneſſe of
grace he had found in him euer ſince firſt he knew him; his ſoule
was ſo filled with the ſwetnes of Chriſt that in nothing he could
forget him, neither in his praier nor exhortations to others, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one that is touched with ſuch a feeling of Chriſt will doe:
Know ye not this ye that make a glorious profeſſion of Chriſt?

There then the two perſons which are the two fountaines of all
grace that comes to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world. Mark here a double honor
giuen to Chriſt. Firſt he is joined with the Father as a fontaine of
all grace, and next he is firſt named: for he ſayes, <hi>I pray the Lord
Ieſus:</hi> and then he ſayes, <hi>and God our Father.</hi> He puts the Father in
the ſecond rowme,<note place="margin">Ieſus Chriſt god equal vvith the Father.</note> albeit in other places he puts God the father
in the firſt rowme, as ye may finde in all his ſalutations. Now
what muſt followe on this? Euen this, that Ieſus Chriſt is very
God, as he is very man, coeſſential of the ſame nature with God,
coequall, of the ſame dignity and majeſtie with the Father, and
coeternall with him; if this were not, he could not haue giuen
him ſuch a ſtyle without blaſphemy againſt God. The olde He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes
thought they got a great aduantage of ſuch places of the
Scripture that placed the Father in the firſt rowme, to conclude
that Ieſus Chriſt was not onely inferior, but far vnequall to God
the Father, and eſpecially they gather it out of theſe wordes, I
baptiſe thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
ſay they, the Sonne is inferiour. But looke here and ye will finde
that Chriſt is named in the firſt rowme. That olde doctor <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
when he hes reaſoned againſt this fond opinion, at laſt he
concludes. They are equall in eternitie, dignitie and in euerie
thing, that is, or may be called truely God. Indeed the Father is
the firſt perſon, but that makes not that the Father is aboue the
Sonne; for there is equalitie in dignity and eſſence, and therefore
he whiles puts the one before the other, and that not in reſpect
of any ſupremacy, but to teſtifie that Ieſus Chriſt our Sauior and
the Father is one, and equall in euery reſpect.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the argumentes which are not ſet downe ſo
much to mooue God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to aſſure the Theſſalonians that the
thinges ſhall be granted that he craues for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The arguments
are from the effects of God. Firſt, <hi>Who hes loued vs.</hi> Secondly, <hi>vvho
hes giuen vs euerlaſting conſolation:</hi> And the laſt, who hes giuen vs
<hi>good hope,</hi> and all <hi>throgh grace</hi> and mercy, contrare vnto our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing.
Marke, bethren, a generall. He bringes theſe Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16659:238"/>
to remembrance of theſe graces of God beſtowed on
them before,<note place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to aſſure vs, that, God vvill gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vs bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits craued in prayer.</note> to aſſure them, the Lord wil grant them theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
he praies for to them. When God begins to ſhow his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
on men, or, wemen, and in Ieſus Chriſt to powre out his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
vpon them, he giues, as it were, an obligation ſubſcriued
with his own hand, I ſhall be with you for euer, neuer man bond
himſelf as the Lord binds himſelfe: from once he begin to deale
mercifully with vs, if he begin once to giue vs faith in Ieſus chriſt
and to miniſter that inward conſolation, and to giue vs hope of
life euerlaſting, in ſo doing he giues vs an obligation that that
mercy ſhall continue with vs for euer. Therefore mark the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God giuen to thee and neuer forget them: for they vvill
hold thee vp. That God that hes comforted thee once ſhal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
thee for euer: He is not like man, <hi>I am,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>Iehoua,</hi> not
changeable; and therefore, ground thy hart on that vnchangable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of God. For, he, who hes once begunne with thee to giue thee
mercy, aſſure thy ſelf, he ſhal not leaue thee. How was <hi>Dauid</hi> and
the godly of olde, holden vp, but, by this ſame obligation? Would
euer any of the olde fathers haue ſtood without this? No. There
only prop &amp; vp-hold was the experience of the mercy of God
once ſhowne on them, and diligently remembred by them.</p>
               <p>Now, to come to the particulare. <hi>Who hes loued vs,</hi> not as a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
does a creature,<note place="margin">The firſt Gods loue</note> but, as the father does the ſon, that is an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
degree of loue; for, he called him Father, immediatly before,
then, he ſubjoines, he loued vs. Brethren, would ye come to the
thinges we haue of God, throgh Chriſt? The firſt is grace, mercy,
and free fauour: He is bound to no creature, but, what euer he
giues, he giues it freely. The firſt bleſſing, that God beſtowes on
man on earth, and the firſt effect of grace and of his free fauor, is
loue (this loue is giuen to make the creature to powr out, as it wer,
the hart on his Creator againe) He hes loued vs, ere euer we
wer, of this loue proceeds eternal election, as ye may read, in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
places of the new Teſtament. This loue ſtayes not here, but,
after, he bringes vs in the world at his owne appointed tyme, he
makes the loue, that was in his hart, before all tyme towardes vs,
to break out, and he ſheds it abroad, in our harts. And the firſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of it is our effectuall calling. He will ſay, Come hither out of
the foule pollution of the world, and I wil exceme thee from the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16659:238"/>
damnable end of the world, and ſo, from thence forth, mercy
hes no end, but, from calling he proceeds to juſtification; from
juſtification, to regeneration; and laſt, to glorification. So, the
firſt thing God giues thee, is his hart and harty loue. He will not
giue thee any of theſe bleſſinges, that are in Ieſus Chriſt, vntill
with them he giue thee his hart: He is not like man who will
giue thee a faire countenance alone, and will take no further
thought what become of thee, but God will giue thee his hart, as
the firſt gift, and giuing thee his hart, what can he deny thee?
When he hes giuen thee his hart, can he deny thee life? And
therefore, Rom. 5. 5. it is ſaid, <hi>that, the loue of God is ſhed abroad in vs,
by his holy Spirit.</hi> Now, as he embraces vs with loue, Lord if we
could meete him with halfe loue againe. <hi>We cannot loue him, except
he loue vs firſt. 1. Iohn 4. 19.</hi> There is none that loues him, but he
that hes the ſenſe of Gods loue in his hart furniſhed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God. O, the joy and conſolation in the hart, when it findes
the Lords hart powred out on it! And without this ſenſe of
Gods loue towardes thee, fy on thee, if thou wert a king for all
thy kingdomes, if thou wert ruler ouer all, fy on thy glorie and
pleaſure: for, all the things vnder Heauen may well miniſter to
thee a falſe joy and peace in thy hart, but they ſhall neuer giue
thee the true joy: for there is no true joy but through the ſenſe
of the loue of God in thy hart. So there is the firſt gift and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereby he aſſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe Theſſalonians that the thinges
he askes for them ſhall be graunted to them without all doubt.</p>
               <p>The next argument is, <hi>And hes giuen vs conſolation eternall.</hi> In
this word he ſummes vp all the bleſſinges giuen to man in Ieſus
Chriſt in tyme,<note place="margin">The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is eternall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> our effectuall calling, our juſtification through
his righteouſneſſe, forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and an acceptation in
his fauor, our ſanctification by his Spirit, the reſurrection of the
bodie, and life eternal in glorie: al theſe we haue in him to whom
<hi>Paul</hi> maks this prayer. So all the bleſſinges of God commes and
meetes in the hart of man as in a centre: they end all in conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
our effectual calling ends in conſolation, our juſtifying ends
in conſolation. Therefore, ſayes <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom 5. 1. <hi>Being iustified by
faith vve haue peace tovvard God.</hi> Then in one word. As all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
beginnes at the hart of God, and at that loue he powres our
on vs, ſo al bleſſing ends in our hart. The beginning is Gods, the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16659:239"/>
end is ours, and our end is this, that peace that paſſes all vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:
This loue of God is as a floode through the which
ſlowes downe all theſe bleſſinges beſtowed on vs which are as
as many ſprings and conduits comming from that great and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
loue of God and entering once in vpon our harts
wakens vp an infinite and vnſpeakable joy in vs: For from
once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the loue of God touch the hart, there flowes
ſuch a conſolation as is vnſpeakable. The Lord of Heauen
giue euery one earneſtneſſe to ſeeke this conſolation: for it is
the arleſpenny of theſe euerlaſting joyes which once we ſhall
haue in Heauen throgh Ieſus Chriſt. He calles it <hi>eternall,</hi> becauſe
it is a fontaine that neuer is ſtopped, it neuer goes dry, but euer
runnes, when the fountaine euer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>mes the riuer that runnes
from it will neuer goe dry. And therefore when that fountaine
of loue in the hart of God commes in thy hart, thy conſolation
muſt laſte for euer, his loue running down in thy hart makes thy
joy euerlaſting. The thinges of this world when thou getteſt
them will waken vp ſome joy in thy hart, but that joy which
thou haſt the day thou wilt want to morrow, for it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent:
but as for that joy which proceeds of the loue of God,
it hes no end, it is eternall; and therefore they that will ſeeke
conſolation in Ieſus ſhal neuer haue an end of joy. Indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
this our joy ſeemes to be troubled heere, becauſe it is
compaſſed with many croſſes and afflictions, but the Lord from
tyme to tyme makes our joy ſenſible, and wakens it vp in vs, and
when thou ſhalt be in Heauen thou ſhalt haue an endles conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
without any viciſſitude or alteration for euer. Seek then I
pray you for this loue of God, as ye wold be euerlaſtinglie bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with this joy vnalterable.</p>
               <p>Now, the third benefite is <hi>good hope.</hi> He calles it good, becauſe
it is of the beſt thing,<note place="margin">The third, good hope</note> that euer was, that is, it is of that cheefe
felicitie: for, vvhat is it vve hope for? Euen, that conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our cheefe and euerlaſting felicitie vvith our God vve
hope for that poſſeſſion of the glorie of our Lord Ieſus, and
therefore, it is not vvithout reaſon, that, it is called <hi>good hope.</hi>
Wherefrom flowes it? Euen, as conſolation flowes from loue,
ſo, hope flowes from conſolation, Rom. 15. 4. and conſolation is
as an arleſpenny, that, God puttes in thy hand, that thou ſhalt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:16659:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>
get the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> full payment of the whole ſumme. And therefore, it wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
vp thy hart to hope, ſo, that when I get a peece of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I am induced to hope certainely, that, that Lord, that hes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
me that arleſpenny ſhal not leaue me, till he fil my hart with
the fulneſſe of conſolation: for, the ſaciety: and full contentment
is not, till we ſee Chriſt face to face, and vntill this tyme we muſt
liue by hope.</p>
               <p>In end, he ſayes, all theſe thinges are <hi>by grace.</hi> Loue is by
grace, conſolation is by grace, hope is by grace, that is, of the
free fauour of God, without any deſert, or, merite, on mans part.
And it is vvell vvith vs, that it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

day, and ſhall not attaine, to that inheritance, that, thou looked

vpon the free fauor and mercy of God to vs, in Ieſus Chriſt. All
the vvorld ſhall not louſe this ground.</p>
               <p>In the laſt verſe, vve haue the thinges he prayes for, to theſe
Theſſalonians: I pray the Lord Ieſus Chriſt and God, euen, our
Father, that they would <hi>comfort your harts.</hi> The next, <hi>eſtabliſhe

                  <note place="margin">Praier for conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Theſe are
the tvvo thinges he prayes for, conſolation and perſeuerance in
well doing. Hes he not ſaid before, that, God the father had giuen
them eternall conſolation, what is the crauſe, then, he praies for it,
as though they had not gotten it? He ſayes, he hes giuen vs eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16659:240"/>
conſolation, and now he ſayes, I pray the Lord Ieſus that he
would comfort you. How can theſe two ſtand? Mark, brethren,
This he ſayes, to tell vs that conſolation is gotten by praier, look
the neceſſity of prayer. If there be no prayer at no tyme, there
is no conſolation; that man that cannot pray to God and beg
comfort at his hand, that manifeſt neuer ſpirituall conſolation
in his hart. Goe to experience. I poſe thee in thy conſcience, felt
thou euer comfort without prayer? No, if there be not prayer
to God, thou ſhalt haue no comfort: and more, if there be not
continuance in prayer, thou ſhalt get no continuance in conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
Leaueſt thou off prayer, looke whether conſolation will
leaue thy hart, or, not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Leaueſt thou off, in prayer to meditate on
Ieſus Chriſt, I poſe the, whether the conſolation in the hart leaues
thee, or, not? Againe, ſtriueſt thou to keepe that preſence of Ieſus
Chriſt, by prayer, and in all thy exerciſes, caſtes a blenke to Ieſus
Chriſt, (be not ſo exerciſed, that thou forget Ieſus Chriſt) haſt
thou thy eyes euer on Ieſus, by prayer and meditation, wilt thou
not finde a joy and ſwetnes in thy hart, ſuch, as thou cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to expres? Againe, when thou art ſo fixt on the things in this
world, yea euen in thy lawfull exerciſe (for, in thy lownry, thou
cannot haue an eye to God) that thou cannot get a peece of thy
hart to God, it may be that thou haue a carnall and falſe joy:
but, true joy and comfort haſt thou not. Well, then, brethren, that
peace and conſolation flowes of prayer and earneſt meditation
in Ieſus. Therefore, as the Apoſtle ſayes, Philip. 4. 6. 7. <hi>Be not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list
for any thing, but in euerything<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let thy requeſts be ſhovven forth
to God and that, by all maner of prayer and ſupplication;</hi> and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

ſhalt finde, <hi>the peace of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that paſſes all vnderſtanding ſhall ſtand
about thee, as a guard,</hi> and what lakeſt thou, if thou haſt that peace
and tranquillity of thy ſoule? And what haſt thou, if thou lakeſt
this peace? Now, fy on al, if thou lake this guarde of Gods peace,
if thou wert a king, or, Monarch, abounding in riches, pleaſure
and honour, what ſhall all auaile thee? So, he drawes conſolation,
from God, by prayer. And as it is ſure, that, euery thing, that liues,
hes the being and continuance of God. So, it is as ſure, that, that
perſon that is diſpoſed to pray keepes and ſhall keepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
preſence and peace of God, that paſſes all vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16659:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Therefore, the Lord diſpoſe our harts to pray, that by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
we may keepe ſome meditation and preſence of Ieſus Chriſt
in our harts. Kings will leaue their kingdomes; Lords, their lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippes,
and euerie man will leaue this world and all, that is
vvithin it; but, vvoe to that man, vvhom God leaues, when the
world leaues him.</p>
               <p>The next thing he prayes for, is, that, the Lord would <hi>eſtabliſh
them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Praier for perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> as we ſay, ſettle them, and make them firme and ſtable,
not changing and wagging, as the buſſe wagges, and ſo, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in their religion, but, that they be ſettled. Ye heard, wherein
ſtood our perſeuerance. It ſtood in holding a faſt grippe of the
Apoſtles doctrine, the trueth of God. Now, here, I finde more,
He prayes to God and Ieſus Chriſt, that, they would eſtabliſhe
them, that is, hold a grippe of them. So, that, in our perſeuering,
there muſt be two things, of neceſſitie. The one, is, thy hand muſt
be feſtned, or, elſe, thou wilt fall: for, there was neuer one, that
had not his hart feſtned vpon the trueth of Ieſus Chriſt, by hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a grip of it, but he fell downe to Hell. The other thing. The
Lord muſt hold a grippe of thee, or, elſe, thou cannot be able to
keepe thy grip; ſo, thou muſt grippe and God muſt grip thee;
thou muſt ſtand on a fundation, which is Ieſus Chriſt, and the
Lord God himſelf muſt hold thee on thy fundation: for, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
thy feet will ſlip off the ground: So, euer ſay, Lord, hold me
on this ground and fundation, or, elſe, I wil not be able to ſtand
one moment.</p>
               <p>Now, then, to come to the fundations, whereon we muſt
ſtand, and whereon the Lord muſt eſtabliſh vs: they are theſe,
firſt, <hi>euerie vvord</hi> of this trueth: and next, <hi>euerie good vvorke.</hi> Ye
may ſee, there are two fundations heere, whereon thou muſt
ſtand: for, he that would ſtand to the end, muſt haue his feete ſet
a ſpar-waies, he muſt not ſtand on a ſlippery place, nor on one
foote onely, but, he muſt haue a ſure ground, and muſt ſtand on
both his feete, and euery foot muſt haue the own ground-ſtone
to ſtand on, and the firſt ground is the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt.
Therefore, firſt, lift thy right foot and ſet it on the trueth of God,
the Goſpell of Ieſus. The next ground is holineſſe of life and
good works flowing from the former; then, take thy left foote
and ſet it on holineſſe of lyfe and euery good worke, and then,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16659:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both thy feete ſtands ſure. I ſhal make this plaine. There are two
things in man, the hart and the hand. The man, that would ſtand,
muſt haue hart and hand both faſtned. The hart muſt be firſt
faſtned and locked on the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, and that, by
the lock and bond of faith; and next, the hand muſt be faſtned
too, and it muſt grip firſt to euerie good turne; thinke it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neugh,
to haue thy hart exerciſed. If thy hand be idle, or, doing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill:
(for, if thy hand be not well exerciſed, it ſhall be doing euil)
keepe theſe two faſt then, thy hart, on the word of God, and thy
hand on euery good worke, and then, firmely ſhalt thou ſtand.
Theſe two are ſo joyned together, that, they cannot be ſeuered:
for, if thou ſix thy hart on the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
thy hand ſhall be exerciſed in well doing; keepſt thou one
of them, thou keepſt both; loſeſt thou one of theſe two, thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
both: for, it ſhall paſſe thy power to haue a good turne in
thy hand, if thou want the Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus in thy hart.
As, by the contrare, hant euill doing, and then, come to heare the
Goſpell, in deſpyte of thy hart, thou ſhalt not get the Goſpell
within thy hart, but, thou ſhalt want Chriſt. Therefore, as thou
would keepe one, keepe both, and ſtriue to faſten thy hart and
hand on both, and I ſhall aſſure thee, in the name of Ieſus Chriſt,
that, he wil hold his hand to thee, and ſtand ſhalt thou faſt to the
end, vntill thou be put out of all danger: For, when once thou
art brought to the mark, and comes to the rinkes end, then, thou
ſhalt be out of all feare and danger: For, there is no defection in
Heauen, no falling, nor, ſtumbling there: but, an euerlaſting ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
when this mirrour is away, and we ſhal ſee our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Ieſus, face to face. Therefore, as the Apoſtle praies
for ſtabilities, to theſe Theſſalonians; Euen ſo, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
Ieſus Chriſt and God the father, to keepe
vs on this ſolide foundation for euer and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
and let euery one of you pray for
the ſame, in the name of Ieſus. To
whom, with the Father and
holy Spirit, be all praiſe

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle (brethren) hes comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
theſe Theſſalonians againſt the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictiones

there ſhould interueene a great thing, to wit, an vniuerſall
apoſtaſie and falling away from the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, which
ſhould take a long tyme in growing and in the decaying, and ſo
ere the Lord ſhould returne it ſhould be a long tyme. Thereafter
he comforts them againſt this Apoſtaſie, the comming and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiling

eſtabliſh them to the end. Yet he exhorts them to ſtand, and be
carefull of it: for a ſleeping man will not ſtand: the Lord hes not
appointed ſtanding for a ſlouthfull man; negligent bodies muſt
of neceſſitie fall. But as he hes appointed ſtanding to his owne,
ſo he hes appointed them to be carefull of it, and to vſe meanes
to procure their ſtanding. And therefore he falles out in prayer,
and beſeeches God the father and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt that he
would hold vp this people, and comfort them.</p>
               <p>Now ſhortly to come to the text red. In this laſt chapter we
haue the laſt part of the Epiſtle, wherein the Apoſtle giues out
admonitions and preceptes concerning good maners and a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
behauiour: for a bare knowledge of Chriſt, a pretended
faith, a profeſſion outward is nothing worth, except that a man
that ſayes he hes faith in his hart, can teſtifie it in his doing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world, God counts not of it. Now the firſt admonition
concernes prayer: for it is one of the chief dueties that the Lord
craues of man, and it is a duetie of the firſt Table whereby the
Lord is honoured. Therefore the Apoſtle begins his admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at prayer, and deſires them to pray: and becauſe immediatly
before he prayed for them, therefore he deſires them to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
him in that part, that they ſhould doe a mutuall duety to
him, to pray for him and <hi>Syluanus.</hi> Ere I goe further marke the
leſſone. Euen as all dueties and offices among Chriſtian men
ſhould be mutuall: (for he that does a good turne to another,
ſhould receiue a good turne of another; he that loues thee
ſhould be loued againe of thee.) Euen ſo there is a mutual duety
craued in praying. If one prayes to God for another, that other
is bound to pray for his well againe, and eſpecially this duetie
is craued betweene Paſtor and people. The Paſtor ſhould pray
for the people, and the people ſhould pray for the Paſtor. The
Paſtor ſhould begin, the people ſhould follow the example of
the Paſtor: for the people is bound to recompence the good
doing of the Paſtor; for the whole duetie of the people to the
Paſtor is called a recompence, as the duety of the childe to his
parent is but a recompence for the good deeds receiued of the
parent. It is euen ſo with the people and the Paſtor: All that the
people does to the Paſtor is but a recompence. 2. Cor. 6. 13. he
ſayes, <hi>As children I ſpeake to you, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> a recomtence:</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16659:242"/>
I craue of you but a recompence, onely rander a duety for
that I haue done to you.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the words. <hi>Pray for vs,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>brethren.</hi> There
are two things in the words following,<note place="margin">Paul cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues praier, bothe for the Goſpel, &amp; for the ministers thereof.</note> in reſpect of which they
ſhould pray for <hi>Paul, Syluanus,</hi> and <hi>Timotheiu.</hi> Firſt, he deſires
them to pray, in reſpect of that Goſpell that was concredite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them: Then againe, he deſires them to pray for him in reſpect
of their perſons. Marke then the order. When he deſires that
they ſhould pray for him, he deſires not firſt that they ſhould
pray for the good eſtate of his perſon, but to pray for him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of that commiſſion he had of the Goſpel of the Lord Ieſus
concredite to him, and ſo he deſires them rather to pray for the
Goſpel then for himſelf. The leſſon is eaſy. A paſtor or preacher
after the example of <hi>Paul</hi> is bound to care for the Goſpell more
nor for his own life. Then after the Goſpell let him come on and
care for his perſon. But marke this, that his care of his perſon be
for the Goſpels ſake. Brethren, the Goſpell of Chriſt is not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined
for the Miniſter or Prophet, nor for the Apoſtle or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
what euer he be, to be a ſeruant to him, that he may make his
vantage by it, to ſeeke himſelfe by it; but the Miniſter is ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for the Goſpell to be a ſeruant to it: for the Goſpell is an
hundreth thouſand times worthier then he, if he were the beſt
preacher that euer ſpoke. Therefore that man muſt ſin greatly
in the heigheſt degree that will teach the Goſpell, not ſo much
for the Goſpels ſake, as for his owne ſake, that by it he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
his dignitie and lyfe. It is true indeede, the Miniſter
ſhould liue by the Goſpell, and ſhould be entertained by it, yet
his liuing ſhould not be the end of his preaching, but his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhould be the end vvherefore he ſhould deſire to breath,
eate, and liue.</p>
               <p>Againe to come to the words. <hi>That the vvord of the Lord may
haue a free paſſage, and be glorified.</hi> Concerning the word of God
he deſires two thinges. The firſt, is, that, it may run through the
world, and haue a free paſſage in running. The next, is, that it
may be glorified. The firſt is leſſe then the other, to wit, to run,
to haue a courſe: The next is greater, to be glorified in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that is to ſay, in running to be povverfull, to be mightie
and effectuall in the hearts of the hearers, to turne them to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16659:243"/>
God, and to reforme and renue them according to the Image of
God; and ſo, conſequently, to be glorified in the ſight of the
world. To make this more plaine. There are two ſortes of the
running of the Goſpell. There is one ſort, when it runnes onely
through the mouthes and eares of men, and no further, when
there is nothing but a bare hearing and ſpeaking of it. There is
another ſort, when it runnes through the harts of men, that is,
when in her courſe ſhe is powerfull in the harts, to worke a true
faith in them, working ſanctification, an altering and changing
of the ſoule, and reforming the harts of men, and conforming
them to the Image of God. As concerning the firſt, ſhe gets no
glorie, nor honor, but ſhe is rather ſtayned by it. As to the other,
ſhe runnes with glory and majeſtie, and ſhe is caried throgh the
world, like a glorious Queene, and is magnified by men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
Now among whom is ſhe glorified, and among whom is
ſhe defamed? When ſhe is powerfull in men to ſanctification,
there ſhe is glorified; who euer liues holily glorifies the Goſpel;
and when men hes nothing but a bare word of it, and liues li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſly
and wickedly, then the Goſpell is defamed and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by theſe men, as the Apoſtle witneſſes, Rom. 2. 24. out of
the 52. of <hi>Eſay. For your ſakes,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>my name is blaſphemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the nations all the day long.</hi> Then they who liues a life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare
to the Goſpell of Ieſus, they ſhame the Goſpell, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in the world to come they ſhall receiue ſhame, for ſhaming
of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>In the end of the verſe, he ſayes, <hi>as it is vvith you.</hi> To moue
them to this purpoſe to pray for him, or rather for the Goſpell,
he brings in their own example and experience. Theſſalonians.
I wiſh you not to pray for another thing but that ye haue expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented
your ſelues; ſee whether or not the Goſpell be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
among you? yea it is glorified. Ye are not bare profeſſors of
it: then are ye not bound to pray the Lord to communicate to
other that grace that is beſtowed on you? So they who findes
the Goſpell glorified in themſelues, and findes her powerfull in
their harts to a ſanctified lyfe, are bound to wiſh and craue this
bleſſing to euery ſoule. if it were poſſible. Wherefore ſhall I
haue a grace if I pray not to God to communicate that grace to
another? Wherefore ſhould I enter in Heauen and not put out
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16659:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my hand to helpe others to that kingdome, if it be poſſible?
Wherefore ſhould I not pray, thy kingdome come? which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in effect, but, Lord, open Heauen to thy people, and let
many enter in, that thou may be glorified. And it is moſt certaine,
that,<note place="margin">col.</note> if a man haue entered himſelfe in Heauen, he will not inuy
to haue others with him; but he will ſtryue to make rowme, if
it were to all the world, that they may enter in. He will not be
like the Phariſies that will not enter in Heauen themſelues, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet will let others enter in it. A man that is once in the light
he would haue all in the light. As a man that is in darkneſſe
would haue all in darkneſſe with him.</p>
               <p>Now in the next verſe he deſires them to pray for his owne
perſon, and for the reſt of his fellow-laborers, that they <hi>may be
deliuered from vnreaſonable and euill men.</hi> Marke ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we enter in the words. Ye ſee the next care is of himſelfe,
that he may be fred from his enemies. The thing that man ſhold
care for next after the Goſpell that worthy thing, ſhould be, the
perſon of the men that caries this Goſpell before the world: for
when ſhe runnes, ſhe is borne vp in the harts and mouthes of
men: ſo next her ſelfe, there ſhould be a ſpecial care had of them
that beares that glorious Queene, that they that ſees her may
be ſafe. Next that Heauenly treaſure the Goſpell, that is, the
vnſearchable riches of Ieſus Chriſt, care (I ſay) ſhould be had
of the laime veſſell, wherein it is contained. 2. Cor. 4. 7. A man
is but a laime veſſell, wherein the Lord puts ſo rich a treaſure.
But wherefore ſhould there be a care of him? Euen for the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
ſake, for that pretious things ſake. The perſon himſelfe or
the Miniſter is bound to care for his owne perſon in reſpect of
the treaſure: And the people to whom he diſtributes ſo preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a treaſure, is bound, as euer any man was bound to any thing
to haue a ſpeciall care of the perſon of the Paſtor for the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
ſake: for if he haue this treaſure, they will get more good
of him, nor he will get by any benefite in this world that they
can beſtow on him. God himſelfe for his treaſures ſake, ere he
ſuffer the veſſell to be broken,<note place="margin">Mark the great care God hes of his paſtors.</note> he will mingle Heauen and earth
together, and ſtupifie the world with wonders, and by wonders
he will worke the deliuery of the man in whom he hes put his
treaſure: ſo long as he hes adoe with him for the diſperſing and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:16659:244"/>
diſtributing of his treaſure, for the ſaluation of men, Heauen and
earth ſhall goe together ere that man periſh. Was not <hi>Peter</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
in a ſtrate priſon, were there not watches within and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
without, was not the doore locked, was he not in irons? (Act.
12.) and yet in the night an Angell is ſent from Heauen, and he
commes in the houſe with an exceeding light, and calles vpon
<hi>Peter,</hi> and bids him riſe, he ſhakes off his fetters, the doores are
made open, and all without doing of any man, the watches per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues
not, <hi>Peter</hi> eſcapes. Wherefore does he this? <hi>Peter</hi> vvas a
veſſell in the which the Lord had his treaſure. This veſſell was
not yet emptied of the treaſure. The Lords worke was yet in
<hi>Peters</hi> hand: but as ſoone as <hi>Peter</hi> had finiſhed his worke he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him to die without much adoe: ſo did he with <hi>Paul:</hi> for
albeit oft-tymes before wonderfully he deliuered him, yet when
he hes done his worke with him, the Lord let him goe his way,
and ſuffer without any miracle. So long as the Lord hes ought
adoe with any man, all the world ſhall not be able to to beat him
off his ſeete, he hes ſuch a care of him Now to end this, I dare ſay
and affirme, they that hes no care of the perſons of men whom
the Lord vſes to be his mouth, to preach this his Goſpell, that
they had neuer care of the Goſpell it ſelfe. If thou haſt no care of
the preacher, praiſe the Goſpell as thou wilt, thou art an enemy
to the Goſpell. He that would breake the veſſell he would ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all the riches of Ieſus Chriſt that is in that veſſell, that is, he
would make a loſe of the glorious riches of the Goſpell. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vvhen ye haue adoe vvith this baſe miniſtrie it is not vvith
men that ye haue to doe, but vvith the treaſures of Heauen
and vnſearchable riches of God. Lord if men novv vvould once
conſider this.</p>
               <p>Now to the words. <hi>Pray for me,</hi> ſayes he, and my fellow-labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
And wherefore that we may be deliuered in our owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
was he in any danger at this tyme, wherefore he craues their
prayer? Appearandly he was in his journey towards Ieruſalem,
and ſo he was to go among as many Tygers, Lyons and Wolfes,
as he found in experience: and out of the way as he was in his
journey he craues that they would pray for him: Ye will ſay,
got he not fore-warnings eneugh, that nothing was abiding him
but bondes at Ieruſalem? Yes <hi>Agabus</hi> tolde him that, Act. 21. 11.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16659:244"/>
Then what needed him to deſire the Theſſalonians to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that, that of neceſſity behoued to come, and he muſt proue
in deed, bondes was prophecyed, and bonds he got: perſecution
was prophecyed, and perſecution he ſuffred. Brethren, I am not
of that mynd that he deſired them to pray that he ſhold be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the croſſe and affliction: for it is not lawful for a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
or any other man to pray that he be burdened with no croſſe.
What ſaies he to <hi>Timothie. 2.</hi> Tim. 1. 8. <hi>Be not aſhamed of my bonds,
but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Goſpel, &amp;c.</hi> It is not lawfull
to a Paſtor to go ſleeping throgh the world, and none to croſſe
his way; for a faithful Paſtor cannot be without either one croſſe
or other. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what a deliuery is this that he deſires them to pray
for? Euen that being vnder croſſes, the Lord ſo long as he had
adoe with him would deliuer him and ſet him free, and ſo it is
lawfull for one lying vnder perſecution for the Goſpels ſake to
pray for ſuch a deliuerance, ſo long as the Lord hes a worke to
do with him yea, and he is bound to pray that he may be victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and triumph both in death and life. What matter of death if
he triumph in death? the Lord Ieſus triumphed in death, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
triumphed in death, the true Paſtor in death he wil triumph.
So if the Lord grant victory in the end, what matter what men
ſuffer. This Apoſtle ſayes in another place of his Epiſtle we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
triumph notwithſtanding of al theſe afflictions we are into,
Rom 8. 37. <hi>Paul</hi> in his death triumphed. 2. Cor. 2. 14.</p>
               <p>Now from whom ſhould they craue that he ſhould be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?
<hi>From vnreaſonable and euil men,</hi> as he wold ſay, This world is
ful of euil and vnreaſonable men, beaſtly-bodies. The firſt word
ſignifies men of an abſurd nature, and of a very euill inclination.
The next word ſignifies men that are euer doing euill, and
troubling the innocent. So he ſpeakes of two ſorts of men, euill
in hart and euill in hand. And certainely he meanes his owne
countrie-men vvho vvere vvorſe inclyned in mynde and deed
tovvardes him and the Lord Ieſus then vvere any other. And
ſo, brethren, marke ſhortly: vvhere euer a faithfull Paſtor ſhall
goe, he ſhall meete vvith ſuch men: goe vvhere he vvill he ſhall
encounter with men euill mynded, and doing euil. The Goſpell
ſo long as ſhe is preached ſhall not be free of theſe men: of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
that ſhall make contradiction: Count not the worſe of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16659:245"/>
her that ſhe is gaineſaid: for ſhe is as naturally ſubject to this
contradiction as euer any thing vvas ſubject to any propertie.
It is the vvearde of the Goſpell, and the preachers thereof to
meete vvith ſuch men: It vvill neuer be broken: But vvhat
remedie? Come to the next beſt: Hovv ſhall a Preacher be in
ſafetie, ſeeing he muſt enter vvith ſuch men. The remedie is ſet
dovvne heere,<note place="margin">Prayer the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and euil men.</note> Prayer: let him pray to God, and the Church pray
for him. When <hi>Peter</hi> was in ſo great and extreme danger, what
vvas the Church doing? Act. 12. verſe 5. &amp;c. 12. Praying for him,
and by their prayers the Angel vvas broght dovvne from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
by whom he was deliuered: So prayer is vvonderful ſtrong,
and eſpecially the prayer of the people for the Paſtor will haue
a vvonderfull povver before God for his ſafetie. Then if this be
the duetie of the people, alas, is not this an vnnaturall thing to
ſee the ſtock riſe vp againſt the Paſtor to deuoure him. When
this commes, either there muſt be a great ſin in the Paſtor, or in
the people, or elſe in both, and it is one of the heauieſt judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
that can light on a Paſtor or people.</p>
               <p>Now to go forward. They might haue bene offended at this
that the Apoſtle ſpok, that there was ſo many that made contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to him, that there vvas ſuch a multitude of them, that be
where he wold, he could not be quite of them, therby they might
haue doubted of the trueth: for this is a vaine conceit that comes
in mens heads, hey thinke the Goſpel ſhould haue ſuch a ſound
progreſſe, as there ſhould not be a contradiction to it; but I ſay to
thee, where there is no contradiction there is a mark of falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And againe, where the trueth is, there for the moſt part a
great contradiction wil be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men when they ſee a multitude riſing
againſt the trueth, and making contradiction to it, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to doubt of the truth. They wil ſay, this cannot be the truth;
is not al the world riſen vp againſt it: But <hi>Paul</hi> tels you the cauſe
of that,<note place="margin">Faith a rare gift.</note> when he ſayes, <hi>all men haue not faith,</hi> faith is a rare gift. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one gets not faiths where one gets it, fourty wants it. So
when men begins to offend at the Goſpell, it is the want of faith
in them that makes them ſo to do: for there are very few that hes
the faith of Ieſus Chriſt. Remember this that there is a few num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that is choſen to life euerlaſting; <hi>many are called,</hi> ſayes Chriſt,
<hi>but fevv are choſen.</hi> And again there is none that gets faith in time,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16659:245" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but he who is choſen to lyfe from all eternity. As is ſaid, Act. 13.
48. <hi>ſo many beleued as vvere ordeined to lyfe euerlaſting.</hi> Therefore
when thou hearſt that few gets faith, remember it is not an Herb
that growes in euery mans garden, it is a rare gift of God. And
therfore findſt thou that thou haſt gotten faith this pretious gift,
rejoice and be glad that the Lord hes called thee to be of that
bleſſed number, and vvonder not at the multitude that oppones
themſelf to the Goſpel; but rejoice thou that thou art one of the
elect, one of that choſen number. Laſt in this verſe ye ſee where
there is no faith; where the hart is not ſanctified, there is nothing
but vnreaſonablenes, &amp; he that hes not faith is a wicked man, an
euill diſpoſed perſon: and ſo ye may reaſon; he hes no faith, <hi>ergo</hi>
he is an euill man; both euil minded &amp; an euil doer. Then againe
he is an vnreaſonable man, what followes? Euen this, it is very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
dwelling with ſuch folks; it is not good to men to dwel with
the faithleſſe: for thou ſhalt get ſome damnage of them, either in
thy body or ſoule; for if thou eſcape the harme of thy body, thou
ſhalt not miſſe to be harmed in thy ſoule. Againe, where faith is,
it wil turne a lyon in a meek lamb, and make a tyger the meekeſt
creature that is. We are in deed borne cruel and ſauage by nature
(for by nature a lyon or tyger paſſes not a man in cruelty.) Now
what turnes thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nature of a beaſt? nothing but this faith
of Ieſus Chriſt. And thou ſhalt not haue faith ſo ſoone, but thou
ſhalt be changed. O how good is it to liue in the company of
the faithfull, for thou muſt liue with them for euer: take thee to
ſuch company in earth, as thou wold haue to be with thee in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
If thou delite not in their company in earth, thou ſhalt neuer
be with them in Heauen. The wicked ſhal not be there.</p>
               <p>Yet to go forward. They might haue bene offended, when he
ſaid, al men hes not faith. It is a rare gift giuen of God. Now they
might haue doubted, whether they were of that number: and if
they wer, whether they ſhould ſtand or not. For, brethren, as it is
an hard matter to get faith, ſo it is as hard a thing to keepe it: for
in keeping it, a thouſand doubts wil riſe in the hart, whether one
will perſeuere in it or not, and eſpecially they that are moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

that hes no care of it, they wil not be moued with tentations, and

that thou ſhalt hear ſhal moue thee doubts, and thou ſhalt offend

                  </gap>ſt againe altogether. Come to the ground
of this doctrine. In the matter of faith there are two things, firſt
there is a giuer, and next there is a receiuer. God giues, and the
ſoule receyues. Now what is the ground of the ſtabilitie of faith
vvherefore it ſhall neuer be loſt againe being once giuen? Is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16659:246"/>
it the receiuer? No, ground it not vpon the receiuer, it is hut foly
ſo to do, as thogh thy ſoule wer ſo ſure a keeper of the grace gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
thee: but the ground wheron thou muſt leane is in the giuer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
He is vnchangeable, true and neuer alters, Heauen and earth ſhal
turne vp ſide downe ere he alter one jote. So the immutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of faith and that it loſes not in him that hes receiued it
once depends on the ſtable nature of God onely, and not in no
receiuer, nor power of man. Therefore if thou would haue an
aſſurance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith that thou ſhalt not loſe it, anchor not thy ſelfe
on thy ſelfe, but on that immutable God; thou euer alters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thou art not immutable in thy ſelfe, no thou haſt no ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
in thy ſelfe. Therefore ſet thy ſoule on that that is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
ſet it on God and ſtick by that immutable nature of his,
and thus doing thou ſhalt neuer loſe the grace receiued: for it is
the nature of the elect and godly to ſet their hart on the giuer
of grace, and therefore they keepe the grace faſt and are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed:
I dare promiſe thee, hold thy eyes on God, and put thy
confidence on him, thou ſhalt neuer loſe the grace receiued.</p>
               <p>He ſayes, <hi>He ſhall ſtabliſh you, and defend you from euill.</hi> There
are two actions of God here ſet downe, firſt to eſtabliſh, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to defend: The one is, in keeping vs in ſtabilitie; the other,
in holding off all aduerſary power. I ſhall giue you the reaſons
of theſe two actions requiſite in our ſtanding: The firſt is, the
infirmitie in our ſelfe: for the ouldeſt of vs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> not able to ſtand
alone more nor an infant that is newe borne is able to ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
The other cauſe, ſupponing thou wert able to ſtand, yet
there is ſuch an aduerſary power, ſo many enemies, ſo mighty,
ſo powerfull, that thou ſhalt not be able to ſtand againſt them of
thy ſelfe and by thy ſtrength. Now God in holding vs vp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
both: therefore as the nurſe will hold vp the childe and
defend it from falling: So the Lord holdes vs vp by the one
hand, and by the other ſeeing the aduerſary power comming on
vs: (for o his inuaſions are fearefull and mighty) he holds it off,
he holds aback the deuill and all our enemies: And therefore ye
ſee two actions giuen to God, one in holding vs vp by the one
hand; and the other, in holding aback all the aduerſary power.
Haſt thou not matter to pray then, firſt to hold thee vp againſt
thy owne infirmitie, and next againſt the aduerſary power that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16659:247"/>
wil haue thee to the earth if that hand of God hold it not aback.
Now he ſayes, <hi>from euill.</hi> The word may be taine generally of al
ſort of euill. yet I agree with this that it is vnderſtood cheeflie
of one, Satan: as <hi>1. Iohn 2. 13.</hi> So then the leſſon riſes, it is not with
fleſh and bloud we haue to doe. Many thinks if they be free of
men that they are well eneugh: put me from his gun and piſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
ſayes he I am ſure eneugh: and in the mean-tyme there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſuſpition of the deuill, ſtronger and ſubtiller then al the men
in the world: He wil get on a croſlet and plateglufe, ô miſerable
catiue, what armour haſt thou for the enemy of thy ſoule? It is
not with men we haue to do, but with powers, we haue not to
do with fleſh and bloud, but with Empyres and Principalities,
Gouernours, Princes of the world, rulers in the Air. If thou haſt
adoe with Princes and Kings earthly, they wil ſute the field with
thee; but if thou haſt adoe with the deuill (as euery vnbeleeuer
hes) he will not ſute the field with thee, but he will be aboue thy
head, where thou ſhalt not get one ſtroke of him, but he vvith
great fetches and force will beate thee downe, and vſe thee at
his pleaſure. Therfore it is not eneugh to pray to giue thee grace
to ſtand, and to keepe thee from ſuch as are enemies bodily to
thee, but thou ſhould ſay, Lord keepe me from that euill one, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
from ſpirituall powers from that deuill: thou art neuer free
of him night nor day: for <hi>he is going about like a roaring lyon, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to be ſaued from the deuil, then ſay, Lord keep me from theſe
bodily enemies. Alas, men liues careleſſe of Satan, as thogh there
wer not a ſpiritual enemie, while as there are millions of them to
deuore thee for euer. Ye ſee then this that is ſpoken to the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians
is applyed to the whole Church of God in the world:

<hi>Paul</hi> written to the Theſſalonians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
precepts and admonitions to liue
an holy and chriſtian lyfe. The laſt day
wel ad in hands the firſt precept, which
concerneth prayer to God, which is the
cheefeſt exerciſe that a chriſtian man
can haue in this world, there is none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it. Therefore he began to pray, and
as he had prayed for them immediatlie before, ſo he craues of
them a recompence which is, pray for me againe, and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that when I pray for thee thou pray for me againe. When
the Paſtor prayes for the flock, the flock ſhould interceede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with God by prayer for him. So the Apoſtle ſayes, Pray
for vs, for me, and my fellow-laborers from whom in common
this Epiſtle was directed. But for what things ſhould they pray
to him? The firſt thing is the Goſpel, and what of it? Pray that it
may runne and haue a free courſe through the world. And what
more? That the Goſpel of Chriſt running throgh ſhold not run
through the mouthes and eares of men onely, that is a ſmall
matter if there be no more: but that in running it may haue the
courſe with power and effectualneſſe in the hearts of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
working lyfe and ſaluation in them, and ſo conſequently ſhe
may be glorified, that is, that men and wemen feeling the great
force may be inforced to glorifie her in this world: for none
will glorifie the Goſpell, but he that feeles the power of it in his
hart, and to whom the Goſpell is the power of God to ſaluation.
The next thing that he craues they ſhould pray for, is for his
perſon, &amp; the perſons of his fellow-laborers, that we (ſayes he)
may be deliuered from vnreaſonable and euill men: He giues
the reaſon of this deſire. All men hes not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith. When we goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
preaching the Goſpell, we will haue great oppoſition of
many wicked men, euil inclined in hart, &amp; euil diſpoſde in hand,
ſo that our perſons muſt be oft in great danger. Therefore pray
for vs: And the ground is, all men hes not faith. Howbeit ſome
will profeſſe God and religion, yet in very deed God is not in
their hart: Chriſt dwelleth not in them by faith: they are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and therefore they beleeue not. It is dangerous to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16659:248"/>
them, yea euen for the perſons of men: for without
Chriſt the hart of a man is as cruell as is the hart of a Tyger and
Lyon, or any wylde beaſt, before it be drawen away from that
cruelty and tamed by faith in Ieſus Chriſt; this is the nature of
all men. Then in that third verſe, leſt that matter concerning
faith and the ſcarcitie of it ſhould haue offended them, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them to doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to thinke it might be that they ſhould
fall away from the faith. He ſayes, the Lord is faithfull, and he
ſhall eſtabliſh you, ye are not of this number that fall away: for
the Lord he is faithfull, and according to his promiſe he ſhall
make you ſtand for euer.</p>
               <p>Now here, he followes out his precepts, and in the firſt verſe
red we haue a generall exhortation to obedience to be giuen to
all the directions, <hi>vvarnings,</hi> and admonitions that he had giuen
them before, as if he ſhould ſay, What euer I haue bidden you in
the name of Chriſt, doe ye it all, and begin not onely, but alſo
perſeuere vnto the end. Brethren, this chriſtian calling that we
are placed into craues a doing and practiſe; not a thinking or
ſpeaking onely, ſo that all our religion be in our tongue. No, put
to thy hand and doe, as thou would ſhowe thy ſelfe a chriſtian:
for a chriſtian man would be a doer; all men muſt be doing and
ſet on an action, but not euery way: for it is better for ſome men
to ſit idle, and to be ſleeping when they are moſt exerciſed. The
doing requyred of a chriſtian ſhould be by a rule, not wauering,
but as ye ſee a lyne drawen by a rule or ſquare; ſo euer the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a man ſhould be by a rule, euen, ſtraight, direct, not
crooked, declyning to this ſide or that ſide. We learne of theſe
words what is the rule whereby the actions of a chriſtian ſhould
be ruled.<note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles is the rule of our actions.</note> It is the doctrine of the Apoſtles of Ieſus Chriſt: doe
as <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles hes bidden thee doe,
and I ſhall warrand thee; preaſe to direct thy actions according
to that rule: for he that heares the doctrine of the Apoſtles, and
followes not their direction, refuſes to giue obedience to Chriſt
himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now the forme of proponing of this matter is to be marked.
He ſayes not, doe as I command you to do, but he mitigates the
command, and caſts in a motiue to moue them to doe as he bade
them. He ſayes, <hi>I am perſvvaded,</hi> I haue a ſure confidence that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16659:249" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ye will doe as I bid you, and ſo he vtters the good opinion he
had of them, that they did well, and would continue in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnto the end. So the Paſtor hes his leſſon. It becommes a
Paſtour or teacher when he ſees a good meaning of his flock,
euer to thinke the beſt of them, yea to conceyue a perſwaſion
(but in the Lord) that they ſhall continue in well doing vnto
the end. And againe in the other part it is very meete that the
flock vnderſtand that the Paſtour counts and eſteemes well of
them: for vvhen the flock conceyues that the Paſtour hes a
good eſtimation of them, it is no ſmall motiue and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to them to go forward in well doing: for when the childe
thinkes his father hes a good opinion of him, and that he ſhall
come to grace, it is an incouragement to go forward in wel doing
Euen ſo it is with the Paſtor and the people; for if the flock think
that their Paſtor hes not a good opinion of them, it is the verie
vvay to diſcourage them and to cauſe them goe backvvard: So
men ſhould be verie ware leaſt they ſhould hurt others. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing heere is to be marked. He ſayes, <hi>We are perſvvaded in
the Lord,</hi> not in you, for aſvvell as vve count of you, our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is not in you: for then ye and we ſhould both be begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
ſo he hes not a confidence in them, albeit vve haue a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of them that they ſhould doe well: for theſe are different;
for if confidence be in a man, it is aſmuch as to aſcryue all power
and glorie of vvell doing to man himſelfe, and ſo to depryue
God of his glorie. As by the contrare, to put al confidence in the
Lord it is to aſcryue all glory to God, that giues the ſtrength to
man to doe well: The generall is, Why ſhould we not haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of men, and be well perſwaded that they will doe well,
but beware while thou hopeſt they will doe well that thou hurt
not the glory of God, by giuing the glorie of their well doing to
man: If he wer the beſt on earth giue him not the praiſe of a jote
of the power of well doing, but giue it to God alone, that all the
glory may be Gods. Let al the glory returne to him from whom
all graces came. This for the firſt verſe I haue red.</p>
               <p>The next precept conteined in the next verſe is more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culare,
and conteines a ſpeciall thing. <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>guide
your harts to the loue of God, and the vvaiting for of Christ.</hi> The
ſumme is this, Set your harts vpon the loue of God, that is one.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16659:249"/>
And vpon the patient hope of Jeſus Chriſt and his comming,
that is another. There is the effect of the words. So firſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends
to them the loue of God, and then the patient look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for of Ieſus Chriſt and their ſaluation, which ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
when he commes in his glory. Now mark the forme and
maner after the which he giues out this precept: He turnes this
precept in a praier (this is wiſdome) in which he beſeeches the
Lord to direct their harts to the loue of God firſt, and next to the
patient hope of Chriſts comming. Mark this forme. By this tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a precept in a prayer he wold teach vs this far, that theſe
commands that are giuen in the Scripture, theſe precepts, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
directions and admonitions, imports not that there is any
power or free-will in man or woman to obey, or to doe that that
is commanded, and exhorted, or to do any part of it: This is the
doctrine of the aduerſares, when they heare of any precept
or exhortation in the Scripture, then incontinent conclude they
there is a free-will in man to doe that that is commanded,<note place="margin">No free-will in man to do good.</note> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it were in vaine the command giuen; if the Lord giue not
free-will to do it, wherfore commands he? but the Lord knowes
how this followes: for by turning this precept into a prayer, we
are taught that albeit man be commanded and exhorted to doe
ſuch and ſuch things, yet all power of wel doing depends onely
on the Lord: And therefore oft ye ſhall finde either the precept
turned in a praier, or elſe with precept praier conjoined: And
therefore when we are commanded and admoniſhed to doe any
good, in that ſame inſtant our hart ſhould be raiſed to God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
ſtrength at him, &amp; thou ſhold ſay, Lord giue me the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
to do as thou commandſt me. When I admoniſh and exhort thee
to ſet thy hart to loue and feare God, is it in thy power ſo to doe?
ſpeaks thy conſcience ſo to thee? If it ſay, that it is in thy power
thy conſcience beguiles thee, that conceit is a plain illuſion. And
therfore ſeeing it lyes not in thy power to do when thou art ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted,
let thy refuge be to the Lord and ſay, Lord as thou bidſt
me loue thee, ſo giue me grace to loue thee; as thou bidſt me
hope, ſo worke thou hope in me, otherwiſe I will neuer be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to thy command.</p>
               <p>Now to the words. <hi>I pray God to direct your harts to the loue of
God.</hi> Ye ſee here wherfore he praies, not for their mouth or tonge
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16659:250"/>
nor for their eies, nor for none of theſe outward members, but his
prayer is for their harts, that the Lord would direct their harts.
What meanes this? To wit, that the directer, the guider, and ruler
of all theſe outward members of the eyes, tongue, and mouth, of
the hand and foote, is the hart; ſhe ſittes in the midſt and guides
all: ſo that if ſhe her ſelfe be firſt well guyded, ruled and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
it ſhall be well with all the members of thy bodie, ſhe ſhall
guide thy tongue, and brydle thy mouth in ſpeaking, and guide
thy hand in doing, it ſhall be well with thy eyes and eares, ſhe
ſhall not ſuffer thee to looke or heare wrong: and ſo well is the
perſon that hes a well guyded hart, and well diſpoſed mynde.
For then as for the outward members they ſhal be all made wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
of righteouſneſſe to ſerue God: but if the hart be euill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed,
but if it be backward and peruerſe (as it is of nature) there
ſhal not be ſo much as the leaſt member of the bodie, but al ſhal
goe the wrong way, thy foote ſhall goe to miſchieefe, a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
hart ſtirres his foote to murther, thy hand ſhall be a wapon
of vnrighteouſneſſe to fight againſt God thy eye ſhall be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to euill, and likewiſe all the reſt, all ſhall be ſet to do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe.
And therefore as the hart craues heere prayer for guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, ſo euery part of the bodie craues prayer for it. As the
Apoſtle prayes, ſo let vs pray, Lord guide my hart, my hand,
my foote: No, the leaſt member craues prayer: but begin at the
firſt ſtirrer, the hart, and ſay, Lord guide my hart that all the reſt
of my members may followe her. Alas, the neglect of this prayer
to God that he would guide the hart makes the hart a foule
ſtinking puddle. There is no ſtinking flewer to the ſtinke of a
foule hart; (ô if thou felt it that thou might deteſt it!) If it be not
purged, thou ſhalt neuer ſee the face of God: if thou ly ſtill in
the filth of thy hart, and euery day in thy hart contract ſome
further filth, remember I forewarne thee, the intolerable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God ſhall be heaped on thy head, as thou heapeſt filth
vpon filth.</p>
               <p>Now, what craues he to their harts? I pray the Lord, ſayes he,
<hi>to direct your harts.</hi> The word in the owne language ſignifies a
ſtraightning as it wer, an euen lyne: for, brethren, conſider the
hart of man, as it is diſpoſed by nature, and by this foule birth of
ours (all within vs is foule without that renuing Spirit of Ieſus
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16659:250"/>
Chriſt) it comes in this world crooked,<note place="margin">manshart, crooked, by nature.</note> and bowed in, as a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
tree, bowed away from God, to the deuill: from al good things
to all euil and miſchiefe. It is backward, that is the terme, that, the
Scripture giues it: euery man is borne vvith a backvvard hart,
bowed downward from God. And therefore, what thing ſhould
thou craue to the hart, what ſhould thou aske for it? It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
eneugh, no, ſo long as thou liueſt, there ſhall be ay a crooke
in it. What ſhould thou pray for it then? Euen this, Lord make
it euen, put this peruerſneſſe out of it: for ſo long as it bydes
in this backvvardneſſe, it is not poſſible but thy vvraith muſt be
on it. Then pray for two things to thy hart. Firſt to mak ſtraight
thy crooked hart, and ſay, Lord I finde my hart crooked vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
me, bovving avvay from thee, Lord put in day holy Spirit in
it, and ſtraighten it. And againe, becauſe it is impoſſible, ſo long
as I liue, that I can attaine vnto an hart altogether ſtraight: Lord
hyde the crookes of my hart, with that mantle of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Chriſt. Trovveſt thou that thou could ſtand one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before that Majeſtie that cannot looke on a crooke, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thy crook were couered with that mantle of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore, our prayer ſhould be, Lord, let
Chriſt my Mediator euer ſtand betweene me and thee, to hold
off thy wraith and fire of thy countenance.</p>
               <p>Now folovves in the end of the verſe, tvvo pointes, vnto the
vvhich the hart ſhould be directed.<note place="margin">manshart ſhould be directed to tvvo things. 1. the loue of God.</note> The thing that is made
ſtraight muſt be directed to a pointe. The firſt pointe, whereinto
the hart muſt be directed, is, <hi>the loue of God:</hi> the next is, <hi>the patient
avvaiting for, of Christ.</hi> To ſpeake of the firſt. The hart as it is
bowed and alienated from euerie good thing, ſo, firſt, it is bowed
from God and his loue: be aſſured, as thou art borne, thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt
not God: No, thy nature inclines to hate him ſo deadlie, that
thou haſt no vvill, nor pleaſure, once to thinke of him, the hart
abhortes by nature the verie cogitation of him, and faine
vvould thou haue that conſcience that adueriſes thee of him, to
be pulled avvay: Many vvould be quyte of their conſcience,
that is euer ſounding to them of God, thou would giue a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
if thou had it, to be quite of it. And as thou wold not think
of him, by nature; ſo, thou vvould neuer heare of him: there is
ſuch a naturall hatred againſt God, in the hart of man; for, all are
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16659:251"/>
borne, as it were, with their face away from God, and their backs
turned to God: and the longer thou liueſt the farther thou run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
from him, except by his Spirit he turne thee, and ſay to thee
turne thee and looke on my face. And therefore the firſt thing
we ſhould pray for, ſhould be, Lord turne my hart to thee, to
loue thee, and ſet it on thee. This is the praier of the Apoſtle, and
it ſhould be our prayer night and day. What thing canſt thou
loue with any joy or delectation, if thou firſt loue not God? Will
the Husband loue the wife if he loue not God firſt? fy on thee
and thy loue both: for thy loue vvill be turned in hatred, and
thou vvilt curſſe thy vvyfe and thy children if thou loueſt not
God firſt, and then them in God for this cauſe. This is the firſt
pointe vnto the which the hart ſhould be directed.</p>
               <p>Now the next pointe he calles <hi>Patience,</hi> that is, a patient hope.
Of vvhom? Of Ieſus Chriſt, that is of his comming, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
of thy euerlaſting ſaluation that ſhall be reueiled at his
comming.<note place="margin">2. Patient avvaiting for Chriſt.</note> Brethren, it is craued that the hart of man be ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
any thing in this lyfe: I tell thee thy hart muſt be directed
farther nor any grace thou can get in this lyfe, farther nor faith,
nor the loue of God, vvhich is the preciouſeſt thing thou can
haue, thy hart muſt be ſet on things that are not reueiled as yet,
on Ieſus Chriſt to come, vpon that glorious reuelation of him,
and full redemption that he ſhall bring with him to thee. Novv
fy on me and thee, if our harts be bounded within the things or
graces of this lyfe, if we hold our harts onely on the thinges of
this lyfe, <hi>then,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>of all men vve vvere the moſt miſerable.</hi>
1. Cor. 15. 19. And therefore the hart ſhould put out the head of
it beyond this lyfe and lift it aboue this earth, aboue all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
vp to that place vvhere Ieſus Chriſt is, vvho ſhall once be
manifeſted. Brethren, as concerning hope and that life to come,
I think ye finde how ye are diſpoſed concerning it: vvill nature
teach you that euer Chriſt ſhall come againe to this world? I ſhal
tell thee; thy nature will anſwere, all foly; and men will ſay, doe
well to me in this life, I ſhal take my venture of the lyfe to come.
This lets thee ſee what is in nature: for nature will neuer tell thee
that there is a lyfe to come; nature is far from all expectation of
glorie after this lyfe. Therefore this is the ſecond thing vve
ſhould craue to the bovved hart that he vvould ſet it ſtraight v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16659:251"/>
the hope of life; and as he prayes, ſo ſhould we pray, and
ſay, Lord my hart is declyned from the hope of lyfe, and lookes
neuer Chriſt will come, Lord righten it, that I may waite vpon
the comming of my Redemer; for I ſhall not attaine to that life
except I hope for it and perſiſt in it till he come. Well ye ſee
then what is the good diſpoſition of the hart of man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
be not be beguyled with it. When may thou haue a vvell
diſpoſed hart, an euen hart? When things falles out that pleates
thee, ſtore of honors, of riches, of pleaſure, then thy hart is aloft
and glad: but I ſay, if this diſpoſition be not in thy hart, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
loue God firſt, and next that thy hart hopes for ſaluation, woe to
that hart: if it be not otherwiſe diſpoſed before thou die, vvoe
to that hart for euer. So if thou vvould vnderſtand vvhen thy
hart is well diſpoſed, go downe to it, and ſay, my hart, loueſt thou
God? if it anſwere I loue him, then thou art well: And againe ſay,
my hart hopeſt thou for a lyfe after this lyfe, and to ſee the Lord
Ieſus to thy euerlaſting ſaluation: if it ſay, I hope ſo, then in joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
reſt there. I beſeech you for Ieſus Chriſts ſake, thinke
not ye haue a well diſpoſed hart, except ſenſibly ye feele in it
the loue of God, and an hope for a better lyfe. Stryue to this
ſenſe of the loue of God, that thou may be perſvvaded that he
hes loued thee firſt, and if thou feele that ſweet loue of this, then
it will lowſe thy hart to loue God with a joy vnſpeakable: fy on
all carnal and fleſhly joyes in reſpect of this ſolide joy.</p>
               <p>Yet one word. He calles it <hi>Patience,</hi> by the which he meanes
a patient on waiting and hope: for, brethren, this vnderſtand, that
there cannot be an hope of lyfe except patience concur vvith
hope in the hart. If thou haſt not patience to byde, look not for
that finall redemption. Therefore this patience is the neceſſary
companion of hope: for hope is nothing elſe but a faire looke,
yea a verie far looke to a thing that is far from vs. Well except
thou haſt patience, troweſt thou that thou wilt hold vp thy head
from morning till night to await on Ieſus Chriſt his comming.
No ſuch thing, thou may call a blenke and away at an inſtant,
but thou ſhalt not ſtand, without patience, no hope. And againe
ere thou attaine to that lyfe, troweſt thou that thou ſhalt goe
euen forward a ſound courſe, ſo that neuer a croſſing ſhall come
in thy way, no affliction touch thee till thou be ſet in Heauen?
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:16659:252" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Is that thy opinion that thou may liue in quyetneſſe, haue goods,
honor, and ſtore, and none ſay to thee, ill goes thou on the way.
Any man may take eaſe in patience: No, no, if thou haſt hope of
glorie, aſſure thee, an hundreth ſtayes ſhall be caſten in the way,
and thou ſhalt be beatten and toſted here and there. And oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
there ſhall appeare ſuch darke cloudes that the fight of
glorie ſhall be plucked out of thy eyes. Therefore if thou haſt
no patience to abide til that cloude be remoued, thou ſhalt haue
no hope, and without hope looke not for glorie. And therefore
it is not without cauſe that Hope and Patience are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
He that would hope for lyfe let him caſt him for troubles
and croſſes; for if lyfe be ordeined for thee the Lord will caſt in
ſtumbling blocks euer to exerciſe thy hope vntill thou get that
that thou hopeſt for: for the Lord hes appointed here continual
ſuffring. The Lord grant that we may be enarmed with Patience
euer till hope be turned into ſight.</p>
               <p>The next verſe conteines another ſpeciall precept. As the
former precept concerned the hart and the direction of it: ſo,
this precept concernes the outward ſocietie and familiarity, we
haue with men in this world: for, ſo long as we liue, we muſt be
in a ſocietie, but, beware with whom. So, the effect of this precept
is this, <hi>vvithdravv your ſelues from euery brother, that vvalketh inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatly,</hi>
in his lyfe, that goes out of order and keepes not his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne
ſtation, that liues inordinatly. There are two things to be
conſidered, in this precept. Firſt, the forme: Next, the effect of it.
The forme is, <hi>We denounce</hi> and charge you, not in our name, but,
<hi>in the Name</hi> and authoritie <hi>of our Lord Ieſus:</hi> for, neither Apoſtle,
nor, Paſtor hes any power to denounce any thing in his owne
name: for, there is no authority in the Church, ouer the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men, but, the Authoritie of God and of Ieſus Chriſt.
And therefore, no man can ſay to the conſcience, I charge thee in
my name. It is onely proper to God, to charge the conſcience.
Now, gather the leſſſon. This forme, he vſes, lets vs ſee, how hard
it is,<note place="margin">Men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned to eull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</note> to be ſeuered from euill company, albeit many will curſſe it
in the end: It wil not be a light word, that wil make thee to leaue
euill company, but ere thou come from it, there muſt a charge
interueene, and that, in the name of the higheſt authoritie, euen,
the great God, and that, by the mouth of his ſeruant. The Lord
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:16659:252"/>
muſt ſay, I charge thee in the Name of the great God, ſeuere
thee from euill company. Brethren, knowe ye not your nature,
neuer thing ſtak faſter to another, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this nature of ours cleaues
to euill and euill men, ſo, that, by a great force, they muſt be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
aſunder. Now, to come to the matter. he ſayes, <hi>vvithdravv
your ſelues.</hi> He ſayes not, ſhoote them from you, but, drawe your
ſelues from them: ſo, it importes not a publick excommunication,
but, a quyet ſeparation of a true brother from a fained brother.
There are ſundrie ſeuerings. One, when we ſeuere our ſelues
from theſe, that are publictly excommunicate. Another, when
men quietly draws themſelues from them, that liues inordinatly:
No, it is not eneugh, to ſay, He is not excommunicate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I may hant his company. No, but, I ſay, If he liue not well
and holilie, begin thou to draw thy ſelf from him, before, that, by
that publike cenſure he be caſten from thee.</p>
               <p>Now, from whom ſhould he withdraw himſelfe? He ſayes,
<hi>From euery brother,</hi> what euer they be to thee, and of what eſtate
ſoeuer they be of. And who is this brother? He that takes on the
name of a Chriſtian, and yet, in effect, is not a Chriſtian: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
not with ſuch a man, if his lyfe fightes againſt his name,
away with him, let him ſtand his alone. There are many ſortes
of euill company, but, of all ſortes, the worſt and moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
is a brother, that is an euill man of lyfe, and takes vpon
him the name of a Chriſtian, and be aſſured, thou ſhalt get more
euill of ſuch a companion, nor thou ſhalt get of an Heathen,
or, Pagane. Is it not, trovveſt thou, a dangerous thing, to haue
company vvith a brother, that is an adulterer, and a murtherer,
will he not infect thee? Fy on thee, that vvithdravves not thy
ſelfe from him: for, a brother, that hes onely but a bare name
of a Chriſtian and not the lyfe of a Chriſtian, is lyke a lumpe
of ſovvre leauen: for, if it be caſten in a vvhole baking, it vvill
ſowre all the reſt: euen, ſo, he will infect all. So, if there be a
falſe brother in thy company, if thou be homely with him, thou
ſhalt be within fewe dayes made ſuch a man, as he is; for, familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
makes conformitie in maners. And therfore, men, when they
goe to the ſcaffold to execution (ye haue heard) haue oft curſſed
euill company. Familiaritie with a fained brother ſhal make thee
cold in Religion, and draw thee to his maners, and ſo, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolued
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16659:253" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in his ſinnes, thou ſhalt haue a part of his puniſhment.</p>
               <p>And what a brother is this, from vvhom thou ſhould vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
thy ſelfe? One <hi>that liues inordinatly,</hi> that is, that liues
not according to my doctrine and rule: and what rule hes he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeryued?
Looke Epheſ. 4. 28. to witte, that, euerie man ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and that, euerie one ſhould eate their owne breade. And if
thou haſt not laboured, but, hes bene idle all day, looke, that, thou
put not a nip in thy mouth: for, there is an Inhibition, <hi>Let him
not eate, that labours not.</hi> This is the rule. Now, learne, how holy
this chriſtian lyfe ſhould be; for, by them that walkes inordinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he meanes not of men openly wicked and diſobedient, as, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
adulterars, murtherars, oppreſſors, &amp;c. but, he meanes of idle
bodies, that are out of all calling, and are not labouring, but are
buſie bodies, clauerers and pratlers, looking here &amp; there, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that a mean, to win their liuing by: as dron-bees enters in the
skeppes and ſoukes vp the honey of the labouring bees; ſo, they
ſouke vp the meate, that others hes win with the ſweate of their
browes. So, as idle buſie bodie is euill company, clap him, as ye
will, entertaine him as ye pleaſe, he is a plague, and he will infect
thee: for, if he haue not a certaine calling, let him ſpeake of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as he will, no religion will follow him: for, the Lord giues
not a bleſſing to any, but, to him, that hes ſome honeſt calling.
Another thing, marke, heere. Let none pretend the Goſpell of
Chriſt to their idleneſſe: fy on the mouth, that ſpeaks of Chriſt,
and then is out of all calling and idle: ſpeake not one word, or,
one mum of Chriſt, if thou haſt not a calling and be exerciſde
therein. I tell thee, Chriſts Goſpell takes not away any good
order, but, ratifies it. The Lawes of Policie hes ordeinde, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one haue a calling, and the Goſpell ratifies the ſame Law,
and it is Chriſts will, that, men keepe themſelues in their calling:
It is not lawfull, vnder pretence of Chriſtianitie and Religion,
to caſt off a calling: for, as God is the God of order, ſo, he lookes;
euer, that, men be in an honeſt calling. If thou be idle, thou of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeſt
him, and prouokſt him to wraith: therefore, looke to thy
ſelf,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> that, thou be not out of all calling: yea, rather, ere thou ſit idle,
be exerciſed in the vyleſt calling and vocation, that euer was.
Now, I beſeech the Lord, that as he hes appointed euerie one of
vs, to be exerciſed in ſome lawfull calling, winning our liuing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16659:253"/>
with the ſweate of our browes, ſo, he would grant, that, we may
faithfully trauaile in our lawfull calling, and that he woulde
joyne his bleſſing to our labours, that hauing ſufficiencie for
our pilgrimage heere, we may conſecrate ſoule and bodie to
him, who cares for vs, and bleſſes vs in all thinges, that this lyfe
being ended, we my be aſſured to reſt from our labors with Ieſus
Chriſt. To whom, with the Father and holy Spirit, be all honour
and praiſe for euer.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS laſt part of this Epiſtle, we ſhewe
you, contained precepts and admonitions,
concerning Chriſtian life and conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The firſt precept and admonition was,
to pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that, for <hi>Paul</hi> and his fellow-labourers,
<hi>Syluanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> who
with him directed this Epiſtle to them.
The next precept was generall, deſiring
them, to doe, and continue in euery thing,
he had commaunded them. The thirde precepte was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare,
that they ſhould take heede to their harts, and ſet them
firſt on the loue of God, and ſecondly, vpon the patient hope
and awaiting for the comming of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. The
fourth precept concerneth ſocietie and fellowſhip, and warnes
them, to withdraw themſelues from euery Chriſtian, that keepes
the name and walked inordinatly, that is, not according to the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ale, he had ſet downe to them, to follow. In this precept, firſt, we
haue the forme, how he propones it, the forme is graue, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,
ſayes he, in the Name of the Lord, that ye withdrawe
your ſelues. By this forme, he teaches vs, how hard it is, to ſeuere
the beſt of vs all from evill company: for this remanent corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that abydes in the renewed men cleaues ſo faſt to euil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
that oft-tymes it preuailes againſt the Spirit: ſo, that, men
muſt be reauen, as it were, by force, from euill companie, they
muſt be threatned with judgement ere they be content to leaue
them. As to the matter, Withdraw, your ſelues from euery bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

buſie bodies: a curſſe and no bleſſing followes ſuch men. And
therefore, they, that hantes their companie, takes pleaſure in it,
and foſters them in their fantaſie muſt be inuolued in that ſame
judgement with them.</p>
               <p>Now, to come to the text preſently red. It containes morall
preceptes, concerning maners. Therefore, we ſhall open it vp
and gather ſuch leſſons, as ſhall be offred for our inſtruction. He
turnes him to theſe idle bodies, of the which, appearandly there
vvas a great number among the Theſſalonians, as there is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16659:254"/>
in this Cittie, and he willes them, to change their maners. The
firſt argument, he vſes, to moue them, is taken from his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emple,
<hi>Ye your ſelues knovv, bovv ye ought to follovv vs: for, vve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued
not our ſelues inordinatly among you, &amp;c.</hi> Ye who liues inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatly,
knowe, how it behoued you to followe me, as a light,
that goeth before you, in lyfe and conuerſation. Then he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes:
I haue not liued out of rule, nor out of order. Therefore,
learne to liue, as I haue liued you before you, not idle, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
for your liuing, as ye haue ſeene me doe, before you.
Now, to gather ſome leſſons, on this firſt argument. Mark, in the
perſon of the Apoſtle, when a Paſtor hes laid downe the rule of
right liuing: the doctrine of the word of God, concerning an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and godly life in this world, how ſoone he hes ſet downe
this rule in the Pulpet, he is bound immediatly as ſoone as he
commes out of it, to walke according to that rule, he hes layde
down; to the end, that, he walking according to the rule, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may followe him: For, for this cauſe, Heb. 13. 17. he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>aguyde</hi> (as he is called a Preacher) becauſe in lyfe, he ſhould
guide the people the right way, according to the doctrine taught
by him; and walking according to the rule of the world, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliats
credite and authoritie to the word, and makes the hearers
to beleue the word, he hes ſpoken, when they ſee him, in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
practiſe that word. And by the contrare, not walking accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the word, he hes preached, he does, that lyes in him, that
no man credite him, and ſo, becommes guilty of the higheſt
crime, that can be: for, the diſgracing of the Goſpell of Ieſus
Chriſt is the greateſt ſin, that, a man can commit; leaſe-majeſtie
is a great ſinne, yet it is nothing to this: for, this ſin is leaſe-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie,
againſt God. So, ye may ſee what neceſſitie lyes on him, to
liue well; otherwiſe, he ſhall beate downe more, with his euill
life, nor he will be able to builde by his preaching: and ſo, he is a
traitor, againſt Chriſt and his Goſpell. Now, the cheefe care of
<hi>Paul</hi> was to honour the Goſpell, that it ſhould get no diſgrace;
and therefore, he looked to be partaker of his owne Goſpell: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
if a man honor not the Goſpell by his life, teach it as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
and eloquently as he can, he ſhall not be partaker of the
Goſpell. This leſſon riſes on <hi>Pauls</hi> perſon; another riſes vpon
the part of the people, concerning them, that heares the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:16659:255"/>
and doctrin of Chriſt. What is their duetie? When they haue
heard, and when they haue ſeene the Paſtor walke directly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the rule of doctrine ſet downe by him: then, there is
a neceſſitie laide vpon them, to follovv his foot-ſteps, and walke,
as he vvalkes. And more. The vvords lets vs ſee, that, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
telles them, that, neceſſitie is laid on them, that, ſeeing the
Paſtor vvalking before them, their conſcience telles them, that,
they ſhould follovve: for, if thou follovve not, the firſt chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenger,
that ſhall challenge thee, ſhall be thy ovvne conſcience,
and it ſhall condemne thee, and if thou follovve, thou ſhalt haue
the approbation of thy conſcience: <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayes, 1. Epiſt. chap. 3.
verſe 20. <hi>If thy conſcience condemne thee, God is greater, nor thy hart</hi>
and conſcience, <hi>and he ſhall condemne thee,</hi> Ye knovv mens voices
in this countrey and their opinions, vve are not all Miniſters,
vve are not therefore bound to vvalke ſo cloſlie by the rule, as
ye, we may play vs here and there. It is true, indeed, the Miniſter
ſhould walk firſt, and ſhould go before you, but, it is as true, there
is a neceſſity lying vpon you, to follow him foote by foote: and
certainly, if ye follow him not, damnation ſhall enſue, play thee
and paſſe thy time, as thou pleaſeſt.</p>
               <p>Come to the next part of the argument. He ſayes. <hi>I haue not
behaued my ſelf inordinatly among you:</hi> this is the aſſumption of the
argument. His lyfe was among them, he paſt not out to a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
out of the ſociety of men and wemen, but, his life was among
chriſtian men and wemen, continually winning them to Chriſt,
by the preaching of the Goſpell. Brethren, we are bound to liue
in a ſociety among men and wemen, and not to go aſide to Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitages,
and to liue in Monkes Cloſters, but, to liue among
men, in the ſocietie of men and Gods people: for, the lyfe of a
good man, or, good vvoman vvill edifie that ſpirituall building,
aſvvell, as the vvord vvill edifie: and euerie one of vs is obliſt
to edifie another, by our lyfe, aſvvell, as by our vvord. <hi>Peter 1.</hi>
Epiſt. chap. 3. verſe 1. exhorting vvyues to be obedient to their
Husbands, ſayes, <hi>They lucrifie ſoules vnto Chriſts, by their lyues,
vvithout any ſpeach.</hi> A vvoman vvill vvinne ſoules, by her life,
albeit ſhe ſpeake not one vvord. Therefore, brethre, ſeeing
there is ſuch force in the lyfe, either to builde, or, caſt dovvne,
take the admonition, that, <hi>Paul</hi> giues both in the Epiſtle giuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16659:255" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Epheſians chap. 5. verſe 15. and alſo, to the Coloſſ. 4. 1.
<hi>Walke circumſpectly,</hi> lift not one foote, but know well, where thou
ſetſt it downe, vvalke vviſely: for, be aſſured, as thou liueſt, others
will liue and follow thee; if thou liueſt vvell, others will followe
thee, and if thou walkeſt wickedly, thou alſo wilt get followers:
and if thou be a ſtumbling-block, wo is thee. O, wo is him, that is a
ſlanderer with his euil life; it wer better, that, a mil-ſtone wer ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gd
about his neck, and, that, he wer caſten in the ſey, nor to be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of ſtumbling. Therefore, we ſhould be carefull, not onely
for our ſelues, to liue godly, but, for others alſo: for, othevviſe,
if, through our occaſion and enſample, others walke inordinatly,
their bloud ſhall be craued at our hands.</p>
               <p>I go forvvard to the verſe following. He proues, that, he <hi>vval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
not inordinatly,</hi> and he takes his argument from the maner of
the eating of his meate. When I vvas among you, the breade
that I eate, it not for noght, but, I wrought for it: and how?
<hi>With great painfulneſſe.</hi> And when? not in <hi>the day</hi> onely, but, in the
<hi>night</hi> alſo: and with what inſtruments? Euen, with my <hi>ovvn hands,</hi>
beſides my preaching. The end of all, was, <hi>that I ſhould not be gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
and chargeable, to any man.</hi> Now, of <hi>Pauls</hi> working, read Acts
18. 3. He was a tent-maker, and beſides the teaching of the Goſpel,
he vſed his handy-labour. But, I come to the purpoſe, ye will ſee if
a man walks ordinatly, or, inordinatly; the eating of their meate
will ſhowe it; for, <hi>Paul</hi> taks his argument from his eating. If he
liues and eats his meate by his worke, he liues in rule and keeps a
good order; but, when he ſteps to his meate and hes not done a
good turne for it, he is out of rule: men commonly thinks, if they
get meate, they care not how they eate it. This is a great ſinne:
and oft-tymes an idle knaue vvill thinke that meate ſvveeteſt,
that hes coſt him leaſt trauaile. But, marke, the end ſhall proue,
there was neuer meat ſo deare boght, as that, that is gotten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
labour, and in end, it ſhall proue the ſowreſt meate, that euer
thou taſted: for, vvhat, trovv ye, be the pryce of this meate, how
is it boght? no man ſhould eate, but, that, that is boght, but, what
is the price of it? He hes a purſſe full of ſiluer, Hes he payde the
juſt pryce, for it? No, there is no true price for meate, but, the
price of labour and vvorking. Labour and eate; othervviſe,
if thou ſhouldeſt die for hunger, thou haſt no right to eate.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:16659:256"/>
Alas, if men vnderſtood the trueth, concerning this thing. More,
note, here, two faſhions of eating. One there is, by working and
that hes the bleſſing of God with it. There is another ſort of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for noght, eating <hi>gratis.</hi> If thou workeſt not, thou eatſt for
nothing. Compare theſe together. The one is lawfull and thou
may eate, with Gods bleſſing. The other, when thou haſt beene
an idle vagabound, and hes done no good, and yet, ſtops to thy
dinner, and framples vp other mens trauels, that is vnlawfull
eating: for, the Lord ſayes to thee, that is an idle bodie, touch not,
nor handle not, Is there any exception of perſons? No, no, there
is not a Monarch can eate his meate lawfully in a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
except, in his calling, he doe the turne, the Lord hes put in
his hands, except he haue laboured for it, in his owne calling.
Yet, marke the words. There is a giuing and a receiuing: for, he
ſayes. I haue not eaten the bread giuen by any man: Therefore,
the Apoſtle thought it not eneugh, to eate, becauſe it was giuen
him liberally, except, ere he eate, firſt, he had laboured for
it. Looke how men countes of this doing: He thinkes, if a man
giue him meate willingly, he may lawfully eate of it. No, it is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
except with the gift there be labour. There is nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Heauen, that, will make a right to thee to eate, except labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in thy owne calling goe before: for, meaſure not the way of
life by thy owne conceit, but, by the will and word of God, and
as he bids thee liue, liue; otherwiſe, woe to thy life.</p>
               <p>But, now, looke how he aggrearges his working. He wrought
and that, with labour and trauell he wearied and pained himſelf,
that is one circumſtance; looke to the tyme, all tymes were alike,
he wrought by night and by day. Looke the inſtrumentes: He
wroght with his owne hands, he put his owne hand to labour.
This is a marueilous thing, if ye knew what <hi>Paul</hi> was; He was a
gentle-man. Our gentle-men thinkes much to file their handes:
God forbid, that, my Lords ſon, and the Lairds ſon file his hands
with worke: <hi>Paul</hi> was a Citizen in Rome, a man greatly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of, he was a Phariſie, he had many worldly preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,
and yet, he puts his hand to worke. It is a ſhame, to ſee ſo
many idle vagabounds, they wil pretend their nobilitie, and they
thinke ſhame to labour, becauſe they are gentlemen, yet, I ſay,
the curſſe of God followes euer vpon ſuch. Alwayes, the leſſon
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16659:256"/>
is, there is ſuch a neceſſitie of working laide on euerie one, for
their liuing, that, nothing can exeeme vs. There is nothing can
exeeme thee from labour, no, not thy bloud and kinred, if thou
wert a kings ſonne, all thy lands and rents will not exeeme thee;
the painfulneſſe of thy labour will not exeeme thee: No, no time
will exeeme thee, when the Lord enters in count. If thou can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
win thy liuing in the day, then, worke in the night, no ſort of
worke will exeeme thee. He will ſay, I cannot put my hand to
ſuch a worke: No, put thy hand to the pleugh, and lead muck
creeles, and goe to the vyleſt exerciſe, that is, rather, ere thou win
not thy liuing by worke. Well is the man, that winnes his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
by the ſweate of his browes, and woe to them, that liues on
other mens labors.</p>
               <p>Now, to come to the end, why he did this. He ſayes, he labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
night and day, to the end, he <hi>ſhould not be chargeable to any man.</hi>
I draw out the generall of this. It is requiſite, in a chriſtian man,
that, he be as little chargeable to others, as can be poſſible. Art
thou a chriſtian man? ſtriue, that, thou be not chargeable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
Is he debt-bound any way? yet, ſaye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpare him. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene
thy father and mother at little, as thou may: many knaues
will not care, what they waiſt of their fathers goods. The Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians
were much addebted to <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet, he ſpends very
little of their goods, he is as little chargeable to them, as he could.
Now, the way to free them of this burdene, is, to worke. If thou
be idle, thou muſt be a burdene: for, an idle man is a burdene laid
to others, that labors. <hi>Paul</hi> Epheſ 4, 28. ſayes, <hi>Let him that ſtole,
ſteale no more</hi> now, when he is a chriſtian: Brethren, he that hes
ſinned, let him ſinne no more. But, what ſhould he doe? <hi>let him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi>
There is the remedie: If thou labor not, thou muſt be a
thiefe, and a throt-cutter. And how ſhall be labor? If he cannot
get a liberall and honeſt calling, let him labour with his owne
hand, <hi>and doe that, that is good.</hi> To what end? <hi>That he may haue to
impart to other,</hi> that cannot worke. So, let him not labor for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
onely, but, for others. And ſo, we ſhould not labour, onely
that we be not burdenſome to others, but, alſo, that we may be
helpfull to others: for, we are not borne for our ſelues onely, he
giues vs not hands and feet, and the reſt of our members for our
ſelues onely, but, for our neighbours alſo: yea, he giues vs not an
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16659:257" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hart, to loue our ſelues onely, but alſo, to loue our neighbour. All
thy working, if it be in reſpect of thy ſelf, if thou haſt no reſpect
to thy poore brother, thou ſhalt get no reward at all, for it.</p>
               <p>Now, I come to the verſe following. The Theſſalonians might
haue ſaid, Then, thou haſt no right, to craue ought of vs, for thy
preaching? ſaieſt thou not, thou laboreſt, to get thy ovvn liuing?
He anſwers, no, I haue juſt right, to tak for my preaching, I writ
not this, <hi>as if I had no authority:</hi> but, this I haue done, when I might
haue ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of you, yet, I tooke not, to learne you to labour, and to
ſhame them, that are among you, idle bodies, that vvorkes not,
for their liuing. Novv, yee ſee, heere, in the perſons of the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,
hovv readie men are, and hes beene at all tymes to
thinke, that, a Miniſter of the vvord hes no right, to theſe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
things, as to eate, to drink, 1. Cor. 9. 4. to mary a vvife, to take
a ſtipende. Any man hes a good right to all theſe thinges, but a
Miniſter, they inuy, that, Miniſter ſhould get ſo much, as this
common aire. They come forward: from thinking and ſpeaking,
they come to doing. Scotland proues this euidently eneugh, by
violence, by cauillation of lavves, by one vvay, or, other, they wil
reaue theſe temporall things from them, that the Lord hes ſet in
his ſeruice: a miniſter hes no right to perſonage, nor, vicarage,
nor, teindes. What hes the Miniſter adoe vvith them? they haue
no right to them? Hes not my Lord, or, the laird, or, vvhat he is,
a Charter of them? But, <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, if any man hes right, I haue
right: And I ſay, a Miniſter hes as good right to theſe things, as
any Earle, lord, laird, or, vvhat euer man he be hes to his heritage:
but, the ground of this is, men knovves not, what, life is, what the
kingdome of Heauen is, albeit they will prattle much of it. Now,
this miniſtrie is the miniſtrie of the Spirit, and of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Ieſus Chriſt: And therefore, all vvordes of theſe things
are but vvinde, to them; and they thinke, a man, that traueiles
in this calling is but an idle man, they count of no exerciſe, but,
that, that is in theſe earthly thinges. O Lord, that heauy count
that ſhall be in that glorious appearance of Ieſus Chriſt, in that
terrible day! Then, this reafe and violence ſhall appeare to be
reafe and violence indeed: Then, no vvordes, no cullour of
Lavve ſhall be an excuſe to thee. More, yet, on <hi>Pauls</hi> parte,
marke hovv readie, good men ſhould be, vvhether they be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:16659:257" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or, others, to giue ouer their rightes, vvhich they may
moſt juſtlie challenge. <hi>Paul</hi> gaue ouer his right, hovvbeit he
might haue taken a ſtipende: Yet, leaſt it ſhould ſeeme to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, that, Miniſters had no right, or, title to take by their
labours, he meetes it and vvill not prejudge the right of the
miniſtrie, that ſhould follovve, but, he telles, he had authoritie,
to take. Thou mayeſt, vpon good occaſions leaue thy right
ſome-tymes, but, looke, it be not to the hurt of thy brother, looke
thou impare not his right, by giuing ouer thy right, othervviſe,
thou haſt no ſinceritie in thy doing; for, if thou hurt him, there is
no ſinceritie in thee.</p>
               <p>Novv, in the end of the verſe, he telles the cauſe, vvherefore he
gaue ouer his right. <hi>To be an enſample,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>to you, to follovve
vs.</hi> Brethren, the thing, that, the Lord craues of euerie one of vs,
is, that, vve ſtand vp, to be a good enſample to others: euerie
one is bound to this duetie: for, vve are not borne to our ſelues
onely, and it is hard, to vvinne to this, and before a man attaine
to this, he muſt ſuffer many thinges, he muſt ſuffer many inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and vvronges, he muſt paſſe from his right oft-tymes, and
that, that he hes juſt title to, he muſt let it goe. So, vve, that vve
may be enſamples of vvell doing, muſt ſuffer many thinges, and
doe many thinges. Ye ſee a meane heere ſet dovvne, to moue
idle bodies, to labour, it is ſet dovvne in <hi>Pauls</hi> doing. <hi>Paul</hi>
needed not to vvorke, onely preaching might haue done his
turne, but, to moue idle men there among the Theſſalonians,
to vvorke, he vvould vvorke. So, the leſſon is, It is requiſite,
that, euen, honeſt men, that hes no neceſſitie to put their ovvne
hands to vvorke, put to their handes to vvorke, to moue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
men and vvemen, that hes no other moyen to liue by, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
by vvorking, to doe their duetie. As, for enſample. A maſter
of an houſe, vvho hes ſuch ſeruants, as vvill not put their hands
to vvorke, let him go before his ſeruants in vvorke, that thereby
they may be aſhamed.</p>
               <p>Now, to come to the laſt verſe. He ſets dovvne another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to moue theſe idle Theſſalonians to vvorke. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
going before vvas gentle, tane from his ovvne enſample,
but, this argument is ſtraite, forbidding all, that vvill not vvorke
to eate. <hi>He that vvill not vvorke, let him not eate.</hi> Workſt thou not?
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16659:258"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> inhibits thee to eat. This leanes on a grueat equitie. What,
trow ye, eating be? God hes ordeined it to be the rewarde of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and working. Thou getſt thy dinner, thy ſupper, meate and
drinke, as a rewarde of thy worke, thou haſt no other allowance
of dinner, nor ſupper, but as a rewarde of thy worke. Then muſt
it not followe, he workes not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore, he muſt not eate. O, ye
will ſay, that is very ſtrait, if men and wemen eat not, they will
die? But, I ſay, die as they will, the Lord vouchafes not a nip on
them, except they worke. Yet, notwithſtanding of this, great
number of men gets meate and liues, albeit they worke not, as, in
Edinburgh this day, and Scotland, ye know, is full of ſuch folke,
that neuer puts their hand to worke, and yet, they eate. Yet, I ſhal
tell you their eſtate: Let not an idle man thinke, he is well, when
he eates and workes not; for, the curſe of God is lying vpon him,
a miſerable eſtate. Would to God, that, men would weigh this,
that, the curſe of God is on theſe men, and al is accurſed to them,
their cloathes, their bed, and all, they haue. For, if this be true, that,
the bleſſing of God is on the labourer, Pſal. 128. 2. Prou. 10. 4.
and vpon him, that eates the frutes of his labours, it muſt follow,
that, he that eats, when he labours not, the curſſe of God is on
him. So, idle bodies haue no matter of vaunting and rejoycing
when they eate; and they who wins their liuing with the ſweate
of their browes hes the bleſſing of God with them. Indeed, his
bleſſing is not ſeene by thee now, and ye cannot diſtinguiſh now
a bleſſing from a curſſing. Ye ſee, here, oft-times it is aſwell with
the idle bodie, as with the bodie, that workes; for, Gods bleſſing
and curſe is not well ſeene here by men, but, in that day it ſhal be
ſhowen euidently, and this labour is a meane to bring vs to that
lyfe, that Chriſt, by his bloud, hes bought to vs. The rewarde of
a ſeruant, that labours faithfully, and that beleues in Ieſus Chriſt,
ſhall be glorie Epheſ. 6. 8, Now, as this inhibition concernes Idle
bodies, that they eate not, ſo, it concernes them, that labours, that
they foſter nor idleneſſe in any bodie; for, that is to foſter them in
ſinne. No, if thou would doe an idle bodie any good, bound him
to worke: wilt thou giue a vagabound leaue to clatter from
morne till night and then, giue him meate, thou foſters and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteines
him in ſinne: beware of ſuch helpe, for, when thou
thinkſt, thou helpſt and pleaſure him, thou art procuring a iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:16659:258"/>
to him. The Lord giue vs grace to helpe all creatures out
of that damnable eſtate, whereinto they are, by our enſample,
that thereafter both we and they may ſtriue to honour God in
our callinges, vntill we come to Chriſt, the Author and finiſher
of our faith; who according as our faith and beleefe is in him,
does recompence to euerie one of vs; that, through him, the juſt
may be ſaued and the reprobate condemned. And therefore, to
him with the Father and holie Spirit be all honour, praiſe and
glorie for euer.</p>

found great fault with ſuch among the
Theſſalonians as liued inordinatly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a lawfull calling, idle in the world.
Now to come to the purpoſe ſhortly, in
the beginning of this text he layes down
the ground of that rebuke, and finding
fault with ſuch men: he ſpok not begeſſe,
but vpon a ſure information and reporte
that he had concerning theſe men: albeit he was abſent, yet the
report came to him, that ſome among the Theſſalonians liued
inordinatly, not working and not exerciſed lawfully, but in vain
ſpeachs and curious and ſuperſluous exerciſes. The text is plain,
and the firſt thing I marke heere, is; Nothing ſhould be ſpoken,
no rebuke, no reproofe ſhold be directed to any, but vpon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
aſſurance and good ground, knowledge and notorietie of
it: either vpon that knowledge we haue our ſelues, as when we
ſee the fault our ſelues, either vpon the certaintie of a true and
ſure report of others that are of credite, and whom we know, to
ſpeake, not of affection, or malice, or of purpoſe to ſlander the
perſon of whom it is ſpoken, leaſt we ſpeaking vpon an vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie,
and being ouer ſoone credulous, without a full informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the end ſuch ſpeaking bring a diſgrace to our miniſtrie.
Then againe the Paſtor when once he hes ſcattred the ſeede of
the word in the harts of the hearers, his next care ſhould be to
ſee how it buddes out and fructifies in their lyues and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.
Euen as the Husband-man after he hes caſten the ſeede
in the ground, his eye is on the ground to ſee how the corne
brierdes; ſo, the Paſtor ſhould haue his eye on his ground vpon
the which he ſowes the ſeede of the word, that is, his flock, and
ſee how it fructifies in them: If he be preſent, his eye ſhould not
be off them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſhould not onely looke on them in the Church,
but his eye ſhould at all tymes, and in euerie place be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
on them. Alas, for pittie that this care is neglected in all
almoſt, we thinke it eneugh to ſtudie the preaching, and lets the
maners of men paſſe ouer, as if they appertained not to vs: If
the Paſtor be abſent, his eares ſhould be opened to heare ſure
reportes concerning their maners, that, as he heares and ſees
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16659:259" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he may doe thereafter, that if the word fructifie hee may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them to goe forwarde, otherwiſe he may admoniſhe,
rebuke, and ſtirre vp the dead ſoule: for, a Paſtour ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be idle, but either ſpeaking or doing, comforting or exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
inſtructing or admoniſhing, or rebuking. No, there is no
idleneſſe for him, as he woulde giue vp a faire count in that
great day.</p>
               <p>What heard he by report? That there wer ſome that liued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinatly.
Who are theſe? He defines them in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>They that vvrought not at all,</hi> and <hi>yet, vvere buſied,</hi> and none ſo
buſie as they, appearandly. Here, ye ſee are two contrares, doing
nothing and yet, exerciſed, they were not buſie in well doing,
and in a lawfull calling, but they were exerciſed and buſie in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie,
and ſo, euill exerciſed. The leſſon is. There is a common
Prouerb, An idle man muſt ay be doing ſome-thing, and he that
is not profitable and wel exerciſed, of neceſſitie muſt be vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
exerciſed: for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Spirit of a man cannot reſt: for, we ſee
by daily experience idle men and wemen (and <hi>Paul</hi> marked that
in ſome young widowes, 1. Tim. 5. 13.) of all people they wearie
and faſh themſelues moſt; ye ſee them here and there talking
and pratling, and where euer they come they are in ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
as is wonderfull, they gather al the newes and tydings of the
countrey greedily, and then running here and there they ſcatter
them. In one word, they will be in as great a buſineſſe, as if the
care of a kingdome were laid on them. Let euery one apply this
to himſelfe. Amongſt all the faults of Edinburgh this is not one
of the leaſt that would be amended. The maners and behauiour
of many people which I ſee in this Citty forces me to ſpeak of it.</p>
               <p>In the next verſe, vvhen he hes laid dovvne the ground, he
turnes him to them, and charges and warnes them very weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie,
That they worke. Marke the weight of the charge. He
charges and exhorts, ſo, that, ye ſee, he mingles lenity with ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
There is a ſharpneſſe, in charging; and lenitie, in exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
In whoſe Name charges he them? Not in his owne name, but,
<hi>in the Name</hi> and authoritie <hi>of Ieſus,</hi> the higheſt authoritie, that
euer was, which learnes vs this, how hard a thing it is, to make
an idle man to put his hand to worke, they muſt be ſtraited with
the higheſt authoritie that is. Euen, of the great God of Heauen:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16659:260" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yea, when they are charged in his Name ſcarcely will they put
their hand to worke: Once a begger and vnthriftie, neuer a
thriftie man againe. It is a very hard thing to bring thee from
thy vaiging. Take heed to this ye that hes yong ones, that they
be not brought vp idlie: for, if thou ſo doe, it will be hard to
bring them to worke againe. It is Gods juſt judgement, that, ye
ſee many of them begging, becauſe ye put them not to labour
in their youth. Now, this for the forme. What charges he them to
doe? <hi>Worke,</hi> ſayes he, and ſo doe I, in the Name and authoritie of
the great God, I ſay, to you vagabounds, worke, ye that make a
ſhift, by pratling and talking, I ſay, to you, worke, let the tongue
be quyet, and the hand be doing. And how ſhould they worke?
<hi>quyetly.</hi> An idle bodie and a bodie well exerciſed workes both,
but, differently; the idle bodie workes with a noyſe, ſo, that, he
troubles himſelfe and others alſo, all the world is troubled by
his working: but, a man in a lawfull calling, how workes he?
quyetly, without troubling either of himſelfe, or, others, and he
is the man, that, hes reſt, both in himſelfe and vvith his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
about him. <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Theſſa. 4. 11. ſayes, <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

buſie bodies, vnquyet will your lyfe be. This, for the firſt.</p>
               <p>The next, that followes this charge is, <hi>Eare your ovvne bread.</hi>
Who is he, that does this? The man, or, woman, that labours in his
calling with a quyetneſſe, this perſon liues on his owne winning.
As for a buſie bodie, looke his vauntage, when he hes wearied
himſelfe in vanitie, he gets not ſo much vauntage, as a morſell of
breade, no, not an inche of breade, he may well eate, and drinke,
and ſleepe, yet, all is accurſed, and his eating is by violence and
reafe; he hes not an allowance in the Lords count-booke, and in
that day he ſhall be challenged for reafe and violent opreſſion.

his neighbor, let him be as little burdenſome to him, as he
may and let him eate and drinke of his owne labour.</p>
               <p>Now, I go forward to the next verſe. Hauing in the verſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before, ſpoken to idle bodies, here, he turnes him to them, that
liued ordinatly in their owne calling, and requyres an higher
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16659:260"/>
duetie of them. Ye, <hi>brethren that labours</hi> quyetly, <hi>vvearie not in

owne bread, but alſo that ye giue peeces about you: yea, as ſome
expones, giue ſome-thing to the bodies before they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe.
ſupport their neceſſitie, and in the meane-tyme, exhorte,
and ſtirre them vp to worke. In that place of the Prouerbes,
when he hes ſaid, <hi>Drinke of thy ovvne ciſterne,</hi> he ſubjoynes, <hi>let thy
fountaines runne out to others,</hi> that is, help others, let thy liberality
be extended to others. I ſhew, the firſt Law of equitie was, that
men ſhould be as little burdenſome to anie as they might. The
next is, when he eates his owne breade, and ſees the want of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to giue peeces of his owne about him, and to helpe the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
of others I thinke that man happy that can doe theſe
two thinges, that is an happie man that deuoures not all him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
but vouchafes a part of his winning vpon others. The laſt

but let him vvorke vvith his ovvne hand, that he may haue to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte
vnto others,</hi> not to liue himſelfe onely, thereon; that is not
eneugh, there is more requyred: for, he is the true Chriſtian
man who labours to feede both himſelfe and others alſo that are
in neceſſitie. Now, brethren, to inſiſt heere, <hi>vvearie not,</hi> ſayes
he, be not ſluggiſhe, relent not, grow not colde in wel-doing.
The Apoſtle would meane, that howbeit matter and occaſion
be offered to vs that would doe well through the ingratitude
and vnworthineſſe of men not to doe a good turne to them, not
to giue them ſo much as a morſell of meate, yet, we ſhould ſtriue
againſt the ſluggiſhneſſe, coldneſſe, ingratitude and indignitie
of men, and ay be doing good. It is hard to do well, the dayes are
euil; yea, they were neuer worſe, and he who would do wel muſt
buy it with the preciouſeſt and beſt thing that he hes in this
world; there are ſo many thinges to hinder and coole him to doe
well. The ingratitude and vnworthineſſe of men to whom he
hes done well, will meete him, ſo that, if he will looke to theſe he
needes not to preaſe to doe well any farther. But this ſhould be
the rule of our doinges, Let vs not looke ſo much to the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of men at our hands, to their vnworthineſſe, as to the wil of
God, remember what it becommes thee to doe, being the ſonne
of ſuch a father, who willes thee to wearie and paine thy ſelfe in

beneficency and well doing towarde ingrate men, awaiting on
his will: for the Lord ſhal reward thee ſufficiently in the end, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
for all thy well doing thou get not ſomuch as a good word.
Reſt then on God, and in thy well doing lift thy eyes to him, and
await for that rich rewarde when that glory ſhall be reueiled in
that great day.</p>
               <p>I go to the next verſe. The next precept concernes ſtubborne
men, obſtinate and diſobedient men that will not obey the word
of God. The thing commanded concerning them, is <hi>Note the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from their company,</hi> excommunicate them, put them from the
ſociety of the godlie, exclude them out of the Church of God.
Firſt in this verſe we haue their diſobedience; next the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that ſhould be enjoined to them. I wil not ſpeak largely of
excommunication, but onely ſo much as ſerues for the meaning
of the text. As to their diſobedience, we haue firſt againſt what
thing it is. What is it they diſobey? They that obeyes not <hi>our ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
This diſobedience is againſt the doctrin of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi>
&amp; ſo, conſequently, againſt God himſelf and his word; the word
of the Apoſtles is the word of God. Let not men extenuate their
diſobedience, becauſe (as they ſay) it is againſt a man, a miniſter: I
ſay to thee, if that man be ſent of God with his word in his mouth
that diſobedience done againſt him is done againſt God, and he
who is a rebel to the word is a rebell to God. Now where is this
ſaying contained? He ſayes, <hi>in this letter.</hi> This ſaying is co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ained-in
this ſame Epiſtle, written to you Theſſalonians, by me <hi>Paul,
Syluanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus.</hi> It is alike to be diſobedient to the writ as
to the word of the Apoſtle, as great diſobedience it is that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the writ of the Apoſtle, as if ye diſobeyed the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
ſupponing he were aliue: and diſobedience againſt the writ
and ſpeaking of the Apoſtle, is diſobedience againſt Gods owne
voice. Therefore, count of the Scripture highly. <hi>They haue,</hi> ſayes
<hi>Abraham</hi> to the rich-glutton in torment, <hi>Luke 16. 29. 30. 31. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and the Prophets, and if they vvill not heare Moſes, thogh one ſhold
be raiſed againe from dead, they vvould not beleue him.</hi> Some wil ſay,
If the Lord would ſpeake to me by Angels out of Heauen as he
did oft-tymes of olde, then I would beleeue. But that is but foly,
if thou beleeue not this ſame word left in writ by the Prophets
and Apoſtles, if all the Angels would come out of Heauen and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16659:261" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſpeake to thee, thou would not beleeue them. Now marke the
nature of this diſobedience. It is not a ſingle diſobedience againſt
any precept or pointe of doctrine: No, but it is a diſobedience
with an obſtinatneſſe and rebellion: as a man is admoniſhed to
do his duety once, or ofter, yet he will not do it, but rebelles and
refuſes obſtinatly. Therefore take vp the leſſon. We ſee, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
proceeds of contumacy, of obſtinatneſſe after admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not of a ſimple ſinne, when men are admoniſhed to doe their
duety and then vvill not doe it, but obſtinatlie vvill rebell, if he
vvill not heare the Church, then follovves the ſentence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.

a man ſhould not be ſtamped and marked lightly thus
way, for it is a ſore marke. But, againe, when a man cannot be win
but by a ſhamefull marke, then this marke ſhould not be ſpared:
for, that is prepoſterous pittie; if neceſſitie driues the Church to
note him, then ſhame him to his ovvne face: for, better it is, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſhame here in this world for a tyme, then to ſuffer ſhame and
paine without hope euerlaſtingly. Shame him, that he may turne
and repent and that in that great day he may be ſaued. Now wel
is the man that is ſhamed to his owne grace that he may repent
him of his ſin and ſo liue for euer.<note place="margin">2 Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his company.</note> The ſecond part of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
is <hi>haue no comapny vvith him,</hi> when once he is ſtamped with that
ignominious mark, leaue him, haue not ado with him, 1. Cor. 5. 9.
for, bearing of company with him taks away the force &amp; fear of
the mark which ſhould be to his repentance: for, if men forbeare
his company, he wold be aſhamed, when company is keeped, he
hes no ſhame, and al power of Excommunication is taken away,
ſo, his repentance is ſtayed, and ſo, he is hardned in his ſin. But,
getteſt thou any good of his company that ſcarres not at the

otherwiſe he cannot be in the world, if it were but this company
that can exhort him and admoniſh him; neceſſitie craues that he
haue this company, that he byde not ſtill in the bonds of Satan;
onely heere is to be vnderſtoode, company that is not needfull,

firſt marking him with a note of ignominy; then ſecond, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
company with him, as this text markes them.</p>
               <p>Now the end of it is, <hi>that he may be aſhamed.</hi> The word in the
owne language ſignifies,<note place="margin">The end of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the turning of a man within himſelfe.
There are many that hes their eies vpon others outwith themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
to mark their ſins, but what man looks within himſelf to ſee
what is ther, to ripe vp their vileneſſe and filthineſſe, their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
and diſobedience, and hatred of God in their harts? wilt
thou that art ſo quick in other mens doinges, forgette vvhat
thou art thy ſelfe? goe downe to thy owne hart and affections,
for thou wilt not beare the burdeene of other mens ſinnes, but
of thy own ſinnes, that ſeeing thy own filthineſſe and vyldneſſe
thou may thinke ſhame of thy ſelfe. The turning of a man, is to
looke downe to his owne hart. If men ſaw themſelues (ô, fy on
the ſight: for all the vylde and filthie thinges in this world that
euer man ſaw or felt, the hart of man is the vyldeſt, if thou ſaw it
as it is) I ſay, if thou ſaw thy ſelf, that ſight of thy ſelf would make
thee forget all the world, and remember thy ſelfe: then, ſeeing
thy ſelfe thou would be aſhamed of thy ſelf. O thou who now
art ſo luſty in thy own conceit, if thou ſaw thy ſelfe thou would
hang downe thy head for ſhame! and then, ſhame brings forth
ſome frute, albeit it be bitter, it bringes out repentance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
brings with it ſaluation. 2. Cor. 7. 11. So then, the end of
excommunication is repentance, that a man may get lyfe and
ſaluation. 1. Cor. 5 5. <hi>Deliuer him to Satan, that the Spirite may be
ſaued in the day of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> Now how is this repentance
gotten? by what meanes? by thinking ſhame of himſelfe,
ſhame is the meane. No, if an excommunicate man thinke not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16659:262" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhame of himſelfe, I cannot ſay that he repents thought he neuer
ſhame of his ſin? he neuer repented from his hart, and no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
no ſaluation. <hi>Paul</hi> 2. Corint. 2. 11. ſpeaking of that ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous
man, he ſettes downe another meane, ſadneſſe or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovve,
that is according to God. Ioyne ſhame and ſadneſſe in
an excommunicate perſon, they vvill bring out repentance, he
vvill beginne to forthinke that euer he ſhould haue done as he
hes done: vvell vvorth that ſhame and ſadneſſe that bringes
out true repentance and ſaluation. Alas, vvhat matter of ſhame
and ſadneſſe for a ſhort tyme here that vve may rejoyce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in the Heauens with our head Ieſus Chriſt for euer. I read
1. Cor. 5. 5. 6. of tvvo ends and vſes of Excommunication. The
one is, the ſaluation of the perſon excommunicate: for he is cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
off not to be loſt, but to be ſaued. The other is, the vvelfaire
of the bodie, that is, the Church, that that peece of leauen
ſovvre not the vvhole lumpe. Indeed it is true in Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
regarde ſhould be had to the vvell and ſaluation of the
perſon that is excommunicate, but the cheefe regarde ſhould be
to the vvell of the Church and vvhole bodie, in ſuch ſort, that, if
the Church cannot be ſafe, but by the cutting off of the rotten
member, rather ere the bodie be infected, let the member periſh.
<hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 9. 3. wiſhed to be <hi>Anathema,</hi> that is to be cutted off
the bodie for euer, that it might be vvell vvith the bodie, for
his brethren the Ievves, to haue them ſaued he vviſhed to be
condemned. There ſhould be ſuch a loue and ſuch a care of the
Church of Chriſt, that it ſhould be farre aboue and ſhould ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
the care of any particulare man or woman. Our cheefe
care ſhould be of the glorie of God in Ieſus Chriſt, and he is
cheeflie glorified in the bodie, and therefore, a cheefe care ſhould
be had of the bodie.</p>
               <p>Now, to come to the laſt verſe. <hi>Yet,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>count him not as
an enemie, but, admoniſhe him, as a brother.</hi> In this verſe, we haue a
kinde of mitigation and tempering of the rigour and ſeueritie of
Excommunication: for, brethren, if Excommunication had the
ovvne force in any man, the ſtroke of Excommunication would
be the ſoreſt ſtroke, that euer one felt. Read 2. Cor. 2. 7. Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
threw the inceſtuous perſon in ſuch an heauy diſple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
that his ſoule vvas almoſt ſvvallovved vp vvith in him: for,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16659:263"/>
when once the ſoule is caſten in an heigh diſpleaſure, which is
the effect of Excommunication, then, the deuill is readie to bring
that man to diſpare. Therefore, he ſayes here, verſe 7. <hi>Forgiue him
and comfort him: for, vve are not ignorant of the enterpriſes of Satan.</hi>
It is marueilous, that ſin blinds men ſo, that many cares no more
to be excommunicate, then if excommunication wer the lighteſt
thing in the world. There is ſuch a deadnes and ſenſleſnes in the
harts of men, that there is no diſpleaſure now for ſin, but, rather, a
delite and rejoycing in it. Certainely, the leſſe ſenſe of the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of that ſword of Excommunication, the greater miſerie. If
there were any diſpleaſure for ſinne in thee, it were an argument
that, there were helpe for thee; but if thou byde ſenſleſſe at that
ordinance of God, if thou be hardned againſt the word and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline
both ſhall turne to thy deſtruction. But, when God is
powerfull with in thee with it (for, as God is powerfull with the
Word, ſo is he powerfull by the Diſcipline) then, it ſhall turne
to thy well and ſaluation. Therefore, ſeeing there is ſuch a force
in it, mitigation is verie meete for it. Now here the way how it is
mitigate, <hi>Count him not as an enemie:</hi> The next, <hi>admoniſh him as a
brother.</hi> The firſt of theſe touches the inward thought, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
concernes thy outward ſpeaking to him. The firſt is, loſe
not a good opinion of him, hate him not, lightly him not, as
thogh he wer a conjurde enemie againſt Chriſt and his Church,
but loue him, loſe not the loue in thy hart towards him, but, loue
him, as a brother. Now, louing him in thy hart, ſpeak to him alſo,
think him not vnworthie of any ſpeaking, but, flatter him not in
his folie and humor, for, that will hurt him: for, if thou loue him,
thou wilt not, nor thou ought not to flatter him: But, I tell thee
what thou ſhalt doe, admoniſhe him both ſharply and louingly,
true admonition commes from the loue of the hart, and whom
we loue, we admoniſh: but, yet admonition muſt be ſo louing,
that it muſt be ſharpe alſo, and ſo it is effectuall in the hart of the
ſinner. Now louing him firſt, and admoniſhing him next, is the
way to win him, and to bring him home againe, who hes gone
aſtray. And if he be curable, certainely admonition will doe the
turne; if admonition will not doe the turne, nor, will not mooue
him, alas, brethren, it is ouer ſure an argument, that, that man is
vncurable, and that the Lord hes not ordeinde him for ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16659:263"/>
                  <hi>If the Goſpell be hid, it is hid to them, that periſhes,</hi> ſayes the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle

keeps his name. It ſhoots him not out of the Couenant of grace,
God forbid, but he ſtandes in the bonde, being Excommunicate.
What does it then? I ſhall tell you. A man that hes fallen from
Chriſt, by ſinne (which ſeueres thee from Chriſt) it bindes him
againe, it bringes him in repentance, and calles him home againe
being wandring from God, it holdes him within the Couenant:
A man going to be an enemie to Chriſt and his Church, it ſtraits
him to byde ſtill a brother. So it does him no euill, it is not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined
for his perdition, but, for his well and ſaluation. This
whole miniſtrie of Ieſus Chriſt and all the parts of it. Preaching
and Diſcipline, promiſes and conſolation, and threatning of
judgement, &amp; al the parts of Diſcipline, yea this Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it ſelfe, are al ordeined to ſaue ſoules, that is the proper vſe of
the miniſtrie, to ſaue all and neuer to loſe one man. Therefore,
in the 2. Cor. 10. 8. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, that, <hi>he got povver to edification and
not to deſtruction.</hi> Neuer Miniſter got power to deſtroy one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
but, to edifie; and if any periſhe, if the Word, or, Diſcipline
be the ſauor of death to death, as, to many, it is, let him not blame
the word, but, let him blame himſelf: For, men by their obſtinacy
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16659:264"/>
and malice turnes the word maliciouſly in an vnproper vſe, to
their deſtruction, and of the Spirit of life they make it the letter
of death. Therefore the Lord keepe vs from al ſlubbornnes and
all repying againſt this Word and Diſcipline: for I aſſure thee,
repine thou againſt the Goſpel and Diſcipline, which ſhould be
the power of life to thee, it ſhall kill thee, thou ſhalt not need a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
to kill thee euerlaſtingly? And therefore the Lord grant
euerie ſoule ſubmiſſion vnder the word of God, which is the
meane that he hes ordeind to ſaluation in Ieſus Chriſt. To whom
with the Father and holy Spirit be al praiſe for euer.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this text, brethren, we haue the end
and concluſion of this Epiſtle, it conſiſtes
wholly in prayer. Firſt he wiſhes peace to
them from the Lord of peace for euer, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
way. Then he wiſhes to them the
preſence of the Lord himſelfe to be with
them all. Laſt he ſalutes them, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the ſaluatation is a prayer for them.
The grace of our Lord Ieſus be with you
all, Amen. So all conſiſtes in prayer. Then learne. He beganne
this Epiſtle with prayer and ſalutation: throughout the whole
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:16659:264"/>
Epiſtle prayer is mingled: Now in the end he multiplies pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
What meanes this? Euen this, that in vaine is all doctrine,
exhortation, admonition, and precept whatſomouer, all preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is nothing, except the Lord by his Spirit worke inwardlie
in the harts of the hearers, all is nothing but vvinde, except
he moue their affections. Now the way to obtaine this inward
and ſecreete operation of the holy Spirite, is oft-tymes to turne
to God by prayer, beſeeching him to be povverfull, and to
joyne his Spirite vvith the vvord, and to joyne vvorking vvith
ſpeaking. And therefore hovv oft ſo euer we teach and ye hear,
the hart and eye ſhould be lifted vp, and ſet vpon him who hes
keeped Spirit and power in his owne hand to giue as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
No man can giue you it, neither the Preachour, nor no
Angell can giue you it. It is onely in the hand of God and Ieſus
Chriſt to giue thee Spirite and povver, and to joyne vvorking
vvith ſpeaking. And therefore the eye in preaching ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be ſet on Chriſt. The Paſtour ſhould pray and haue his
hart aboue to dravve dovvne grace to himſelfe and the people,
that the vvord ſpoken may be effectuall in the hart, othervviſe,
preaching and all hearing is in vaine.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the words. The firſt thing he prayes for and
wiſhes, is peace. <hi>The Lord of peace,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>giue you peace for euer
and euery vvay.</hi> The thing then he wiſhes is peace, that is quyet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
reſt and tranquillity, concord &amp; agreement all theſe words
expreſſes the meaning of the word Peace. The contrare is, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyetnes,<note place="margin">What peace is.</note>
diſſention, &amp;c. This Peace is the bleſſednes felicity &amp;
happy eſtate of Chriſts kingdome, which is his Church, both in
earth and Heauen: And all the graces we haue in Ieſus Chriſt
tends to this end, that, his ſubjects may liue in peace, quyetneſſe,
and joy, for euer: and that ſhall be the end, when we are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
peace and joy for euer. Ye ſee, the happy eſtate of a worldly
kingdome, what is it? When men liues in reſt, and enjoyes peace
and quyetnes, that is the happines of a worldly knigdom: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in the 1. Timot. 2. 2. he commaundes prayer to be made for
all men, <hi>For Kings and ſuperiour povvers.</hi> To what end? Euen
to this ſame end, <hi>that, vve may liue a peaceable and quyet lyfe.</hi>
Euen ſo, the bleſſed and happie eſtate of Chriſts kingdome, is,
an heauenlie peace, concord and quyetneſſe. And therefore,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16659:265"/>
Rom. 14. 17. he makes this peace to be eſſentiall to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God, that he defines it, by this peace, ſaying. <hi>The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God is righteouſnes, peace and ioy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> This Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
peace is onely in Chriſts kingdome, in his Church, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and earth. And the ſubjects of the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt
are onely they that enjoyes this peace here, and after this life for
euer: for, without the Church of Chriſt, there is no true peace:
If thou be no ſubject in his kingdome, thou haſt no reſt, no true
peace: for, there is no true <hi>peace for the vvicked,</hi> ſayes the Prophet
<hi>Eſay 57. 21.</hi> If thou be of that number that is without the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Chriſt, no peace for thee, and the end ſhall proue, thou
hadſt neuer true peace in this world.</p>
               <p>Now, to go forward. He craues, that, it may be giuen to them:
Then,<note place="margin">Peace the gift of god</note> it is a gift. Heauenly peace is the gift of God; thou haſt it
not by nature: None is borne with peace, but with warre and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitie,
by nature all are borne with diſſention, ſtrife and debate,
there is no heauenly peace, by nature. And the whole lyfe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
what is it, but a continuance in war, debate, and ſtrife: firſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God; next with thy ſelfe and thy owne conſcience? And
againe, a ſtrife againſt the Angels in Heauen and men on earth,
and all the creatures of God; thou art an enemie to them, and
they vnto thee, vntill the tyme thou attaine to that new birth in
Ieſus Chriſt; and then, by vertue of that birth, thou getſt this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
and ſpirituall peace: for, then, thou beginſt to liue at peace,
firſt, with God himſelfe, and next, with the Angels in Heauen,
and men in earth and with all his creatures. So, looke how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
it is, for thee, to haue regeneration: for, if thou want it, thou
ſhalt be at war for euer, thou ſhalt haue no peace. But how getſt
thou it? It is a gift. And who ſhold giue it? <hi>The Lord of peace.</hi> The
giuer of it muſt be the Lord, with dominion and power, with
command. And as vnder his Lordſhip other things muſt be, ſo
peace muſt be at his command, either to giue it, or, hold it. Now,
who is this Lord that hes this power of peace and war? Who is
he that ſayes, <hi>All povver is giuen to me in heauen and earth</hi> Matt. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

18. This Lord is Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore, ere euer he came in
this world and tooke on him our nature. <hi>Eſay 9. 6.</hi> he ſtyles him
<hi>the Prince of peace.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> Epheſ. 2. 14 ſtyles him <hi>peace</hi> it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he is our peace-maker And in <hi>Iohn 14. 27.</hi> Chriſt ſpeaking to his
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:16659:265"/>
Apoſtles takes on him to be the giuer of peace, and ſayes, <hi>My
peace I leaue to you,</hi> and giues you. So this Lord of peace is the
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who hes in his handes all grace and glorie, in
Heauen and in earth.</p>
               <p>Yet to goe forward.<note place="margin">The lords ſtyle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the grace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> Why is it that he makes a choiſe of this
ſtyle rather then of any other? Certainely this ſtyle he receiues
here agrees with the petition and thing asked at his hands: peace
is craued, he is ſtyled the Lord of peace: what euer we aske of
Chriſt it ſhould be in faith that he hes power to giue it: aske i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
thou peace, aske it not but in an aſſurance that it is in his hand,
and that he is able to giue it. Now this aſſurance that all is in his
hand, it cannot be better vttered then by the Name and ſtyle
we giue him: askeſt thou wiſdome? ſay, Lord of wiſdome giue
wiſdome: askeſt thou peace? ſay, Lord of peace giue me peace:
askeſt thou mercie? ſay, Lord of mercy giue me mercy. So the
name and ſtyle we giue to the Lord when we craue ought at his
hands ſhould be anſwerable to the grace and mercy we aske: for
then we vtter our faith and aſſurance that he hes ſuch a grace
and power to giue vs. This hes bene the forme of <hi>Pauls</hi> prayer,
and of godly men of old, and ſhould be imitate by vs. The Lord
hes many ſtyles, he is called the Lord of peace, mercy and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
the Lord of glorie. There is not a Monarch that prydes
himſelf in honourable ſtyles and names, that is comparable with
the great Creator the Lord of the world, yea ſet them altogether
all are nothing in compariſon with him, becauſe all are his, all
grace, power and dominion in Heauen and earth is his; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
look by how many graces his Majeſtie hes ſpread it ſelfe
through Heauen and earth, look how many graces he hes in his
hand to giue, ſo many ſeuerall and honourable ſtyles may he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
there is no end of his glory, nor no end of his Names: from
his wiſdome he is called the Lord of wiſdome; from his juſtice
the Lord of juſtice; from his mercy the Lord of mercy; from his
peace the Lord of peace; from his glory the Lord of glory.</p>
               <p>Now to goe forward.<note place="margin">Tvvo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of peace. 1. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting</note> There are two properties giuen to this
peace. The firſt, It is for euer, <hi>alvvayes,</hi> it is not for a tyme onely,
but for all tymes: It is not for this lyfe onely, but for the lyfe to
come. This worldly peace ſerues but for this lyfe onely, but the
peace of Ieſus Chriſt ſerues for the lyfe euerlaſting. The peace
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16659:266"/>
of God is not peace in proſperitie onely, but in aduerſitie alſo.
It is not peace in life onely, but in death alſo. And therefore <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
in his ſong when he had ſeene Ieſus, he ſayes, <hi>Novv Lord,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> depart in peace. Luke 2. 29.</hi> the ſeruant of God
as he liued in great peace, ſo alſo departed in peace: ſo this peace
laſtes for euer. And therefore <hi>Eſay 9. 7.</hi> when he hes called him
the Prince of peace, he ſayes, the largeneſſe of his dominion <hi>and
increaſe of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> at and peace ſhall haue no end:</hi> his kingdome
is an endles kingdome, and there is an endles peace in that king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome.
I called this peace our bleſſedneſſe. Now this is the nature
of bleſſedneſſe, it cannot be bounded within any tearms: if it be
true ſelicitie bound it not, compaſſe it not within a yeere, within
twentie yeeres, or within a thouſand, yea within ten thouſand
yeeres: for the nature of true bleſſedneſſe is euerlaſting. And
therefore ye ſee worldly men that places their happineſſe in
worldly peace will dreame an eternity, and perpetuitie to that
peace of theirs, that neither they nor their peace will haue an
end. That rich man in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke 12. 19.</hi> ſaid to his ſoule,
<hi>Liue at eaſe, eate and drinke, and take thy paſtime, thou hast ſtore
laid vp for many yeeres:</hi> trow ye not but he thought to liue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and thought that that aboundance ſhould abyde with him
for euer? and ſo faires it with all worldlings, they dreame a reſt
and peace for euer, but the end will proue that they wer dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their dayes. Therefore Lord ſet our harts on that peace
of Ieſus Chriſt that laſtes for euer. This is then the firſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of this peace of his; It laſts for euer. The ſecond propertie of
it is It is <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> of vvay.</hi> It is peace in all reſpects, not in one
reſpect onely nor in ſome reſpects onely,<note place="margin">2. It is in al reſpects</note> but in euery reſpect.
I ſhall make this plaine. The peace of Ieſus Chriſt is peace in
reſpect of God, when our ſoules ſtandes in friendſhip with him,
when we are reconceiled to him by the bloud of Ieſus, as it is
ſaid. Rom 5. 1. <hi>Being iuſtified by faith vve haue peace tovvards God.</hi>
Then it is peace in reſpect of our ſelues, an euill conſcience is an
euill enemie, when thou ſtryueſt not againſt thy owne affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
but ſatiſfies them, then thy conſcience will let thee get little
reſt, it will ay be accuſing thee: but when once this peace of
Ieſus be giuen thee, ſo that thou beginſt to be regenerate, and to
lead an holy and ſanctified lyfe, then thy conſcience reſts, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16659:266"/>
thou beginſt to enjoy a joyfull peace in thy ſoule. Philipp. 4. 7.
<hi>The peace of God that paſſes all vnderſtanding preſerue your harts and
myndes in Christ Ieſus:</hi> and Col. 3. 15. <hi>Let the peace of God rule in
your harts.</hi> And againe, it is peace in reſpect of the creatures of
God, with Angels in Heauen, with men on earth (man is enemie
to man by nature) then hauing this peace thou art at peace with
Heauen and earth, man and Angell: for all are enemes to thee
ſo long as thou art outwith Ieſus Chriſt, we are enemies to them
all, and they all to vs: but being in Chriſt all things are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to vs, <hi>in heauen and earth.</hi> Epheſ. 1. 10. Col. 1. 20. ſo in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
it is peace. Looke how many ſortes of enimities was, as
many ſortes of peace muſt be; we are enemies to God, to our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne
conſcience, to Angels and men, yea, and that that is moſt
conjoyned to vs by nature, be it bloude, aſfinitie, or any other
bond; if there be no more but nature, there is nothing but enimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
the conjunction of man and woman, if there be no more but
their natural bond is enimity; the parents and the children with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this ſpirituall peace of Ieſus are at enimitie. So, looke how
many ſorts of enimitie there is, there are as many ſorts of peace,
and our bleſſedneſſe ſtandes in this peace. Now looke the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it. As bleſſedneſſe muſt indure for euer, ſo our bleſſednes
muſt be perfite. If thou haſt that peace of Ieſus, thou muſt haue
it in all reſpects: if thou haſt peace with God, thou haſt peace
with all men, ſo far as lyes in thee: (Rom 12. 18.) otherwiſe, thou
haſt no true peace with God. Men oft-tymes beguyles themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.
I will haue peace with God, will he ſay, and yet, I ſhal be this
man, or that mans enemie, I ſhall ſlay him: folie, folie; if thou
glorie in debate with man and does not that lyes into thy power,
to be at peace with all men, thou ſhalt haue no peace with God:
that thing which the Lord joynes, ſeuere not thou, the Lords
peace is with al: if thou ſeuere it and pryde thee in enimitie with
any, thou ſhalt not haue peace with God, nor with thy ſelf. What
peace hes a murtherer with God, or with his owne conſcience?
Aske at him, I demand thee, ô murtherer, knew thou what that
peace of God meanes, when that bloudie affection raged and
caried thee to bloude? Thou lookeſt for friendſhip with God,
folie, thou art neither at friendſhip with God, nor his Angels,
nor none of his creatures. It is a wonder, that the Heauens falles
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16659:267"/>
not on thee. The earth is thy enemy, and it is a vvonder that it
ſwallows thee not vp for al that bloud that thou haſt ſhed on it,
but once it ſhall preſent it to thy damnation, if thou repent not.
This far concerning prayer for peace.</p>
               <p>I goe to the next words. <hi>The Lord</hi> be <hi>vvith you all.</hi> He goes to
a deeper ground. Before he wiſhed the grace of the Lord Ieſus
to them. Novv he vviſhes the Lord himſelfe to them, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Ieſus Chriſt in his ovvn perſon, not onely that he ſhall
be vvith them in his grace and vertevv, but alſo that he may
be vvith them in his ovvne preſence and perſon, vvhich is more
then the firſt. Then thou muſt not be content to pray for the
benefites of Chriſt, but the cheefe ihing vve ought to pray
for to Chriſt is, Lord giue me thy ſelfe, giue me thy preſence
in thy ovvne perſon: for if vve get any good of him it muſt be
by himſelfe, he muſt giue himſelfe to vs. In one vvord, the firſt
conjunction vve muſt haue vvith him muſt be vvith his ovvne
perſon, he muſt be our head, and vve the members of his bodie:
My hand vvill not be the better of any povver or vertue in my
head, if my hand be not joined with my head; the firſt thing then
my hand muſt haue, muſt be a conjunction with the head, and ſo
of the reſt of the members of the body, and then the conjunction
being made vvith the head, the vertue goes down from the head
and is ſcatred throgh al the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the body. It is euen ſo with
Chriſt Ieſus before we get grace or lyfe out of him, motion ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
out of hi, peace out of him (he is full of grace) firſt that
ſweet conjunction muſt be made betvveene him and vs, he muſt
be conjoined vvith vs in a more ſtrate conjunction then the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
vvith the head. And therefore he goes to the ground of all
peace the Lord Ieſus, that he may ſtand vvith them, and they
may be conjoined with him their head.</p>
               <p>Now he prayes for this preſence to <hi>them all:</hi> not to one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to tvvo or three, but to all and euerie one of them. Then
marke. The Lord Ieſus is a ſufficient head and Sauiour for all
the vvorld, none being excepted, all ſufficiencie is in him, he
may ſerue to be the head to all the vvorld, yea to a thouſand
vvorldes, his preſence is ſo ample that he may ſuffice to be a
Sauiour to a thouſand vvorldes; yea, to an infinite number of
vvorldes. <hi>Paul</hi> knevv this that he is not like an earthlie king,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:16659:267" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vvhoſe preſence ſerues but for ſo many, and is contained vvithin
narrow bounds, and therefore he prayes for peace to all. Now if
thy head and Sauiour be ſo ample, thy hart ſhould not be nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovve,
nor thy mouth narrovve: but as Ieſus is a ſufficient head
for all, ſo let thy hart deſire his preſence to all the vvorld, if
ſo it ſhould be poſſible. And as for my ſelfe, I vviſhe there
vvere none but that they vvere partakers of this preſence of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt: For, vvhy ſhould vve ſeeke the vvreak of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
yet the Lord hes his ovvne, and none vvill get his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
but they that are his. O, vvell is that bodie vvho is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate
to lyfe, for that bodie muſt haue his preſence, he vvill
be an head and Sauiour to him! But that body that is predeſtinat
to deſtruction cannot haue his preſence; yet vve are bound to
vviſh his preſence to euery one.</p>
               <p>Novv he commes to the ſalutation, and ſayes, <hi>The ſalutation of
me Paul vvith my ovvne hand.</hi> Then he ſubjoines the forme of it
<hi>The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> He began vvith a ſalutation
after his common forme, and novv he ends vvith a ſalutation.
His firſt meeting vvith them vvas by a ſalutation, the end of his
conference is by a ſalutation. Then looke vvhat example
of his doing ſhould learne vs: for as vve are bound to obey
the doctrine of the Prophets, ſo we are bound to follow their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
of doing: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaluted, ſalute thou. The thing then I note
here is this, In all the meetinges and conferences of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
either by vvord, preſence, or vvritte, there ſhould be a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
beneuolence, and an intere loue and affection; that as ye
ſee the bodies of men meete together, ſo the harts may meete
together joyned in kyndneſſe and beneuolence: Wilt thou meet
in bodie and hold thy hart aback, that is, vvilt thou haue the half
man meeting, and not the whole man? That is no meeting: for
the meeting ſhould be of the vvhole man, bodie and hart: and
this ſhould be vttered all maner of vvay, in thy geſture, in thy
doing,<note place="margin">ſalutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would be teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies of their loue.</note> in thy ſpeaking, and all the vvordes of thy conference
ſhould ſmell of loue: Among all other thinges that teſtifies of
loue, this ſalutation is one, when thou bidſt him good morrowe,
good night, it is a teſtification of thy well willingnes and of thy
loue towards the man: and this hes bene the forme of the godly,
their meeting hes bene with a ſalutation; and their ſending with
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16659:268"/>
a ſalutation, that if they could not haue a byding together here,
by their mutuall ſaluation they might abyde together: for all
the members that are true members in Ieſus Chriſt, are joyned
together in their ſpirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> harts and affections, this exemple we
ſhould followe. This maner of doing nowadayes is counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite:
Men will ſeeme to ſalute other gladly, and yet the harts
will be wiſhing the worſt: in harts they are enemies to other,
and ſo commonly al their doings, becking, and off-cap, and good
dayes; both all their words and deeds are fained. Looke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what euer thou doe, doe it in ſinceritie: for the Lord heares
and ſees all, and if thou doe fainedly, the Lord ſhall judge thee
for it in that day.</p>
               <p>He ſayes, he wrote this ſaluation <hi>vvith his ovvne hand.</hi> The
whole Epiſtle before <hi>Paul</hi> hes dyted, and appearantly another
hes written it. Now when it commes to the ſubſcription, <hi>Paul</hi>
ſubſcryues it with his owne hand. Now wherefore was this?
The cauſe appeares to be that before this tyme there raiſe vp
deceiuers that ſtole in wrytings vnder the name of <hi>Paul,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in the 2. chap. 2. verſe, <hi>be not deceiued,</hi> ſayes he, &amp;c. And
therefore to let them know what was his, and what was not his, he
ſubſcryues with his own hand. This hes bene an old practick of
Satan, euer to corrupt Chriſts Church, both by word and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaiting
of writte, and all maner of way, and this ſame day we
ſee the experience of it in the Romane Church.<note place="margin">Satan by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

that falſe writtes may be trowed the better, looke the craft of the
deuill, he hes in his inſtruments ſtollen in bookes written vnder
the name of Prophets and Apoſtles, to the intent that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
reading the name of a Prophete or Apoſtle ſhould giue
credite to the writ. Papiſtrie is full of deceite, and the cheefe
grounds of their doctrine is Apocryphe-books which hes bene
ſtollen in vnder the names of holy men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now looke what hes
beene the mercy of God, he ſees this well eneugh. Therefore it
pleaſed him to imprint a marke in his holy writte, whereby it
ſhould be knowne to be authentike Scripture, as in this place he
ſubſcryues with his owne hand, which was not without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of God: for there is not a part of Scripture but the Lord
hes ſtamped it with ſuch a ſure ſtampe, that is, with ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie
in ſpeaking, with ſuch gratiouſneſſe and ſpiritualneſſe,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:16659:268" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both in words and matter, that they that hes a ſpirituall eye to
diſcerne betweene light and darkneſſe will take it vp to be of
God. I pray you tell me, how was the olde Scripture tane vp to
be of God? The Papiſt will ſay, becauſe the Church ſaid it they
were of God. Is that all the warrand? And who told the Church?
If the olde and new Scripture bare not the markes of the Spirit
in themſelues the Church had neuer tane them vp to be of God?
So the marke of the Scripture is that ſtampe of the Spirit, that
Majeſtie in ſuch a ſimplicitie of wordes: that gratiouſneſſe and
power which ſhows both in the wordes and matter, theſe things
telles vs they are not mans writs: for, mens writtes hes not the
gratiouſneſſe and power that is in the Scripture. Brethren, this
marke of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſubſcription is away, albeit we haue the Epiſtle,
but a better marke bydes, the ſtampe of the Lord bydes, and this
telles that it is the Scripture of God and <hi>Pauls</hi> writing.</p>
               <p>Now followes the ſaluation. <hi>The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
be vvith you all.</hi> I ſee the affection of the man in the end of his
writ is powred out on this Church of Theſſalonica, and when he
takes his leaue, he burſtes out in frequent prayer, and al his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is for heauenly and ſpirituall thinges. Then, firſt, we learne,
we muſt not euer bide al together, and we cannot haue euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
either by word or writ. But, how is our ſundring recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed?
To wit, with greatneſſe of affection, let thy loue grow.
And how ſhalt thou vtter it? In prayer to God, for them, with
whom thou may not dwell: affection is nothing worth without
praier. And what ſhould we pray for? Eſpecially for heauenlie
things: Pray for heauenly peace, for the preſence of Ieſus Chriſt,
and that the grace of Chriſt may be with him: Pray alſo for
things earthly, but ſo that they may further him to heauenlie
thinges. And I ſay, the man that cannot pray for heauenly things
cannot pray truely for earthly thinges. Dare thou pray, if thou
ſeeke not firſt the kingdome of Heauen? no, thou cannot pray,
if it were for thy dinner, except thou pray firſt for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God. Now the next word is <hi>grace,</hi> that is free fauour of
God. I reade not of ſuch a commendation of any people as of
theſe Theſſalonians. He commended them in both theſe Epiſtles,
from their faith, hope, loue, and all the dueties of loue. Yet, he
ſayes not, The Lord render you a rewarde for your merite; but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:16659:269"/>
he ſayes <hi>grace be vvith you.</hi> This is contrare to all merite. Read
the 2. Timo. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. there ye will finde a very notable exemple to
this purpoſe. There he ſayes, <hi>Oneſiphorus vvas very beneficiall to
me, he oft refreſhed me, he thought no ſhame of my bondes: he ſought
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Rome very diligently.</hi> How ſhould he be requyted for this?
He ſayes, <hi>The Lord grant that Oneſiphorus may finde mercy vvith
the Lord at that day:</hi> He is but a miſerable man when he hes done
all this: And therefore this ſhall be my prayer for him: for it will
not be his merite that will do him good, but it is the free grace
and fauour of God. O foole, all thy merites ſhall ſtinke in that
great day, and then thou ſhalt ſee what free grace ſhall do: for in
that day none ſhall ſtand, but ſuch as ſtands by free grace.</p>
               <p>Now whoſe grace is it he prayes for? It is Ieſus Chriſts: No,
there is no grace but Chriſts grace. How is it the Lord Ieſus
Chriſts? He hes boght of the hand of the Father all grace, al gifts
of the holy Spirit, all glorie in Heauen and earth with a pryce,
euen the pryce of his precious bloude. And therefore the Father
hes giuen him all. So there is no ſparke of grace giuen to any
creature, but it muſt come through Chriſt his hand, euen the
hand of the man Ieſus. All righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and
glorie muſt come from him, he muſt be the giuer thereof. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ſaid, <hi>he gaue gifts to men.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 8. The Father giues
no graces immediatly, but all are giuen through the hand of
Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore let vs haue recourſe to this Lord of
grace, and ſeeke not to the Father without him, but ſeek all from
the Father in him. Now how far ſhould this grace extend? Euen
as Ieſus Chriſt is an head that extends himſelfe to al, ſo the grace
that commes from him is ſufficient for all: it is ſufficient if it were
for a thouſand, yea infinite worlds. Rom. 5. 15. The Heauens are
not capable of the greatnes of the grace of Ieſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the grace of Chriſt.</note> ſo that
if there were a thouſand worlds, there is ſufficiency of grace in
him for them all: There is no inlack in him, but the inlack is in
thy narrow hart; it is capable but of a very ſmall portion. Learne
here then by the exemple of <hi>Paul</hi> that we ſhould not haue nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
harts to wiſh this grace to a few, but we ſhould wiſh it to
be giuen to all. Looke what he ſayes of himſelfe, 2. Cor. 6. 11.
<hi>My meuth,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>hes bene vvyde open vnto you, my hart is dilated,
ye dvvell not narrovvly in my hart.</hi> So all men ſhould haue an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:16659:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and a dilated hart in wiſhing grace: ſpare not to be liberall
in wiſhing, fill thy hart and mouth with his grace, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
with liberalneſſe to others: ſeeke that grace of Ieſus to all, that,
if it were poſſible, all the world might be ſaued: <hi>For this is good
and acceptable in the ſight of God our Sauiour, vvho vvill that all
men ſhall be ſaued, and come vnto the acknovvledging of the trueth.</hi>
1. Tim. 2. chap. 3. 4. verſ. Yet the Lord hes his owne, and ſo many
as he hes written in his booke ſhall be ſaued. Therefore thou
ſhould ſeeke all the warrands thou can to aſſure thee that thou
art Ieſus Chriſts fore-ordeinde to lyfe euerlaſting: for if thou
be of the number of the elect, the grace of Chriſt ſhall
extend to thee, and thou ſhalt haue glorie with
him for euer. To this Ieſus be all praiſe,
honour and dominion, for euer and
euer.</p>
