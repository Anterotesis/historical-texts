            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>It has been of a long time the wiſh of my heart to have had nothing to do with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemick writings; the bodies of ſojours are no more ſubject to wounds and manifold hardſhips, then the minds and names of diſputant Divines do lie open to various vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

            </p>
            <p>It ſeems that yet for ſome time the ſervants of God muſt earneſtly contend for many pretious truths, which erroneous ſpirits do mightily impugne: for the help and encouragement of others in that warfare, I, though among the weakeſt of Chriſts ſouldiers, doe offer theſe my endeavours. It was my purpoſe to have made a farther progreſſe, and to have handled all I mention in my Preface; but being cald away from my preſent ſtation by theſe who ſet me therein, upon the occaſion your Lordſhip knowes, my ſtudies in this kinde are broken off; ſo that this eſſay in <hi>Browniſme</hi> and <hi>Independency</hi> muſt go forth alone, or nothing at all.</p>
            <p>My ay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in theſe two is, and was in all the reſt; Firſt, in an hiſtorick way to ſet down the originall and progreſſe of the errour; next its compleat parts together in one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that at one view the whole face of the way may be repreſented; for I conceived it many wayes advantageous and very ſatisfactory in debating either a truth or an error,
<pb facs="tcp:50687:3"/>
to be brought to ſee the fountain and originall whence it hath ſprung, the ſtreams and iſſues whither the Tenet tends of it ſelfe, or is drawn by its followers; to behold a way not in its pieces, but the whole together from the head to the feet, the begining, midſt, and end without any concealment or diſguiſe. Thirdly, my purpoſe was to have examined the principall parts of every errour in a ſhort, cleare, and popular method, conſidering the maine Scriptures that uſe to be alledged in the point either <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>contra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beleeve this my method will not be diſpleaſing to any. I know it was acceptable enough to many of the Congregationall way when lately I did uſe it againſt the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburian Faction; but poſſibly ſome of the matter of my hiſtorick part may fall out to be faſhions to the followers of the Tenets which I labour to lay open; for it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydable to make a true and a full narration of any erroneous way, but ſuch things muſt be told which will be diſpleaſing to ſome; yet I hope I have given as little of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in this kinde, as any other could have done in ſuch a way of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reatiſing; for all the paſſages that may be pungent of the tendereſt skin, are ſuch, as not only I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to bee very true, but ſuch alſo which I ever make preſently good by ſufficient Teſtimonies ſet downe fully at the end of every Chapter in the expreſſe words of the Authors. Secondly, the opinions or practiſes I alledge, are ſuch as the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this day do openly avow, or elſe have beene objected to them by very honeſt men long ago in print, and to this day, ſo farre as I know, are not taken off by any tolerable anſwer; in all that is over and above, I will undertake to give ample ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction wherein ſoever I give the leaſt offence to any.</p>
            <p>I date appeale to your Lordſhips knowledge, and to many others who have beene acquainted with all my by-gone walking, how averſe I have ever been from cauſing griefe to any, eſpecially good men: ſo farre as I am conſcious to my moſt ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, it is my hearts deſire that all our preſent controverſies might quickly either be ended or compoſed by calme, meek, and peaceable meanes, and theſe alone.</p>
            <p>That lately renewed Committee for Accommodation, Oh if it might pleaſe the Lord to ſhine upon it, however I may not ſtay to ſee its ſucceſſe; yet wherever I am, my beſt wiſhes ſhall be poured upon it, eſpecially when I ſhall heare, as I have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to beleeve is only intended, that it abides circumſcribed within the bounds of that prudent Order whereby it is renewed.</p>
            <p>For firſt, that Order is ſo farre from holding out an Accommodation for all the ſects of the Land, that it ſpeaks only of the differences that are among the members of the Aſſembly. Liberty of Conſcience, and Toleration of all or any Religion is ſo prodigious an impiety, that this religious Parliament cannot but abhorre the very nameing of it. Whatever may be the opinion of <hi>Io. Goodwin,</hi> of Mr <hi>Williams</hi> and ſome of their ſtamp, yet Mr <hi>Burrowes</hi> in his late Irenicon upon many unanſwerable arguments explodes that abomination. Likewiſe our Brethren who ſeek to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate, will be willing I hope to profeſſe their going along with us, without any conſiderable d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſent, as in the Directory for all the parts of divine worſhip, ſo in the confeſſion of Faith and Catechiſm.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Order expreſſes only the differences in Church-government; what other opinions wee have mentioned in the following Treatiſe, I hope our Brethren will either diſavow and paſſe from them, or elſe be content to bury them in their owne breaſts, till time and better information make them die and vaniſh without more moyſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50687:3"/>Thirdly, the intent of the Order is to bring up the diſſenting Brethren <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o approve of the Government agreed upon in the Aſſembly and allowed by both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; or if that cannot be, to ſee how in ſome practiſes they may be forborn. This doth ſuppoſe that our Brethren ſhall not be permitted to print, preach, or publiſh any thing againſt the Goverment eſtabliſhed by Parliament; alſo that in the practice of this Government they ſhall be obliged to joyne ſo farre with their Brethren as their principles may ſuffer. This being, I doubt not but in many things they ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l be much forborn; for whatever be the unadviſed raſhneſſe of ſome in their way, yet if they may be pleaſed, according to their frequent offers (as I remember) to be conſtant members of our Presbyteries and Synods, and there to give were it but their conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative voyce, I beleeve that few of them ſhall ever be preſſed to much more; for if they agree among themſelves, and governe well their owne Congregations, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie that concerns them will ever come before any ſuperiour Aſſembly; and if any complaint of their male adminiſtration, or any matter of ordination or excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication ſhould come from them to be cognoſced in a Presbytery or Synod, the reſult might ever be to them as a matter of advice to be executed in their owne Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by their owne Paſtors, if they did finde it right: or if it appeared wrong, the Generall Aſſembly, or at leaſt the Parliament, would give them ſo much ſatisfaction, as on earth can be expected.</p>
            <p>Albeit I am in opinion, that no caſe meerly Eccleſiaſticall ſhall ever need to goe from a Generall Aſsembly to a Parliament; theſe two bodies are ſo friendly and neare of kin, that none who knowes their nature and conſtitution will ever feare their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. I dare ſay, that all the jealouſies which are preſented to the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of a Nationall Aſsembly, are meere Bugbeares and childiſh frightments, ariſing alone out of miſ-information and unacquaintance; for both reaſon and experience will demonſtrate that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> cannot have on earth ſo ſtrong pillars and pregnant ſupporters of all their Priviledges, as free Proteſtant Aſsemblies eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Law, and kept in their full freedom from the loweſt to the higheſt, from the Congregationall Elderſhip to the Generall Synod of the Nation. No ſuch Barres as theſe are imaginable either againſt Tyranny or Anarchy; they are the mightieſt impediments both to the exorbitancy of Monarchs, which has been and is our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; and to the extravagancy of the common multitude, attempting to correct and ſubject all Parliaments to their owne fooliſh deſires, which is like to be the matter of our next exerciſe and trouble.</p>
            <p>Proteſtant Aſsemblies examined to the bottom, will be found reall and cordiall friends to all the Iuſt, Legall and reaſonable Prerogatives of a Monarch, to all the equitable and profitable Liberties of the meaneſt ſubject; but above all to every due priviledge of a Chriſtian Parliament. Sometimes we laugh, ſometimes we grieve to ſee men afraid out of meere ignorance with that which we know is their great good. I am perſwaded that after a little experience, Congregationall Seſſions, Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſicall Presbyteries, Provinciall Synods, and Nationall Aſsemblies will be embraced and ſluck to by the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> as the greateſt and moſt uſefull priviledges of their great Charter.</p>
            <p>My fourth remarke upon the Order in hand is, that it ſpeakes alone of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Government, whereby the Aſſemblie was retarded, but nothing of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Congregations which never came to any conſiderable debate, much leſſe
<pb facs="tcp:50687:4"/>
did ever retard the Aſſemblies proceedings: and albeit the words of the Order might be extended beyond the Government to the conſtitution, yet wee may not thinke that the Houſe doth intend to tolerate the gathering of ſeparate Congregations; in this point we hope that the deſired accommodation ſhall ſatisfie our Brethren, and all tolerations ſhall be needleſſe. Themſelves are witneſſes of our moſt earneſt Deſires, of our very reall indeavours, (and we wiſh, they had been much more our helper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But when the Aſſembly and <hi>Parliament</hi> have done their uttermoſt, to have the Churches purified ſo farre as is poſſible, if notwithſtanding of all that can be done, our Brethren will yet ſeparate, and peremptorily refuſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate as Members, in the beſt ruled Congregations, either of <hi>England,</hi> or of any other reformed Church; wee confeſſe, that by ſuch a Declaration, our Brethren would put us to a great deale of perplexity; for ſuch a ſeparation as this, were as we conceive, the moſt palpable and unreaſonable Schiſme that ever yet was heard of in the Chriſtian World, much contrary to the word of God, and evidently deſtructive of the neceſſary peace of all theſe Churches wherein it ſhould bee tolerated; beſide its cleare contradiction in termes, not onely to the Order of the Houſe, but to the ſolemn League and Covenant of the three Kingdomes. Notwiihſtanding wee truſt that the grace and mercy of God, ſhall be ſo richly powred out upon this revived <hi>Committee,</hi> as ſhall enable them to expedit both us and our Brethren from theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe unextricable Labirynths.</p>
            <p>Would to God that our Controverſies with them were brought to a happy period, that both they and we, with all our power might concurre to reduce the reſt of our poore Brethren, who this day are pitifully intangled in manifold hereſies and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſo all the childr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Your Lordſhip is conſcious to the firſt deſignes of the Noble Patriots of that your Nation, it was never their mind to have trifled ſo much time in jangling with their Brethren of this Iſle, about new and needleſſe queſtions, but expecting a facility of ſetling truth and Peace within theſe S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They have the more to anſwer who here and elſewhere have been the unhappy inſtruments, not only to fruſtrate theſe great and gracious enterpriſes for the Weale-publick of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but alſo to bring the undertakers to ſo low a condition, that they be obliged this day to God alone for any tollerable ſubſiſtence and their very being: albeit we are hopefull the Lord is reſerving good things for them, who had ſo much Faith, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Courage, as to venture all for the cauſe of God, and their Brethren, the more unkind men have proved unto them; The Lord who hath been witneſſe to all their intentions, actions and ſufferings, will in his owne time accordingly reward them, and will not let them be aſhamed of their firſt hopes and conſtant deſires, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the which himſelfe for a long time did ſhine ſo evidently from the Heaven, as ever
<pb facs="tcp:50687:4"/>
upon any enterpriſe on the Earth. Though now that brightneſſe be much ecclipſed, and overclouded, yet we are expecting with paſſionate deſires, and confident hopes, the diſſolution of theſe clouds, and the diſpelling of the preſent darkeneſſe by the ſtrength of the Beames of his ancient and undeſerved kindneſſe, towards that now ſuffering and much diſtreſſed Nation.</p>
            <p>But inſenſibly my pen hath runne beyond the bounds of a ſhort Epiſtle, albeit my experience of your Lordſhips readineſſe to diſpence with your friends indiſcretion, makes me ſecure of my pardon. I will detaine your Lordſhip no longer, I lay downe my Booke at your Lordſhips feet, to be given to the world by your Lordſhips hand. If it be received with ſo much candor and charity by every Reader, as I know it is offered, it may poſſibly prove ſerviceable. Thus wiſhing to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in theſe dayes of deepe and dangerous tryalls, and too great defection of many, conſtancy, and daily increaſe of affection to all truth, Piety, Iuſtice, and every Vertue, I remaine,</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHile the fire of War continues to ſcorch every one of theſe miſerable Dominions,<note place="margin">The firſt and chief Mean to extinguiſh the flames of our War, is the waters of the heart poured out in prayers to God.</note> it is the duty of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Countrey-men to contribute the uttermoſt of their beſt endeavours for the extinguiſhing of theſe unhappie Flames, before the remainder of all our Churches and States be burnt down to aſhes.</p>
            <p>Too much Oil already hath dropped from many unhallowed Pens; the times now do paſſionately call for Waters; and them, the more cold and clear, the better, for quenching the thirſt of this devouring Beaſt. Vinegar and Gall, though in the largeſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, whole rivers of Blood will not allay, but augment the heat of a Civil War; The moſt hopeful Peace-makers, from whoſe intermedling the greateſt ſucceſſe is to be expected, are they whoſe veſſels are filled moſt plentifully with tears, to be poured out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of God.</p>
            <p>The fire which this day prevails againſt us, which burns up not the fleſh onely, but the very bones of our Kingdoms, is from above: it is the Lord who <hi>burns againſt Iacob like a flaming fire which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours round about.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 2.3.</note> When the ſcorching heat of the Sun dries up the moiſture from the graſſe and corn, there is no remedy for the languiſhing fields, till the vapours aſcend from below, and thicken in a cloud; then incontinent the burning beams are intercepted, the ſhowres deſcend from above to refreſh and renew the withered face of the parched ground. The moſt ſeaſonable exerciſe of al who love the peace of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> is to fill the air with the exhalations of their Spirits, with the perfumes ariſing from the kindled In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of their Prayers; much of theſe holy vapours will hardly make up one cloud; wherefore many hearts would daily be brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing up together ſome ſtore of that heavenly ſmoke. However for a time all our endeavours may ſeem to be quite evaniſhed, and when we have gone out to behold much ofter then ſeven times, there may appear to our eye not ſo much as the ſmalleſt beginning of the leaſt cloud; yet when the period of Gods appointed ſeaſon is come, when <hi>the three yeers and ſix moneths</hi> are paſt over and gone, there will certainly ariſe a cloud which, however at firſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall, and no broader then a hand, yet will quickly become ſo big as to fill the heavens with voices, and ſend down to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

A Reformation after mourning, is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſtep to a ſolid Pacification. Long may we petition both God and men for peace in vain; long may we article and treat for that end without any ſucceſſe, unleſſe a reall Reformation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from the ſight of God the perſonal abominations, the State-tranſgreſſions, and the Church-impieties of our Lands.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church is the fountain of our preſent Miſery.</note>The Crimes of perſons are grievous, but thoſe of a State are more. The corruption of a member is not ſo grievous as of the whole Body; and the deformity of the Body Political, is not ſo unpleaſant to the eye of God as of the Church: this is the Body, this is the Bride of Chriſt; nothing ſo much provokes the paſſion of a loving Husband, as the polluting of his Spouſe. Church-grievances were the firſt and main cauſes of our preſent Troubles; the righting of theſe, will open the door of our firſt hope of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>

All Treaties for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating State-differences, will be loſt, if in the firſt place Religion be not provided for, according to the minde of God. If once the Temple were builded, and filled with the cloud, the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties would be ſmall in making up the breaches in the houſe of the Kingdom, and filling it with Peace and Proſperity. So long as the Temple lies deſolate, it is not poſſible to rear up the walls of the City. It were the wiſedom of our great Builders, when they finde themſelves over-toiled in the Fifth yeer of their <hi>Work,</hi> as they deſire not to have all their by-paſt labours vain and fruitleſſe, at laſt in good earneſt to ſet upon the building of the Church.</p>
            <p>Intereſts of private perſons and particular Factions, laid over with the colour of pretended State-reaſons, may procraſtinate days without number, ſetling of Religion: yet if we truſt either an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or late experience, theſe States-men provide beſt for the welfare of their Countrey, who give to the God of heauen, to his Worſhip and Houſe, the firſt and moſt high place in all their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and cares.</p>
            <p>If we behold either the former, or the later Reformers of the State of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; if we conſider the practice of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> of <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and others, it is evident the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi> the <hi>Ark,</hi> the <hi>Temple,</hi> did firſt and moſt lie at all their hearts. Our Neighbours and Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when this our Diſeaſe was upon them, and did preſſe them well-neer to death and ruine, by this method of Phyſick did in a ſhort time regain their full health and ſtrength, in the which they had great appearence to have continued, without any Recidive, unleſſe their pious compaſſion and brotherly attendance upon us in our languiſhing, had made them partakers of theſe evils in our Company which they had clean eſcaped,</p>

I have heard it from reverend Miniſters, that he was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon beater of his poor old wife, and would not ſtick to defend publikely this his wicked practice; alſo, that he was an open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faner of the Sabbath; and that his injuſtice, in not paying the ſmall pittance he was indebted to him whom lazineſſe in his Calling made him to keep for the ſupply of the cure of his Parſonage, did bring him to priſon, in the which, for that very cauſe, he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till death.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50687:20"/>
the firſt ſetled Congregation of <hi>Browniſts</hi> we read of.</p>
            <p>This man, with <hi>Ainſworth</hi> his Doctor, ſent out to all the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches the Confeſſion of their Faith, in the yeer 1602. But long it was not till it appeared to the world that no better ſpirit did reign in that company then in the former Societies of this way.</p>
            <p>For incontinent three ſhamefull Schiſms one upon the neck of another, broke out among them: Firſt, many of them turned <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and were excommunicated. Secondly, Maſter <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> fell to ſo great oddes, firſt with his brother Maſter <hi>George,</hi> for ſmall matters, and afterward with his father, that he excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated them both, and was curſed by both, when he had rejected peremptorily the mediation of the Presbytery of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> for reconciliation. Thirdly, the remnant of the company, a little after, rent in two, upon needleſle Queſtions: Maſter <hi>Ainſworth</hi> the Doctor with his half, did excommunicate <hi>Johnſon</hi> and his half, who were not long behinde, for they alſo did quickly excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate <hi>Ainſworth</hi> and all his followers.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, the War betwixt theſe two handfuls of people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo ſharp, that <hi>Amſterdam</hi> could not keep them both; for <hi>Johnſon,</hi> with his ſide of the houſe, got away to <hi>Emden,</hi> where, after his death, that little company, as I ſuppoſe, diſſolved and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. <hi>Ainſworths</hi>'s company, after his death, remained long without all Officers, very like to have diſſolved: yet at laſt, after much ſtrife, they did chuſe one Maſter <hi>Cann</hi> for their Paſtor, but could not agree, til very lately, upon any other Officer, and even yet they live without an Elderſhip, as they did before without a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor. The moſt of theſe things are the confeſſions of the party, <hi>(D)</hi> the reſt are notorious, and will not be denied.</p>

            <p>Maſter <hi>Smith</hi> (a man as I have heard of right eminent parts) falling to that ſide, and writing againſt the uſe of the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, was convinced in a publike meeting by Maſter <hi>Hilderſham,</hi> and others, (for the Unconformiſts alwayes had the one eye no

            <p>Neither here did the ſpirit of errour permit him long to ſtand: But as in the Preface of his Book of difference from the old <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts,</hi> he profeſſeth a reſolution of inconſtancy: (<hi>F</hi>) So ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did practiſe, falling from <hi>Browniſm</hi> to <hi>Anabaptiſm.</hi> And as ordinary <hi>Browniſm,</hi> when he was a <hi>Browniſt,</hi> did not pleaſe his taſte, without his own refinings; ſo turning <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> the common ſorts of that way did not pleaſe him; (though of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> there be more kindes then of any other Sect this day extant) yet by none of them all, would his conſcience permit him to be Rebaptiſed; but he needs muſt Rebaptiſe himſelf, and ſo draw on the juſt infamy of a <hi>Sebaptiſt (G).</hi>

            </head>
            <p>THe peculiar Tenents of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> wherein they differ from other <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> are many: Thoſe that occur to my minde from ſome ſlight and curſory reading of ſome of their Books, ſhall briefly and plainly be ſet down; but with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, That every thing mentioned, be not taken for an Article of <hi>Browniſm</hi>; for it is needful at ſome times to interlace Tenents which are common to them with others, for the clearing of thoſe which they have peculiar.</p>
            <p>Their differences run moſt upon the Conſtitution and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church: They have alſo divers Singularities about the Circumſtances and Parts of the Service of God; alſo concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Magiſtrate, and Schools, and divers other things. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affectation, or curious ſearch of Method, we ſhall propound matters as they come to hand.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">They hold that all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the world but their own, are ſo polluted, that they muſt be ſeparate from.</note>Concerning the Conſtitution of the Church, conſider their judgement, firſt, what they think of others, then what of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. All other Churches they condemn, ſo far, as to profeſſe and practiſe a Separation from them. The edge of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is uſually directed againſt the Church of <hi>England</hi> alone; but when their Doctrine or Practiſe is looked upon a little more neer, it appears they ſhoot their Bolts at all other Churches in the world which refuſe their Way.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Their injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſlanders of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </note>For the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they ſay it ought not to be called a Church; or at beſt, that it is a falſe and Antichriſtian Church, out of the which every one (though not perſecuted) muſt flee, as they would avoid damnation. <hi>(A)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes, in their calm mood, they will give better words, and acknowledge it to be a true Church, That the Doctrine and Sacraments thereof are true,<note place="margin">Yet ſometimes they ſay that communion may be kept therewith both in preaching and prayer.</note> That many thouſands of its members are gracious and elect people. <hi>(B)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But their ordinary language is of another ſtrain, to wit, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a meer Harlot, divorced from Chriſt, <hi>(C)</hi> That the Worſhip thereof is groſſe Idolatry, and the Service of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50687:23"/>
the devil, <hi>(D)</hi> That all the members thereof are unclean beaſts, and the limbs of Antichriſt, (<hi>E</hi>) That her beſt Preachers that preach moſt for Reformation, are but Phariſees and Deceivers, (<hi>F</hi>) That the Faith, Grace and Comfort which by their Miniſtery they ſeem to bring to the hearts of the hearers, is but meer deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>(G)</hi> That their Sacraments are Seals, not of Grace, but of the wrath of God, (<hi>H</hi>) That all Communion with her, even in the Word and Prayer, is to be forſaken. (<hi>I</hi>)</p>
            <p>The Unconformiſts did always zealouſly plead againſt the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of that Church, but never againſt the truth of her being, or the comfort of her Communion: When by the force of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution they were driven out, then they did flee: Of their own accord they did never ſeparate, but were ever moſt glad to live and die in her boſome, willing to partake of her Worſhip and Sacraments, whenever they were permitted to diſſent in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and to abſtain in practice, from thoſe things which they conceived to be corruptions.

            </head>
            <p>THe Sect (if ſo without offence it may be called) which this day is the ſubject of the moſt diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Independency the ſmalleſt of all the Sects of the time for number, but greateſt for worth of its followers.</note> and the object of the greateſt paſſions; ſome pouring out upon it more of their love and hope, others of their anger and fear, then were convenient, is that of <hi>Independency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all the by-paths wherein the wanderers of our time are pleaſed to walk, this is the moſt conſiderable; not for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but for the quality of the erring perſons therein. There be few of the noted Sects which are not a great deal more numerous; but this Way, what it wants in number, ſupplies by the weight of its followers. After five yeers endeavours and great induſtry within the Lines of the Cities Communication, they are ſaid as yet to conſiſt much within One thouſand perſons; men, women, and all who to this day have put themſelves in any known Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of that way, being reckoned. But ſetting aſide num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for other reſpects they are of ſo eminent a condition, that not any nor all the reſt of the Sects are comparable to them; for they have been ſo wiſe as to engage to their party ſome of chief note, in both Houſes of Parliament, in the Aſſembly of Divines, in the Army, in the City and Countrey-Committees; all whom they daily manage with ſuch dexterity and diligence, for the benefit of their Cauſe, that the eyes of the world begin to fall upon them more then upon all their fellows: It will be requiſite therefore that with the greater care we give an account of them.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50687:40"/>
Practices from the other, but alſo by deduction of their Pedigree in this clear line.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Robinſon</hi> did derive his way to his ſeparate Congregation at <hi>Leyden</hi>; a part of them did carry it over to <hi>Plymouth</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi>; here Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> did take it up, and tranſmit it from thence to Maſter <hi>Goodwin,</hi> who did help to propagate it to ſundry others in <hi>Old-England</hi> firſt, and after, to more in <hi>Holland,</hi> till now by many hands it is ſown thick in divers parts of this Kingdom. But the manner how this ſeed did grow, is not unworthy conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">When the fire of Browniſm was dying out in <hi>Holland,</hi> a little of its aſhes carried to <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> broke out there into a laſting flame.</note>When the Separatiſts for whole Fifty yeers had over-toil'd themſelves for little purpoſe, their horrible Diviſions, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they ſet up, marring their encreaſe; behold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the very point of time when their <hi>Spunk</hi> was dying, and their little ſmoke, both at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and <hi>Leyden,</hi> was well-neer vaniſhed, God in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret providence permitted the tyranny of Biſhops, which firſt had begotten them, to put new life in their aſhes, and bring them back from their grave, to that vigour wherein now they appear.</p>
            <p>After the death of <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> the <hi>Brownists</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> came to a ſmall unconſiderable handful, and ſo yet they remain. No other at that time in the whole world were known of that Religion, but a ſmall company at <hi>Leyden,</hi> under Maſter <hi>Robinſons</hi> Miniſtery; which, partly by Diviſions among themſelves, and partly by their Paſtors deſerting many of their Principles, was well-neer brought to nought: Onely about the Twenty eighth, as I take it, or the Thirtieth yeer of this Age, ſome of them going over, for a more commodious habitation, to <hi>New-England,</hi> did perſwade their neighbours who ſate down with them there at <hi>New-Plymouth,</hi> to erect with them a Congregation after their ſeparate way <hi>(A).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">By what means theſe aſhes were kindled.</note>This Congregation did incontinent leaven all the vicinity. The Planters in <hi>New-England,</hi> ſo far as their own informations give notice, not minding Religion for many yeers after their firſt enterpriſe <hi>(B),</hi> were ready to receive, without great queſtion, any pious form which might be preſented by their neighbours, whoſe minde ſerved them to be active in ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers. Alſo that way of new <hi>Plymouth,</hi> beſide the more then ordinary ſhew of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, did hold out ſo much liberty and honour to the people, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50687:40"/>
made it very ſuitable and lovely to a multitude who had lately ſtepped out of the Epiſcopal thraldom in <hi>England,</hi> to the free air of a new world. However it was, without any noiſe in a few yeers, the moſt who ſettled their habitations in that Land, did agree to model themſelves in Churches after <hi>Robinſons</hi> patern.</p>
            <p>This for a time, was either not known, or not regarded in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The firſt who appeared in any diſpleaſure at it,<note place="margin">Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> at firſt a great oppoſite to that way.</note> was Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>; for this reverend man, howſoever he had faln off from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of ſom, &amp; but of ſom of the Ceremonies, &amp; was diſtaſted with Epiſcopal Government, yet ſo long as he abode in <hi>England,</hi> minded no more then the old non-conformity: In all his oppoſition to the Epiſcopal corruptions, he went not beyond <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and the Presbyterians. With the way of the Separatiſts he was then well acquainted, but declared himſelf againſt it in print, as in his Preface to Maſter <hi>Hilderſhams</hi> Sermons upon <hi>John,</hi> may be ſeen to this day <hi>(C).</hi> Neither thus alone, but a very little before his voyage to <hi>New-England,</hi> ſo ſoon as he underſtood of the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Robinſons</hi> way there, ſuch was his zeal againſt it, he wrote over to the Miniſters who had been the chief inſtruments of bringing theſe Churches under that yoke, admoniſhing them free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their falling from their former judgement, and that their new Reformation was no other but the old way wherein the Separatiſts had walked, to the grief and offence of the Anti-Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal party in <hi>England,</hi> and of the whole Proteſtant Churches <hi>(D).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this admonition,<note place="margin">Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> with little ado, became the great patron of that Errour.</note> the Brethren there went on in their way, yet without any hazard to others, till the 1634. as I take it, or 1635. yeer of our Lord God, when the yoke of Epiſcopal perſecution in <hi>England</hi> became ſo heavy on the necks of the moſt of the godly, that many thouſands of them did flee away, and Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> among the reſt, to joyn themſelves to theſe <hi>American</hi> Churches. Here it was when that new way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt to be dangerous to the reſt of the world.</p>
            <p>For Maſter <hi>Cotton,</hi> a man of very excellent parts, contrary much to his former judgement, having faln into a liking of it, and by his great with and learning, having refined it, without the impediment of any oppoſition, became the great inſtrument of drawing to it, not onely the thouſands of thoſe who left <hi>England,</hi> but alſo by his Letters to his friends who abode in their Countrey,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50687:41"/>
made it become lovely to many who never before had appeared in the leaſt degree of affection toward it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> the miſleader of Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> and others.</note>Before his departure from <hi>England,</hi> by conferences in <hi>London,</hi> he had brought off Maſter <hi>Davenport</hi> and Maſter <hi>Goodwin,</hi> from ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ceremonies (<hi>E</hi>); but neither of theſe two, nor himſelf at that time, did minde the leaſt degree of Separation (<hi>F</hi>); yet ſo ſoon as he did taſte of the <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> air, he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo paſſionate an affection with the Religion he found there, that incontinent he began to perſwade it, with a great deal more zeal and ſucceſſe then before he had oppoſed it <hi>(G)</hi>: His convert Maſter <hi>Goodwin,</hi> a moſt fine and dainty Spirit, with very little ado, was brought by his Letters from <hi>New-England,</hi> to follow him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſtep alſo of his progreſſe, and that with ſo high an eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his new Light, that he was bold to boaſt of it in termes a little beyond the lines of moderation <hi>(H).</hi>

                  <p>Why God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits great men to fall in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Errours.</p>
               </note>It had been happy for <hi>England,</hi> that Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> had taken longer time for deliberation, before that change of his minde: He might have remembred his too precipitant raſhneſſe in former times, both to receive, and to ſend abroad to the world ſuch Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents whereof after he had cauſe to repent.</p>
            <p>God in wiſedom permits his deareſt children to ſet black marks on their own faces, not onely to keep themſelves in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſuſpition of their own hearts, but to divert others from idolizing their gifts, and ſetting up their perſons as a patern for their too ſudden imitation. I would not willingly detract from any mans reputation; I am oft ready enough, both to hear with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and liberally to ſpeak to the praiſes of men much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in my thoughts to Maſter <hi>Cotton:</hi> Yet when his gifts are turned into ſnares, when they become occaſions of ſtumbling, and, contrary to the minde of the giver, are made inducements to follow him in his wanderings; I am of opinion, that neither Piety nor Charity will hinder to remark his evident and known failings: That as his eminent endowments are ſtrong invitations to run after him; ſo the mixture of cleer weakneſſe may be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive to every prudent man, and a caveat from God, to beware of his wayes, as well as of any other mans.</p>
            <p>I take it for a great mercy of God to ſimple ones, that the moſt, if not all, who have offred themſelves to be Ringleaders in any Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or Schiſm, or other by-way, have ever bin permitted to fall into
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50687:41"/>
ſome evident folly; to the end, that they whoſe ſimplicity made them too prone to be miſled by the ſtrength of pregnant wits, and the luſter of excellent gifts, which in the moſt of Sectaries to this day, have ever been apparent, might be held in the love of the truth, and made cautious of being led aſide by them in whoſe footſteps a very blunt eye might perceive the print of an evil ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Not to ſpeak of Maſter <hi>Cottons</hi> long continuance in the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of his education,<note place="margin">His Prelatical <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Montaniſtick</hi> Tenents.</note> ſundry whereof ſtuck to him as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth all the time of his abode in <hi>England (I)</hi>: Nor of his more dangerous fall into the gulf of Pelagianiſm, ſome of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Errours, from which the writings of Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> are ſaid to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed him <hi>(K)</hi>; However, the Doctor doth ſay, that he hath no aſſurance of his recantation to this day, and therefore was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that his Treatiſe againſt Maſter <hi>Cottons</hi> erroneous writings ſhould be publiſhed to the world. To paſſe by alſo that which I have heard of ſome gracious Miniſters of his old <hi>Montaniſm,</hi> wherein ſome think he remaineth to this day.</p>
            <p>That which I point at, is, another more dangerous fall,<note place="margin">His <hi>Antinomy</hi> and <hi>Familiſm.</hi>
               </note> which as already it hath much humbled his ſpirit, and opened his ear to inſtruction, and I truſt it will not leave working till it have brought him yet neerer to his Brethren: So to the worlds end, it cannot but be a matter of fear and trembling, to all who ſhall know it, and of aboundant caution to be very wary of receiving any ſingularity from his hand without due tryal. That which I ſpeak of, is, his wandring into the horrible Errours of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians</hi> and <hi>Familists,</hi> with his dear friend Miſtreſſe <hi>Hutchinſon</hi>; ſo far, that he came to a reſolution to ſide with her, and ſeparate from all the Churches in <hi>New-England,</hi> as legal Synagogues.</p>
            <p>The truth of this horrible fall, if ye will not take it from the parties themſelves, the followers of Miſtreſſe <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> who ofttimes were wont to brag of Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> for their Maſter and Patron <hi>(L)</hi>; nor from the Teſtimony of Maſter <hi>Williams (M),</hi> who had as much occaſion to know it, as any man elſe; and if I miſtake not the humor of the man, is very unwilling to report a lie of his greateſt enemy. Yet we may not reject the witneſſe of Maſter <hi>Winthrop,</hi> the wiſeſt of all the <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> Governours hitherto, and of Maſter <hi>Wells,</hi> a gracious Miniſter of that Land, in their Printed Relations of the Schiſms there, both thoſe, albeit,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50687:42"/>
with all care and ſtudy they endeavour to ſave Maſter <hi>Cottons</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, yet let the truth of Maſter <hi>Cottons</hi> ſeduction fall from their Pens in ſo clear termes as cannot be avoided; for however, what they ſpeak of the erring of the moſt eminent in place, might be applyed to the Governour for the time (<hi>N</hi> 1.): Yet when they tell us, that the moſt of the Seducers lived in the Church of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and that the whole Church of <hi>Boſton,</hi> except a few, were infected with that Leproſie, and that none of them were ever-called to an account by the Presbytery of that Church till after the Aſſembly, though the Paſtor of that Church, Maſter <hi>Wilſon,</hi> was alwayes exceedingly zealous againſt them; alſo that in face of the General Court, Miſtreſſe <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> did avow Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> alone, and Maſter <hi>Wheelwright,</hi> to Preach the truth according to her minde; and that Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> himſelf, before that ſame Court, did openly diſſent, even after the Aſſembly, from all his Brethren about <hi>Wheelwrights</hi> Doctrine. Theſe, and other the like informations, are ſo clear, that no art will get Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> freed (<hi>N</hi> 2.)</p>
            <p>I have been alſo informed by a gracious Preacher, who was preſent at the Synod of <hi>New-England</hi>; that all the Brethren there, being exceedingly ſcandalized with Maſter <hi>Cottons</hi> carriage, in Miſtreſſe <hi>Hutchinſons</hi> proceſſe, did ſo far diſcountenance, and ſo ſeverely admoniſh him, that he was thereby brought to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhame, confuſion, and grief of minde that ever in all his life he had indured. But leaving the perſon of Maſter <hi>Cotton,</hi> if not the Author, yet the greateſt promoter and patron of Independency, we will go on with the way it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Independency large, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as Browniſm.</note>What Maſter <hi>Cotton,</hi> and the Apologiſts, his followers, have teſtified of Gods diſpleaſure and judgements upon the way of the Browniſts (<hi>O</hi>), is as evidently true of the way of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; not onely becauſe, as it will appear hereafter, both wayes really are one and the ſame: But alſo, becauſe in the compariſon of the events which have befaln to both wayes, it will be ſeen that the miſcarriages and (becauſe of them) the marks of Gods anger have been more manifeſt upon this latter way then upon the former.</p>
            <p>Independency brought to the utmoſt pitch of perfection which the wit and induſtry of its beſt patrons were able to attain, having the advantage of the Browniſts fatal miſcarriages, to be

            <p>Their firſt Church in <hi>Holland</hi> was that of <hi>Roterdam,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This Church became no ſooner Independent, then it run into the way of ſuch ſhameful Diviſions as their Mother at <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had gone before them. Their Paſtor Maſter <hi>Peters,</hi> was ſoon weary of them, or they of him; for what cauſes themſelves beſt know; but ſure it is, he quickly left them, and went for <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church was not long deſtitute of Paſtors;<note place="margin">Their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Maſter <hi>Bridge,</hi> Maſter <hi>Simpſon</hi> and Maſter <hi>Ward,</hi> renounced their Engliſh Ordination, and as meer private men took new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from the people.</note> for about that time Maſter <hi>Ward</hi> and Maſter <hi>Bridge</hi> came over to them from <hi>Norwich,</hi> where they ever had lived fully conform, without any contradiction either to Epiſcopacy or Ceremonies, onely they withſtood Biſhop <hi>Wrens</hi> laſt Innovations (<hi>B</hi>).</p>
            <p>So ſoon as they came to <hi>Roterdam,</hi> without any long time of adveiſement, they conformed themſelves to the Diſcipline which Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> had planted <hi>(C)</hi>; They renounced their Engliſh Ordination and Miniſterial Office, joyning themſelves as meer private men to that Congregation, which afterward did chooſe and ordain both of them to be their Miniſters (<hi>D</hi>).</p>
            <p>It was not long before Maſter <hi>Simpſon</hi> alſo came hither from <hi>London,</hi> and renouncing alſo his Ordination (<hi>E</hi>), joyned himſelf as a private member with them.</p>

               <note place="margin">Incontinent they did fall into ſhameful diviſions and ſubdiviſions.</note>Then did the Spirit of Diviſion begin to work among them, and ſo far to prevail, that Maſter <hi>Simpſon</hi> malecontent with Maſter <hi>Bridge,</hi> for hindering the private members of the flock to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie after the Browniſts way, did ſeparate himſelf and erect a new Congregation of his own (<hi>F</hi>): Betwixt theſe two Churches, the contentions and ſlanders became no leſſe grievous then thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> betwixt <hi>Ainſworth</hi> and <hi>Johnſons</hi> followers; and in this much worſe, that they of <hi>Roterdam</hi> abode not at one Schiſm; but after Maſter <hi>Simpſons</hi> ſeparation, broke out again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another ſubdiviſion.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Bridges</hi> Congregation was ſo filled with ſtrife, ſo ſhameful ſlanders were laid upon his own back, that diſpleaſure did haſten the death of his wife <hi>(G),</hi> and did well neer kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, making him oft profeſſe his repentance that ever he entred into that ſociety (<hi>H</hi>).</p>

            </p>
            <p>That Aſſembly, I ſay of <hi>Roterdam,</hi> did not ſo much as touch the main queſtion; they drew a thin skin over the wound, but durſt not aſſay to lance it to the bottom. For did they ever rebuke,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50687:51"/>
or ſo much as once ſpeak to the people of that Congregation, for uſurping a Tyrannicall Authority to depoſe their Paſtor. Did they tell Maſter <hi>Ward</hi> of his ſiding with Maſter <hi>Simpſon,</hi> againſt Maſter <hi>Bridge,</hi> in the matter of Propheſie? did they ever attempt to cognoſce on the great ſcandal, the ground of all the reſt, Maſter <hi>Simpſons</hi> Separation? did they make any hearty and ſolid recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation betwixt Maſter <hi>Ward</hi> and the Church? It ſeems the Aſſembly was wiſer then to meddle with evils, which they found much above their ſtrength to remedy. Maſter <hi>Ward</hi> found himſelf after his reſtitution in ſo pittiful a condition with his new friends, that he left their Company (<hi>M</hi>).</p>
            <p>The two Churches were irreconcileable,<note place="margin">The Schiſms at <hi>Roterdam</hi> were more ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable then thoſe at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
               </note> till both Maſter <hi>Bridge,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> had removed their Stations to <hi>England</hi>; and even then the concord could not be obtained, till the Dutch Magiſtrate had interpoſed his authority (<hi>N</hi>): Neither by this means could Maſter <hi>Simpſons</hi> Church be perſwaded to return to Maſter <hi>Bridges,</hi> till for their meer pleaſure they got that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to remove one of their prime members, without the alleadging of any cauſe but their own peremptory will and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction (<hi>O</hi>). When by ſo much a do theſe two divided Churches are brought together, it may be much doubted, if their Union ſhall long continue.

               <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> For among theſe of <hi>Roterdam,</hi> not onely the grounds of the old diviſion do evidently remain, but alſo the Seeds of a new breach do appear above the ground.</p>
            <p>The liberty of Prophecying, which Maſter <hi>Simpſons</hi> (now Maſter <hi>Simons</hi>) Congregation did require, is not obtained in the way they deſired it; for they are not permitted to Prophecy in the Congregation, nor upon the Sabbath day, nor in the place of publike meeting: Onely in a private place, on a week day, where ſome of the Church who pleaſe do meet; they have liberty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their gifts. On the other part, what Maſter <hi>Bridges</hi> (now Mr. <hi>Parks</hi>) Church did require, I mean a Presbytery for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Congregation, cannot be obtained. For however, they profeſſe the lawfulneſſe and conveniency of Ruling Elders, and of a Conſiſtory for Diſcipline; yet it hath ſo faln out that for many yeers they have had none, neither are like in haſte to have, unleſſe the grumbling of Maſter <hi>Parks</hi> and his friends
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50687:52"/>
threatning a new breach, do force them at laſt to the uſe of that Ordinance.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anabaptiſm is like to ſpoil that Church.</note>But that which threatneth not a Schiſme alone, but a total diſſolution of that Congregation, is the Peſt of Anabaptiſm, which begins of late much to infect them (<hi>P</hi>). It is true, the Paſtors do their beſt to reclaim all their members from that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; and when they finde themſelves not able to prevail, give good words and aſſurances of a full and Brotherly Toleration; for as they ſcruple not to give the hand of Fellowſhip to the Browniſts of <hi>Amſterdam (Q)</hi>; ſo will they not caſt out any from their Church for denying of Pedobaptiſm, if the diſſenting and erring party be pleaſed to remain peaceably amongſt them: But here is the pitty, when the Independents have declared their greateſt readineſſe to tolerate and entertain in their Churches, both the rigid Separatiſts, and the Anabaptiſts (<hi>R</hi>); yet the moſt of thoſe are unwilling to ſtay, but are peremptory to ſeparate from the Independent Churches as more corrupt then that they with a good conſcience can abide in them, though never ſo much tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and cheriſhed.</p>
            <p>As for their Church at <hi>Arnhem,</hi> howſoever their ſmall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with others, during their abode in that remote corner, and their taciturnity of their own affairs, makes their proceedings to lie under a Cover; yet ſo much of their wayes is come to light upon divers occaſions, as will not be very inductive and alluring of indifferent ſpirits, to tred in their footſteps.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">They of the Church of <hi>Arnhem</hi> admire and praiſe themſelves above all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note>Firſt, We finde them greater admirers of themſelves and proclaimers of their own excellency then is the cuſtome of modeſt and wiſe, though the beſt and greateſt men.

For that Synod did conſiſt of no other but the two
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50687:52"/>
Doctors of that Church, and the two Elders thereof, together with Maſter <hi>Bridge,</hi> and the Members of his Church. Theſe laſt were preſent in that Synod as perſons challenged, and guilty of a grievous ſcandal; ſo to them in that action, but a ſmall praiſe can be due: Wherefore, the ſupereminent Excellency of that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, muſt fall upon the Commiſſioners of <hi>Arnhem,</hi> the onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which in that meeting were void of offence, and free from challenges. To themſelves therefore it is alone, or at leaſt above all others, that they aſcribe the ſuperlative praiſes of that Synod.</p>
            <p>In that ſame place they ſtick not to take to themſelves the honour of ſo great ſincerity as any fleſh in the world not onely hath at this preſent, but poſſibly can attain in any following Age (<hi>V</hi>). We wonder the leſſe to hear them canonize their Colleague Maſter <hi>Archer</hi> after his death, among the moſt precious perſons who ever trod upon the earth (<hi>X</hi>).</p>
            <p>This ſelf-overvaluing ſeems to be the ground why they cry out of their very moderate afflictions as of great calamities;<note place="margin">The eaſineſſe of their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and afflictions.</note> they ingeminate to the Parliament, over and over, their perſecution, their poverty, their miſerable exile (<hi>Y</hi>); when they who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the caſe, give aſſurance, that not one of Ten of the moſt proſperous Miniſters of the whole world, in the time of their greateſt Sunſhine, do live in more wealth, eaſe, honour, and all worldly accommodations, then theſe poor miſerable exiles did enjoy all the time of that which they call their baniſhment (<hi>Z</hi>).</p>

This Hell which is at preſent, to be ſure is in ſome of the places of the Air, or the Waters, and not in the Earth: But the Hell which ſhall be the everlaſting torment of all the damned, ſhall be all this lower and viſible World. All the places of the Earth, Water, Air, Sun, Moon, Stars, and the Fire, called the Heavens, and the Earth. The things which God immediately made out of nothing, ſhall never change: As the higheſt Heavens, and the Angels in them, and the ſouls of men, and this Chaos called the Earth; but all other things being made out of ſomething, even out of this Earth or Chaos, they ſhall after a time change; and ſo all this World ſhall come to an Earth or Chaos again.

               <note place="margin">The work of the prime In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents of <hi>New England, Arnheim,</hi> and <hi>Roterdam,</hi> theſe five yeers at <hi>London.</hi>
               </note>YOu have gotten a taſte of the Fruits of this Tree, as it grows in <hi>New-England</hi> and <hi>Holland:</hi> When it is tranſplanted to <hi>Old-England,</hi> conſider if the Grapes of it be any thing ſweeter. Theſe Five laſt yeers, the chief of that party, both from <hi>Arnhem, Roterdam</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> have kept their reſidence at <hi>London,</hi> to advance, by common counſels and induſtry, their Way, in theſe days of their hopes. A full account of their courſes in that place cannot be expected, ſo long as many paſſages concerning them lie in the dark, and the end is not yet come. But three things ſeem to be clear, which make their Way at <hi>London</hi> no more lovely then in the places mentioned. Firſt, they have been here exceeding unhappie in retarding, and to their power croſſing the bleſſed Reformation in hand. Secondly, they have pregnantly occaſioned the multiplication of Hereſies and Schiſms, above all that ever was heard of in any one place in any former Age. Thirdly, they have occaſioned ſuch Diviſions in the State, that, had it not been for the extraordinary mercies of God, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and all that follow them, had long ago been laid under the feet of their enraged enemies, and the whole Iſle, long before this, totally ruined.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">They did hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with all their power, ſo long as they were able, the calling of the Aſſembly.</note>As for the firſt, The Reformation of Religion, ſo much wiſhed for by all the godly for ſo many yeers, all know it could never have been attained without the help of an Aſſembly of Divines: Who oppoſeth the neceſſary Mean, cannot be taken for a friend of the End. The Aſſembly, the neceſſary means of Reformation, was for a very long time hindred, by the diligence of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent party, to be called <hi>(A):</hi> and when, to their evident grief and diſcontent, the Parliament had voted its calling, they may remember their extraordinary induſtry to get<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it modelled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Principles, both in its members and power <hi>(B)</hi>; to have it an elective Synod onely for advice, to conſiſt of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of themſelves and of their favourers as was poſſible, not any known Divine of any parts in all <hi>England</hi> of their opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

omitted. How cautious they were by great ſlight of hand to keep off ſo many of the old Puritan Unconformiſts, and how much more enclinable towards men of Epiſcopal and Liturgick principles, themſelves do know.</p>
            <p>This their underhand-working before the ſitting of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, was ſeen but by few: but ſo ſoon as the Synod did ſit,<note place="margin">When it was called, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> it did then appear to the whole Company who were the men who made it their work and greateſt ſtudie to keep off, by their endleſſe Janglings, the Aſſembly from concluding any thing that might ſettle the diſtracted Church <hi>(C)</hi>; ſo that to this day, after two yeers time and above, in more frequent and learned Seſſions then every we read of in any Aſſembly ſince the world began <hi>(D),</hi> There is nothing at all ſet up for the comfort of the afflicted Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Their averſeneſſe to the Aſſembly doth appear, not onely in their oppoſition to its calling, in their retarding of its proceedings, but in their preſſing of its diſſolution. I do not ſpeak of the huge Contumelies which ſome of their party have poured out upon the face of that moſt Reverend Meeting, in a number of very wicked Pamphlets, which to this day were never ſo much as cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, though the Authors, by name and ſirname, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of in Print. But that which I ſpeak of, is the expreſſe Article of the Independent Petition, deſiring the Parliament in formal terms, according to Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> dictates, to diſſolve the Aſſembly (<hi>D</hi> 2.).</p>
            <p>Had either the Popiſh faction, or the Epiſcopal party,<note place="margin">That the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> lie ſo long in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, nor Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, nor Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants have been the cauſe.</note> or the malignant Courtiers procured the continuance of our woful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, our anger would have been greater then our grief or ſhame. But when the mercies of God now for ſome yeers have removed the Papiſts, Prelats and Courtiers ſo far from us, that by word or deed they have not hindred us in the leaſt meaſure to heal the diſeaſes of our Church at our pleaſure; that her wounds to this day ſhould be multiplied, and all kept open to drop out her beſt blood, alone through the obſtinacy of our Brethren, though we compreſſe our indignation, yet we cannot but be oppreſſed with a great meaſure of grief, nor can we chuſe but to be covered with confuſion and ſhame, when we are forced to taſte the moſt bitter fruits of our Brethrens principles, though denied by them in words, yet ingenuouſly avowed by their friends in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:50687:59"/>
and conſtantly practiſed in <hi>New-England</hi>; to the uttermoſt of their power (<hi>E</hi> 1.), they muſt oppoſe the building of a Church any where in the world, if it be not after their patern:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">But the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their principles.</note>That as in <hi>New-England</hi> no Presbyterial Church on any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be tolerated, ſo in <hi>Old-England</hi> no Presbyterial Church muſt ever be erected, if all their skill and induſtry can hinder it. Such a Reformation, though expreſly according to the National Covenant, to them is a deformation which they cannot wiſh, much leſſe pray for or endeavour, but with all their ſtrength muſt croſſe it, as a corruption unſufferable, where they have power.</p>
            <p>Its plain and demonſtrable, that their Principles and Way have forced them to oppoſe the Reformation in hand, and will ever force them ſo to do, till they lay new grounds, and be changed in the ſence of their erroneous minde. However, the actions of our Brethren did proclame loud enough their intentions to delay ſo long as they were able, the ſetting up of any Government; yet when this evil is become ſo groſſe and palpable, that all in words do diſclaim it, and they who moſt do procure it, do moſt in ſhew abominate it, it ſeems a little ſtrange that ſome of their Divines are now begun in Print expreſly to own it, and in Print to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the delay of this work (<hi>E</hi> 2.).</p>

            <p>Unto this great miſery, another great unhappineſſe addeth much weight.

            <p>It is well known that the Sects, at the time of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents return hither, were inconſiderable, in regard of that which now they are by their means. It was their work to bring people
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50687:59"/>
into diſtaſte with the way of all the Reformed Churches: this by their labours was made vile in the eyes of the multitude; and people once having leaped over that wall within the which all the Proteſtant Churches have dwelt in ſafety, by all the skill of their firſt miſleaders could not be holden from running farther away; as in <hi>New-England</hi> Independency was a mother to Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm, Antinomianiſm, Familiſm, and many more Hereſies, We need not wonder to ſee it any where bring forth the like Brood: But hereof indeed do we wonder, that in ſo ſhort a time this Way ſhould change as it were its nature ſo farre to the worſe.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> Independency,<note place="margin">Independency at <hi>London</hi> doth not onely bring forth, but nouriſh and patronize Hereſies and Schiſms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its cuſtom either in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
               </note> ſo ſoon as it had found and diſcerned the young brats of Anabaptiſts, Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians or Familiſts in her boſom, it was her cuſtom incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fling them away as Baſtards: But Independency at <hi>London</hi> hath learned not onely to beget, but to cheriſh ſuch children when they are brought forth. Not onely the Churches of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but the very <hi>Amſterdam</hi>-Browniſts have ever been zealous to caſt out of their Society the Heretikes and Schiſmatickes we ſpeak of: but here in <hi>London</hi> it is far otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>We have heard that many of the Independents here, ſo ſoon as they have fallen into Anabaptiſm or other Errours of the time, have quickly of their own accord run away and ſeparated from the Independent Congregations, as polluted, as falſe, as no Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: But that ever any of the <hi>London</hi>-Independents did caſt out of their Churches any man or woman for Anabaptiſm, Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm or any other Errour, we never heard.</p>
            <p>By the contrary, Independency here is become an uniting Principle; it hath kept our Brethren in the midſt of all their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jarrs with the Reformed Churches abroad, and the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians at home, in a great entireneſſe and familiarity with all the Sectaries that pleaſed to draw neer them. They have by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and diſſents laboured to hinder the Aſſembly from giving the leaſt advice to the Parliament to take any order with the moſt abſurd of the Sectaries, when complained upon for their greateſt Enormities; yea, they have preached and printed divers Tractates for a full liberty to all Sects <hi>(G).</hi> That ſo ſoon they ſhould have run thus far out, we could never have believed, if our own eyes and ears had not been our perſwaders.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. An Enumeration of the common Tenets of the <hi>Independents.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is not eaſie to ſet down with aſſurance the <hi>Independents</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,<note place="margin">Why it is hard to ſet downe the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> poſitions.</note> both becauſe they have to this day declined to declare poſitively their minds; as alſo becauſe of their principle of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability whereby they profeſſe their readineſſe to change any of their preſent Tenets.</p>
            <p>How unwilling they are to declare their mind,<note place="margin">They have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, more then has ever been the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of any Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</note> may appeare by their obſtinate ſilence, and refuſing to anſwer any of theſe Books that put them moſt to it; alſo, by hiding of their opinions from their brethren, who moſt earneſtly have preſt their Declaration.</p>
            <p>Theſe divers yeares the Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> have been dealing with them for ſatisfaction herein, and once by importunity obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a promiſe under their hand of a full and free Declaration, but theſe foure yeares they have eluded that promiſe (<hi>a</hi>).</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Apollonius</hi> in name of all the Churches of <hi>Zealand</hi> with all earneſtneſſe did intreat this duty of them (<hi>b</hi>), but all in vaine. When upon any occaſion they have been moved to make any kind of Narration of their way, it was ever with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <hi>proviſo</hi> of their reſolution to keep up as yet from the World their poſitive Tenets; ſo they conclude their <hi>Apologetick (c),</hi> ſo they begin their <hi>Keyes (d).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now when the indignation both of the Aſſembly and Parliament, and of many more, was likely to break out upon them for this, that after ſo long time no plaine dealing hath been ſeen in them,<note place="margin">When they ſhal bee pleaſed to declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the full, their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of change will hinder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to aſſure us that any thing is their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, and firm Tenet wherein they will bee conſtant.</note> at laſt they have engaged themſelves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their minds; and yet ſince that their publike engagement there are ſix Months paſt, and the Worlds expectation of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at laſt their mind, is ſtill ſuſpended.</p>
            <p>And though that their Declaration ſhould come out to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, yet with what aſſurance can we take any thing therein for their conſtant and ſettled Tenet, ſo long as they profeſſe it to be one of their cheife principles to be ſo looſe and irreſolute in any thing they maintaine for the time, that they are ready to leave it, and upon occaſion to embrace the contrary (<hi>e</hi>)? So long as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50687:62"/>
this skeptick irreſolution is avowed, there is no hope, there is no poſſibility of any fixed conſtancy.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The chief Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto they have given out, and not yet recal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It hath been hitherto their earneſt deſire to decline the infamy of <hi>Browniſme,</hi>
               <note place="margin">They reject the name of <hi>Independents</hi> unreaſonably, and for their own diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</note> and it was the charity of their Brethren to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from that Sect, under the new name of <hi>Independents</hi>: importing their chiefe difference from us to ſtand not in the point of ſeparation, which is our proper quarrell with the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> but alone in the point of Church-Government, which againſt all the Reformed Churches they ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ntaine to be Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, that is, not ſubject to the Authority and Juriſdiction of any Superiour Synod. This was thought to be their proper di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive and characteriſticall Tenet, till of late we finde them paſſionately reject the name of <hi>Independents,</hi> and tell us, that the dependency or independency of their Congregations will bee found one of their leaſt differences and ſmalleſt controverſies.</p>
            <p>In this our long miſtake, we are content to be rectified; albeit our charity ſhould not be reproved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who being ignorant of their willingneſſe to differ from us in any thing higher or deeper then the Dependency of Congregations upon the Authority of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Aſſemblies, did put upon them no other name then that which implyed this difference alone.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes that this Title is not only the moſt reaſonable, but the moſt innocent and inoffenſive note of diſtinction, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could have choſen: The terme not being invented by any of their ill-willers, but by their own cheife Leaders (<hi>f</hi>), who did think that word moſt proper to notifie their Tenet of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;<note place="margin">When it is laid aſide, the more infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous name of <hi>Browniſts</hi> and Separatiſts wil juſtly fall upon them.</note> and ſince ſome name muſt be given to every eminently differing party, it ſeemes none leſſe irritative could bee fallen upon, then that which moſt properly did ſignifie the chiefe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Controverſie.</p>
            <p>But now finding they avow their chiefe differences to lie elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, for my part I could yeeld to them to have the name of <hi>Independents</hi> buried, did I not feare it behoved to be changed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50687:62"/>
with another Title, which would much more diſpleaſe: For ſince they are gone beyond the queſtion of Independent Government, and now doe queſtion the conſtitution of our Churches ſo farre as puts them on a neceſſity of Separation, and in this doe place the chiefe of their Controverſies with us: If a Sect may be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated either from the Author or principall matter, as they make no bones to Print us <hi>Calvinians (g)</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians (h)</hi>: I cannot conceive why they ought not to take it in good part, if when the name of <hi>Independents</hi> is laid by, they have in place of it, the Title of <hi>Browniſts</hi> and Separatiſts faſtned upon them.</p>
            <p>Of their owne accord they take upon them openly the halfe of the thing we alledge profeſſing themſelves to lie halfeway off us,<note place="margin">They avow a Semi-Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui-Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will bee proved upon them.</note> towards <hi>Browniſme (i)</hi> avowing the truth to conſiſt in this their middle way: But whoſoever conſiders better of the matter, will find, that however in ſome things they incline to a middle way; yet in the chiefe and moſt, they come up cloſe to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt line of <hi>Browniſme,</hi> and in many things doe expatiate ſo much beyond it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in place of the Semi-Separation they mention, they may be juſtly argued to have drawn upon themſelves the blot of Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, the worſt and uttermoſt Tenet of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> for which they cook to themſelves,<note place="margin">The <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> doe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from all the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches upon farre worſe grounds then the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> were wont to ſeparate.</note> and had beſtowed upon them by others the ſtile of Separatiſts, was their doctrine and practiſe accordingly, to Separate from the Churches of <hi>England</hi>: In this the <hi>Independents</hi> goe beyond them. For beſide that the practice of both is the ſame, both actually Separating from all the Congregations of <hi>England</hi>; the grounds of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> Separation were a great deale more reaſonable, then that of the <hi>Independents,</hi> albeit neither of them be good and ſufficient: For the <hi>Browniſts</hi> did build their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Tyranny of Biſhops, on the Superſtition of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Service-Book; on the groſſe, avowed, and neglected profaneneſſe of the moſt in every Congregation: if theſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had been removed, ſo farre as I have read in any of their writings, they would no more have Separated. But the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> having no ſuch ſtumbling blocks in their way, Biſhops

and Books being aboliſhed, and a barre ſet up in every Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to keep off from the Sacrament, every ſcandalous and ignorant perſon, notwithſtanding they will yet Separate. The more unjuſt and leſſe cauſe they have ſo to doe, their ſeparation muſt bee ſo much the worſe, the groſſer and more inexcuſable Schiſme.</p>

            <p>But we would intreat them to declare if they would be willing to receive any Sacrament in the Engliſh Congregations, or if they will be content to bee under any part of their Diſcipline, if they will be either Members or Officers in any of our Churches.</p>
            <p>I ſee indeed the Apologiſts profeſſe their participation of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in our Congregations, but beſides that, the <hi>Browniſts</hi> will profeſſe ſo much of themſelves (<hi>o</hi>); yet how this is conſiſtent with the conſtant practice and Doctrine of the <hi>Independents,</hi> I confeſſe my underſtanding is too blunt to conceive.</p>

            <p>Secondly, they eſteem not baptized Infants to be members of their Church before they have entred into their Covenant; till then they hold them from the Lords Table and all the acts of Diſcipline, as people without the Church and not members of it (<hi>lllll</hi>): If it be ſo, their Baptiſm was of ſo ſmall uſe that well they might have wanted it to the time of their admiſſion to be members.</p>

               <note place="margin">The <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> prime principles.</note>HAving ſet down the Proceedings and Tenets of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> ſo farre as my ſlender reading of ſome of their writings and obſervation of their wayes have brought to my memory at this time: Before I leave them, it will not bee unfit to examine the truth of their chiefe principles whereby they have diſturb'd the Church, and will continue ſo to doe untill they
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50687:89"/>
have changed their minde. For ſhortneſſe, I will pitch but upon foure grounds which the <hi>Independents</hi> have learned in the <hi>Browniſts</hi> ſchoole: The firſt, concerning the members of a Congregation; The next three concerning their power. We will firſt conſider whither the members of every particular Church bee obliged at their firſt admiſſion to ſhew to the whole Congregation convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſigns of their Regeneration and true grace. Secondly, whether the people of a Congregation have a power of voycing in every Eccleſiaſtick affaire. Thirdly, whether the power of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation be abſolute and <hi>Independent?</hi> Fourthly, whither every man who hath a gift though not an office, hath power to preach and propheſie publickly.</p>
            <p>The firſt queſtion is of the greareſt importance:<note place="margin">Their Tenet about the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of members, is the great cauſe of their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from all the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches though they doe deſſemble it.</note> The <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> would gladly diſſemble their minde therein; to this day they have declined all ſolemn debate upon it, they ſpeak as if they were either fully or very neere accorded with us, profeſſing their utter diſlike of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> unreaſonableneſſe herein; but I profeſſe this hath alwayes ſeemed to me their capitall and fundamentall difference, the only cauſe of their ſeparation from us, and wherein if wee could either agree or accommodate, there would be a faire poſſibility of accord in all things elſe, at leaſt ſo farre as to be united in one and the ſame Church; but this difference is the great partition wall, which ſo long as it ſtands, will force them to continue their intolerable practice of ſeparating from all the Reformed Churches in the world, and that for fewer and more unjuſt cauſes then any who ever did carry the name of a Separatiſt, to this day did pretend. This ſeemes to bee the reaſon why both <hi>Apollonius</hi> and <hi>Spanheim</hi> very excellent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, have begun their diſpute with this queſtion.</p>
            <p>For the ſtating of the controverſie, conſider how it ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and the <hi>Independents</hi> at this time; the <hi>Browniſts</hi> for their ſeparation were wont to alledge the impurity of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the corruption of our Government, the open prophaneſſe of the moſt in our Congregations. By the mercy of God, the firſt is fully Reformed, at leaſt ſo farre according to the minde of our brethren, that they have entred no diſſenting vote to any one paſſage of the Directory for worſhip: The Government alſo is ſo farre cleared in the Aſſemblie, that they have entered their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50687:90"/>
diſſent from no part of it, except that alone which concerns the Iuriſdiction of <hi>Presbyteries</hi> and Synods; and their diſſent herein, might and ſtill may well be ſo carried as not to occaſion any breach.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">In this they goe beyond the <hi>Browniſts.</hi>
               </note>But the third is the great cauſe of diviſion, wherein they much out-runne the <hi>Browniſts</hi>; for they did never offer to ſeparate upon this ground alone; and the matter whereupon here they ſtumbled, was only open profaneneſſe and that incorrigible, either through want of power or want of care to remedy it. If the profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was not open and viſible, or if the Church had her full power to execute diſcipline, and according to her power made conſcience really to cenſure ſcandalls: Theſe things as I conceive, would have abundantly ſatisfied the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> and cured their ſeparation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The true ſtate of the queſtion is whether it be neceſſary to ſeparate from a Church, wherein wee get no ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the true grace of every Member at their firſt admiſſion.</note>But the <hi>Independents</hi> now doe draw them up much higher then they were wont to ſtand; They teach them to ſtumble not only at open profaneneſſe, but at the want of true grace; yea, at the want of convincing ſignes of Regeneration: They teach them to require not only a power and care in the Church to cenſure ſuch profaneneſſe, but alſo a power in every member of the Church to keep out all others with whom they are not ſatisfied in the truth of their grace; So the queſtion is not as uſually it is made, of the quality of the members of the Church, but of the neceſſity to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from that Church wherein we are not ſatisfied by convincing ſigns of the true faith and grace of every member at their firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Wee grant it is earneſtly to be wiſhed, and all lawfull meanes would diligently bee uſed both by Paſtors and people, to have all the members of a Church moſt holy and gratious, and what ever lawfull overture our Brethren can invent for this end, we with all our heart will embrace it, or elſe be content to beare much blame; We grant alſo, that it is the duty of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours to keep off every ſcandalous perſon from profaning to their own damnation the holy things of the Lord; and that it is the duty of theſe Governours not only to ſuſpend from the holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all ſcandalous perſons but farther to caſt all ſuch out of the Church without reſpect of perſons in the caſe of obſtinacy, when by no meanes they can bee brought to ſatisfactory repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; we grant alſo, that Church-Governours deficient in theſe duties, ought themſelves to be diſciplined by the rod of Church-Cenſures; theſe things were never controverted. But the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50687:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is, whether becauſe of the admiſſion of ſome to Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip who have not given ſatisfaction to every member of the Church in the point of their reall Regeneration, a Church may lawfully be ſeparated from, as vitiouſly conſtitute, for that eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all defect in its very matter?</p>
            <p>Our Brethrens conſtant and reſolute practice albeit gilded over with many faire words, maketh this to be the cleare ſtate of the queſtion, againſt which I reaſon thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">For the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, we reaſon firſt from the practice of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> &amp; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who did never offer to ſeparate for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch reaſon.</note> What to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets was not a ſufficient cauſe of ſeparation from the Churches of their time, is not a ſufficent cauſe for us to ſeparate from the Churches in our times. But, want of ſatisfaction by convincing ſignes of the true grace of many members of the Church, was not a ſufficient cauſe for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Prophets to ſeparate in their times. <hi>Ergo</hi>: The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is cleare and uncontroverted; for <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were ſo farre from ſeparating from the Churches of their dayes for want of aſſurance of the true grace of every perſon in theſe Churches that they remained ſtill to their dying day in the boſome of theſe Churches, comumnicating with them in the Word, Prayer, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and Sacrifices, though they were aſſured of the evident wickedneſſe of the moſt of their fellow-members. <hi>Moſes</hi> knew the Body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to bee a crooked and perverſe generation: <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells the <hi>Iewes</hi> that they were another <hi>Sodom; Ieremy</hi> ſheweth that <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his dayes was uncircumciſed in heart, no better then <hi>Moab, Ammon,</hi> or <hi>Edom; Micah,</hi> that the godly in his time were very rare as the ſummer fruits, as the grapes after the Vintage; of this truth all the Prophets are full; yet for all this, none of the Prophets did ever think of a ſeparation.</p>
            <p>All the difficulty then is in the major, which thus we prove:<note place="margin">The cauſes of a juſt ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler under the Law, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</note> The Church in the dayes of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, was one and the ſame with the Church of our dayes: The Houſe of God, the body of Chriſt, the Elect and redeemed people, the holy Nation, the peculiar treaſure and ſpouſe of the Lamb: The difference of the true Church in any age is at moſt but in accidentall circumſtances, and not in any eſſentials: ſo what ever morall evill doth defile the Church now, and is a juſt cauſe of ejection or ſeparation, that muſt be ſo at all times, eſpecially, under the old Teſtament, where all the Ceremoniall differences that are alledged betwixt the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50687:91"/>
Church then and now, make for the ſtrengthning of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for then the cauſes of ſeparation were ſtricter and ſmaller; a little Ceremoniall pollution would then have kept out of the ſanctuary; much more a morall uncleanneſſe would have made the ſacrifice abominable. If therefore at that time the matter in hand was no cauſe of ſeparating from the Church, much leſſe can it be ſo now, when God hath given a greater liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Church in her majority, and when Chriſtians are not ſo eaſily infected by their neighbours ſinnes as of old in the dayes of the Churches infancy they were; Idolatry, falſe doctrine, open profaneneſſe, were then moſt abominable, and more terribly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed then now, by the totall deſtruction of whole Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries wherein they were entertained; alſo the duty of mutuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and admonition, the contempt whereof is made the grand cauſe of ſeparation, was moſt clearly enjoyned in the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The weakneſſe of their Reply.</note>What here is replyed, that all ſeparation from the Iewiſh Church was ſimply impoſſible, becauſe then there was no other Church in the whole earth to goe to: We anſwer, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyers themſelves will ſay that a ſeparation muſt be where there is juſt cauſe, and where a perſon cannot abide without pollution and ſin, although there be no other Church for him to go to; for they make it better for men to live alone ſeparate from all, then to abide in any Church where they cannot live without the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of their neighbours ſinnes. We anſwer further, That it was eaſie for the godly under the Law to have joyned together in the ſervice of God, and to have excluded the wicked thence; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid that this could not bee done, becauſe the Cenſure of Excommunication was not then in being; We anſwer, the Goſpel makes it cleare; That caſting out of the Synagogue which was reall Excommunication,<note place="margin">Our ſecond reaſon, is from the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who did not ſeparate for any ſuch cauſes.</note> was frequent in the Old Teſtament; as alſo the keeping off from the ſervice with a great deale of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection all who were unfit by any legall pollution, much more by any known morall uncleanneſſe; Kings themſelves when pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were removed from the Altar and put out of the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>Again, I reaſon thus; That which moved not Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to ſeparate from the Church of their time, is no cauſe to us of ſeparation; but, want of ſatisfaction by convincing ſignes of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50687:91"/>
true grace of every member of the Church, was to them no cauſe of ſeparation from the Churches of their times, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The major is cleare, except we deſire a better pattern for our practices then Chriſt and his Apoſtles; what ever carrieth us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their line, muſt be high preſumption and deep hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>The minor is cleare, by many Scriptures; the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees were a generation of vipers; <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> worſe then <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah; Coraſin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> was worſe then <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> and to be caſt lower in Hell then theſe: yet the Lord did not give over to preach, to pray, to go to the Temple with them. <hi>Iudas</hi> when a declared Traytor, did not ſcarre him, nor any of his company from the Sacrament. After he went from the Table, when his wickedneſſe was revealed that a Devill was in him; yet none of the Apoſtles offered to caſt themſelves out of the body becauſe this wicked member was not cut off. Many members of the Apoſtolick Churches were ſo farre from convincing ſignes of true grace, that the works of the fleſh were moſt evident in their life. In the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> fundamentall errours, open Idolaty, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſcandall, bitter contentions, profanation of the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. In the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ſuch errours as deſtroyed grace, and made Chriſt of none effect. In the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and the other golden Candleſticks, divers members were ſo evidently faulty, that the Candleſtick is threatned to be removed; yet from none of theſe Churches did any of the Apoſtles ever ſeparate, nor gave they the leaſt warrant to any of their Diſciples to make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from any of them.</p>
            <p>A third Argument. The want of that which never was to bee found in any Church, is no juſt cauſe of ſeparation:<note place="margin">The third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find true grace in every member of any viſible Church that ever was or ſhall be in the world.</note> But ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by convincing Arguments of the true grace of every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, was never to be found in any Church.</p>
            <p>The major is unqueſtionable for what is not, cannot have any operation; <hi>non entis nulla ſunt accidentia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The minor is demonſtrable; from the nature of a viſible Church, it is ſuch a body whoſe members are never all gracious, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Scripture; It is not like the Church inviſible, the Church of the Elect. It is an heterogeneous body, the parts of it are very diſſimilar, ſome chaffe, ſome corne, ſome wheat, ſome tares; a net of fiſhes good and bad; a houſe wherein are veſſels of honour

            <p>The beſt form I can ſet on his firſt argument, is this;<note place="margin">His firſt reaſon put in form.</note> If every member of each Church is not only in profeſſion, but in ſincerity and truth to be a Saint and faithfull; then, the Officers and body of each Church muſt take triall, and be ſatisfied of the true faith and ſanctification of every perſon before they receive him into the Church; but, every member of each Church is not only in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but in ſincerity and truth to be a Saint and faithfull; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Officers and body of each Church muſt take triall, and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the true faith and ſanctification of every perſon before they receive him into the Church. All the proofe is beſtowed upon the minor from theſe Scriptures which make all the members of the Church to bee Saints by calling, and faithfull Brethren: the Church it ſelfe to be the body of Chriſt, the Temple of the holy Ghoſt, the ſpouſe of Chriſt, the ſons and daughters and children of God.</p>
            <p>We anſwer that no part of this argument is ſound. The major,<note place="margin">All the parts of it are vitious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the concluſion proves not the queſtion.</note> minor, and concluſion are vitious. Firſt, the concluſion commeth not neare the queſtion; for were it granted, it concludes no more
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50687:94"/>
but a duty of the Church-officers and members to try and be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied about the ſtate of theſe who are to bee received into the Church, but it hath no word of an other duty which is the point in queſtion: It ſpeaks nothing of a neceſſity to ſeparate from a Church upon the neglect of the former duty; this alone is the ſtate of the preſent controverſie, which neither is expreſſed nor by any conſequence doth follow from any thing that is expreſſed in this concluſion: for ſuppoſe it were a duty laid by God upon every Church-Officer and member, to enquire accurately after the Faith and Sanctification of all to be received among them, and to expect ſatisfaction in their tryall; yet I hope that every neglect of duty in the Church-Officers, much leſſe in every Church-member, and leaſt of all the want of ſucceſſe of a duty truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, will not be found a juſt and neceſſary cauſe for every one to ſeparate from a Church; if all this be not experſly concluded, this arrow miſſeth the marke.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">It ſtands upon a chief ground of Anabaptiſm, and preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the nullity of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note>Secondly, That which is expreſſed in the concluſion, pitcheth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon one particular caſe, which the Reformed Churches neither do nor may acknowledge; for it ſpeaks only of admiſſion of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers upon their confeſſion of ſins. This fits well the practice of the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> who ſuppoſe a neceſſity to diſſolve the Reformed Churches that now are as vitiouſly conſtituted from their firſt beginning. They may ſeeme to have reaſon in their gathering of new Churches, to put their members to tryall before admiſſion; but the Reformed Churches who take themſelves to be ſo farre true, that they need no diſſolution or new erection, are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this caſe of admiſſion; for their members were borne in the Church, and had the Covenant ſealed to them in Baptiſme; what tryall they take of their children when they admit them to the Lords Table, is no wayes for their admiſſion to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; for this practice is a maine pillar of Anabaptiſme; and our brethrens engagement therein, is the ground of all their ſympathy and ſymboliſing with that Sect: So then the concluſion commeth ſhort of the queſtion, and toucheth not the Reformed Churches, but is builded on the pillars of rigid Separation and Anabaptiſme, taking that for granted which no Reformed Church may admit, but upon hard termes; no milder then the nullity and diſſolution of all their Churches: that out of the rubbiſh, a new building
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50687:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may bee erected after the Separatiſts patterne.</p>
            <p>The major alſo is vitious;<note place="margin">The major is many wayes vitious.</note> for ſuppoſe the antecedent of it were true, yet there is no force therein to inferre the conſequent; be it ſo, that every Church-member ought to be ſo holy as you will; yet, can this inferre the peoples power to try that holineſſe which is the one halfe of the conſequent? Such a power in the people would make every one of them a Church-Governour, which none of the Reformed Churches, nor the halfe of the Separatiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will admit; and they who doe plead for it, ſet it upon other pillars but no man I know deduceth it from any thing in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent now in hand.</p>
            <p>For the reſt of the conſequent, the Officers ſatisfaction in the true and ſincere grace of the members at their firſt admiſſion, if it have any truth, yet it commeth too ſhort of reaſon, and runnes alſo farre beyond the moſt rigid Separatiſts. If a tryall muſt be made of Church-members, why at their firſt admiſſion alone and never after? Is it not an ordinary caſe in all Churches, and as much among the <hi>Browniſts</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> as any other, that many who at firſt have been taken for truly regenerate, have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after fallen to ſuch errours in judgement and ſuch practices in life, as have given juſt ground to conclude the irregeneration of ſome, and to doubt the regeneration of others? Now, if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of regeneration, be a juſt cauſe to hold a man out of all Churches, is it not as juſt a cauſe to caſt a man out of a Church, when by doctrine or life, this uncertainty appears, which at firſt was covered? yet none of our Brethren affirm that the uncertainty of regeneration, nor the certainty of irregeneration is a juſt ground to caſt any man out of the Church who once is come in. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent alſo runs wide of the rigid Separatiſts; for the holineſſe they require, is expreſly externall, which may ſtand with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall wickedneſſe of hypocrites; but the conſequent ſpeaks of inward ſincerity contradiſtinguiſhed from all outward profeſſions.</p>
            <p>The Minor is the part of the Argument which they labour to fortifie, knowing the greateſt weight to lie upon it:<note place="margin">But the minor is the moſt faulty part of the Argument.</note> We do deny it as a very dangerous errour; every member of a viſible Church is not in truth and ſincerity a Believer and Saint: This is againſt Scripture and all experience in every viſible Church; all who are called are not choſen: In the field of God there are tares among

            <p>The places thus expounded, prove not the point; for grant to every Congregation ſo high priviledges as you will, yet if they muſt be verified of that Congregation only according to ſome members, and not according to all; if they be to be underſtood on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Elect in that Congregation who have the ſanctifying Spirit of Chriſt, not of many others who are dead in nature, and yet are ſuch members who have right from God according to our Brethrens own Tenet, to perform Church acts, ſuch as are the preaching of the Goſpel, the celebration of the Sacraments, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of members, the execution of cenſures, with ſuch authority from Chriſt, as makes all theſe acts truly valid for the comfort and ſalvation of the Elect; they prove not the true grace of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom we muſt acknowledge to be a true member of a Church.</p>

            <p>We Anſwer therefore to the Minor, That it is evidently falſe for the Reaſons which we brought upon the Minor of the former Argument.<note place="margin">The minor is falſe.</note> The place of the <hi>Acts</hi> brought for the proofe of it is detorted;<note place="margin">Its proofe is unſufficient.</note> ſuch as were to be ſaved were added to the Church; is this indefinite propoſition to be underſtood univerſally, that all who were to be ſaved were added to the Church? the former Argument maketh this no neceſſary truth; for if men muſt be juſtified, ſanctified, and put in the way of ſalvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be added to the Church, then though they were never added to the Church, they may well bee ſaved.</p>
            <p>They would doe well here to remember their own ordinary practice, contrary to that which here they profeſſe to be the way of God. Why doe they not adde to their Church all that are to be ſaved? why exclude they many whom they grant to be truly gracious and Elect, upon this ground alone that they cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of their <hi>Independency</hi> or Covenant?</p>

               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:50687:96"/>Or ſuppoſe the propoſition to be univerſall; yet, muſt it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall and convertible? Be it ſo, that all who were to be ſaved, were added to the Church: yet, muſt all who are added to the Church be ſaved? This is an evident untruth. Will they that all the members of their Church muſt be ſaved? or doe they think that all the perſons of their Churches who ſhall not be ſaved, were never true members of their viſible Church? <hi>Iudas</hi> was made a member of the Apoſtolick ſociety by Chriſt, and many men were brought into the viſible Church by the Prophets and Apoſtles, who ſhall not be ſaved.

            <p>The third Argument.

            <p>Anſwer, This is a ſtrange Argument. For firſt, we may not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the Church founded upon the Rock is every particular vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church: The priviledges of the Catholike and viſible Church, which the Ieſuites by all their wreſtlings have never been able to extort from us for their Idoll of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall we throw them away upon every <hi>Independent</hi> Congregation? how unſtable Rocks theſe Congregations are, and how eaſily by ſmall tentations ſhaken in pieces, themſelves may remember.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Rock whereupon the Church is builded, is Chriſt, whom <hi>Peter</hi> did confeſſe; we may not make any mans profeſſion, were it never ſo cleere and never ſo zealous, the foundation of the Church in ſuch a faſhion, that the ignorance or hypocriſie of any man may remove the foundation of any Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſhall no man be a member of a Church, till the holy Ghoſt dictate unto him ſuch a confeſſion of Faith as he did unto <hi>Peter?</hi> if none but the Elect and thoſe who are filled with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, may be members of Churches, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> have won the field. However, what here is alledged, is not true of <hi>Peter</hi>

               <note place="margin">The parable of the Tares is thrown againſt its principall ſcope.</note>The third place miſ-applyed, is the parable of the Tares, as if the Tares came into the Church by the ſleepineſſe of the ſervants. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This alſo is a bold addition to Scripture: it is not ſaid, while the ſervants ſleeped, but while men ſleeped, noting no negligence in men who did ſleep when it was ſeaſonable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them to ſleep; but only the ſecret and dark time of the night, or the ſecret, dark, and imperceptible way of Satan his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in hypocrites, and corrupting the Church. However, this part of the parable is no wayes argumentative; for Chriſt in his full ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication toucheth not at all upon this circumſtance; but the maine ſcope of the parable declareth to us the nature of the viſible Church upon earth, contrary to the argument in hand, That Chriſt doth not intend to have upon earth any Church wherein the Tares ſhall not be mixed with the wheat; for if he did not finde in his wiſedome the expediency of this adminiſtration,<note place="margin">His fourth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that all who cannot demonſtrate the truth of their regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, deny the power of godlineſſe, is not true.</note> hee could in his power eaſily alter or prevent it.</p>
            <p>Their fourth argument is drawn from the ſecond to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 3.5. <hi>who have a form of Godlineſſe, but deny the power of it, from ſuch we muſt turne away. Ergo,</hi> who are not found to have poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſatisfactory ſignes of regeneration, ought not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted members of any Church. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The conſequent is naught; for the ſtrength of it will lie in this propoſition, Every
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50687:97"/>
profeſſor who bringeth not demonſtrative ſignes of his regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and true grace, is a man who hath the forme of godlineſſe and denyeth the power thereof. How falſe this is, both the Text and our Brethrens practice will evidence. The Text puts it out of doubt, that the men whom the Apoſtle calls the denyers of the power of godlineſſe, are perſons openly ſcandalous and flagitious, as the verſes both before and after doe demonſtrate; even ſuch whom the Apoſtle deſcribes, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. abominable, diſobedient, and to every good work reprobate. Now it is cleare that many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors who are not able to bring out any convincing ſignes of their regeneration, are notwithſtanding free from all ſcandall; and however many hypocrites can goe beyond them in making faire and ſatisfactory ſhewes to men: yet ſundry of them may be the elect children of God, and really moſt gracious in his eyes, how unable or unwilling ſoever they be to make this much appeare to the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the men whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, are to be caſt out of the Church after their admiſſion; but our Brethren will not caſt out all of whoſe regeneration they are not convinced, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter once they are admitted; for if ſo, Excommunication in every Church would become too frequent.</p>
            <p>Their fifth argument is this; No hypocrite,<note place="margin">His fifth, that no hypocrite is to be admitted a member of a Church, is a very raſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> none who at laſt will leave their firſt Love, are to be admitted in the Church; for all ſuch will ruine the Church, and procure the removing of the Candleſtick: but all that cannot prove their regeneration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly, are ſuch. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a bold and raſh argument, laying a neceſſity to exclude all hypocrites from the Church, and all ſuch as may fall away from any degree of their firſt love. We anſwer then that the minor is very falſe; for many gracious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons farre from hypocriſie, and free from all decay of their firſt love, may be unable to ſatisfie themſelves or others in the certaine truth of their regeneration. But the major is more falſe, againſt the practiſe of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, who did alwayes receive divers hypocrites; and our Brethren dare not deny that they do ſo alſo; for their Churches conſiſt not all of reall Saints. However the very Text alledged proveth our Tenet; for Epheſus to Chriſt, there is a moſt true Church, notwithſtanding their fall from their firſt Love, and his threatning of them with the removall of their Candleſtick if they did not repent.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">His ſeventh, from the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters excluſion of uncleane perſons from the Temple, has no ſtrength.</note>The other typicall argument is this; The porters excluded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane perſons from the Temple; therefore, the Officers ought to keep the irregenerate from the Church. <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumenting from ſymbolick types, except where the ſpirit of God in Scripture applies a type to ſuch a ſignification and uſe.</p>
            <p>Where did our Brethren learne to make the porters of the Temple types of the Church-officers. Their people will not bee content to be cheated of the Keyes by ſuch ſymbolizing. If they will make the Temple a type, not only of Chriſts body and the Church univerſall, but of every Congregation; yet by what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will they make legall uncleanneſſe typifie the eſtate of irrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration? And above all, how will they make the excluſion from the Temple for legall uncleaneſſe, a type of rejection from Church-memberſhip for irregeneration?</p>
            <p>Nothing more common then legall cleaneſſe in a perſon irrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, and legall uncleaneſſe in a perſon regenerate. Legall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſſe did never hinder any from Church-memberſhip under the old Teſtament, albeit for a time it might impede their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in ſome ſervices; but irregeneration did never hinder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in any ſervice. It is a queſtion whether very ſcandalous ſins did keep men ceremonially clean from the Temple and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; but out of all doubt irregeneration alone was never a bar to keep any from the moſt holy and moſt ſolemn ſervices, whether of the Tabernacle or Temple.</p>

               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:50687:98"/>There are two other arguments couched in the concluſion of the debate. Firſt,<note place="margin">His eight, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the worſt is that the antecedent is clearly againſt the places of Scripture alledged. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt did not exclude either the Scribes or the Phariſees or the common people from his baptiſm, but received all that came, both the Scribes and Phariſees, and Ieruſalem, and all Iudea, and all the region about Iordan, requiring no other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their admiſſion to his Sacrament then the confeſſion of ſinne and promiſing of new obedience, acts very feaſable to irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate people.</p>

They teach that the power of propheſie or publike preaching both within and without the Congregation, belongeth to every man in their Church who hath ability to ſpeak in publike to edification. The Reformed Churches give this power only to Paſtors and Doctors who are called by God and the Church to labour in the Word. They do not deny to every Chriſtian all true liberty in private as God gives them occaſion, in an orderly way to edifie one another, nor do they deny to the ſons of the Prophets who are fitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the paſtorall charge, to exerciſe their gifts in publike for their preparation and triall; but publike preaching they do not permit to any who are not either actually in the Miniſtry or in the way unto it.</p>

            <p>The reaſons we bring for our tenet, are theſe. Firſt, Who ever have power to preach the word ordinarily, have alſo power to baptiſe.<note place="margin">That none but Miniſters may ordinarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, wee prove, it firſt by Chriſts joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the power of baptiſm and the power of preaching.</note> But only Miniſters have power to baptiſe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> only Miniſters have power to preach the Word ordinarily. The Minor how ever the <hi>Arminians</hi> and ſome few of the late <hi>Browniſts</hi> deny, yet all the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents</hi> grant it; but they deny the Major, which we prove by two Scripturall reaſons; firſt, Chriſt conjoyns the power of baptiſm with the power of preaching; <hi>Ergo,</hi> who have the power of preaching have alſo the power of baptiſing, which Chriſt hath anexed to it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go and teach all Nations, baptiſing them.</hi> Their Reply that Chriſt ſpeaks here of Apoſtles and not of ordinary Miniſters, is not ſatisfactory; for he ſpeaks both of Apoſtles and ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters becauſe of ſuch officers who were to remain in the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world, and with whoſe Miniſtry he was alwayes and ever to be preſent as it followeth in verſe 20. But the Church from that time to the worlds end, was not to be ſerved by Apoſtles only, who ſoon after were removed, but by ordinary Paſtors alſo, the Apoſtles Succeſſors. Moreover, there is no reaſon for the connexion of baptiſm and Preaching in the perſon of the Apoſtles that will not hold as well if not better in the perſon of ordinary Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Our other proofe of the major, is this. The power of preaching is more then the power of baptiſme; <hi>Ergo,</hi> who have the firſt, have the ſecond alſo. The antecedent is manifeſt from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptiſe but to preach</hi>; to intimate the excellency of the one above the other; the Apoſtle declares not only his ſeldome pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the one,<note place="margin">Secondly, theſe that preach, muſt be ſent to that work.</note> but denyeth his commiſſion for it in compariſon of the other.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Argument; Who ever have power to preach are ſent of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50687:100"/>
God to preach. But, theſe who have no office in the Church are not ſent of God to preach, <hi>Ergo</hi>: They that have no office in the Church have no power to preach. The major is grounded on <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>How ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi> The minor may bee proved, not only from the nature of the thing, the calling of God to preach, and a mans ordinary preaching on Gods call importing an office and charge to do ſuch a work: but alſo from the place in hand compared with its fountaine, whence it is derived <hi>Iſay</hi> 52.8. <hi>Thy watchmen ſhall lift up the voyce,</hi> where it is cleare that theſe whom the Lord ſends to preach are watchmen, from whoſe hand the blood of them, that die without warning will be required, <hi>Ezeck.</hi> 33.6. <hi>Who watch for the peoples ſoules as they who muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, Heb.</hi> 12.17. which is not true of any man who hath no charge.</p>

            <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">Sixthly, all who have from God the gift of preaching are obliged to lay aſide all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and attend that work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</note> Whoever have gotten of God a calling or a gift to preach the Goſpel, they are obliged to keep &amp; encreaſe their gift, &amp; to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that calling by giving themſelves wholy to reading, by laying aſide all worldly occupations, &amp; not intangling themſelves with the things of this life; but, no man out of office is thus obliged. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The minor they grant, for they will not have their Prophets to be ſo much in reading as may diſtract them from their worldly Trade and civill occupation: The major is proved from 1 <hi>Tim. cha.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 13.14, 15. where <hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded to keep his gift of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching by the meanes named. The reaſon is alike to all that have that gift, whether they have it by Propheſie, &amp; laying on of the hands of the <hi>Presbytery</hi> as <hi>Timothy</hi> had it, or any otherwayes: for the gifts of God however gotten, muſt not bee neglected, and the meanes preſcribed of God for the entertaining of theſe gifts may not bee ſlighted, leaſt of all by them in whom the gift is but mean and ſmall; they of all others have moſt need of the ſtrongeſt meanes to make their ſmoking flax to burn: beſide, publick preaching is a faculty of that nature, that all the reading and attendance which any man can beſtow upon it, will have enough ado to ſupport and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it in any uſefull and edifying condition.</p>
            <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">Seventhly, the Apoſtles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed none to preach but Elders.</note> None may lawfully preach but ſuch as the Apoſtles appointed to preach. But, the Apoſtles appointed no man out of office to preach. The minor alone is queſtionable; which thus we prove. The Apoſtles appointed no others to preach but Elders; <hi>Ergo,</hi> none out of office. The antecedent we have from <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5.<note place="margin">Eighthly, the preaching of men out of office is a means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> 
               <hi>That thou ſhouldeſt ordaine Elders in every City as I had appointed thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eightly, the permitting of private men out of office to preach, is a great meanes of confuſion in the Church and breeding of errors and ſtrife; <hi>Ergo,</hi> its not of God. The antecedent is made too cleare
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50687:101"/>
by daily experience; the conſequence is builded upon the nature of God who is a God and Author of truth and order; what is from him, is conduceable to theſe ends, not to the contrary.</p>

            <p>Alſo Mr <hi>Cotton</hi> himſelfe in his laſt book of the Keyes, p. 20. doth grant this, and expreſly recals what himſelfe in his Catechiſm, and both he and his Brethren in their Anſwer to the 32 Articles, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered about propheſying.

            <head>CHAP. IX. Whether the power of Eccleſiaſtick Iuriſdiction belongs to the People or to the Presbyterie.</head>
            <p>THe next Queſtion concernes the power of Eccleſiaſtick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction to whom it may be due:<note place="margin">What is meant by Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction.</note> by Eccleſiaſtick Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is underſtood the admiſſion of Members into a Church, their caſting out againe by Excomunication, their reconciliation after repentance, the Ordination of Officers, their depoſition from their charge, the Determining of Queſtions,<note place="margin">The ſtate of the Queſtion wont to be cleare, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches putting the power and exerciſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in the hand of the Presbytery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> &amp; <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> in the hand of the people onely; but Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> &amp; his followers the other yeare have perplexed the Queſtion with their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Schole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions. If they put the power of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction onely in a Church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized and Presbyterated, they fall from much of the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> and their own, both doctrine and practiſe.</note> the deciding of Controverſies and ſuch other acts of Eccleſiaſtick authority.</p>
            <p>Till of late the ſtate of the Queſtion here was very cleare and plaine: the Reformed Churches doe put both the power and the exerciſe of Juriſdiction into the hand of the Presbytery, that is, the company of Elders, and Colledge of Church Governours. The Browniſts, and after them the Independents did aſcribe all theſe acts to the Church, as well without, as with a Presbytery: but of late Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> in his Booke of the Keyes and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in their Synodick meetings of <hi>New-England</hi> have ſo ſubtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and as to me it ſeemes, involved the Queſtion with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of new diſtinctions, that it is very hard to apprehend with any certaintie and cleareneſſe their meaning, and more hard to reconcile any one with himſelfe, much leſſe one with another.</p>
            <p>They would ſeeme to differ much from the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> they ſtand not to put them in the Category of <hi>Morellius,</hi> the firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of Democracie and popular government in the Church: they profeſſe a midway of government, well ballanced with a prudent mixture of the Officers power with the peoples, giving a part to both, and all to neither: They bring a multitude of diſtinctions rather to eſchew the dint of our former arguments in the darkeneſſe of theſe Thickets, then to give any light to this very great Queſtion. They inſiſt moſt on two diſtinctions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they thinke to anſwer all we bring againſt them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they diſtinguiſh betwixt a Church Organized or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated, as they ſpeake, and a Church inorganized and unpresbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: the one is a body <hi>Heterogeneous,</hi> a covenanted people with their Officers framed in a Presbitery; the other a body
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50687:103"/>
               <hi>Homogeneous</hi> a people in a Church Covenant without Officers, at leaſt without a Presbytery. They would ſeeme to plead, or elſe the diſtinction is for no purpoſe, for the power onely of an Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized and a Presbyterated Church. If they would ſtand to this in earneſt, and firmely, we ſhould be glad; for ſo they ſhould open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſert, not onely the whole race of the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> but all their owne former Writings, practiſes, and enervate the beſt of theſe very arguments they ſtill adhere unto: for if ye will conſider what is written by Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> either in his Catechiſme, or way, or anſwer to the thirty two Queſtions, or the Arguments that ſtill he inſiſts upon in the Keyes, or their generall practiſe in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>New-England</hi> to this day, you will ſee that they maintaine the Juriſdiction of a Church, as well unpresbyterated, without a Presbytery, without Officers, as of a Church Presbiterated; for the power of Ordination of Officers, and of their depoſition, the power of admitting and caſting out of Members, which are the higheſt acts of Juriſdiction, they aſcribe expreſſely to every Church, whether it have, or want Officers, as its proper and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable priviledge.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Their laſt and beſt beloved invention of the power of Authority, and power of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, is for no purpoſe but to involve the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in new difficulties.</note>Their other new diſtinction, wherein openly they applaud ſo much one another, as it were contending who ſhould have the glory of its invention, is of a double power, one of Authority, and another of Liberty: aſcribing unto a Presbyterated Church the whole power of Juriſdiction and every part of it, both to the Officers of their Presbytery, and to the people in their fraternity or brotherhood; but, ſo that the intereſt of the Officers in every act, is a power of authority which makes that their action only is valid and binding; but the intereſt of the people is a power of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to concurre in theſe acts of Juriſdiction by an obedientiall, yet a neceſſary and authoritative concurrence.</p>
            <p>This new diſtinction will not ſerve their turne, for firſt, its not applicable to the chiefe acts of Juriſdiction in queſtion: their Ordination of Officers, their admiſſion of Members, are done or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily by their people alone, without the concurrence of any Officers, who then are not in being. Secondly, their arguments for the peoples intereſt in Excommunication, Abſolution, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acts of Juriſdiction, inferre either nothing at all, or much more then that which they call a power of Liberty, or of an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50687:103"/>
concurrence. Thirdly, this diſtinction involves the Authors in new unextricable difficulties, it makes the Keyes &amp; Sword of Chriſt altogether inſerviceable in common and ordinary caſes, wherein they have moſt neede and occaſion to be ſet on worke.</p>
            <p>Not onely according to their former principles, they make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Congregation uncenſurable for any poſſible crime:<note place="margin">As they wont to make their ſmalleſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent</hi> &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſurable for any crime, ſo now by this diſtinction they divide all their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in two parts, and make every one of theſe parts <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent</hi> alſo, and uncenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable ſinne. For the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that the people have no power of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, we reaſon: Firſt, the Officers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, and the people are to be governed.</note> But by this new Doctrine they confeſſe, that every Presbytery in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation becomes uncenſurable, and that every people of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation becometh uncapable of any cenſure. Yea farther, if the moſt part of the Presbytery, ſuppoſe two ruling Elders joyne together in the greateſt hereſies and crimes, the whole people with the reſt of the Presbitery, ſuppoſe the Paſtor cannot cenſure theſe two Elders; alſo if the greateſt part of the people ſhould joyne in the greateſt wickedneſſe, yet the whole Presbytery, with the reſt of the people that remaine ſincere and gracious, cannot cenſure the wicked. In all theſe, and divers ſuch ordinary caſes, they have no remedy but Separation, and alwayes Separation upon Separation, till their Church be diſſolved into ſo ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that it cannot by more Separations be farther divided. But let us conſider the Arguments upon both ſides.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we reaſon thus, The people are not the Governors of the Church, But the acts of Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction belong to the Governors of the Church; <hi>Ergo,</hi> The acts of Eccleſiaſtick Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction belong not to the people. The <hi>Minor</hi> is cleare from the nature of the very termes; for Juriſdiction is either all one with Government, or a chiefe part of it: now Government is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially relative to Governors. The <hi>Major</hi> is proved by many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which make the people ſo farre from being Governors, that they are obliged to be ſubject and obedient to their Officers, as to them by whom God will have them governed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, for they watch for your ſoules as they who muſt give an account.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Let the Elders who rule well, be counted worthy of double honour.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Know them which are over you in the Lord, and eſteeme them very highly in love for their workes ſake.</hi> God hath made them Paſtors, and the people their flocke; them Builders, the people the ſtones laid by them in the building; them Fathers, the people children begotten by their Miniſtry; them Stewards, the people domeſticks under their conduct.</p>

The people have not any promiſe of gifts ſufficient for government.</note>Fourthly, Who have a right from God to the acts of Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they have a promiſe of gifts needfull for the performance of theſe acts. For a divine right and calling to any worke is backed
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50687:104"/>
with a promiſe of Gods preſence, gifts and aſſiſtance in doing of that worke; but, the people have no promiſe of any ſuch gifts. For beſides that daily experience declares numbers among the people to be altogether deſtitute of ſuch knowledge, wiſedome and other gifts which are neceſſary for the performance of theſe acts of Juriſdiction: The Apoſtle himſelfe teaches that ſuch gifts are not given to all, but to ſome onely.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. The popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar government bringeth in con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuſion making the feete above the head.</note> That is not to be given to the people that brings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion into the Church, for the Lord <hi>is the God of Order.</hi> But the putting of the power of Juriſdiction in the peoples hand, brings confuſion into the Church, for it makes the feete above the head, it puts the greateſt power into the hand of the meaneſt, it gives power to the Flocke to depoſe and excommunicate their Paſtour. Our Brethren were lately wont to digeſt with the <hi>Browniſts</hi> theſe abſurdities: but now they begin to diſlike them, and rather then to ſtand to their Prior Tenets, they will limit the Minor, aſſerting that the power of Juriſdiction belongs to the people not ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but joyntly with their Officers: ſo that neither they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate their Officers, nor their Officers can excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them.</p>
            <p>But it ſeemes this new Subtilty will not long pleaſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of it, for as we have ſaide it makes the Keys of Heaven much more inſerviceable for opening and cloſing then needs muſt; when it hath taken the keys out of the hand of all others, and put them in the little weake fiſt of a particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it will not permitt them to open or to cloſe the doore, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the people, nor yet to the Elderſhippe. The Elderſhippe cannot remitt, nor retaine the ſinnes of the Brotherhood, nor the Brotherhood, of the Elderſhippe: yea none of the Elderſhippe can be cenſured by all the people, without the conſentient vote of the Presbytery, nor any of the people can either be bound or looſed without the conſentient vote of the people. In theſe caſes which may be very frequent, The Keys of Chriſt muſt be layde aſide, and a new key of the <hi>Independents</hi> owne invention, their ſentence of Non-Communion, or that much beloved and a little elder key of ſeparation, forged by the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> muſt come in the place thereof, to be uſed againſt any or all other Churches, againſt their owne Church or its Elderſhippe, or its Brotherhood, or any Member of either.</p>

               <note place="margin">6. The people have not the power of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note>Our ſixth argument concernes Ordination, a ſpeciall act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, which all the Independents to this day put in the hands of the people alone, when ever a new Congregation is to be ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: which to them is no extraordinary nor rare caſe: or when in a Congregation already erected, there is no Presbytery, which among them is frequent. For a Presbytery muſt conſiſt of more Governours then one, and uſually their Presbiteryes exceede not the number of three or foure. At the death of their Miniſter, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one of their two ruling Elders be ſicke, or abſent, or the two differ betweene themſelves: in this caſe they make no difficulty to cauſe ſome of the people out of all office to ordaine a new cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Paſtour; Againſt this very ordinary practice we reaſon.</p>
            <p>Vnto whom the power of Ordination doth belong, they have a Commiſſion from God authoritatively to ſend Paſtours for preaching and celebration of the Sacraments,<note place="margin">They have no Commiſſion to ſend Paſtours to themſelves, to impoſe hands to examine their Paſtours, to pray publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and exhort.</note> alſo to lay hands upon them for that effect; But people have no ſuch Commiſſion. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major,</hi> is the nature of Ordination; for the eſſence and inward forme of it is the authoritative ſending named: the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Forme and Signe uſed in Scripture, is impoſition of hands. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved from three grounds; firſt, that the people however they elect, yet they doe not ſend; for ſo they ſhould ſend to themſelves. The Senders and they to whom the Preachers are ſent, ſhould be one and the ſame. Secondly, an authoritative miſſion imports a Superiority in the Sender above the Sent; But, the Paſtours are over the people not under them. Thirdly, the examples of the New Teſtament make it evident, that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative ſending, and impoſition of hands, the ſigne thereof, were never uſed by any of the people, but by the Elders onely. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>With the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery</hi>: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly upon no man.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Stirre up the gift of God that is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</hi> So it was not onely at the firſt ſending of men to preach, but in <hi>poſterior</hi> miſſions to any particular Service of the Miniſtery. <hi>Acts.</hi> 13.1. <hi>There was in the Church certaine Prophets and Teachers, and the Holy Ghoſt ſayd, Separate me Barnabas and Saul to the worke whereunto I have called them; and when they had faſted and prayed, and layd their hands on them, they ſent them away.</hi> Fourthly, None of the people ordinarily have the gifts requiſite for this action, as skill to examine the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50687:105"/>
in all things he muſt be tried in, a gift of publicke prayer, a faculty to inſtruct and exhort the Paſtour and people to mutuall duties.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That power belongeth not to the people which diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth them both in their Chriſtian and Civill duties. But,<note place="margin">7. This power in the people would diſable them in their callings.</note> the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction doth ſo. The <hi>Major</hi> is grounded on the nature of all power and all gifts which God doth give; for all are for edification, and none for the hurt of theſe to whom they are given. The <hi>Minor</hi> may be demonſtrated by this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That it layes a neceſſity upon all the people to attend in the Sabbath day upon the exerciſe of diſcipline, which by the very length will make the Sabbath-Service inſupportably burdenſome; and alſo will fill the mindes of the people with theſe purpoſes which naturally occurre in the agitation of Eccleſiaſticke cauſes, and cannot but caſt out of common weake mindes much of the fruite of the preceding worſhip.</p>
            <p>Further, the peoples neceſſary attendance on all Eccleſiaſticke cauſes, will make the proceſſe in the moſt cauſes ſo prolix, as cannot but robbe the people of that time which they ought to imploy in their ſecular callings for getting of bread. For every one of the people being a Judge, muſt be ſo ſatisfyed in every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of every action, as to give their Suffrage upon certaine knowledge and with a good conſcience: now before this can be done in a few cauſes of the ſmalleſt, and beſt ordered Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations much time will be ſpent: as the Church of <hi>Arneim</hi> found it in one cauſe alone, though but a light one; and betwixt two onely, even of their cheife and beſt Members.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, That power is not to be given to the people,<note place="margin">8. This power of the people would bring in <hi>Morellius</hi> demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy and anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy in the Church.</note> which brings in the popular government of <hi>Morellius</hi> into the Church: but, the power in queſtion doth ſo. The <hi>Major</hi> is the common aſſertion of all the Brethren, that they are farre from democracy, and further from <hi>Morellius</hi> anarchy, and that they are ready to forſake their Tenet, if it can be demonſtrated to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any ſuch thing. The <hi>Minor</hi> thus we prove, That which puts the higheſt acts of Government in the hands of the multitude, brings in the popular government: for in the greateſt democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that are or ever have beene, there were divers acts of great power in the hand of ſundry Magiſtrates; but the higheſt acts of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50687:106"/>
power being in the hands of the people alone: ſuch as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Lawes, the creation of Magiſtrates, the cenſure of the greateſt Offendors, theſe were the ſure ſignes of Supremacy, that gave the denomination to the government. Now we aſſure that the Tenet in hand puts the higheſt acts of Eccleſiaſtick Authority in the hands of the people. For the Ordination and Depoſition of Officers, the binding and looſing of Offendours, are incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the higheſt acts of Eccleſiaſticke Juriſdiction: Theſe they put in the hand of the people.</p>
            <p>That they doe conjoyne with the people the Officers to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Law, and declare what is right, and to give out the ſentence makes nothing againſt the peoples Supremacy: for in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> at their moſt democraticke times, and this day in the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> in all the Provinces and every City, where the people are undoubted Soveraignes, they have their Magiſtrates and Officers in all their proceedings to goe before them, to declare the caſe, to take the Suffrages, and to pronounce the Sentence.</p>
            <p>As for them who of late have begun to put the whole Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Officers alone, and to give the people onely a liberty of conſenting to what the Officers doe decree of their owne Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, wee ſay they are but few that doe ſo, and theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to themſelves. Alſo theſe ſame men give abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the people in divers caſes: further, that liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they come to call an authoritative concurrence. Laſtly, the moſt of the arguments even of theſe men, doe conclude not onely a liberty to conſent, and to concurre, but an authoritative agency in the higheſt acts of Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">9. This power of the people will draw upon them the power of the word and Sacrament.</note>Ninthly, They who have the power of Juriſdiction, have alſo the power of preaching the word, and celebrating the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, unleſſe God in his word have given them a particular and expreſſe exemption from that imployment. But none of the people have power to preach the word, and celebrate the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is built on theſe Scriptures which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne the adminiſtration of the Word, Sacrament and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in one and the ſame termes: and upon theſe Scriptures which lay a part of theſe adminiſtrations upon ſome men, with an expreſſe exception of another part of them. <hi>Math.</hi> 16.19.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50687:106"/>
under the name of the Keys of the Kingdome of Heaven, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the whole Eccleſiaſticke power of the Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Diſcipline; what there is promiſed. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in theſe termes, <hi>as the Father hath ſent me, ſo I ſend you.</hi> But, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. where this power is ſeparated and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the one part of Juriſdiction is aſcribed to the ruling Elders, with an expreſſe intimation of their freedome from preaching the Word, and by conſequence from celebration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The <hi>Minor</hi> was that none of the people have power of the word and Sacraments. For the power of the Sacraments, it is confeſſed not to belong to the people. That the power of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, belongeth no more to them, was proved in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter. None of our Brethren doe aſcribe the power of preaching to all the People, but onely to a few of them who are able to propheſie: ſo the power of Juriſdiction according to the ground in hand, could be aſcribed to none of the people but theſe few Prophets alone.</p>

I deny the conſequence, for however upon the occaſion of his confeſſion the Keys are promiſed to him: yet they are not promiſed to him becauſe of his confeſſing, nor under the relation of a beleever; for if ſo, then all and onely beleevers ſhould have the full Power of the Keys; but our Brethren will be loth to avow this direct Aſſertion of <hi>Smith</hi> the <hi>Sebaptiſt</hi>; for they doe not aſcribe the Power of the Sacraments to any beleever out of Office, nor any power of the Keys to every beleever: for ſome beleevers are not Members of any Church, and the Keys are onely for Domeſticks. Neither doe they put the Keys into the hands of beleevers alone; for ſo, <hi>Judas</hi> and many Paſtours for want of true fayth could not validly either preach or baptize. The Keys therefore are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Peter</hi> under the notion of a beleever, but in the quality
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50687:107"/>
of an Apoſtle and Elder of the Church, as is cleared in the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led places of <hi>Math</hi> &amp; <hi>John,</hi> where the gift here promiſed is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conferred upon all the Apoſtles, who all were Elders, and whoſe Office of opening and cloſing the doores of Heaven, was to remaine in the Church to the worlds end, not in the hand of every beleever, but of the Governours of the Church joyned in that Presbytery which other Scriptures doe mention.</p>

            <p>They goe here a little further, telling us that the Church in this place cannot be the people, though with their Officers; but muſt be taken for the Officers with the people: becauſe both the Power and the Execution of cenſures belongs to the Officers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, though in the preſence of the people, and with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and concurrence. They tell us that the Right and Authority of cenſures is given onely to the Presbytery of governours, in ſuch a manner that the Presbytery can be cenſured by no others, neither can any other be cenſured not onely without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but not without their action.</p>
            <p>We adde a third ſteppe, whether our former arguments muſt draw them, that the Church here meant, muſt be the Governours alone without the peoples concurrence: for if Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great act of government, did belong to the people, either by themſelves alone, or joyntly by way of concurrence with their Officers, it would follow that the people were either ſole
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50687:107"/>
governours above their Officers, or joynt governours with their Officers: which albeit our Brethren did hold lately with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts, yet now they will not aſſert, ſo much the more as they declare it to be their judgement and practice that the Elders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone without the People, doe meete apart in their Presbytery to heare all offences and to prepare them for publicke Judgement, whence I thus argue.</p>
            <p>They to whom offences are to be told immediatly after the two or three witneſſes are not heard, They are the Church to whom in this place the power of excommunication is given; but, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders alone without the People, being ſet apart in their Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are they to whom offences are to be told, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is cleare from the Text, for it ſpeaks but of one Church which muſt be told, and heard under the paine of cenſure. The <hi>Minor</hi> is their own confeſſion, and practice: and if that meeting of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to whom they tell the offence, for preparation of the proceſſe to their peoples voice, be not the Church here mentioned, Then their ordinary practice of bringing ſcandalls firſt to the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, before they be heard in the Congregation, ſhall be found not onely groundleſſe beſide the Scripture, but altogether contrary to the Scripture in hand: for the method here preſcribed is that the Church be told when the witneſſes are not heard: if therefore that company which is told after the witneſſes are contemned, be not the Church: Chriſts order is not kept, and the Church gets wrong.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they reaſon from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 5. ver. 4.5.7.12.13.<note place="margin">3. The people of <hi>Corinth</hi> did Judge and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate the inceſtuous man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Anſwer, Tbe Text will prove no ſuch matter.</note> They who are gathered together with the Apoſtles Spirit, and the Power of Chriſt to deliver the inceſtuous man to Sathan; Who were to purge out the old Leaven, and to judge them that are within, and put away the wicked Perſon: they have power to excommunicate; but, the People doe all theſe things. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Anſwer, the <hi>Minor</hi> is denyed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that gathering together might well be of the Presbytery alone, which our Brethren grant moſt meete in divers preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acts to cenſure.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if it were of the whole people which can not be ſuppoſed in <hi>Corinth,</hi> where the People and Officers were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the Congregations, as in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and elſe where, were
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50687:108"/>
more then one: yet, ſuppoſe that all the people did meete to the excommunication of that wicked man, this proves not that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one who did meete unto that cenſure, had either the power or the execution of it, more then of the Word and Sacraments to which they did more frequently meete.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the purging out of the old Leaven, and the putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the man, is commended indefinitely to theſe unto whom the Apoſtle wrote, which our Brethren grant cannot be expounded without ſundry exceptions. Firſt, none doubt of women and children; againe in the next chapter, it is written indefinitely, you are ſanctifyed, you are juſtifyed, your Bodyes are the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Holy Ghoſt; this muſt be reſtricted to the elect and regenerate, except we will turne <hi>Arminians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Everywhere in Scripture indefinite propoſitions muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded according as other Scriptures declare the nature of the matter in hand; ſo here, the act of purging and putting away, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed indefinitely to the Church, muſt be expounded not of all the Members, but only of the Officers of the Church. For the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> themſelves make not every Member to be a ruler: nor doe our Brethren give the formall authority and power of cenſures to any other but Officers, aſcribing to the reſt of the Members one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Liberty of concurrence, ſo that the next word of Judging is expounded by them of a Judgement of diſcretion, not of any ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall and authoritative Judgement, which alone is in queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. The people of <hi>Coloſſe</hi> might cenſure <hi>Archip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Anſwer. there is no Word in this Text of the peoples cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note>Fourthly, from <hi>Coll.</hi> 4.17. they reaſon: the people of <hi>Coloſſe</hi> had power to admoniſh their Miniſter <hi>Archippus</hi> to fullfill his Miniſtery. Therefore the People of any Church have power if neede be to excommunicate their Miniſter. Anſwer. Firſt, That however our Brethren pretend to have come off from the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> halfe way towards us: yet their arguments drive at the utmoſt of their old extremities, at no leſſe then a power for the people to excommunicate their Miniſters. Thus farre the moſt of their reaſons doe carry, if they have any force at all. Secondly, the Antecedent may well be denyed, all that the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the <hi>Colloſſians</hi> indefinitely, muſt not be expounded of every one of the people: This precept of ſpeaking to <hi>Archippus,</hi> could not be better performed then by the Presbytery, whereof <hi>Archippus</hi> was a Member. Thirdly, the conſequence is
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50687:108"/>
invalid, They might admoniſh, therefore excommunicate. Every admonition is not in order to cenſure; it is a morall duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent to every one to admoniſh lovingly and zealouſly his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when there is cauſe: it is a ſinne and diſobedience to God if we let ſinne lye upon any whom we by our counſell and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition can helpe; but to conclude that we have power to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate every man, whom in duty wee ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, is an abſurdity which none of the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> will well digeſt.</p>

Secondly, The Antecedent may be denied; for the fault of that impious Toleration is not laid upon the whole Church, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly upon the Angell. Thirdly, the conſequence is not good. The whole Church might be reproved for a neglect of their duty, in not inciting and incouraging their Officers to cenſure theſe Hereticks; but a reproofe for this neglect, inferreth not that it was the peoples duty to execute theſe cenſures: Thus much our Brethren will not avow.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, They reaſon from <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.4.<note place="margin">6. The twenty foure Elders ſit on Thrones with Crownes on their heads. Anſwer, This will not prove a regall power of judging in every one of the people.</note> The foure and twenty Elders ſate on Thrones in white Robes with Crownes on their heads. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Every one of the Church hath a power of judging, as Kings with Crownes ſitting on their Thrones. Anſwer, Firſt, the concluſion ever inferres the full Tenet of the <hi>Separatiſts.</hi> Secondly, the conſequence is very weake, except many things be ſuppoſed which will not be granted without ſtrong proofes: firſt, that this Type is argumentative for the matter in hand: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that this place is relative to the Church on earth, rather then to that in heaven: thirdly, that theſe Elders doe typifie the people rather then the Officers: fourthly, that the Thrones and Crownes import a Kingly Office in every Chriſtian to be exerciſed in Church cenſures upon their brethren, more then the white robes doe inferre the Prieſtly Office of every Chriſtian to be exerciſed in Preaching the Word and celebrating the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

The whole ſcope of the place carrying evidentty a liberty from the burthen and ſervitude of the Law. Their fathering upon it a new and unheard of ſenſe, to wit, a priviledge of Church cenſures, without any authority or proper power therein, is very ſtrange: they cannot produce any Scripture where the word Liberty hath any ſuch ſenſe, and though they could, yet to give the word that ſenſe in this place where ſo clearely it is referred to a quite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe matter, it ſeemeth extremely unreaſonable.</p>

Every gratious neighbour is a Counſellour and Pedagogue, the greater the incorporation is of ſuch, the better is every Member directed and the more ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened. Hence the goodneſſe of God hath ordained not onely the planting of particular men into a ſmall body of one ſingle Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but for the greater ſecurity both of Perſons and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, the Lord hath increaſed that Communion of Churches by binding neighbour Congregations in a larger and ſtronger Body of a Presbytery, or Claſſis; yea a number of Presbyteryes by the ſame hand of God are combined in a Synode; neither this onely, but for the ſtrengthening of every ſtone and of the whole building, the Lord hath appointed the largeſt ſocieties that are poſſible, the very Church univerſall and the repreſentation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, an <hi>Oecumenick</hi> Aſſembly. This congregative way is divine; the diſſolution of humane ſocieties, eſpecially of Eccleſiaſticke Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblyes, muſt be from another Spirit.</p>
            <p>The firſt we know to have oppoſed the holy Societyes we ſpeake of, were <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> who liking a Catholicke anarchy in all things, and preſſing an univerſall liberty, did ſtrive to cut in peeces all the bands, as of Politicke and <hi>Oeconomick</hi> union whereby Kingdomes and States, Cities and Familyes did ſtand, ſo alſo of the Eccleſiaſticke conjunction, making every perſon at laſt fully free from all ſervitude, and ſimply independent, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable in any of his owne opinions or deſires, by any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:50687:110"/>Their firſt follower among the reformed,<note place="margin">From them <hi>Morellius</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> learned the Tenet.</note> was one <hi>John Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau</hi> a <hi>Pariſian,</hi> who in the <hi>French</hi> Churches did vent the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of Congregations from Synods, and the popular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of theſe Independent Congregations: But his ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick pamphlet came no ſooner abroad then the <hi>French</hi> Divines did moſt unanimouſly trample upon it. In their generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at <hi>Rochell,</hi> moſt Reverend <hi>Beza Moderator</hi> for the time, and in their next Aſſembly, Learned <hi>Sadeell</hi> with others, did ſo fully confute theſe <hi>Anabaptiſtick</hi> follies, that thereafter in <hi>France</hi> this evill Spirit did never ſo much as whiſper; only in <hi>Holland,</hi> in the <hi>Arminian</hi> times, it began to ſpeake by the tongue of <hi>Grotius,</hi> and others of his fellowes, who being conſcious to themſelves of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets whereunto they deſpared the aſſent of any Synode, yea fearing to be prejudged in the propagation of their errours by a croſſe Sentence of a Nationall Aſſembly, did ſet themſelves to call in queſtion, and at laſt to deny the Authority and Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Church meetings. But when the goodneſſe of God in that happy Synode of <hi>Dort,</hi> did cruſh the other errours of that Party, this their fanſie did evaniſh, and ſince in theſe bounds hath beene buried in Oblivion. By what meanes this <hi>Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick</hi> roote which neither <hi>France</hi> nor <hi>Holland</hi> could beare, when <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Morellius</hi> did aſſay to plant it, doth thrive ſo well in <hi>England,</hi> after <hi>Browne</hi> and <hi>Barrow</hi> with their followers did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come its dreſſers, I have declared at length before.</p>
            <p>However the Novelty of the Tenet,<note place="margin">Laying aſide all prejudice we will reaſon the matter.</note> the Infamie of its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, the evill ſucceſſe it hath had whereever yet it hath ſet up the head, doth burden it with ſo juſt contempt, that all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther audience might be denyed thereto; yet in this impudent and malapertage, where the greateſt abſurdityes will importunately ingyre themſelves, and require beleefe as unanſwerable and moſt covincing truths, unleſſe in a full hearing their naughtineſſe be demonſtrate, we are content without all prejudices to reaſon the matter it ſelfe from the ground, and to require no man to hate this errour for its Authours, or any externall conſideration, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be cleerely ſhowne to be contrary to the revealed will of God.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the Queſtion hath no perplexitie,<note place="margin">The ſtate of the Queſtion cleared.</note> if its termes were cleared. The <hi>Browniſts</hi> affirme that every Pariſh Church, that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50687:111"/>
every ſingle Congregation, is Independent from any Presbytery, any Synod, any Aſſembly: This we deny, affirming the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence and ſubordination of Parochiall Congregations to Presbyteries, and of theſe to Synods: to which we aſcribe power, authority, and Juriſdiſdiction.</p>
            <p>Before wee fall to reaſoning, let us underſtand the words, which in this debate doe frequently occurre. Firſt, what is a Parochiall Church, or ſingle Congregation. Secondly, What is its independence. Thirdly, What is a Presbytery, and a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Church. Fourthly, What is a Synod. Fifthly. What is Authoritie and Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſticall. We intend no defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but ſuch popular deſcriptions as may make cleare what the parties uſe to underſtand by theſe words.</p>
            <p>A particular Church, a Pariſh or Congregation in this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is taken for a company of faithfull people, every one whereof in the face of the whole Congregation, hath given ſo cleare tokens of their true grace and regeneration, as hath ſatisfied the minde of all: A company, I ſay, incorporate by a particular Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Oath to exerciſe all the parts of Chriſtian Religion, in one place under one Paſtor: Our Oppoſits affirme, that in one Church there muſt be but one Paſtor, aſſiſted indeede with a Doctor, and three or foure Elders, yet no more Paſtors but one. They will admit into a Church no more people then commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and at their eaſe, may convene in one houſe; how few they be they care not; ten families, or forty perſons to them are a faire Church: you have heard that ſome of their Churches have beene within the number of foure perſons.</p>
            <p>Independencie is the full liberty of ſuch a Church to diſcharge all the parts of Religion, Doctrine, Sacraments, Diſcipline, and all within it ſelfe without all dependence, all ſubordination to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other on earth, more or fewer, ſo that the ſmalleſt Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, ſuppoſe of three perſons, though it fall into the groſſeſt hereſies, may not be controlled by any Orthodoxe Synod, were it Oecumenicke of all the Churches on earth.</p>
            <p>A Presbytery, as it is called in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or a Claſſis, as in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or a Collogue, as in <hi>France,</hi> is an ordinary meeting of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Churches neerly neighbouring, &amp; of the ruling Elders deputed therefrom, for the exerciſe chiefely of diſcipline, ſo farre
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50687:111"/>
as concernes theſe neighbouring Churches in common.</p>
            <p>A Presbyteriall Church, is a company of Profeſſors governed by one Prysbytery, who for the exerciſe of Religion meete in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe places, or who have moe Paſtors then one.</p>
            <p>A Synod, is a convention of Paſtors and Elders ſent and depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from diverſe Presbyteries, meeting either ordinarily or upon occaſion for the affaires that are common to thoſe that ſent them.</p>
            <p>Eccleſiaſticke Juriſdiction, is a right and power, not onely by advice to counſell and direct, but by authority given of God, to injoyne and to performe according to the rule of Scriptures theſe things which concern the Ordination of Miniſters, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of Eccleſiaſticall Cauſes, the determination of Doctrines, the inflicting of Cenſures, &amp;c. The ſignification of theſe words being preſuppoſed, the ſtate of the Queſtion, or minde of the parties, can not be obſcure.</p>
            <p>The firſt Argumen for the truth I caſt into this Forme.<note place="margin">That ſingle Congregations are not Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; firſt, from the 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.14. becauſe they have not the right of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> Every <hi>Independent</hi> Church hath alwayes, and ordinarily, the right of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and power to lay hands on Paſtors. But, no ſingle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or Parochiall Church huth that right and power. <hi>Ergo</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No ſingle Congregation is an Independent Church. The <hi>Major</hi> is not queſtioned by the adverſe party, for they place the nature of their Independencie in a right and power intrinſecall and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall to every the leaſt Congregation of Ordaining, Depoſing, Excommunicating, and exerciſing all acts of Juriſdiction upon all their own Members, as well Paſtors as others. I ſaid alwayes, and ordinarily, for we queſtion not now what at ſome times in ſome extraordinary caſes may fall out to be lawfull and neceſſary, not onely to ſingle Congregations, but even to ſingle perſons: Alſo the power which our adverſe party diſputeth for, is not Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticke, which ſometimes on ſuppoſition of ſuch and ſuch caſes belongeth to a Church, but abſolute, which is inherent to every Congregation at all times.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> we prove thus: What is proper to a Presbytery the right thereof belongs not to any ſingle Congregation:<note place="margin">Ordination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Presbytery.</note> But Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and impoſition of hands is proper to a Presbytery, as appeareth from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4, 14. <hi>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by Propheſie with the laying on of the hands of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50687:112"/>
the Presbytery.</hi> The Apoſtle maketh that right proper to the Presbytery, which he will have to remaine in it, and not to be removed therefrom, notwithſtanding ſundry extraordinary caſes which might have excuſed the removeall of it. For <hi>Timothy</hi> was a Paſtor not altogether ordinary, and inferior, but an Evangeliſt; he had for the ground of his Office the extraordinary call of ſome Prophets when he was ſent out to Preach, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf laid hands upon him; notwithſtanding all this, that the due and juſt right of the Presbytery migh be proclamed, the Apoſtle marketh that the gift, office, and grace of Preaching the Goſpell was confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on <hi>Timothy</hi> by the laying on of the Presbyteries hands.</p>
            <p>For the proof of the laſt <hi>Maior,</hi> we neede not much deſcant on the Word Presbytery, and the ſenſe of it in the fore-named place, nor to refute the miſinterpretations which ſome make of it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they, who under the miſ-alledged authority of <hi>Calvin,</hi> would underſtand not the convention of any men, but the Office of a Presbyter, as if an Office or any accident could have had hands which might have beene laid on <hi>Timothies</hi> head. Paſſing therefore ſuch digreſſions, we prove the <hi>Maior</hi> in hand, thus: No ſingle Congregation is a Presbytery, nor any wayes neceſſarily hath a Presbytery within it ſelfe; yea if our adverſe party may be beleeved, no Congregation can have, at leaſt ſhould have in it ſelfe ſuch a Presbytery whereof <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh. <hi>Ergo.</hi> What is proper to a Presbytery, the right thereof may not be uſurped by any ſingle Congregation. Of the conſequence there is no doubt: the Antecedent hath three parts: onely the firſt is needefull to be proved; but for more abundant ſatisfaction, we ſhall aſſay to prove them all.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">No Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</note>The firſt, thus; A Presbytery is a member and part of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, according to our adverſe party (we love not to ſtrive for words, be it ſo that the meeting of a Miniſter and Elders go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning ſingle Congregations, which we call a Seſſion, as over-Sea it is called a Conſiſtory, may goe under the name of a Presbytery) <hi>Ergo.</hi> No Congregation is a Presbytery. The Conſequence is clear, for no member may be affirmed in the <hi>Nominative</hi> of its owne whole, eſpecially <hi>Heterogeneous</hi>: The body is not the head, the finger is not the hand; he doore, or the Window is not the houſe.</p>
            <p>Concerning the ſecond part of the Antecedent, that no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50687:112"/>
hath a Presbytery any wayes neceſſarily within it ſelfe,<note place="margin">No Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelfe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</note> this is cleare from the common practiſe of our adverſe party: very oft their Churches have neither Seſſion, nor Paſtor, nor Doctor, nor Elder at all; they make not any of the Officers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary parts of the Church either eſſentiall or integrall, without the which the Church may not ſubſiſt; yea, as the moſt learned, and moſt acute Mr. <hi>Rutherfoord</hi> hath well obſerved, <hi>pag.</hi> 272. their grounds take away the neceſſitie of any Miniſtry at all. Mr. <hi>Paget</hi> tells us that their chiefe and Mother-Church at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdame,</hi> through the miſ-government of their Paſtor, Mr. <hi>Can,</hi> hath wanted now for ſome yeares both a Doctor and Elders and a Seſſion, or Congregationall Presbytery.</p>
            <p>But the pith of the Argument is in the third part of the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, that no ſingle Congregation can have,<note place="margin">No ſingle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ought to have within it ſelfe <hi>Pauls</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</note> or (which is all one when we ſpeake of right and wrong) ought to have within it ſelfe <hi>Pauls</hi> Presbytery. This we prove. No ſingle Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may, or ought to have moe Paſtors than one. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Neither <hi>Pauls</hi> Presbytery. The Antecedent is the Doctrine of our adverſe party. The Conſequence leaneth on this Propoſition. In <hi>Pauls</hi> Presbytery are more Paſtors, which thus is proved: Where there are many layers on of hands on Paſtors, there are many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors: But, in <hi>Pauls</hi> Presbytery are many layers on of hands on Paſtors; for in the alledged place, not one, but many lay on their hands with <hi>Paul</hi> on <hi>Timothy.</hi> The laſt <hi>Maior</hi> leaneth on this ground, that onely Paſtors lay hands on Paſtors, ſo that many laying hands on Paſtors, muſt be many Paſtors, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in one Congregation, where there are not many, but one onely Paſtor, (yea none at all whenſoever by impoſition of hands a new Paſtor is to be ordained to that Congregation,) the act of Ordination can not be lawfully performed by the proper members of that Congregation.</p>
            <p>That which alone remaineth to be proved, that onely Paſtors lay hands upon Paſtors, is cleared by an Induction,<note place="margin">Onely Paſtors lay hands on Paſtors.</note> againſt which no inſtance can be brought. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Stirre up the gift of God that is in thee, by the putting on of my hands. Tit.</hi> 1.5. <hi>I left thee in Crete that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ordayne Elders. Acts.</hi> 13.1.3. <hi>Certaine Prophets and Teachers laide their hands upon them, and ſent them away. Acts.</hi> 14.23. <hi>They
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50687:113"/>
ordained them Elders in every Church.</hi> In all theſe places both the firſt Ordination, and <hi>poſterior</hi> Miſſion to preach the Goſpell, is the Act onely of thoſe who were Paſtors, neither elſe-where reade we that it was otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſecond Argument from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicke Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>erciſed full ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, the chiefe whereof, if not all, were Presbyteriall and not Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall.</note>The ſecond argument: Every Independent Church, exerciſeth ordinarily within it ſelfe, by its owne members all acts of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticke Juriſdiction. But, this no ſingle Congregation doth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily. <hi>Ergo,</hi> no ſingle Congregation is an Independent Church. Onely the <hi>Minor</hi> is dubious, which we prove thus; Every Church ordinarily exerciſing all acts of Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction is Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall: But, no ſingle Congregation is a Presbyteriall Church. <hi>Ergo.</hi> No ſingle Congregation exerciſeth ordinarily all acts of Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction. The <hi>Minor</hi> is cleare from the nature of a ſingle Congregation and Presbyteriall Church, as in the ſtateing of the Queſtion both were deſcribed. The <hi>Major</hi> is proved by a full Induction of all the Churches which in the New Teſtament we reade to have had the full exerciſe of all Eccleſiaſtick Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that all ſuch were Presbyteriall and not Congregationall; We prove it thus: A Church which cannot all convene in one houſe for the publicke Service of God, a Church which hath more Paſtours then one, is Presbyteriall, not Congregationall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grounds of our Adverſaryes. But all the Churches we reade of in the New Teſtament to have had the full exerciſe of all Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction, did meete in more places for divine worſhippe, and had more Paſtors then one. This we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate of the cheife, the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem, Samaria, Rome, Corinth, Epheſus, Antioch,</hi> neither can a reaſon be given why the reſt of the Scripturall Churches ſhould not be of the ſame kind.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Such was the Church at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>
               </note>Beginne with the Mother-Church of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> A company conſiſting of many thouſand perſons, and wanting a publicke houſe of meeting, could not convene into one place for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe: for this very day when Chriſtians have gotten moſt ſtately and ſpacious Palaces for Churches, hardly one thouſand can commodiouſly be together for ſolemne worſhippe; and if we looke to the practiſe of the Adverſaries, a few ſcores of men will be a large Church.</p>
            <p>As for the State of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Firſt, It is granted that for many yeares after the Apoſtles, neither it nor any other
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50687:113"/>
company of Chriſtians in any part of the world had a publicke place of meeting. Secondly, That this Church did conſiſt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand people, the following places prove <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.41. <hi>The ſame day were added unto them about three thouſand.</hi> Alſo chap. 4.5. <hi>The number of the men were five thouſand.</hi> And where there were ſo many men, if yee looke to the ordinary proportion, there were of women and children twice or thrice ſo many. Neither did that Church ſtand at the named thouſands, for <hi>Acts.</hi> 5.14. more multitudes both of men and women were added to the Church, and the number of the Diſciples was yet more multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, chap 6.1 Alſo that which we reade chap. 2.47. The Lord added to the Church daily, ſeemeth to have continued for a long time.</p>
            <p>To that which is replyed by ſome, that a great part of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med multitudes were ſtrangers, and not Inhabitants at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo no Members of that Church; We anſwer, that this is ſaid without warrant. That of the three thouſand mentioned in the third chapter, ſome part were ſtrangers, we will not deny to be likely; but that the moſt part were ſo, or that of all the thouſands named in the fourth, fifth, and ſixt, any one was a ſtranger, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved from the Text.</p>
            <p>As for that which they bring from the 2 chap. 44.<note place="margin">How the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth together.</note> 
               <hi>All who beleeved were together: as if the whole Church had alwayes come to one place for the publicke worſhippe.</hi> We ſay that it was ſimply impoſſible for three thouſand people, not to ſpeake of twenty thouſand and above, to meete in one private houſe, for they had none publicke, neither did they in the ſtreetes celebrate their Sacraments. So we are neceſſitated to take the Churches being together, one of three wayes: either for the conjunction of their minds, as the following words doe import (<hi>they continued with one accordin the Temple</hi>) or elſe their meeting together muſt be underſtood diſtributively in divers places, not collectively in one, as the words in hand will alſo beare where the celebration of the Lords Supper, and breaking of bread is ſaid to be not in any one houſe onely but <hi>from houſe to houſe.</hi> The Church meete thin a third way together when not all the members but the Officers with a part of the people convene in a Presbytery as appeareth from the 15 and 21 chapters.</p>

            <p>Our third Argument:<note place="margin">Our third ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> to the Synod at <hi>Jeruſalem, Act.</hi> 15.</note> No Synod hath authority to impoſe Decrees upon an <hi>Independent</hi> Church: But ſome Synods have authority to impoſe Decrees upon particular Churches, whether Presbyteriall or Congregationall. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Particular Churches, whether Presbyteriall or Congregationall are not Independent. The <hi>Maior</hi> is not controverted; our adverſe party acknowledgeth the lawfull uſe and manifold fruits of Synods: They grant it is the duty of every good man, and much more of every Church, and moſt of all of a Synod conſiſting of the Meſſengers of many Churches, to admoniſh, counſell, perſwade, and requeſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Curches to doe their duty: But, that any company on earth, even an Oecumenicke Synod, ſhould preſume to injoyne with
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50687:115"/>
authority the ſmalleſt Congregation, to leave the groſſeſt hereſies under the paine of any cenſure, they count it abſurd. Upon this ground, that every Congregation, how ſmall ſoever, how cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſoever, is an <hi>Independent</hi> body, and not ſubordinate to any ſociety on earth, how great, how pure, how holy ſoever.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> thus is proved: The Synod of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> impoſed with Authority, her Decrees upon the Church of <hi>Antioch. Ergo,</hi> Some Synod; and if you pleaſe to make it univerſall, every law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Synod may impoſe its Decrees upon particular Churches. The Antecedent is to be ſeene, <hi>Acte</hi> 15.20. <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us, to lay no further burden on you then theſe things neceſſary.</hi> The Conſequence is good, for <hi>Antioch</hi> was among the chiefe of the Apoſtolicke Churches; in it <hi>Barnabas, Paul,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophets inſpired of God were Preachers: If this Church was ſubject to the Authority of Synods, what Church may plead a freedome from the like ſubjection?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer to the <hi>Replies.</hi>
               </note>Many things are here replied, as uſually it hapneth when no ſolid anſwer can be brought: The chiefe heads of the Reply are three; Firſt, that the meeting at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was no Synod. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, What ever it was that it did injoyne nothing, authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to any other Churches. Thirdly, That other Synods may not pretend to the priviledges of that meeting ſince its Decrees were indited by the Holy Ghoſt, and ſtand now in the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non as a part of Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The meeting of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a true Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.</note>To the firſt, we ſay, that the meeting at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is either a true Synod, or elſe there is no paterne in all Scripture for Synods, even for counſell, or advice, or any other uſe. But, this were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient; for they acknowledge that Synods are lawfull meanes for many gracious ends in the Church: Now, to affirme that any Eccleſiaſticke meeting is lawfull, neceſſary, or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for gracious ends, whereof no patterne, no example can be found in Scripture, were dangerous.</p>
            <p>But beſide this argument, towards our adverſe party, we reaſon from the nature of the thing it ſelfe. A meeting conſiſting of the Deputies of many Presbyteriall Churches, is a true Synod; but, the convention at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 15. was ſuch a meeting. The <hi>Maior is</hi> the eſſence of a Synod; there are many accidentall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Synods; for according to the quantity and number of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50687:115"/>
the Churches who ſend their Commiſſioners, the Synod is ſmaller or greater, is Provinciall, Nationall, or Oecumenicke: according to occaſion, the Churches ſending Commiſſioners, are ſometime moe, ſometime fewer, ſometime neerer, ſometime fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off: alſo according to the commodity of place, and neceſſity of affaires, they come from one Church moe, and from others fewer: all theſe are but accidentalls, which change not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing. Unto the eſſence of a Synod; no more uſeth to be required then a meeting of Commiſſioners from moe Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Churches. The <hi>Minor</hi> is cleare; That the Church of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were moe Churches, no man doubts; that both were Presbyteriall, it was proved before, that from both theſe Presbyteriall Churches, Commiſſioners did ſit at that meeting, it is apparent from that oft cited, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. Yea, that from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> beſides <hi>Antioch,</hi> Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners did come to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> may appeare by conference of the 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> of the 15. <hi>chap.</hi> with <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. for that with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> Commiſſioners for the time from the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> others alſo did come, it is certaine: that thoſe others, at leaſt ſome of them, were Deputed from the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> it is like, becauſe the Synodick Epiſtle is directed expreſly no leſſe to thoſe than to this of <hi>Antioch</hi>; alſo thoſe, no leſſe than this, are ſaid to be troubled with the Queſtions which occaſioned that meeting. But to paſſe this conſideration, it is cleare that in the Convention at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were preſent, not onely the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of ſome few Presbyteriall Churches, but alſo they whom God had made conſtant Commiſſioners to all the Churches of the world, to wit, the Apoſtles; their preſence made all the Churches legally ſubject to the Decrees of that Synod, though they had no other but their grand and conſtant Commiſſioners to Voyce for them in that meeting.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Anſwer is clearely refuted from the 28. <hi>verſ.</hi> where the Decrees are not propoſed by way of meere advice,<note place="margin">It doth not onely adviſe but command. The Decrees of that Synod at their firſt making had onely Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> but are injoyned and impoſed as neceſſary burdens, with Authority, not onely of the Synod but of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Concerning the third, we ſay that the meerely Divine, and more than Eccleſiaſtick Authority of theſe Decrees in their firſt Formation, is not made good from this, that now they ſtand in
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50687:116"/>
holy Scripture, and are become a part of the Bible; for a world of Acts meerely indifferent, and which without doubt in their Originall had no more then Eccleſiaſticke Authority, are Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in Scripture. Was the Presbytery of <hi>Lyſtraes</hi> laying on of hands on <hi>Timothy</hi> any other then an act of Eccleſiaſtick Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? The Decree of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> for the inceſtuous mans Excommunication, or relaxation after Repentance, was it any more then an act of Juriſdiction meerely Eccleſiaſticke? <hi>Pauls</hi> circumciſion of <hi>Timothy,</hi> his Uow at <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> the cutting off his haire at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were free and indifferent actions: The nature of theſe things, and many moe of that kinde, is not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by their Regiſtring in the Booke of God. Neither alſo is the meerly Divine Authority of the Decrees at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> proved by this, that in their firſt framing they were grounded on cleare Scripture, and after proclamed in the name of the holy Ghoſt; for that is the condition of the lawfull Decrees of all gracious Synods. Did not of old the Fathers of <hi>Nice,</hi> and of late the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>Dort,</hi> through the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth with the Church, eſpecially with gracious Synods to the worlds end, pronounce from the holy Sctipture their Decrees of the Godhead of <hi>Chriſt</hi> againſt <hi>Arrius,</hi> and of the grace of God againſt <hi>Arminius</hi>: Shall we for this cauſe aſcribe to the Canons of <hi>Nice</hi> or <hi>Dort</hi> any greater authority then Eccleſiaſtick and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane? Howſoever, that the Apoſtles in framing the Canons at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did proceede in a way meerely Eccleſiaſtick, and farre different from that they uſed in dictating of Scripture, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing truths meerely Divine, appeareth from this; firſt, that theſe Canons were brought forth by much Diſputation and long diſcourſe, But, Divine Oracles without the proces of humane Ratiocinations are publiſhed from the immediate inditing of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>The Propheſie in old time came not by the will of man, but the holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Secondly, Oracles meerely Divine are publiſhed onely in the name of God, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord</hi>; but, theſe Canons are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed, not onely in the name of God, but alſo in the name of man, <hi>It ſeemeth good to the holy Ghoſt, and to us.</hi> Thirdly, The Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God are dictated to the Church by the Miniſtry only of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and men inſpired with an infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50687:116"/>
               <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2, 20. <hi>Being built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles.</hi> But, the Canons of that Synod, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. are declared to be the worke, not onely of the holy Ghoſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d the Apoſtles, but alſo of the Elders, and of all who Voyced to them. So it is cleare, that in the making of theſe Canons, the Apoſtles, as elſe-where oft, did come downe from the eminent. Chaire of their Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and extraordinary authority to the lower place of Ordinary Paſtors, that in their owne perſons they might give an example to ordinary Paſtors in what manner holy Synods might be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly celebrated to the worlds end. Had not this been their end, how eaſie had it beene either for <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Barnabas</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> without the toyleſome voyage of a long journey to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or for <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> or <hi>James,</hi> or any one of the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſuperfluous paines of any convention or diſputation, as infallible Apoſtles to have pronounced Divine and irrefragable Decrees of all the matters in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Our fourth argument. A Church ſubordinate is not Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but, a <hi>Parochial</hi> Church is ſubordinate to a Presbyteriall:<note place="margin">Our fourth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fewer to moe, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.</note> For a leſſer Church is ſubordinate to a greater, as a part to its whole wherein it is contained. Now a <hi>Parochiall</hi> Church is leſſer and the leaſt of all Churches; a Presbyteriall Church is greater. Of the quantity, that the one is leſſer, the other greater there is no doubt; but of the matter it ſelfe there is queſtion whether there be any ſuch thing as a Presbyteriall Church. Now this was proved before and hereafter alſo will be more cleare; the cheife plea here is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſecond major which we prove thus: A ſmaller number of the faithfull is ſubordinate by Chriſt to a greater number of the faithfull. But, a leſſer Church is a ſmaller number of the faithfull, and a greater Church is a greater number of the faithfull. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> is proved from the 18 of <hi>Math. v.</hi> 15.16.17.18. <hi>If thy Brother treſpaſſe againſt thee, &amp;c.</hi> Here the Lord in admonitions and Church cenſures inſtitutes a ſubordination, a gradation, a proceſſe from one to two or three, from two or three to moe. Underſtand thoſe moe not abſolutely and at randoun but in a ſociety bound togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the orderly ligaments of divine policy, ſuch as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Churches to be from the ſmalleſt to the greateſt till you come to the very Church univerſall.</p>
            <p>Here they diſtinguiſh the Major, granting that in this place a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50687:117"/>
ſubordination is appointed by Chriſt of fewer to moe within the ſame Church but not without it. We might oppugne the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diſtinction to the Minor, and prove that a Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Church is a greater number of the faithfull within not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſame Church; for a Congregationall Church may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly be compared with a Presbyteriall as a part with its whole; eſpecially if you compare the meeting of the Officers which rule the Pariſh with the Presbytery, theſe two are not extrinſecall the one to the other; for the Seſſions, or Conſiſtories, or Claſſis, are in the Presbytery which is compoſed of the Commiſſioners from Seſſions as of its owne and intrinſecall Members.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Chriſts ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is to be extended to the utmoſt bounds of the Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall.</note>But leaving this, we oppugne the ground of the diſtinction as it lyeth in the Major, breaking the one halfe of it upon the other. The ſubordination of fewer to moe in the forenamed place is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed ſay they within the ſame Church. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſay we, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſame Church, we meane with them without the ſame <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall</hi> Church: the conſequence we prove by three arguments. Firſt, there is a like reaſon for the ſubordination of fewer to moe without the ſame Church as within the ſame; for the cheife rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Lord ordaines us in admonitions to proceed from one to two or three, from two or three to a number ſitting as Judges in the Seſſion of one Congregation, is, becauſe in the admonitions of two or three, more authority, gravity and wiſedome are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed to be than in the admonitions of one alone: and that a Delinquent is ſtriken with more feare, ſhame, and reverence by the faces and mouthes of many who ſit as Judges in the name of the whole Congregation, than he would be by the mouth of two or three onely. Doeth not this power, virtue and weight of admonition increaſe with the number of admoniſhers, as well without as within the ſame Congregation? For as the admonition and cenſure of tenne ſitting in the name of one Congregation, hath greater weight then the admonition of two or three of that ſame Flocke who repreſent none but themſelves; ſo the admonition of thirty Miniſters and Elders repreſenting in a Presbytery fifteene Congregations, whoſe commiſſioners they are, ſhall have more weight then the admonition of ten which repreſent but one flocke: for it is according to reaſon, that thoſe thirty Members of the Presbytery ſhould exceede in wiſedome,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50687:117"/>
zeale, gravity, and other qualities which adde weight to an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, theſe ten which in a Seſſion repreſent one Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo farre as thoſe ten goe beyond the two or three ſeverall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that Congregation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, unleſſe in this place be eſtabliſhed a ſubordination of fewer to moe, as well without as within the ſame Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the remedy brought by Chriſt will be unable to cure the ill for which it was brought. The Lords meanes will be diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable and unequall to its end; but this were abſurd to ſay of the wiſeſt of all Phyſicians. The reaſon of the <hi>Major</hi> is this, Chriſt is preſcribing an helpe and cure for brotherly offences; now one may be offended by a brother as well without as within the ſame Congregation: and as well by many brethren as by one; yea, as well may we be offended by a whole Church as by one member thereof: Now, if after the minde of our adverſe party, the ſubordination of fewer to moe might not be extended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the bounds of one Congregation, the Lords medecine were not meete to cure very many ordinary and daily ſcandals; for what if a man be ſcandalized by the neighbour Church? To whom ſhall he complaine? When the Church offending is both the Judge and party, it is likely ſhe will miſregard the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints that are made to her of her ſelfe. What if a man be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized by his owne Church or by the moſt, or by the ſtrongeſt part of it? What if that Church to whom he complaineth, take part againſt Juſtice and reaſon with him upon whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines? It will be impoſſible to remedy innumerable offences which daily fall out among brethren, unleſſe appeales be granted, and the ſubordination eſtabliſhed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> be extended, not onely without the bounds of one Pariſh, but as farre and wide as the utmoſt limits of the Church univerſall: for upon this place is rightly grounded by the Ancients, the Authority of Synods even Oecumenick of all the Churches.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the ſubordination eſtabliſhed by <hi>Chriſt, Matth.</hi> 18. is ſo farre to be extended in the Chriſtian Church as it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi>; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> there alludeth to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> practiſe. But ſo it is, that in the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Church there was ever a ſubordination of fewer to moe, not onely within the ſame Synagogue, but within the whole Nation, and ſo within the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50687:118"/>
whole Church Univerſall: for all Synagogues everywhere in the world were under the great Councell at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> No doubt of the <hi>Minor</hi>; the <hi>Major</hi> is builded upon this ground, that what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath tranſlated from the Synagogue to the Church, eſpecially if it be of naturall equity, hath as great force now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians, as of old among the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Now, that the ſubordination of Synagogues to the great Councell is of naturall equity, it appeareth thus: A Synagogue was the loweſt Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticke Court, the Councell was the higheſt; but the ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the loweſt Court to the higheſt, is of naturall right; for Nature hath ever dictated to all Nations, as well in things civill as religious, a ſubordination of the loweſt to the higheſt.</p>

               <note place="margin">Our fifth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the evill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, which reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to follow Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily and naturally.</note>Our fifth Argument: That which taketh away all poſſibility of any effectuall remedy againſt Hereſie, Idolatry, Schiſme, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, or any other miſchiefe that wracks either one or moe Churches; is not of God: for God is the Author and conſerver of truth, purity, union, order, liberty, and of all vertue; God of his goodneſſe and wiſedome hath provided for all and every one of his Churches meanes and remedies, which if carefully made uſe of, are ſufficient to hinder the firſt ariſing of Hereſie, Schiſme, or any other evill: and when they are riſen to beate them downe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and aboliſh them: ſo that what ever cheriſheth theſe miſchiefes, and is a powerfull inſtrument to preſerve them ſafe, that none with any power, with any authority, for any purpoſe, may get them touched, that muſt be much oppoſite to the Spirit of God, and good of the Church: But, ſuch is Independencie, as both reaſon and experience will prove. Behold firſt ſeverall Churches; Suppoſe, which too oft hath falne out, that the Paſtor become a pernicious Hereticke; let him beginne with the venome of his Doctrine to poyſon the hearts of his people, what ſhall be the remedie? Independency bindes the hands of Presbyteries and Synods. Paſtors of Neighbouring Congregations, have no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to binde, or expell that ravenous wolfe: in the deſtroyed flock there is no Paſtor, but the wolfe himſelfe. Be it ſo that the people in their judgement of diſcretion perceive well enough the wickedneſſe of the falſe doctrin whereby they are corrupted; yet the office, charge, and authority to cure their Paſtors diſeaſe, lyeth not on them. <hi>The Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50687:118"/>
Prophets</hi>: the Paſtor is not to be proceeded againſt with cenſure by the people of his flocke; for ſo the order which God hath eſtabliſhed in his Church, ſhould be inverted, if they whom hee hath commanded to obey ſhould rule: and they whom he hath ſet above and over the flocke, ſhould be under it. Further, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Paſtor to be moſt gracious, what if the flocke, or the greater part of the flocke become ſo wicked as to abuſe their Paſtor, or to abuſe the moſt godly of the Congregation? What if a wicked ſpirit of Hereſie, Schiſme, or Tyranny, ſet the moſt part of the flocke againſt God, againſt their gracious Paſtor, and the godly of the flocke, what ſhall be done in this pitifull, and very poſſible, yea, oft contingent caſe? <hi>Ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pendency</hi> cloſeth the doore of the troubled Congregation, that no man may goe out to cry for any powerfull helpe to neighbours, though their kindled houſe ſhould burne them all to death; within there is no remedy; for all moſt goe there by the number of voyces, and the moſt part oppreſſeth the beſt, the moſt wicked go on againſt the Councells, the intreaties, the prayers of the reſt, and ceaſe not till they have either corrupted or caſt out their Paſtor, Elders, and all of their fellow-members who are conſtant in goodneſſe, that ſo their wickedneſſe without controle may domineere in the whole ſubdued Congregation. So long as Independency ſtandeth, no effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall authoratative or powerfull helpe can poſſibly be found for the preſervation of any ſingle Congregation againſt ruine and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſubverſion.</p>
            <p>Further, Independency hazards the being of all Churches as well as of every one. For who ſhall hinder any member of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Congregation to infect all the neighbour Churches with the poyſon of his doctrine and manners? If a ramping Lyon, a viperous Serpent, a crafty Fox ſhould goe and devour all the Lambs of the neighbour flocks; Independency doth hinder any order to be taken with that limbe of Sathan, no ſword of cenſure can be drawne againſt him, he muſt be referred abſolutely to his owne Congregation; other Churches may intreate, adviſe, and pray him not to make havoke of them: but ſhould he trouble, infect, and deſtroy twenty, an hundred, a thouſand neighbour Congregations, no Eccleſiaſtick cenſure may paſſe upon him but by his owne Church: and when complaints of him come to his
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50687:119"/>
owne Church, his miſdeedes there are excuſed, defended, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; his Hereſies are proclamed ſound doctrine his devouring of ſoules is declared to be zeale and painfulneſſe to win ſoules to CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Our Argument is backed by experience, as well as by reaſon; The firſt Independent Church we reade of, was that company which Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> brought over from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Middleborough</hi>; how long did it ſtand before it was deſtroyed by Independency? when once Anabaptiſtick novelties, and other miſchiefes fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, there was no remedy to prevent the companies diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. When Mr. <hi>Barrow</hi> and his fellowes, aſſaied at <hi>London</hi> to erect their Congregation, the ſucceſſe was no better; their Ship ſcarce well ſet out was quickly ſplitupon the Rocks, was ſoone diſſipate and vaniſhed. When <hi>Johnſtoun</hi> &amp; <hi>Ainſworth</hi> would make the third aſſay, and try if that tree which neither in <hi>England</hi> nor <hi>Zealand</hi> could take roote, might thrive in <hi>Holland</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where plants of all ſorts are ſo cheriſhed, that few of the moſt maligne qualite doe miſcarry; yet ſo ſingular a malignity is innate in that ſeede of Independency, that in that very ground, where all weedes grow ranke, it did wither: within a few yeares new Schiſmes burſt that ſmall Church aſunder: <hi>Johnſtoun</hi> with his halfe, and <hi>Ainſworth</hi> with his made ſeverall Congregations, neither whereof did long continnue without further ruptures; Behold who pleaſe, with an obſervant Eye theſe Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations which have embraced Independency, they ſhall finde that never any Churches in ſo ſhort a time have beene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced with ſo many, ſo unreaſonable, and ſo irreconcileable Schiſmes.</p>

Firſt: To whom Chriſt hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the right of excommunication the greateſt of all cenſures, they in all other acts of Juriſdiction, and in all acts of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick diſcipline, are Independent: But Chriſt hath given the right of excommunication to every Congregation, and to theſe alone. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> They prove the <hi>Minor.</hi> Unto the Church Chriſt hath given the right of excommunication <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>Goe tell the Church, if he heare not the Church, let him be to thee as an Ethnicke</hi>: But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Congregation, and it onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the Church, becauſe in the whole Scripture the word <hi>Church</hi> where ever it is not taken for the Church univerſall, or inviſible, is ever underſtood of a ſingle Congregation, which in one place with one Paſtor ſerveth God. Anſwer. Paſſing the <hi>Majors,</hi> we deny the <hi>Minors,</hi> and affirme that no where in Scripture the word <hi>Church</hi> may be expounded of their Independent Congregation, and leaſt of all in the alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged place; If we will adviſe either with the old or late Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or with the beſt and moſt learned of the Adverſaryes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who affirme with us that by the Church <hi>Math.</hi> 18. no Congregation can be underſtood, unleſſe we would bring in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians moſt groſſe anarchy, except we would ſet down on the Judgment ſeates of the Church every member of the Congregation, men, women, young, old, the meaneſt and weakeſt part of the people to decide by the number, not the weight of their voyces the greateſt cauſes of the Church, to determine fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally of the excommunication of Paſtors, of the nature of haereſie and all doctrine, and that with a decree irrevocable from which there may be no appeal, no not to an <hi>Oecumenicke</hi> Synod. Wherfore beſide the reſt of the Interpreters a great part of the Adverſaries by the Church in this place underſtand no whole Congregation, nor the moſt part of any Congregation, but a ſelect number there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Senate or Officers who cognoſe and diſcerne according to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:50687:120"/>This is enough for anſwer to the argument: but if further it be inquired, the Senate of which Church is pointed at in this place, whether of a <hi>Parochiall</hi> Church, or Presbyteriall, or Nationall, or <hi>Oecumenicke,</hi> or of all theſe. Anſ. It ſeemeth that the Senate of all the Churches muſt here be underſtood, and eſpecially of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Church, at leaſt not of a <hi>Parochiall</hi> onely and independent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as our Adverſaries would have it. By no meanes will we have the Seſſion of a Pariſh prejudged, and are well content that the authority of <hi>Parochiall</hi> Seſſions to handle their own proper af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires ſhould be grounded upon this place; onely we deny that from this place a Church-Seſſion hath any warrant to take the cognition of things common to it ſelfe with the Neighbouring Congregations, or yet to governe her proper affaires abſolutely and independently ſo that none may attempt to correct her when ſhe erreth, or by cenſure to put her in order when ſhe beginneth by hereſie ſchiſme and tyranny to corrupt her ſelfe and others.</p>
            <p>That in this place principally the Senate of a Presbyteriall Church is underſtood, is cleare; for of ſuch a Church Chriſt here ſpeaketh, as were the Churches at <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, Corinth,</hi> and others in the new Teſtament which we proved before to have bin presbyteriall. The Senate of ſuch Churches attending on govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and diſcipline, is here called the Church, as elſewhere, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.20. <hi>It ſeemed good to the Apoſtles, Elders and whole Church:</hi> The Church met to cognoſce on the queſtions from <hi>Antioch,</hi> cannot be underſtood of all the thouſand Chriſtians at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; it muſt then be taken of the Presbytery to which the cognition of ſuch queſtions doth belong. In the fourth verſe of the ſame chapter, <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid to <hi>be received of the Church,</hi> the word may well be expounded not of the whole Body, but of a ſelect number there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; even the Presbytery; as in the 21 he is ſaid to be received of the Apoſtles and Elders, before the multitude had met together.</p>
            <p>Only obſerve that however we affirme the Senate of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Church cheifely here to be eſtabliſhed, yet we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not this in a way independent from provinciall, Nationall, or <hi>Oecumenick</hi> Synods; for all theſe meetings in their owne place and order are alſo grounded on this paſſage, as before hath beene declared.</p>
            <p>Their ſecond Objection: The practiſe of the Church of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50687:121"/>
               <hi>Corinth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſecond Objection is taken from the practiſe of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous man.</note> approved by the Apoſtles is the due right of every Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall Church and ſingle Congregation: But, the cenſure of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication was the practiſe of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>Do we not judge them that are within? therefore put away from you that wicked perſon.</hi> This judgement is authoritative, and this putting away is the cenſure of Excommunication, cutting off from the body of Chriſt, which cenſure is here committed unto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> being gathered together in one, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. and ſo to them all, and every one of them: for to them all the Epiſtle is written, and not to the Presbytery onely. Anſw. The <hi>Maior</hi> muſt be denied for two cauſes; Firſt, The practiſe of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was grounded not onely upon the expreſſe command of the Apoſtle, but alſo on the ſingular preſence of the Apoſtles Spirit and authority with them in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the ſentence of Excommunication againſt that inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>I as preſent in Spirit have judged already.</hi> This ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar priviledge of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is not a ground of common right to every Church who wants the authority of the Apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe command, and ſingular preſence. Secondly, we may not argue from the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to every Congregation; for it is proved before, that the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was not Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, but Presbyteriall, conſiſting of ſo many as could not meete commodiouſly in one private roome; alſo it had within it ſelfe a Colledge or Senate of many Paſtors, Elders, and Prophets; to ſuch a Church we grant willingly the exerciſe of all acts, both of Ordination and Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> alſo cannot be admitted but with a double di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; the act of Excommunication is given to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> not according to its whole, but acording to the ſelect part, to wit the Presbytery thereof. It maketh nothing againſt this, that the Epiſtle is written to the whole Church; for what is written to the whole Church indefinitely, muſt be applied accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the matter and purpoſe, ſometime onely to the Paſtors excluding the people: ſometime onely to the people, excluding the Paſtors: ſometimes to both together, to Paſtors, and Flock. The firſt Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>Every one of you ſaith, I am of Paul, I am of Apollos, and I of Cephas</hi>; this cannot be taken of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, but of the people following Schiſmatically ſome one, ſome
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50687:121"/>
another of the Paſtors. Likewiſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Let a man ſo count of us as of the Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> muſt be taken of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. (<hi>Now if any man build on this foundation gold, ſilver, precious ſtones</hi>) is to be underſtood of the Paſtors, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Alſo it is required in Stewards that a man be found faithfull</hi>; but the moſt of the other places are to be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of both. Now that the preceding paſſages concerning the Church-cenſures, are not true of the whole Congregation, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares; for beſide the abſurdity of confuſion &amp; Anarchy, it would follow that very women have right judicially to Depoſe, and Excommunicate by their voyces their Paſtors, which the very Adverſaries profeſſe to reject as abſurd, albeit not congruouſly to their Tenets; for it is not reaſonable that the right which from theſe places they aſcribe to every member of the Church, ſhould be taken away from women, upon this onely reaſon that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11. a commandement is given to the <hi>women not to teach, but in ſilence to learne</hi>; for as the brethren of our Adverſaries, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> have marked, that place taketh away from women the publicke charge of Preaching, but not of ſpeaking in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or giving their voyce in Church-judicatories. Surely, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where abſolute ſilence in Church-judicatories is injoyned to women, we truly give the power of witneſſing, and of ſelfe-defence as well to women as to men in all Church-judicatories. However that the cenſure of the inceſtuous man was not inflicted by the whole Church, it appeares from the 2 <hi>Epiſt. Chap</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Sufficient to ſuch a man was the puniſhment which was inflicted of many.</hi> Who were theſe many but the Officers who were ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Church in the Lord?</p>
            <p>Another diſtinction alſo would be marked, that whatſoever right we aſcribe to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> whether according to its whole, or according to any of its parts, whether we take it for a Presbyteriall or a Parochiall Church, all that right is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not abſolutely, nor independently, which here is the onely queſtion. For the Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> had no greater priviledges then the Church of <hi>Antioch.</hi> Now that in a dubious and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted caſe, and in a common cauſe the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> was ſubordinate unto a Synod, it was before proved.</p>
            <p>Their third objection. That which the Holy Ghoſt gives unto
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50687:122"/>
the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The third Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection from the example of the ſeven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </note> muſt be the right of every ſingle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.

            <p>Anſw. Both the Propoſitions are vitious: The <hi>Major</hi> becauſe the Churches in <hi>Aſia</hi> were Presbyteriall, not Congregationall. This we proved of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and we know no reaſon why the reſt ſhould not be of that ſame condition.

The <hi>Minor</hi> alſo may not be granted; for that which the Text aſcribeth to the Angell, may not by and by be applyed to every Member of the Church.

Beſide, there is no conſequence from one act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe to the whole right of Eccleſiaſticke government even in every caſe; for a common cauſe and an appearance of errour and many other things, will inforce a neceſſity of ſubordination.</p>

Since the dayes of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> unto our time, it went under no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notion, and was imbraced by no Chriſtian we heare of, till ſome of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> did draw it out of its grave: for a long time after its reſurrection, it was by all Proteſtants contemned; onely <hi>Alſtedius,</hi> after his long abode in <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> began in his laſt times to fall into likeing with ſome parts thereof, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome paſſages of <hi>Piſcator</hi> for his incouragement. <hi>Alſtedius</hi> Heterodox Writings were not long abroad when Mr. <hi>Meade</hi> at <hi>Cambridge</hi> was gained to follow him: yet both theſe Divines were farre from dreaming of any perſonall raigne of Chriſt upon earth: onely Mr. <hi>Archer,</hi> and his Colleague, <hi>T.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The minde of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Chiliaſts.</note>Our Brethrens mind in this point, as I conceive, they have Printed; is this, That in the yeare 1650. or at furtheſt, 1695. Chriſt in his humane nature and preſent glory is to come from heaven unto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where he was crucified; at that time the heaven and earth, and all the workes therein, are to be burnt and purged by that fire of conflagration, mentioned by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſt. Chap.</hi> 3. At the ſame time all the Martys, and many of the Saints both of the Old and New Teſtament are to riſe in their bodies; The <hi>Jewes</hi> from all the places where now they are
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50687:124"/>
ſcattered ſhall returne to <hi>Canaan</hi> and build <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>: in that City Chriſt is to raigne for a full thouſand yeares; from thence he is to goe out in perſon to ſubdue with great bloodſhed by his owne hand all the diſobedient Nations; when all are conquered, except ſome few lurking in corners, then the Church of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall live without any diſturbance from any enemy, either without or within; all Chriſtians then ſhall live without ſinne, without the Word and Sacraments or any Ordinance: they ſhall paſſe theſe thouſand yeares in great worldly delights, beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many children, eating and drinking and injoying all the lawfull pleaſures which all the creatures then redeemed from their ancient ſlavery can afford. In this Earthly happineſſe ſhall the Church continue till the end of the thouſand yeares when the relicks of the Turkiſh and Heatheniſh Nations ſhall beſiege the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and Chriſt with fire from heaven ſhall deſtroy them: afterwards followeth the ſecond reſurrection of all the dead good and bad for the laſt judgement. Thus farre the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Preach and Print: further <hi>Cerinthus</hi> himſelfe went not, if you will except the Polygamy and ſacrifices of the old <hi>Iſraelits.</hi> What truth may be in theſe things, let the arguments which are uſually brought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>contra,</hi> declare.</p>
            <p>Againſt the mentioned Tenet I reaſon, firſt,<note place="margin">Our firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the Chiliaſts is, that Chriſt from his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the laſt judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides in the heaven.</note> He that remaines in the heaven unto the laſt Judgement comes not downe to the earth a thouſand yeare before the laſt Judgement. But, Chriſt remaines in the heaven unto the laſt Judgement. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior</hi> is unqueſtionable; the <hi>Minor</hi> is proved from the Article of our Creede. <hi>From that place he ſhall come to judge the quicke and the dead,</hi> importing that Chriſt from the time of his aſcention doth abide in the heaven at the right hand of the Father, and commeth not downe from that place to the earth till he deſcend in the laſt day to judge the quicke and the dead.</p>
            <p>I know they are not moved with the authority of any humane Creed, yet they would doe well to ſpeake out their minde of this Article, as they doe of ſome others. Surely to ſay that Chriſt ſhall come from heaven in his humane nature, to abide a thouſand yeares on the earth, and then to returne againe to the heaven, that he may diſcend the third time from the heaven in the laſt day to judge the quicke and the dead, is ſo evident a perverting of that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50687:125"/>
Article that Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> their great Doctor and leader in this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, to eſchew it, falleth into a very ſtrange and ſingular conceit, wherein I doubt whether any of the Independents will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to follow him; with all other Orthodox Divines he makes but two commings of Chriſt from the heaven to the earth; the firſt at the Incarnation, the ſecond at the day of Judgement: but this day of Judgement he extends to a round thouſand yeares, and this day to him is the onely time of the Millenary raigne. We neede not refute this fancie; for the beſt arguments which are brought for it, are ſome teſtimonies from the Talmudicke Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, and theſe, as I conceive, underſtood againſt the true ſence of the Authors. The ſtreame of Scripture and Reaſon runne more againſt this conceit then any other part of Chiliaſme, as the moſt of the Chiliaſts themſelves will confeſſe.</p>
            <p>However, what I brought from the Apoſtolick Creed of Chriſt his aboade in the heaven till the laſt day, I prove it from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Acts.</hi> 3 21. <hi>Whom the heavens muſt receive till the time of the reſtitution of all things which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all the holy Prophets ſince the world began.</hi> This place proveth clearely the aboade of Chriſts body in the heaven till the time of the reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things. So much our Brethren grant, but they deny our aſſumption that the time of the reſtitution of all things is the laſt day; this therefore we prove not by the Teſtimony of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, who unanimouſly bring this place as a maine ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts and Lutherans in the queſtions of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation and Ubiquity, but by three reaſons from the Text it ſelfe. Firſt, that time here is underſtood when all things that are ſpoken of by all the Prophets, are performed: But, all things ſpoken of by all the Prophets, are not performed till the laſt day. Maſter <hi>Burrowes</hi> alleadgeance that all the Prophets are frequent and large upon the Raigne of the 1000 yeares, but rare and ſparing upon the doctrine of the laſt Judgement and life eternall, might well have beene ſpared for the one halfe of it, and left to the <hi>Socino</hi>-Remonſtrants; but ſuppoſe it were all true, yet if any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have ſpoken any thing at all of the laſt Judgement, as the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> puts it out of queſtion even of <hi>Enoch</hi> it is cleare that the time of the performing of all things, which any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have ſpoken, cannot poſſibly exiſt before the laſt Judgement,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50687:125"/>
as we may ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. ver. 21. compared ver. 18.23. where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the creatures to their deſired liberty comes not before the redemption of our bodyes, and the glory to be revealed upon the whole Church at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the time here ſpoken of is when the <hi>Jewes</hi> to whom <hi>Peter</hi> did ſpeake, were to be refreſhed, by the Lords preſence; but this ſhall not be before the Generall reſurrection; for the <hi>Chili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſts</hi> doe maintaine that all the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhall not riſe, neither that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them to whom the Apoſtle did then ſpeake, ſhall be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the firſt reſurrection, unleſſe ſome of them who were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres; for the honour and Glory of this firſt reſurrection, the moſt of them make it ſo rare and ſingular a priviledge, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> himſelfe does not obtaine it but by a ſpeciall promiſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The time when God doth ſolemly before Men and Angels declare the abſolution and blotting out of the ſinnes of all his people, is not before the laſt day. But this is the time whereof the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes in the preſent place, as appeares by the 19 verſe; <hi>That your ſinnes may be blotted out, when the times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take but one other place for Chriſts aboade in the heaven till the laſt day. <hi>John</hi> 14.2.3. <hi>I goe to prepare a place for you, I will come againe and receive you to my ſelfe, that where I am there you may be.</hi> Behold Chriſt goes to the heaven and comes backe againe but once, for this very end, to take his Diſciples with him, not to abide with them upon the earth, but to place them in the Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Fathers Houſe in the Heavens, which he went to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for them, wherein all the time of his abſence he himſelfe was to remaine.</p>
            <p>A Second argument we take from Chriſts ſitting at the right hand of God.<note place="margin">Our ſecond reaſon is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on Chriſts ſitting at the right hand of God till the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> This errour how innocent ſoever it ſeeme to ſome, yet it perverts the true ſence of ſundry articles of our Creed, and forceth its followers to coyne new and falſe ſenſes to a great many Scriptures whereupon theſe articles were builded. This was the reaſon why neither <hi>Piſcator</hi> nor <hi>Alſtedius</hi> nor <hi>Mead</hi> when they laide too faſt hold upon ſome of the branches of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſme,</hi> yet the bulke and roote of that Tree, Chriſts comming downe to the earth in his humane nature a thouſand yeares before the laſt day, they durſt never touch: but our Brethren have more venturous Spirits, they ſee much further then their Maſters,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50687:126"/>
they ſcruple nothing to make all theſe things popular and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheticke doctrine. The reaſon I ſpoke of, is this, Chriſt ſits at the right hand of God till the laſt day. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he comes not to reigne on earth a thouſand yeares before the laſt day. The conſequence is builded upon this Propoſition, Chriſts ſitting at the right hand of the Father is not in earth but in heaven, which many Scriptures prove. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.20. <hi>He ſet him at his own right hand in heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>He ſat downe at the right hand of the Majeſty on high. Heb.</hi> 8.1. <hi>He is ſet on the right hand of the Throne of the Maieſty in the heavens.</hi> The antecedent I prove thus, <hi>He ſits at the right hand of God till all his enemies be made his footſtoole.</hi> So ſpeakes the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. But all his enemies are not made his footſtoole till the laſt day: for till then, <hi>Satan, Sinne, Death,</hi> and all wicked men are not fully deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Our third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead; the godly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly doe all riſe together at the laſt day.</note>Our third argument we take from the reſurrection of the dead. All the Godly at Chriſts comming from heaven doe riſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to a Heavenly Glory. <hi>Ergo,</hi> none of them doe ariſe to a Temporall glory of a thouſand yeares upon earth. The antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſee in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them that looke for him ſhall he appeare the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation.</hi> Chriſt hath but two times of comming to the earth, firſt in weakenes to die upon the Croſſe; The ſecond time in glory to give eternall Salvation without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to all beleevers who looke for his comming.</p>
            <p>Alſo 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Them which ſleepe in Jeſus, will he bring with him. The Lord himſelfe ſhall diſcend from heaven with a ſhout, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt; then we which are alive ſhall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meete the Lord in the ayre, and ſo ſhall we be ever with the Lord.</hi> The ground of comfort which the Apoſtle propounds to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> for all their dead, as well Martyrs as others, was their reſurrection, not before the Lords comming with the voice of the <hi>Archangell,</hi> but at that time when all the dead in Chriſt without exception do ariſe, and non of them abide on the earth, but all are caught up in the ayre to meete the Lord, and all remaine with him eternally thereafter without any ſeparation.</p>
            <p>See alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>In Christ ſhall all be made alive, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man in his owne order; Chriſt the firſt fruits, afterward they that are Chriſts at his comming; then commeth the end when he ſhall have delivered up the Kingdome to God.</hi> The Apoſtle here ſpeakes
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50687:126"/>
of the Reſurrection of all, and particularly of the Martyrs ſuch as with the Apoſtle <hi>dyed daily and every houre were in jepoardy and fought with Beaſts</hi>; although he profeſſes to diſtinguiſh the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of order that might be in this great worke of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet he affirmes that theſe who are Chriſts, do not ariſe till his comming; and his comming he makes not to be till the laſt day when Chriſt renders up his <hi>Oeconomicke</hi> Kingdome, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed all his enemies, eſpecially death, &amp; fully perfected the work of his mediation. This Reſurrection is after the ſound of the laſt Trumpet, when all the godly riſe, and are changed, and put on incorruption and immortallity, when death is ſwallowed up into victory, and the godly inherit the Kingdome of God; theſe things are done at the laſt day, not a thouſand yeares before it, as <hi>John</hi> 6.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Our fift reaſon is taken from the nature of the Church.</note>We take our fifth argument from the nature of the Church; Scripture makes the Church of God ſo long as it is upon the earth to be a mixed multitude, of Elect and Reprobate, good and bad, a company of people under the croſſe and ſubject to vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temptations, a company that hath neede of the Word and Sacraments, of Prayer and Ordinances, that hath Chriſt a High Prieſt within the vaile of heaven interceding for them.

            </p>
            <p>Thus the Scripture deſcribes the condition of the Church on earth; but the Doctrine in hand alters much the nature of it for a great part of its time here: for of the 2650 yeares which they give to the Church from the comming of Chriſt to the laſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they make her to conſiſt for a whole thouſand yeares only of godly perſons, without the mixture of any one wicked; and all the millions who are borne in the Church in that large time, they are free from their birth to their death of all croſſes, of all ſorrowes, of all temptations, and as it ſeemes of all ſinne alſo; for that is the time of the reſtitution of all things when old things are paſt and all things become new: They make them to have neede neither of Word nor Sacraments, or any Church-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, neither of Chriſts Interceſſion in the heavens with the Father; for they have him among them in the earth, and they are freed from all ſinne; and all miſery.</p>
            <p>A ſixth Argument.<note place="margin">A Sixt reaſon from the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the time of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> Scripture makes the time of Chriſts ſecond comming to be ſecret and hid, not onely to men, but to the very Angels, and to Chriſt himſelfe as he is man, <hi>Marke</hi> 13.32. <hi>But of that day and that houre knoweth no man, no not the Angels which are in heaven, neither the Sonne, but the Father.</hi> But this Doctrine makes
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50687:128"/>
that day open, and tells the time of it punctually; for they make the thouſand yeares to begin with the 1650 yeare, or elſe with the 1695. and the day of Judgement to be at the end of the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares; ſo if their count doe hold, every child in the Church might tell us that Chriſt will come to Judgement in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 2651 yeare, or at fartheſt in the beginning of the 2696.</p>
            <p>A ſeventh Argument. The reward of the Martyrs is eternall life in the heavens,<note place="margin">A Seventh, from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall reward of the Martyrs.</note> promiſed to them at Chriſts comming to judge the juſt and the unjuſt. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is not temporall in an earthly Kingdome of a thouſand yeares. The <hi>Antecedent</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Bleſſed are they that are perſecuted for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, for theirs is the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.6. <hi>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is neare; I have fought a good fight; I have finiſhed my courſe; henceforth is laid up for me a crowne of righteouſneſſe, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give at that day, &amp;c.</hi> The reward that <hi>Paul</hi> expects after his Martyrdome, is the Crowne which Chriſt at the laſt day gives to all that waite for his comming at that time when he takes ven-geance on the wicked, as we have it 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8, 9.10. where the reſt and retribution of the Martyrs, of <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe and thoſe who at that time were troubled for the Goſpell, is ſaid to be at Chriſts <hi>coming to take vengeance in flaming fire on all the wicked, and to be glorified in all the Saints, and admired in all them that beleeve</hi> which without all doubt is not before the laſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if it were otherwiſe, the Martyres would be at a loſſe; for inſtead of a reward, a puniſhment ſhould be put upon them, their condition ſhould be made worſe then that of the common Saints, who during the time of the thouſand yeares remaine in the heavens among the Angels, beholding and injoying the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, while the ſoules of the Martyrs are brought downe to the earth, and returne to a body, not like to the glorious body of Chriſt, nor unto theſe incorruptible, immortall, Spirituall bodies, which yet are promiſed to the leaſt of the faithfull at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. but unto ſuch a body that eates, drinkes, ſleepes, fights, delights in fleſhly pleaſures, and converſes with beaſts and earthly creatures, in ſuch a Paradiſe whereof the Turkiſh Alcorane and the Jewiſh Talmud doth ſpeake much; but to a godly ſoule is very taſteles, and to a ſoule that hath beene in

heaven, or to one that injoyes the preſence of Chriſt, is exceeding burthenſome and bitter.</p>
            <p>An eight reaſon. The opinion of the <hi>Millenaries</hi> ſuppoſeth the reſtauration of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Kingdome after their deſtruction by the <hi>Romans.</hi> But, Scripture denies this,<note place="margin">An eight rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an earthly <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> brings backe the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſht figures of the Lgw.</note>

When thy Siſter Sodome and her daughters ſhall returne to their former eſtates, and Samaria and her daughters ſhall returne to their former eſtate, then thou and thy daughters ſhall returne to your former eſtate.</hi> The <hi>Jewes</hi> are never to be reſtored to their ancient outward eſtate, much leſſe to a greater and more glorious Kingdome. <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was to be rebuilded, and the ſpirituall glory of the ſecond Temple was to be greater then the firſt; and in the end of this ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the reſtitution of the <hi>Iewes</hi> after the Babyloniſh captivity, by the vertue of the new covenant is promiſed; but the outward eſtate of that people was never to be reſtored to its ancient luſtre more then <hi>Samaria,</hi> or <hi>Sodome,</hi> as <hi>Amos</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Samaria, chap.</hi> 5.2. <hi>The Virgine of Iſrael is fallen, ſhe ſhall no more riſe. And</hi> Iſaiah <hi>of Jeruſalem, The tranſgreſſion thereof ſhall be heavy, and it ſhall fall and not riſe againe,</hi> according to the Propheſie of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Iudah till Shiloh come.</hi> Importing that the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhould ever have ſome outward viſible rule till the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh; but thereafter the Scepter and power of the Church ſhould be onely ſpirituall in the hand of Shiloh the Meſſias; he was the ſubſtance and the body of all theſe Types, the reſtauration of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and the erecting of a new Monarchy in <hi>Iudah,</hi> for the <hi>Iewes,</hi> were to bring backe the old evaniſhed ſhadowes contrary to the doctrine and nature of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>One other reaſon. The <hi>Millenaries</hi> lay it for a ground,<note place="margin">A ninth, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is not aboliſht till the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed and fully aboliſhed before their thouſand yeares beginne; but Scripture makes <hi>Antichriſt</hi> to continue to the day of Judgement. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Then ſhall that wicked man be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the Spirit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſſe of his comming.</hi> The brightneſſe of Chriſts comming is not before the laſt day, as before is proved.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, they who from this place reaſon againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Tenet, doe differ all of them among themſelves in ſundry materiall concluſions, the old Chiliaſts from the late, and the late one from another <hi>Alſtedius, Mead, Archer, Goodwin, Burrowes, Matton</hi>; every one of them have their proper conceits wherein they differ from the reſt, as will be found by any who compare their Writings.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In all this Chapter there is not one ſyllable to prove <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Chriſts being upon the earth, but that one word of the Saints reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with Chriſt. Suppoſe the Text had expreſſed that they who
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50687:129"/>
did reigne with Chriſt, had beene upon earth themſelves; this would not prove that Chriſt (becauſe they are ſaid to raigne with him) was upon earth with them; for <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>If children, then joynt-heires with Chriſt, if ſo be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that we ſuffer with him that we may be alſo glorified together.</hi> There is here in one verſe three paralell phraſes with that in hand, <hi>Heires with Chriſt, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with Chriſt, Glorified with Chriſt</hi>; and a fourth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Who hath bleſſed us with all Spirituall bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt</hi>; Will it hence follow that Chriſts humane nature was then upon earth with them who ſuffered with him, were heires with him, were bleſſed in him in heavenly places with all ſpirituall graces, and were to be glorified with him? if none of theſe foure phraſes imply a perſonall preſence of Chriſt upon earth with men, much leſſe will the place controverted doe it; for they ſpeak expreſly of men living upon the earth, but it ſpeakes as expreſly of the ſoules of men that were in the heaven; the ſame that are mentioned, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.9. <hi>I ſaw under the Altar the ſoules of them that were ſlaine for the Word of God.</hi> This place then is ſo farre from proving Chriſts perſonall preſence upon earth, that it imports the contrary, both becauſe they that are ſaid to reigne with him, were not upon the earth, but under the Altar in heaven; and alſo becauſe in <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. Chriſts Throne whereupon he judges the quicke and the dead, is mentioned after the raigne of theſe thouſand yeares. Now we have proved from many Scriptures that Chriſt remaines in the heavens till he come downe in the laſt day to ſit upon that Throne.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We deny that there is any thing in this place which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> imports a bodily reſurrection. They can produce no ſcripture where the firſt reſurrection is ever applyed to the body; there be ſundry places to prove a ſpirituall reſurrection of the ſoule, from the death and grave of ſinne, of errors and corruptions, before the laſt reſurrection of the body, <hi>Coll.</hi> 2.12. <hi>You are riſen with him through fayth</hi>: alſo 3.1. <hi>If then ye be riſen with Chriſt &amp;c.</hi> But a firſt reſurrection of the body no ſcripture intimates; for ſo there ſhould be not onely a firſt and ſecond, but a third reſurrection, as they tell us of a firſt, ſecond, and third comming of Chriſt to the earth. Further, the reſurrection here ſpoken of is attributed to the Soules of them that were beheaded; theſe are not capable
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50687:130"/>
of a bodily reſurrection, in propriety of ſpeech; and if to theſe ſoules, men at their owne pleaſure without any warrant from ſcripture, will aſcribe a body, they fall into a great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for their love to this imagined firſt reſurrection of the body, they overthrow both the heaven and the hell which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have beene beleeved; and make no ſcruple to create a new heaven and a new hell of their owne invention, to the dangerous ſcandall of all Chriſtians.</p>

As for hell, he tells us that all Chriſtians but the Independent his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, have beene in an error about it; he teaches that the hell whether the wicked now goes, is not that fire prepared for the Divell and his Angells, whether at the laſt Judgement they ſhall be ſent; but onely a place of priſon in the Low region of the aire, or in ſome part of the Sea, where the ſoules of the wicked are kept till the day of Judgement; but at the day of Judgement, he tells us of a ſecond hell, very large, and farre higher then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent heaven of the Saints, the whole body of the foure Elements, all the heavens of the Planets and fixed Starres, and what ever elſe is below the third heavens the habitation of God; he turnes it all into the firſt <hi>Chaos,</hi> and makes all that confuſed body without any diſtinction, to be hell. In all this, the man is ſo confident, as if there were nothing in theſe ſtrange novelties to be called in queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, We deny that in this place there is one ſyllable for any earthly Kingdome. They ſhall reigne with Chriſt, therefore they ſhall reigne with him upon earth: this is an addition to the Text. For, ſuppoſe the words did import a reigning upon earth, yet this would not inferre an earthly reigne, for the Kingdome of Chriſt is ſpirituall; like his Preiſthood, and theſe two are here conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ver. 6. <hi>They ſhall be Preiſts of God and of Chriſt, and ſhall reigne
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50687:130"/>
with him.</hi> Chriſtians on earth are Preiſts, but not to offer bodily ſacrifice; and while they are upon earth they are Kings, but not to rule mens outward eſtates: for if ſo, then there ſhould be all theſe thouſand yeares many more Kings then Subjects. Maſter <hi>Archer</hi> tells us confidently without any ſcruple, that not the Martyres alone, and ſome few priviledged Saints, as his Colleague <hi>T. G.</hi> would have it, but that all the godly without any exception, ſhall riſe and be Kings to rule and judge the Saints, who ſhall be borne in the thouſand yeares, Suppoſe it ſhould be no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all theſe who then ſhall be borne, to be excluded, while they live from all places of authority and power: yet would it not be ſome piece of diſorder to have more Kings to command then Subjects to obey, for I ſuppoſe that the godly of all by-gone ages ariſing together will be many more then the Saints in any one age of theſe thouſand yeares.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, we deny that a thouſand yeares in any propriety of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſpeech, can be applyed to Chriſts Perſonall reigne; for if we ſpeak of his reigne either in his nature or Perſon, it is eternall, and not to be meaſured by any yeares or time; and if we ſpeake of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall office as Mediatour, it muſt be much longer then a thouſand yeares; for although we ſhould cut off from his Monarchy all the yeares that are paſt ſince his birth to this day, which were much againſt the currant of ſcripture, ſince all this while he hath beene ſitting upon the Throne of his Father <hi>David,</hi> and ruling his Church as King and Monarch thereof; yet it were uncomely to confine the time of his reigne to come to a thouſand yeares; this were too ſmall an endurance for his Monarchy. Many humane Principalities, ſundry States and Empires which have beene and this day are in the world, might contend for a longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, for this cauſe it ſeemes to be that Maſter <hi>Archer</hi> the moſt reſolute Doctor in this queſtion that I have met with, makes the thouſand yeares we debate of, to be onely the evening of Chriſts Perſonall reigne; but to the morning therof wherein at leiſure all the proceſſes of the Laſt Judgement are gone through, he aſcribes a great many more yeares, readily another thouſand; and why not two or three or more thouſands? It is good to be wiſe to ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; arrogant curioſity and preſumptuous wantonneſſe of wit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s deteſtable, though in the beſt men.</p>

ſeducing the Nations, that he ſhould not be able as before the comming of Chriſt he was, to miſleade the Nations of the whole world to Idolatry, a free doore then being opened to the Goſpell in every Nation, for their converſion to the truth; but our new Doctors extend the place much further; they will have Satan bound up for a 1000 yeares, not onely from ſeducing Nations to Idolatry, but from tempting any perſon to any ſin; this is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to theſe Scriptures which makes every Saint in all ages, to fight not onely <hi>with fleſh and bloud, but with Principalities and Powers</hi>: which makes Satan always <hi>to goe about like a roaring Lion ſeeking whom he may devoure</hi>; and that ſo boldly that in the very preſence of Chriſt, he doth ſeeke to winnow the beſt of his Diſciples: yea, the place in hand gives to Satan in the very time of the thouſand yeares, ſo great power upon multitudes of men who never were ſanctified, but ever his vaſſalls, led by him at his will, that he makes them compaſſe the holy City, and the Campe of the Saints to fight againſt God, till fire from heaven did deſtroy them.</p>

               <note place="margin">Their ſecond reaſon from <hi>Daniel</hi> 12.</note>Beſide this famous place, Maſter <hi>Archer,</hi> Maſter <hi>Mattoun</hi> and <hi>T. G.</hi> in his glimps, bring a number of other ſcriptures for their Tenet, wherewith we neede not meddle: for Maſter <hi>Petree,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Hayne</hi> in peculiar treatiſes have anſwered them all; onely the cheife of them, which Maſter <hi>Burrows</hi> in his treatiſe upon <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. is pleaſed to chuſe out, we will conſider. He builds much upon <hi>Daniel.</hi> 12. as if it did prove the reſurrection of ſome of the godly to an earthly glory a thouſand yeares before the laſt Judgement; he borroweth from the glimpſe foure arguments, word by word; there is a fifth alſo in the glimpſe, which the moſt of that party doe much inſiſt upon; the firſt is taken from the ſecond verſe of that 12 chap. At the laſt Judgement ſay they, all ſhall riſe; but, in that place, many doe riſe, not all.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">We Anſwer</note>Anſwer. We prove that the Prophet ſpeakes here of the laſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> reſurrection, by two grounds which our Brethren will not deny. Firſt, the reſurrection unto life eternall is onely at the laſt day; but the reſurrection whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeakes, is expreſly to life eternall; not that prior reſurrection which out Brethren aime at, to a temporall Kingdome of a thouſand yeares. Secondly, the reſurrection of the wicked to eternall ſhame, is onely at the laſt day; for according to our Brethrens Doctrine, the wicked have no part of the <hi>firſt reſurrection,</hi> and riſe not till the thouſand
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50687:131"/>
yeares be ended; now, the reſurrection whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeakes in <hi>verſe</hi> 2. is expreſſely of the wicked to ſhame and death, as well as of the godly to life and glory. As for their Argument from the word <hi>Many,</hi> it proves not that all did not riſe, but onely that theſe that did riſe, were many and a great multitude. Therefore <hi>Deodate</hi> Tranſlates the words well according to the ſence of the Originall, <hi>The multitude of theſe that ſleepe in the duſt.</hi> The Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, <hi>omnes &amp; multi,</hi> are ſometimes Synonemy's, according to the matter in hand; as <hi>omnes</hi> muſt ſometimes be taken for <hi>multi</hi>; ſo <hi>multi</hi> muſt ſometimes be taken for <hi>omnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, They reaſon from the third <hi>verſe,</hi> that in the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the bodies of all the Saints ſhall ſhine as the Sunne: But, in the reſurrection whereof the Prophet ſpeakes, no body ſhines as the Sunne, but ſome as the Starres, others as the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Anſw. The preceding <hi>verſe</hi> evinces unanſwerably, that the Prophet here is ſpeaking of the laſt reſurrection to life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting; as for the argument, it doth not follow that they who here are ſaid to have ſo much glory, may not elſewhere be ſaid to have more; for that which here the Prophet intends to expreſſe is not the abſolute but the comparative glory of the Saints; however the leaſt diſciple ſhould ſhine as the Sunne, yet if ye compare his glory with the greater light of an other, you may expreſſe the glory of both in the ſimilitude of lightſome bodies leſſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then the Sunne, if ſo theſe bodies differ one from another in degrees of glory; for all that the Prophet here aimes at, is onely this difference of glory. Chriſt in the Goſpell makes all the Saints to ſhine as the Sunne, yet the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing the different degrees of glory that is among the Saints, ſcruples not to expreſſe the glory of the moſt of them in the ſimilitude of bodies leſſe glorious then the Sunne; <hi>There is one glory of the Sunne, another glory of the Moone, another of the Starres; for one Starre differeth from another Starre in glory; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> Further, will our Brethren af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that the bodies of the Saints on earth during the time of thoſe thouſand yeares, ſhall be ſo farre changed, as to ſhine like the Starres, and yet to eate, drinke, and ſleepe? ſo much glory can hardly ſtand with ſo much baſeneſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They reaſon from the fourth <hi>verſe</hi>; The laſt reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:50687:132"/>
is no myſtery nor any ſecret to be ſealed up to the end of the viſion. But, the reſurrection here ſpoken of, is ſuch a myſtery as muſt be ſealed up.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, Firſt, according to Mr. <hi>Burrowes</hi> expreſſe profeſſion in the ſame place, the Argument may be inverted; for the firſt reſurrection to the thouſand yeares of glory, he makes a Doctrine very well knowne and much inſiſted upon by all the Prophets before Chriſt; but the <hi>Generall</hi> reſurrection and life everlaſting he makes to be a hid and ſecret Doctrine which the Prophets in the old Teſtament doe ſcarcely touch. Secondly, Life eternall and death eternall, heaven and hell, are to this day very great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the moſt of the world; and Scriptures concerning <hi>theſe,</hi> are hid and cloſed above any other. Thirdly, The words ſpeake not onely of the reſurrection, but of the whole preceding Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, eſpecially of the peoples deliverance by <hi>Michael</hi> the Prince from the oppreſſion of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> which was not much to be underſtood till it came to paſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, They reaſon from the laſt <hi>verſe</hi>; Life eternall is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the Saints, and no ſingular priviledge of <hi>Daniels.</hi> But, the reſurrection here ſpoken of, is promiſed to <hi>Daniel</hi> as a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar favour.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, Mr. <hi>Archer</hi> who is deepeſt learned in theſe Myſteries, affirmes. That all the goldly as well as <hi>Daniel,</hi> had their part in the firſt reſurrection; and indeede, if once you begin to diſtinguiſh, it will be hard to finde ſatisfactory grounds to give this glory to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and to deny it to <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> and many others. Secondly, We may well ſay that life eternall albeit <hi>common</hi> to all the Saints, yet is ſo divine, ſo rare and ſingular a mercy to every one that gets it, that it may be propounded to <hi>Daniel</hi> and every Saint as a ſoveraigne comfort againſt the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of all their troubles. Thirdly, The place according to the beſt Interpreters, ſpeakes nothing at all of any reſurrection; onely it imports a promiſe to <hi>Daniel</hi> to live in peace all his dayes, that notwithſtanding all the troubles, of the Church which he ſaw in theſe viſions (as <hi>Diodate</hi> Tranſlates it) yet ſo farre as concerned himſelf he ſhould goe on to his end, and reſt, ſtand, or continue in his preſent honours and proſperous condition to his death, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of his dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:50687:132"/>Fifthly, from the 11. and 12. <hi>verſe</hi> they conclude peremptorily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the beginning of theſe thouſand yeares to be in the yeare 1650; or at furtheſt 1695 for they make the 1290 dayes to be ſo many yeares, and the 1335 dayes to be 45 yeares more; theſe they make to beginne in the raigne of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate who after <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> death, did re-eſtabliſh Paganiſme in the Empire, and encouraged the <hi>Jewes</hi> to build the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> till God hindred them by an Earthquake which did caſt up the foundation-ſtones of the old Temple. Beginning their account at this time, the end of their firſt number falls on the yeere 1650, and of the ſecond on the yeare 1695. This is <hi>Archers</hi> calculation, which <hi>T. G.</hi> and others follow preciſely.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, We marvell at the raſhneſſe of men who by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of many before them, will not learne greater wiſedome; if they needes muſt determine peremptorily of <hi>times and ſeaſons,</hi> That they doe not extend their period beyond their owne dayes, That they be not, as ſome before them, laughed at before their owne Eyes, when they have lived to ſet the vanity of their too confident Predictions; however, in this calculation, there ſeemes nothing to be ſound; neither the beginning, nor the middle, nor the later end. If the thouſand yeares begin in the 1650 yeare, if Chriſt then come in perſon to the earth, what will keepe him from perfecting his Kingdome to the 1695 yeare thereafter; will he ſpend whole 45 yeares in warres againſt the Nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be ſubdued to his Scepter? Secondly, What warrant have they to begin their account with the Empire of <hi>Julian?</hi> Did he ſet up <hi>any abomination</hi> at all in the Church of God? He ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe in the Territories of his Empire the Pagan Temples, which by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had been cloſed; by counſell and example he allured men to idolatry; but he troubled not any Chriſtians in the liberty of their profeſſion, he did not ſet up idolatry in any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Congregation; The Lord did quickly kill him and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his intended perſecution of Chriſtians. But although it could be verified of him, that he did ſet up the <hi>abomination of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in the Temple</hi>; yet how made he the <hi>daily Sacrifice to ceaſe?</hi> he was ſo far from <hi>this,</hi> that to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> uttermoſt of his power he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to ſet up againe the daily Sacrifice which ſome hundred yeares ceaſed. Scripture ſpeakes onely of <hi>two</hi> times wherein the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50687:133"/>
ſolemne ſacrifice was made to ceaſe, and the abomination of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation was ſet up. Firſt, by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and then by <hi>Titus Veſpaſian</hi>; but of <hi>Julian</hi> his making the ſacrifice to ceaſe, Scripture ſpeakes nothing. That Story of the Earthquake where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr <hi>Archer</hi> builds, albeit reported by ſome of the Ancients, ſeemes to be a great fable; Certainely, the application of it to Chriſts Propheſie of the Goſpel, <hi>A ſtone ſhall not be left upon a ſtone,</hi> as if this had not been fulfilled till <hi>that</hi> Earthquake had caſt up all the foundation-ſtones of the ancient Temple, is very temerarious. As The beginning and end of their calculation is groundleſſe, ſo alſo the midſt and the whole body of it is frivolous. What neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is there to expound <hi>dayes</hi> by <hi>yeares</hi> eſpecially in that place, where yeares are divided into dayes? In the very preceding words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. the dayes here mentioned, are expreſſed <hi>by a time, times, and halfe a time</hi>: can they ſhew in any place of Scripture that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a <hi>day</hi> is put for a <hi>yeare,</hi> where yeares, and dayes are conjoyned, and a few yeares are extended in the enumeration of all the dayes that are in theſe yeares?</p>
            <p>The words of the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> are cleare, if they be taken as they lie; but if they be ſtrained to a Myſticall ſenſe, they become inexplicable. The Lord is comforting the Prophet and the whole Church by the ſhort indurance of the deſolations which <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> was to bring upon them; for from the time of his ſcattering of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and diſcharging of the ſolemne ſacrifice, unto the breaking of the yoake of his Tyranny, it ſhould be but three yeares and a halfe with a few more dayes: yea, unto that happy time when the plague of God ſhould fall on his perſon, it ſhould be but 45 dayes more. The Hiſtory of <hi>Joſephus</hi> and the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> makes the event accord with this prediction. Why then ſhould we ſtraine the Text any further to a <hi>new ſence</hi> which neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the <hi>event</hi> nor with the <hi>words</hi>?</p>

            <p>Thirdly, the time whereof the Apoſtle ſpeakes, is called <hi>the day of the Lord,</hi> the uſuall diſcription of Chriſts comming to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; alſo the day that comes on the world <hi>as a theefe in the night,</hi> which phraſe oftentimes in ſcripture is attributed unto Chriſts comming unto Judgement, but is not true of his comming to the <hi>Millenary</hi> reigne: for the calculation of that time is ſo well knowne, that it is preached and printed to be at <hi>ſuch a yeare,</hi> if not ſuch a mounth or day.

               <note place="margin">Their eight place.</note>His eight place, is <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5, 8. <hi>For unto the Angells he hath not put in ſubjection the world to come; but now we ſee not yet all things put under him</hi>; whence he inferres that Chriſt in the world to come, is to reigne and to have all things put under his feet, which is not now performed, the Apoſtle ſaying expreſſely that now all things are not put under him; neither is this true in the life to come; for then the Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is rendred up to the Father.</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>The world to come</hi> is not that imaginary world of the 1000 yeares,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> whereof the Scripture ſpeaks no thing; but the dayes of the Goſpell of which the Apoſtle is there ſpeaking, and ſhewing that the Goſpell was adminiſtred not by Angells as the Law had beene upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but by the Sonne of God himſelfe: This new world under the Goſpell did differ more from the old world under the Law, then the earth in the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> and the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> after the floud, from the earth in the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> before the floud. This <hi>new world</hi> of the Goſpell began with Chriſts <hi>firſt comming</hi> in the fleſh; it was demonſtrated in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>When all power in heaven and in earth was given to him.

The accompliſhment of this world is not till the Laſt day, when Death, Hell, and Satan, which yet are not made Chriſts footſtoole, ſhall fully be conquered. Theſe things cannot be verified of the thouſand yeares. For according to Mr. <hi>Burrowes</hi> grounds, before they begin, many things are annihilated, and ſo not made ſubject; The heavens and elements are melted with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent heate; The earth and the workes thereof are burnt up with fire; Alſo, during theſe thouſand yeares, Chriſts chiefe enemies are not fully ſubdued; death ſtill hath dominion over men; the devill is onely bound, but yet alive, and not caſt into the lake.</p>

               <hi>They ſhall ſay no more the Arke of the Covenant of the Lord, neither ſhall it come to minde, neither ſhall they remember it; at that time they ſhall call Jeruſalem the throne of the Lord, and all the Nations ſhall be gathered unto it, neither ſhall they walke any more after the imagination of their evill heart.</hi> Hence, he inferres, A ſtate of the Church in the Laſt dayes ſo glorious, that all things by-paſt ſhall be forgot; That <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall returne from their captivity to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; That all Nations ſhall joyne with them; That they ſhall no more walke after their old ſinnes; That <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which before times was at beſt but the footſtoole of God, ſhall then become a <hi>throne</hi> of glory.</p>
            <p>Anſwer.<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> There is no word here of Chriſts abode upon earth for a thouſand yeares.

Fourthly, <hi>Walking after Gods owne heart,</hi> doth not import a freedome from all ſinne; but onely a ſtate of grace, wherein according to the new Covenant, God gives his people a newheart, and writes his Lawes upon the ſame. Fifthly, That whereupon the greateſt weight of the argument is laid, ſeemes to be a very groundleſſe conceit, That <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> when it is a throne of glory, muſt be the old <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> builded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; as if <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> under the Law, and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in the dayes of the Goſpell (the Church in the new Teſtament, the mother of us all) were but the footeſtoole of God. This is a doctrine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly againſt Scripture; for in divers places, <hi>Ieruſalem, Sion,</hi> and the <hi>Arke,</hi> even in the old Teſtament, are called not onely the footſtoole, but the throne of God <hi>Ier.</hi> 14.21. <hi>Doe not abhorre us for thy names ſake; doe not diſgrace the throne of thy glory.</hi> Alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.12. <hi>A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our Sanctuary.</hi> The Lord did as it were ſit upon the Mercy Seate as upon a chaire of State, under the Canopy of the wings of the Cherubins within the Sanctuary the chamber of his moſt Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous preſence. <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> under the new Teſtament, is called not onely the throne of God, but his footſtoole, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40.13. <hi>To beautifie the place of my Sanctuary, and I will make the place of my feete glorious.</hi> This place our Brethren expound of the Sanctuary during the time of the thouſand yeares. However, it is cleare it muſt be expounded of the Church in the ſame times whereof <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> ſpeakes in his third <hi>Chapter</hi> whence the Argument in hand is brought.</p>

To deny the beginning of Chriſts Kingdome over his Church, unto the thouſand yeares, is many wayes abſurd; And, becauſe of the eternall indurance of his dominion and glory in the heavens, to make the Church on earth in which he raignes, to be voide of all tribulation, of all changes, to have a perpetuall day without any darkeneſſe, is contrary to the Scriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged in the former arguments.</p>

            <p>Anſwer.<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> It is a very ſtrange conception to make the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus embrue his holy hands in the blood of ſo many men.

As theſe battells were fought by Chriſt, not in his <hi>owne</hi> perſon nor upon the earth; ſo neither theſe battells of the <hi>Revel</hi>-which ſo much the leſſe can be literally expounded, as in the 14 and 15 <hi>verſes</hi> of that 19 <hi>Chapter,</hi> the inſtrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſt is ſaid to fight theſe battells, is not any Sword in his hand, but the two-edged <hi>Sword of his mouth</hi>; and the Souldiers whom he leads out to theſe battells are not armed with Sword and Speare, but ride upon <hi>white Horſes, cloathed in fine linnen white and cleane.</hi>

            <p>From <hi>this,</hi> to inferre the purging of the Chriſtian Church of all other enemies in this life, and that by killing of them all as curſed <hi>Canaanites</hi>: were a dangerous concluſion, farre from the juſtice and innocence of Chriſtians in all by-gone times, the beleefe whereof would quickly renew unto us the horrible tragedies of the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi>
