            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You ſhall feed no longer upon the Oyle that was in other mens Lamps (the Scriptures) for now it is required that every one have Oyle in his own Lamp, even the pure teſtimony of truth, within himſelf. For he that wants this; though he have the report of it in his book: he ſhall not enter with the Bridegroome into the chamber of peace.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou are the men that ſtand up, aſſuming the power to your ſelves to teach the People the myſtery of the Spirit, and that you are the onely men ſent of him for that office: therefore you are called ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all men, or men that are all ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Many differences you ſee about ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things, ariſes up daily amongſt the people; it doth not belong to you to make parties; but to judge of theſe differences, with a moderate and meek
<pb facs="tcp:37940:4"/>
ſpirit between people and people; you are not to ſuffer fleſh or ſelfiſh diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to breake forth from you; a haſty raſh ſpirit cannot judge any thing.</p>
            <p>There are onely theſe two roots, from whence theſe differences ſpring up, that is, either from the Spirit that made all things, or from humane fleſh, which is the Creature that is gone aſtray; and he that walks after the fleſh, denies the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now if you be ſpirituall, as you ſay, you are to judge of theſe differences, and declare what is of the Spirit, that it may ſtand; and what is of the fleſh that it may be trod under foot; that ſo the Lord alone, that made fleſh, may be exalted above <hi>fleſh,</hi> in the day of his power, that doth begin to ſhine forth. The rule that you judge by, you ſay are the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of Prophets, Apoſtles and ancient writers; if ſo, then you are not ſpirituall, or all ſpirit; neither have you the alone priviledge to judge; for the
<pb facs="tcp:37940:4"/>
People having the Scriptures, may judge by them as well as you.</p>
            <p>If you ſay no, the People cannot judge, becauſe they know not the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall: I anſwer, neither doe you know the originall; though by your learning you may be able to tranſlate a writing out of <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> into our mother tongue, <hi>Engliſh</hi>; but to ſay this is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall Scripture you cannot: for thoſe very Copies which the Prophets and Apoſtles writ, are not to be ſeen in your Univerſities.</p>
            <p>You ſay you have the juſt Copies of their writings; you doe not know that but as your Fathers have told you; which may be as well falſe as true, if you have no better ground then tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You ſay that the interpretation of Scripture into our mother tongue is according to the mind of the <hi>ſpirit</hi>; you cannot tell that neither, unleſſe you were able to ſay, that thoſe who did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nterpret thoſe writings, had had
<pb facs="tcp:37940:5"/>
the ſame teſtimony of Spirit, as the pen-men of Scriptures had; for it is the Spirit within that muſt prove thoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies to be true: now you know that there are many tranſlations and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, which differ much one from another; which of them muſt the People take to be trueſt; ſeeing you yourſelves are at loſſe?</p>
            <p>One company of you ſayes, this tranſlation is the truth; and then the People muſt be forced to follow you: loe, here is Chriſt, ſaith the Prelats; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother company of yours ſaies, ſuch a tranſlation is the trueſt; and then the People muſt be forced to follow them: as this halfe-day of the Beaſt, cry, loe here is Chriſt,</p>
            <p>Firſt, here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ytery; then there in the Independency: and thus you leade the People like horſes by the noſes; &amp; ride upon them at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from one forme and cuſtome to another, and ſo quite from the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:37940:5"/>You preſſe the People with much violence, to maintain the Goſpel: the People demands, What is the Goſpel? You ſay, it is the Scriptures. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple replies again; <hi>How can theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be called the everlasting Goſpel, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is torne in peeces daily amongst your ſelves, by various tranſlations, infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and concluſions; one preſſing this, another that; and the People are lost in the midſt of your waters</hi>?</p>
            <p>If you ſay, you can judge by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, why, then you have not the alone priviledge to judge neither; for the Spirit is not confined to your Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; but it ſpreads from Eaſt to Weſt, and enlightens ſons and daughters in all parts.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, that viſions and revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ceaſed, and that the Spirit and Scriptures are ſtill together; then you erre mightily in ſpending conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Scriptures, which is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; and doth not rather leave the
<pb facs="tcp:37940:6"/>
Scriptures to their own genuine lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that People may read the very lettter without alteration.</p>
            <p>Two things, as you are Scripture men, you muſt judge of. Firſt, what is the Goſpel. Secondly, what is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or declaration of the Goſpel. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare poſitively what I know; doe you take the Scriptures and diſprove me if you can. Firſt, The <hi>Goſpel</hi> is the <hi>Spirit</hi> that ruled in the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which teſtified to them, that in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter daies the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> ſhould be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out upon all <hi>fleſh.</hi> Secondly, then their writings is not the <hi>Spirit</hi>; but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or declaration of that law and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony which was within them.</p>
            <p>Now the Spirit ſpreading it ſelfe from Eaſt to Weſt, from North to South, in ſonnes and daughters, is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and never dies; but is ſtill ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and riſing higher and higher in manifeſting himſelfe in and to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:37940:6"/>But now the declaration of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> being but words gon out of the mouth, may be, and daily are corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſubtilty of imaginary fleſh; it is the <hi>Spirit</hi> within every man that tries all things: words cannot try all things: he that ſpeakes from the fleſh; ſhall of the <hi>fleſh</hi> reap corruption; ſhall taſt of miſery that <hi>fleſh</hi> brings upon himſelfe: but he that ſpeaks from the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life: or he that preaches the <hi>Goſpel, ſhall live of the Goſpel</hi>; that is, he that ſpeakes from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſhall have inward peace, life, and liberty from the Spirit, in the midſt of all worldly ſtraights, he ſhall not want life and peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <q>You will ſay, what of all this?</q>
            <p>I anſwer, it is matter of the greateſt concernment; your Pulpit wrings againſt Errors: The People cries what are thoſe errors? You anſwere,

            <p>Well, matters of this nature, are to be judged with a wary and moderate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; covetous raſhneſſe can judge of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

            <p>Whether you your ſelves, be not the very men that doe deny God, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Ordinances of God; and that turnes the tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When the Apoſtolicall gifts ceaſed, which was to ſpeak from an inward te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of what they heard and ſaw; as the Father did will it ſhould ceaſe for a time, times and halfe time; or fourty two moneths; then began the falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets to ariſe, that ſpeak from tradition of what they had read in Books; expounding thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings from their imaginary thoughts; getting a power from the Magiſtrate to protect them; and to puniſh ſuch as ſpeak from the teſtimony of Chriſt within them, which fleſh is willin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EAR friend it is ſlandero uſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported (by reaſon whereof ſome of you may be troubled to hear) that Chamberlain the <hi>Redding</hi> man, called after the fleſh, <hi>William Everard;</hi> doth hold blaſphemous opinions: as to deny God, and Chriſt, and Scriptures, and prayer; and they call him a deceiver, and many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ilt by names; and upon this report of the raging multitude (ſome that call themſelves Miniſters, and ſome common people) the Bayliffs of <hi>Kingſton</hi> have put him in priſon, as he came through their Towne and took a nights lodging; and hath kept him there this weeke, upon theſe ſuppoſed ſcandals.</p>
            <p>Now I was moved to write what here followes, as a vindication of the man and my ſelfe, being ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as well as he (by ſome of the Miniſters) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been in his company; that all the world may judge of his and my inn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cency in theſe particular ſcandals; and that it may appear, as it will upon tryall, that the pariſh Miniſters themſelves, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that followes their way of worſhip; doth turn the Scriptures into a lye, by leaving the old
<pb facs="tcp:37940:9"/>
letter that the Apoſtles writ; and new moulding thoſe Scriptures into their own language; walking according to their owne inferences and conjectures thereupon; and by holding forth God and Chriſt to be at a diſtance from men; they are the only men that deny God and Chriſt and Scriptures, and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, walking in the practiſe of their own invention, to which ignorant fleſh cloſeth without examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ſo the greatest theeves cry, ſtop theefe firſt.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall adde one word as an accompt wherefore I uſe the word Reaſon, inſtead of the word God, in my writings, as you ſhall meet mith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: If I demand of you, who made all things? And your anſwer God. If I demand what is God? You anſwer the ſpirituall power; that as he made; ſo he governs and preſerves all things; ſo that the ſum of all is this, God is the chief Maker or Governor, &amp; this maker &amp; governor is God: Now I am loſt in this wheel that runs round, and lies under darknes.</p>
            <p>But if you demand of mee, why I ſay Reaſon did make, and doth governe and preſerve all things: I anſwer, Reaſon is that living power of light that is in all things; it is the ſalt that ſavours all things; it is the fire that burns up droſſe, and ſo reſtores what is corrupted; and preſerves what is pure; he is the Lord our righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>It lies in the bottom of love, of juſtice, of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for if the Spirit Reaſon did not uphold and moderate theſe, they would be madneſſe; nay, they
<pb facs="tcp:37940:9"/>
could not be called by them names; for Reaſon guids them in order, and leads them to their right end, which is not to preſerve a part, but the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But is mans reaſon that which you cal God? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, mans reaſoning is a creature which fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ws from that Spirit to this end, to draw up man into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: it is but a candle lighted by that ſoul, and this light ſhining through fleſh, is darkened by the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of fleſh; ſo that many times men act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon, though they thinke they act according to reaſon.</p>
            <p>By that light of Reaſon that is in man, he may ſee a ſutableneſſe in many things, but not in all things; for the reaſon that acts in another man, may ſee a weakneſſe of reaſon that asts in me: but now the Spirit Reaſon, which I call God, the Maker and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of all things, is that ſpirituall power, that guids all mens reaſoning in right order, and to a right end: for the Spirit Reaſon, doth not preſerve one creature and deſtroy onother; as many times mens reaſonings doth, being blind by the imagination of the fleſh: but it hath a regard to the whole creation; and knits every creature together into a oneneſſe; making every creature to be an upholder of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and ſo every one is an aſſiſtant to preſerve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he whole: and the neerer that mans reaſoning comes to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his, the more ſpirituall they are; the farther off they be, the more ſelfiſh and fleſhy they be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:37940:10"/>Now this word Reaſon is not the alone name of this ſpirituall power: but every one may give him a name according to that ſpirituall Power that they feel and ſee rules in them, carrying them forth in actions to preſerve their fellow creatures as well as themſelves.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſome may call him King of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and Prince of peace: ſome may call him Love, and the like: but I can, and I doe call him Reaſon; becauſe I ſee him to be that living powerfull light that is in righteouſneſſe, making righteouſneſſe to be righteouſneſſe; or juſtice to be juſtice; or love to be love: for without this modera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er and ruler, they would be madneſſe; nay, the ſelfewilledneſſe of the fleſh; and not that which we call them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I am made to change the name from God to Reaſon; becauſe I have been held under darkneſſe by that word, as I ſee many people are; and likewiſe that people may reſt no longer upon words without knowledge; but hereafter may look after that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wer; and know what it is that rules them, and which doth rule in and over all, and which they call their God and Governour or preſerver. And this I hope will be a ſufficient accompt why I alter the word: what here followes may give more light into the thing.</p>

act of unrighteouſneſſe and oppreſſion from him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when a man lives in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and love of the Father, ſeeing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in every creature, and ſo loves, delights, obeyes, and honours the Spirit which he ſees in the creature, and ſo acts rightly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that creature in whom hee ſees the ſpirit of the Father for to reſt, according to its meaſure.</p>
               <p>And whereas before he exerciſed outward ſenſes to follow creatures; now he lives in the exerciſe of his ſpirituall ſenſes, and hee doth rightly, and he knowes wherefore; for his ſoul now ſees, feels, taſts, ſmels and hears the Father ſpiritually in all things, and ſo doth all things in love and cheerfull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Spirit, that diſcovers all things to him inwardly; whereby he is made able to doe acts of righteouſneſſe outwardly.</p>
               <p>This man that is thus drawn up, knowes what it is to live in community with the Globe; and to live in community with the Spirit of the Globe</p>

               <p>Yea, after he refuſed to live after the Spirit his Maker; and made joyce to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the objects of the Creation, he then dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and corrupted, and fell into all venimous and ſtinking unrighteouſneſſe: and as his body went to the earth, he did ſtill poyſon and corrupt the earth, and cauſed it to bring forth poyſonous Vipers, Todes and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and Thornes and Bryars.</p>
               <p>For the curſe being firſt falen upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, through man it fell upon the other creatures, and the Earth was curſed for his fake; and the poyſon of mans unrighteous body, dunging the Earth, filled the graſſe and herbs with ſtrong unſavory ſpirits, that flowed from him, whereby the cattell feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, comes to be made bitter ſpirited, and mad one againſt another.</p>

               <p>This ſpeech hath blinded the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of many; for the Father is not confined to any one particular place; for he is in every place, and in every creature; and where Hee dwels in cleare manifeſtations, there is Heaven; and the higher manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the higher Heavens.</p>
               <p>Now the body of Chriſt is where the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, in the earth, purifying the Earth; and his Spirit is entred into the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the heavenly glory, where the Father dwels; which is a glory above the fleſh, and where he rules King and Lord, in and over all the Creation, purging out all ſtrong ſpirited powers that cauſes ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and bringing all into the unity of that one Spirit, himſelf.

That whereas the Apoſtles ſaw Chriſt ariſe and aſcend, and were witneſſes of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, it was onely a declaration in viſion to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, The beaſtly ſon that ariſes up from that rebelling power, and that is, Man, that holds forth this rebellion to fellow creatures; for now rebellion is broke out, and Reaſons law is violated; the creatures fleſh ſeekes to honour it ſelfe, and hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken his Maker: here is the Father and the Son of darkneſſe.</p>

               <p>Secondly, That the ſecond man may have the more glory, when in the fulneſſe of time he ſhall come, and pull the Kingdome out of the firſt mans hand, and tread him under foot, and rule righteouſly in fleſh himſelfe. Yea, and to begin this great worke, when all

               <p>Two things are to be obſerved in the firſt man; Firſt, his revolt from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in making choyce to live upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not upon the ſpirit: and hereby now the law of Reaſon is broke. And this is one thing, that ſuch as are of the generation of the firſt mans fleſh doth doe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Note the miſery that this firſt man fleſh doth bring upon himſelfe: by ſo doing, he puls croſſes and ſorrowes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in upon himſelfe, and troubles without: for his unrighteous breath corrupts the aire, and raiſes hurtfull winds and weather; and his unrighteous fleſh corrupts the earth, and cauſes it to ſend forth hurtfull crops, and poyſonous Vipers: theſe are the fruits of his earthy choyce and labours; and therefore when you ſee miſery in the world, then ſay, this is the fruit of living upon the creatures, and not upon the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:37940:23"/>Well, From the beginning to this day, Reaſon hath ſuffered the firſt man to reigne, and to fill the earth: therefore is it ſaid, <hi>The firſt man is of the earth, earthy</hi>; and he fils the earth, as one beane, multiplying every yeare, fils the earth with that graine; which is but the multiplication of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam,</hi> or firſt man, is looked upon in a three-fold ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Adam,</hi> or firſt man, that went aſtray from his Maker, which lived upon earth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand yeares agoe, which the eyes of every man is upon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Every man and woman that live upon the objects of the creation, and not in and upon the ſpirit that made the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a ſonne and daughter of the firſt man; and being put altogether, make up but the one firſt man: ſo that we may ſee <hi>Adam</hi> every day before our eyes walking up and downe the ſtreet.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, I ſee the two <hi>Adams</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man: The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> hath his time to rule firſt in me; when the chiefe powers in me, leads me forth to looke after objects, and to delight in them, more then in the ſpirit.

               <p>Firſt, the Father Reaſon, that made all things before the creation was brought forth he was not known. Secondly, the Son, and this is that part of the creation that holds him purely forth to the view of others. Now truth begins to ſhine, and Reaſon begins to be honoured by an humane body; ſo that here is Father and Son. Thirdly, when the whole earth is filled with the one ſpirit; this makes the ſecond man perfect, for corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and curſe is removed; and the whole earth is filled with holy breathing; all acting and living in righteouſneſſe. And this is Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond man.</p>

               <p>It is true, his writings are the word of it, or the report of it; but it is not the thing it ſelfe: for when it was reported, that the Father would dwell in the fleſh, and deſtroy the Serpent: this report ſavoured ſweet: But when man comes to ſee, and feel, and know, that the Father dwels and rules in him; This is farre more ſweet: This is to enjoy the Goſpell himſelfe: The word of life within, and this ſhall never ceaſe, but endures for ever.</p>

               <p>Secondly, waite upon the Father with a meek ſpirit for his teaching. And you ſhall find it a very hard thing to performe theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, if you would hear other men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the Apoſtles and Prophets, your fellow ſervants were; but do not alter their words, by forceing a meaning, till the Father teach you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you would hear, then acquaint your ſelves with ſuch, as can ſpeake from a teſtimony within: for as they received what they have from the pure teachings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo this ſecond hand teaching will be pure teaching to you; but be ſure you do not prefer this ſecond hand teaching before the firſt: for now the everlaſting word and goſpel muſt reveale himſelf to you, or elſe you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>I have now diſcharged my ſervice to the Father, in this declaration: remember what is tould you, deſpiſe not the Fathers meanes, by preferring the way and meanes of the fleſh, above the wayes of the Father.</p>
               <p>They ſay, I deny the Scriptures, becauſe I ſay, that the Scriptures were not appointed for a rule to the world to walke by, without the ſpirit; but were the teſtimony of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in thoſe men that writ them, for the comfort and benefit of thoſe that are drawn up into communion with the ſame ſpirit: And to this I ſhall give this accompt.</p>

               <p>It was the Law and Teſtimony of the ſpirit which reſted in and upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, for they writ what they ſaw in viſion, and they ſpake what they heard by voice, ſpeaking to them ſpiritually.</p>

               <p>No: For this is to walke by the eyes of other men, and the ſpirit is not ſo ſcanty, that a dozen or 20 pair of eyes ſhall ſerve the whole world; but every ſonne and daughter as they are called children of light, have light within themſelves: The ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that fils one, fils all; and makes the whole number of them, according to their ſeverall

               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>I anſwer no: neither reaſon nor Scripture allowes any man to ſpeake any words, but what he knowes poſitively to be truth. And he that ſpends conſtructions thereupon, ſpeaking from his imagination, he ſpeaks from the fleſh and devill, and ſo he makes himſelf to be a traytor to the father, inholding forth that to be truth which is no truth. And a thief, robber, and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous dealer with the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: Firſt, in taking their words as his own: and ſecondly, in expounding their meaning, and ſo putting his own meaning upon their words.</p>
               <p>But yet he that hath the ſame ſpirit, may ſpeak the ſame word, where the Father hath given him the ſame ſight and experience: for no man can ſafely tell ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this is a poſitive truth of God, till he have the ſame teſtimoniall experience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf as the penmen of Scripture had: and this I am ſure all that ſtand up to teach by way of office have not; therefore it is clear, that the power that ſets up ſuch teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37940:30"/>
is not from the Father; commanding, but from the fleſh; being ſuffered by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a time, that when he comes to throw downe his enemies, fleſh may be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and he honoured.</p>
               <p>That man that cannot ſpeak the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Father, no other way, but from his book as he reads, or from the mouth of another what he heares: as the publike teachers doe ſpeake by hearſay and not from experience, and ſo declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a falſe Chriſt, a falſe prophet, that runs to teach others, before he have any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of God within himſelf.</p>

                  <hi>But are not the Scriptures the truths of God</hi>?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, for they declare, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was the mighty governour of the fleſh of thoſe that writ them, and ſo the truths of God the great governour in the pure expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of thoſe penmen.</p>
               <p>And I ſhall demand of you how you know that theſe Scriptures are the word of God, in the ſenſe you call them: but the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the ſpirit within your ſelves, I ſay, there is no way to know but by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit himſelf; ſeeing there are ſo many expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions upon them, which without doubt hath varied the copies: if it were poſſible to

ſee thoſe very writings from the prophets and Apoſtles own pen: which is not to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>But when the ſpirit comes in he muſt, nay he doth and will declare his own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And ſo the ſpirituall man judges all things, and he himſelf is judged of no man: he can judge the fleſh, and paſſe righteous judgement, becauſe he ſees and knowes wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <speaker>An.</speaker>
               <p>Firſt, they are, or may be kept as a record of ſuch truths as were writ not from imagination of fleſh, but from pure experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and teachings of the Father. Secondly, we are taught thereby to waite upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a meek and obedient ſpirit, till he teach us, and feed us with ſincere milk, as he taught them, that wrote theſe Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when I look into that record of experimentall teſtimony, and finde a ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble agreement betweene them, and the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of light within my own ſoule, now my joy is fulfilled. And every man and woman may declare what they have received, and ſo become preachers one to another.</p>
               <p>For the Scriptures doth but declare the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37940:31"/>
ſending down of the ſpirit and how he ſhall rule in the earth in the latter dayes: but they doe not declare every particular meaſure and beame of the ſpirits ruling, for this the ſons and daughters are to declare, by their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular experiences, as they are drawn up.</p>

               <p>Therefore Reaſon the eſſentiall Father, gave this Law, that in that day, that man left off to own his maker that dwelt within him, and to ſuck delight from the creation, he ſhould then die, or be caſt into a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to live below the ſpirit that is to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the creature, and not upon the ſpirit; And the ſpirit would ſuffer himſelf thus for a time to be trod under foot, til the fulneſſe of time came, that he would riſe up like ſeed of wheat, from under thoſe darke and heavy clods of fleſhy earth, and ſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the ſeed out of whom all things came would bruiſe the ſerpents head, that powerfull proves that was in fleſh to looke after objects without him, rather then into the ſpirit within him.</p>

his heele againſt the Spirit within, which was his Maker, ſeeks life and contentment, from objects without in the globe, not from the Spirit Reaſon that dwels within, and that holds altogether by the Power. As for example; covetous fleſh delights in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of riches or creatures; pride of the fleſh delights in the enjoyment of the ſight of the eye, or inward delights placed upon viſible objects.</p>
               <p>Now the man lives in, and upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not in and upon the Spirit in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and though he ſay that the Father is his God, yet he lies, for he is led and ruled by the fleſh, which is the devil, or father of lies which throwes the man into vexation and ſorrow every foot, for if his covetouſneſſe, pride, and luſts be ſatisfied, he hath peace; but this is the peace of the fleſh, or devil; and let his covetouſneſſe or pride be croſt, and then he is filled with vexation; which is hel or darkneſſe, even the torments of the fleſh or devil.</p>
               <p>And the Law of Reaſon ſuffered the fleſh thus to fall and to weary out himſelf in his own folly, that when the Spirit is pleaſed to breake forth and manifeſt himſelf to rule in fleſh, then man may ſee his wiſe fleſh hath nothing that is good in al his ſelfiſh actings;

but that the ſpirit that brought it forth, is the mighty Power.</p>
               <p>And when the Fathers time is come to manifeſt himſelf to any one, he will then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell the darkneſſe, which by his Law he made, and will ſet the creature free from the bondage of that darknes, burne up all thoſe thornes and briars that fleſh hath brought to terrifie it ſelf; and will take up the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into his own liberty and life; And then the Spirit ſhall be all in all: whereas the fleſh generally living up on objects is all in all, or chiefe ruler in every man.</p>

               <p>Prayer is of a threefold nature; Firſt, it is to pay the king of righteouſneſſe his due; and that is for every man to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the-creation of a man, which is to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37940:39"/>
righteouſly to all fellow creatures, he being the lord of the creatures.</p>
               <p>As firſt, to doe righteouſly to his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in taking food moderately, for the preſervation of the health of it, and not to be exceſſive in drunkenneſſe and gluttony; and not to give away to the unclean luſts of the fleſh, which tends to the deſtruction of himſelf; for if the Spirit, Reaſon, within a man let the fleſh alone, and doth not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and moderate it in righteouſneſſe, it will deſtroy it ſelfe in a ſhort time: let the fleſh walke in Reaſons law of moderation and righteouſneſſe, and it ſhall be preſerved from heart breaking ſorrows.</p>
               <p>Secondly, act righteouſneſſe to all fellow creatures, till the ground according to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; uſe the labour of your cattell with Reaſon; follow your courſe of trading in righteouſneſſe, as Reaſon requires; doe to men and women, as you would have them doe to you; and by ſo doing you ſhall live as Reaſonable creatures, you ſhall act according to the creation of a man, and ſo pay the King of Righteouſneſſe his due; for when you hold forth him in your converſation, to the view of others, you honour him, you glorifie his name, and give him thanks: and this is one part of prayer.</p>

               <p>But ſecondly, Prayer lies in the Reaſonings of the heart, as thus: Ask this queſtion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thy ſelfe; Is covetouſneſſe the name of the Lord, or the name of the fleſh? the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer within thee will be, it is the name of the fleſh, not the name of the Lord; now if thou walke in covetouſneſſe, how can thou

be ſaid to honor the Lord by thy words in prayer, when thou honoreſt the name of the fleſh, in thy practiſe.</p>
               <p>And ſo is pride, is envy, is raſh anger, is hypocriſie, is ſelf-will, is unmercifull cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is zeale without knowledge, is unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; the name of the fleſh, or the name of the Lord; thy owne heart will give anſwer, they be the name of the fleſh, not the name of the Lord, and thou lives in the practiſe and power of thoſe luſts; and gives the Lord a few cuſtomary words, and thinks his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice lies in them. I will have thee to know that the time is now breaking forth; yea, it is began, that they that worſhip the Father ſhall worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, and not in lip labor and cuſtome, according to the imagination of fleſh.</p>

               <p>Now he that is drawne up thus to Reaſon within himſelf, and to ſee himſelf, this man is praying continually, and calling upon the name of the Lord continually, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he doth, whatſoever he thinkes, which way ſoever he goes, he ſhall have
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37940:41"/>
ſtill freſh occaſions thus to be reaſoning within himſelf; and this reaſoning will do two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it will ſtrike the heart dead; when thou comeſt to ſee that for all thy praying in words, yet thou art at a loſſe, for thou honoreſt the name of the fleſh in practiſe, and only worſhips the Lord with wind, like the way of the world; your ſervant Sir; when he could kill him in his heart: when theſe things comes home to thee, thou wilt be ſtruck dead, and thy mouth be ſtopped; and this is a great power that ſtops the rage of fleſh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this way of prayer or calling upon the name of the Lord will kill thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers as they ariſe, and wil keep thy heart in peace, this I know, if thou wilt beleeve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers teſtimony, for now the name of the fleſh is ſpied out, and the poyſon of it killed; for when once Reaſon begins to enlighten thee, he will be thy keeper. The name of the Lord likewiſe is hereby advanced; firſt, within thy ſelfe, thou feareſt and trembleſt before him. Secondly, outwardly thou art moved to act righteouſneſſe to others, from the ſavour of this ſweet oyntment.</p>
               <p>Now that man doth not live leſſe or more in the practiſe of thoſe two rules laid down;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37940:41"/>
did never pray in all his life, though he uſe the words of prayer every day.</p>
               <p>Words and actions going together are the declaration of a ſincere heart; but words in prayer, without acting according to creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the generall practiſe is, are declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of hypocriticall and deceived fleſh: let his profeſſion be what it will be.</p>
               <p>Therefore profeſſors look to your ſelves, both prieſts and people, there is light broke out that will lay open the hipocriſie of your private actings to the view of the whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and you ſhall not cover your ſhame, doe all you can.

               <p>Well, thou haſt now heard what prayer is, both in the heart, and in the mouth, and in the hand. Theſe words ſhall not die, they are ſincere milke which once a wearied ſoul did ſuck from the Fathers owne breaſts of love, and wherein he now walks, and finds true reſt in the Father; they are words of truth and ſoberneſſe.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, your preaching is expoſition of words and texts, a cuſtome that Chriſt and his Apoſtles never uſed nor commanded; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Chriſt did expound the 61 of <hi>Eſay,</hi> but it was upon occaſion, to give forth his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that he was the Meſſias, he made not a trade of it cuſtomarily to get a living by. <hi>Mica.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Zacha.</hi> 13.4, 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Acts.</hi> 21.40.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, you petition the magiſtrate to compel the people to come to hear you pray and preach, or if you doe not petition, yet your anceſtors have done it: And you allow of ſuch a compulſion, and never tell the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of his evill in ſo doing. A forcing power, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles never practiſed; indeed they did foretell the riſing up of his power, which <hi>Daniel</hi> calls the little horne. <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.23, 24.25. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.47, 48.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37940:46"/>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.50.53, <hi>&amp;c. Rev.</hi> 13.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.26, 27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5.12.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, you call a pariſh (which is ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and made for civil good ſake) a Church, and all that lives within the boun of that pariſh, you ſay, are bound to maintain one of you, that ſtands up to teach them, what you have read and heard from others; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, you ſpeak from God, when your own ſoules knowes you lie; for you ſpeak o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens words not your own experience; but your lyes now ſhall be covered no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Nay, you ſay, if the people refuſe to give you tithes, you tell the Magiſtrate, it is his duty to force them, all which is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, neither from Reaſon nor Scripture. <hi>Mica.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.21. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.54, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 7.12.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, you ſay and practiſe, that the firſt day of the week is the Sabbath day, and ſo making uſe of the Magiſtrates power, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to compell the people to keep that day after the manner of the Jewiſh tipe, meerly to uphold your own trade; a practiſe which the writings of the New Teſtament warrants not; for the keeping of that firſt day, was not a forced buſineſſe, but a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary act of love among themſelves, having a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſt of the day of Chriſt, the Antitipe of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37940:46"/>
Moſes ſeventh day. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Eſay</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p>Eightly, you ſay and practiſe, that break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bread and drinking wine in a mixed company, if they be al pariſhioners, al ſitting either afraid or aſhamed one of another in a ſlaviſh bondage, none to ſpeake, but one of you, is the breaking of bread which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did practiſe: But neither Reaſon nor Scripture doth warrant your practiſe, for it is a meer table geſture, eating and drinking in love and ſweet communion one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother from houſe to houſe: Read <hi>Act.</hi> 2.46. <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.4, 5.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, you ſprinkle children, and call that the baptiſme of Chriſt, a practiſe which there is not the leaſt command or example in Scripture to warrant; yet you doe it, for it mightily deceives the people, and moves them to uphold your trade. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, you aſſume the office of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, becauſe you are bred up in humane learning, which the Scriptures doth not countenanee in the leaſt; and while you doe it, you perſecute the Goſpell it ſelfe, which is the Lord, or Spirit within; and you teare in peeces the declarations of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which is the Scriptures, by your various
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37940:47"/>
expoſitions, and ſo all you doe, is but to trouble the children, and to throw durt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their food. <hi>Moſes</hi> a ſhepheard; <hi>Amos</hi> a fruit gatherer; <hi>Apoſtles</hi> fiſher-men; <hi>Christ</hi> a carpenter; ſuch as the Lord made preachers, not ſuch as made themſelves preachers, that had biggeſt purſes.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given a taſt of my own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and if the prieſts, who ſay they own the the Scriptures, and they ſay, I deny the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and Gods Ordinances; therefore let all men judge between us, whether is in the fault, and let truth hereafter be owned and practiſed.</p>
               <p>They that practiſe any way of worſhip which neither Reaſon nor Scripture war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, do deny the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>But the Miniſters of England, and ſuch as follow them in the practiſe of praying, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; ſprinkling children, breaking bread, ſabbaths, Church ſocieties, &amp; Miniſters main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as they practiſe in their cuſtomary way of performances, which they call Gods ordinances; hath neither Reaſon nor Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to warrant them.</p>
               <p>Therefore you that call your ſelves Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, are the men that deny the Scriptures and Gods ordinances, ſetting up your owne inferences and conſtructions above the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37940:47"/>
leaving the antient letter which the Apoſtles and Prophets writ, and ſet up a new moulded way of Ordinances of your own framing, by inferences and conjectures. And by thus new moulding the Scriptures, you deny God, and Chriſt, the one Spirit, from whence the Scriptures were breathed.</p>
               <p>Let the Record be ſearched without draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inferences from it, and let all judge. Let us ſpeak the Scripture words, not force a meaning, leaſt we ſpeake contrary to the mind or ſpirit of them.</p>
               <p>Well, all that I ſhall ſay, is this; let all men ceaſe ſpending conſtructions upon the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and leave the pure Scriptures to ſhine in their own luſter, not mixing imaginary inferences with them; they were the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of truth in the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
               <p>And let us leave the pure teachings of the Father in every man, to conjoyn themſelves with thoſe Scriptures, and then there will be no jarring, but a ſweet harmony of peace and love, betweene the experience of every man and thoſe Scriptures.</p>
