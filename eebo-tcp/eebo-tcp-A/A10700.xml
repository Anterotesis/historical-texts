            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

his temptation in <hi>Paradiſe</hi>
he attempted the woman, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Her ſhe wanted but one thing
to make her ſelf like God:</hi> I would
be loath therefore, either vaine
ly to magnifie or vily to imbaſe
the dignitie of women. That I
might then ſpeake of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
without partiallity, and but according to a truth,
I will not implore the aſſiſtance neither of <hi>Apollo</hi> neither
of <hi>Pallas,</hi> nor yet of the <hi>Muſes,</hi> but will humbly beſeech
the help of the euer liuing God.</p>
            <p>For the woman of honeſt life, glory and admiration
attends on her, it is therefore euery mans part not onely
to reuerence her, but alſo to defend her honour and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation.</p>
            <p>But the better to make tryal of womens perfection in
generall, let vs examine their firſt creation, wherein is to
be noted the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce whereof they were formed which
was <hi>of the purified mettall of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The place where they were created, which was in
<hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time of the creation which was <hi>The laſt and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the perfecteſt handy worke of the Creator.</hi> The cauſe
why they were created, which was <hi>To be a comfortable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant
to man,</hi> that a man by marryage of a good woman
might paſſe through the laborſome toyles &amp; turmoyles
of this life with the more eaſe, hauing ſo good an aſſiſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to the which doubtles God had reſpect when he ſaid <hi>It
is not good for man to liue alone, let vs make him a helper.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:16377:5"/>
To this the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> doth likewiſe witneſſe
when he ſaith. <hi>Though God at the firſt had abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
yet hee made but one woman of one ribbe for the helpe and
comfort of one man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why then a man that wanteth a friend for pleaſure
a ſeruant for profit, a counſellour to aduiſe him, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to cheriſh him, a companion to ſolace him, a helper
to aſſiſt him, or a ſpirituall inſtructer to informe him, a
good &amp; a vertuous wife doth ſupply all theſe occaſions
And therefore I thinke there is neither religion nor
goodnes in that man, that loueth not an honeſt and a
loyall wife.</p>
            <p>Here we ſee there firſt inſtitution, &amp; where vnto they
were made, but if I ſhould now take vpon me to ſpeake
of the excellencie of thoſe women that haue from time

            <p>But leauing hyſtories that are infinit in example of

            <p>By this we may ſee the <hi>Excellencie of good women;</hi> that

            <p>But let vs yet draw nearer to this confirmation: when
our ſauiour himſelfe had his abode here vpon the earth
who conſpired againſt him, who ſought to perſecute
him, who tempted him, who condemned his doctrine,
who would haue ſtoned him, who ſayd he had a Deuill
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16377:6"/>

that was one of his owne <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>

women, <hi>Mary, Martha,</hi> the woman of <hi>Samaria, Ionna
Suſanna,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>It was a woman that poured a box of precious oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

it and were offended that ſo great coſt was beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed

            <p>It was <hi>Pilate</hi> a man that condemned <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered

            <p>They were men that caried him to be crucified com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pelling

            <p>What would you more they were women that ſtill vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſited
his ſepulcher after his buryall, and it was a woman
to whom he firſt appeared after his reſurrection.</p>
            <p>It were needles to in large any further how many wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy
women haue conſtantly ſuffered death vnder
tyrantes for the name of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doe not inſerte theſe preſidentes with any pretence
to impeach men, or to doe them wronge, but according
to a teſtified truth, to do women right.</p>
            <p>And yet to ſpeake truly women are commonly more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16377:6"/>
abſtinent from all manner of vncleaneſſe then men ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are the moſt of them curbed in with any other bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
then what they willingly put vppon them ſelues.
And that is the zeale of vertue and the deſire of good
name which to euery honeſt woman is more precious
then gold or ſiluer or any other gemme.</p>
            <p>It grieueth me now to thinke that there ſhould be a
woman found, to be accounted diſhoneſt, or that any
of them ſhould ſo farre ſtray from that <hi>Excellencie</hi> where
vnto ſhe was created, to be reputed ill. And yet in the
holy ſcriptures there is mention made aſwell of a <hi>Dalila</hi>
as of a <hi>Debora,</hi> of a <hi>Ieſabel</hi> as of a <hi>Iudith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is impoſſible indeed, that any good ſhould be
without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mixture of ill, becauſe there is no contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie
without his contrary, there could be no right if there
were no wronge. And what were health if there were no
ſickneſſe, what happines, if no miſaduenture, what were
loue if there were no hate, and ſo of good if there were
no ill.</p>
            <p>And as a diſcorde many times maketh the muſicke
to be the more ſweete, ſo the woman of lewde life ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
her that is good to ſhine the more glorious.</p>
            <p>There be a number of women in theſe dayes that of
my conſcience are both good and honeſt, and I am ſure
that they themſelues are deſirous ſo to be acounted, and
yet if we ſhould iudge of them by their outward ſhow,
as they vſe to pranck vp them ſelues in their light and
gaudy attire we ſhuld iudge them to be more <hi>Curtizan</hi>
like then euer was <hi>Lays</hi> of <hi>Corynth</hi> or <hi>Flora</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a hard matter therefore in this age to diſtinguiſh
betweene the good woman and the bad but now
as there belonges no ſhame to him that in wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16377:7"/>
a glorious garland, is ſometimes inforced to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
a handfull of flowers from a neighbours garden:
euen ſo, to adorne the ſubiect that I haue taken in hand
and the rather to beautifie ſo worthy a matter, I haue
borrowed the helpe of a learned diuine, who in a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
by him preached in the praiſe of good women,
firſt borrowed his text out of the booke of <hi>Prouerbs</hi> the
3. <hi>Chap.</hi> and the 14. verſe where <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of
a vertuous woman, ſaith <hi>ſhe is like a marchantes ſhip &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If their be any therefore that will preſume to find
fault with this deſcription now enſuinge, or that will
thinke the prayſes that are giuen to thoſe women that
are good, are ouer exceedinge, or the diſpraiſes of the ill
are too reprehending, let them vnderſtand that although
it were ſet downe by the hand of <hi>Solomon,</hi> a man (yet
ſuch a man as God himſelfe had approued to be the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
amongſt men) yet it was the finger of God that firſt
directed it; who by the hand of <hi>Solomon</hi> hath ſet downe
the true notes and markes whereby to diſtinguiſh the
good women from the bad, the vertuous from the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the godly from the vngodly.</p>
            <p>The firſt in the 10 verſe of the foreſaid Chap. of a
vertuous woman he ſaith <hi>Her price is farrnemore precious
then pearles:</hi> And proceeding ſtill in her praiſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
in the 14. verſe he ſaith <hi>ſhe is like a marchants
ſhippe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He firſt prizeth her what ſhee is worth eſteeming her
to be more precious then pearle, then he likeneth her to
what ſhe doth reſemble and that is <hi>To a marchants ſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as he ſetteth downe her value what ſhe is worth
and her reſemblance where vnto ſhe is like, ſo he giueth
certaine notes and knowledge of all her qualities how
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16377:7"/>
ſhe behaueth her ſelfe aſwell within doore as without,
and firſt towardes her huſband <hi>She will doe him good and
not euill all the dayes of her life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he giueth other notes, what be her exerciſes &amp;
how ſhe ſpendes her time <hi>She ſeeketh wooll and flax and
laboureth cheerefully with her hands:</hi> he forgetteth not to
giue vs ſpeciall markes of her ſpeaches, whereunto they
tend and how ſhe behaueth her ſelfe in her owne houſe
amongſt her family.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>She openeth her mouth with wiſdome, the law of grace is
in her tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>She ouerſeeth the wayes of her houſhoulde and eateth not of
the breade of Idlenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This deſcription of a good woman thus ſet downeby
<hi>Solomon,</hi> was not done without great conſideration for
he thought it not onely neceſſary to ſhewe what ſhe is
but alſo where vnto ſhe is like, that we might the rather
finde her out by ſome ſenſible reſemblance our ſauiour
<hi>Chriſt</hi> vſed the like when he reſembled his <hi>Diſciples to
ſalt</hi> and ſometimes likeneth himſelfe to a <hi>Vyne,</hi> to a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſtone</hi>
and figureth his bleſſed body to <hi>Breade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He likeneth the kingdome of heauen to a <hi>Huſbande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
to a <hi>Graine</hi> of <hi>muſtardſeed,</hi> to <hi>Leauen,</hi> to a <hi>Nett,</hi> to a
<hi>Marchant,</hi> to a <hi>King</hi> and all theſe with many other like,
thus reſembled for certeine properties and ſimilitudes,
wherein the one is like vnto the other.</p>
            <p>Now a good woman ſaith <hi>Solomon, is like vnto a ſhip:</hi>
but what ſhipp? <hi>Like vnto a merchantes ſhip that bringeth
in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Harlot</hi> is like to a ſhip too, but not like a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes
ſhip, but in truth like a <hi>Pyrat</hi> a <hi>Rouer,</hi> a <hi>Frebuter</hi>
and like ſuch a ſhip as lieth ſtill in waite for rapine and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16377:8"/>
for ſpoyle.</p>
            <p>An honeſt tradinge marchants ſhip is farre different:
and it was well noted by him that hath formerly ſet
downe the wife to be the ſhip, and the huſband to bee
the marchant, and the huſbands word to be the <hi>Routher</hi>
to the ſhipp, by the which ſhe muſt be turned, guided
and directed, ſhe muſt be a ſtirringe ſhip quicke of ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rige,
ready at a word of her huſband, ſhe muſt not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable
like ſome womenne that a man were as
good to remoue a houſe, as to remoue them from their
willes, but a good woman is like a ſhipp but not like a
houſe.</p>
            <p>She muſt be directed by diſcretion, and ſtill ſhape her
couſe both by <hi>compaſſe</hi> and by <hi>carde.</hi> I doe not meane
at a paire of playinge cardes: for ſhe that directes her
courſe that way is but an vnprofitable ſhip for an honeſt
trading marchante.</p>
            <p>The <hi>compaſſe</hi> and the <hi>carde</hi> that an honeſt woman is
to vſe, is her countenance and her conſideration, which
muſt be modeſt and vertuous.</p>
            <p>She muſt be balanced with <hi>Sobrietie</hi> and <hi>Grauity</hi> that
ſhe be not ouer ſet with euery light puffe of <hi>winde,</hi> ſhe
muſt not ſet ſayle to euery gale that bloweth, but to the
<hi>winde</hi> of <hi>wiſdome,</hi> the winde of her huſbandes breath,
for that is it that muſt direct her in her right courſe; ſhee
muſt not be too high <hi>cargde, nor to tant Maſted</hi> for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
ſafety is to beare a lowe ſayle.</p>
            <p>She muſt not ſayle but by leade and by line ſtill ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the deapth and foreſeeinge the danger, ſhe muſt
looke out for <hi>Rockes, Flattes, Shelfes</hi> and <hi>Sandes:</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering
any perill within her kenning to giue her huſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>band
warning, and (aſmuch as in her lieth) to helpe
him to avoyde it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:16377:8"/>
A further note is here left vnto me, that as a woman
is thus like a ſhip conſidered in her proper vertues, ſo
ſhe is likewiſe compared with her <hi>Owner</hi> and there ſhe
is like a ſhip indeed, for who ſo euer marries a wife may
well be called a <hi>Merchant venturer,</hi> for he makes a great
aduenture that adventures his credit, his reputation,
his eſtate, his quiet, his libertye, yea many men by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
do not onely aduenture there bodyes but many
times their ſoules.</p>
            <p>As the ſhip her ſelfe therefore muſt be very delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
and neuer ſayle but by ſounding, leſt by her vnhee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines
ſhe runs her ſelfe a ground: ſo he that goes about
a wife had neede to looke aſwell about him, leaſt hee
make ſuch a choice that for one daies pleaſure, he doth
purchaſe repentance all the dayes of his life after.</p>
            <p>They ſay a man ſhould rather chuſe a wife by his eares
then by his eyes, but for thoſe that will needes aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ſuch women as haue bene notoriouſly knowne
to be infamed, and being truly informed of them afore
hand, will yet needes marry them, they are like the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<hi>Mariners Act.</hi> 27. who becauſe they tooke not coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſayl
in the hauen which <hi>Paule</hi> had aduiſed, were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
after they put to ſea to reſolue vppon a wracke.</p>
            <p>A marchantes ſhip to be acounted well conditioned
muſt haue many qualities: but I ſay he is but a deſperate
marchant that will aduenture of a ſhip that is not ſtauch</p>
            <p>Shee is not a good marchants ſhip that is too tender
ſided that will ſtoupe to euery puffe, that doth but beate
vppon her quarter, and is ſo leward, if ſhe doe but bite a
little at a <hi>Bouline,</hi> that ſhe will hould no courſe but with
the winde in her poope.</p>
            <p>All theſe be ill conditions in a ſhip but eſpecially in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16377:9"/>
her that longes to a marchant.</p>
            <p>It is the property of a good ſhip to anſwere her <hi>Helme</hi>
readily and not to bee heard of ſtirreage but to feele
the <hi>Routher</hi> quickly and thereby to be turned, ruled and
directed in the courſe that ſhe ſhould hould, for that ſhip
that is not yeare of ſtirrage is apt to run into many perils
euen ſo that woman that is not ruled by her huſbandes
word but is croſſe and contrary to his directions is a
dangerous wife and runneth her ſelfe many times into
ſhame and infamy.</p>
            <p>But a good woman ſaith <hi>Soloman is like a Marchants ſhip</hi>
a worthy come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ndation: And although the wordes haue
beene many times repeated yet they cannot be too often
itterated for amongſt all other ſhippes that croſſeth the
ſeas the marchant is moſt profitable both for himſelfe
and his country, for ſhe is a ſhip onely for trade and traf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fique
to inrich him, by which example a good woman is
taught in all her endeuours to reſpect her huſbandes
profite.</p>
            <p>And as the marchants ſhip is thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious, ſo of
all other ſhe is moſt peaceable vppon the ſea, for ſhe was
built for peace and not for warre, for marchantes are in
nothing more ſory then to heare of warres but amongſt
all other things an honeſt true trading marchant cannot
indure to heare of a <hi>Pirate,</hi> that liues not by honeſt traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
but by common ſpoile, and as the ſhip of a <hi>Pirate,</hi>
(which is the true reſemblance to an adultrous woman)
is both loathed and ſhunned by the honeſt trading mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
ſo the time hath beene that a wicked woman wel
knowne to be infamed, was no leſſe abhorred by thoſe
that were honeſt but here good women are to learne,
that a marchant will in no wiſe conſort nor haue to doe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16377:9"/>
with a <hi>Pirate,</hi> but as he doth deteſt and abhorre her ſo he
ſeeketh by all poſſible meanes both to avoide &amp; ſhunne
her, it ſhould be ſo amongſt good women, if it be not ſo
the greater is her blame that will admit of a <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtizans</hi>
company.</p>
            <p>Againe the marchantes ſhip is a painefull ſhippe ſhee
muſt not be ſtill ridinge at ancker, or ready to runne into
euery porte or <hi>Hauer,</hi> but as ſhe muſt be obſeruatiue to
watch both wind and tide ſo to winn her voiage with
the more expedition, ſhe muſt ſome times be content to
beat it out at the ſea it ſelf although but with a bare and
a very ſcant gale.</p>
            <p>And a good woman is laborious, like the marchantes
ſhip that ſeekes to bring in, ſhee bringeth in by her good
foreſight, by her care, by her diligence, and by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of her gouernement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shee ſeeth that her marchandize are good, her candle is not
put out by night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shee riſeth while it is yet night and giueth the portion to her
houſhould and the ordinary to her maydes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>She putteth her fingers to the wheele and her handes handle
the ſpindle. pro.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Now a good ſauer is not onely a good getter but like
wiſe a good bringer in.</p>
            <p>The adultrous woman, ſhee bringeth in too, but by ſo
many filthy meanes, as were ſhamefull to be ſet downe.</p>
            <p>And as ſhee bringeth in by coſening, by chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
by gaming, and by ſhiftinge, not by painefull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
but by Idlenes, not by godlines, but by deuilliſhnes,
ſo ſhee ſpendes it againe as ſhamfully in dyſſolution, in
prodigalitie, in pride, in vanitie iuſt like the <hi>Pirate,</hi> that
when ſhe hath ſcoured the coaſt, and committed a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16377:10"/>
of ſpoiles with as many paſſengers as ſhe meetes ſhe
conſumes it againe in the next harbour, in ryot, in drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes,
in voluptuouſnes, &amp; in al manner of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
beaſtlines: heere is yet againe to bee remembred, what
hath beene already learnedly taught vs out of this text of
ſcripture, for heere is nowe to bee conſidered, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a vertuous woman, in many thinges may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
to a ſhip, yet there be ſome particular qualities
belonging to a ſhip, that a good woman muſt not haue
and that is, one ſhippe may belong to many marchants
and one marchant may be owner in many ſhips but this
is a ſpeciall note of the vnchaſt woman, for ſhe cries ſtill
the more the merrier: a marchant, neuer ſayleth but with
a conuenient company no more then will ſuffice to han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dle
her ſayles and to tackle the ſhip as neceſſitied requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Pirat,</hi> is ſtill double and treble manned, yea &amp;
ſo ouer peſtred with men, that ſhe hath more then ſhe is
well able to ſtowe: And all this ſhe vſeth as well for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
as for defence and againſt none ſo much as againſt
the moſt honeſt trading marchant.</p>
            <p>So the adultrous woman doth ſtill play of the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and ſhe ſhall haue tenne for one to take her part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any woman that is honeſt.</p>
            <p>Let me but craue pardon to ſet downe what I my
ſelfe haue obſerued in this caſe.</p>
            <p>I haue ſeldome ſeene an honeſt woman (which is here
reſembled to a marchantes ſhip) to haue many friendes
to  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

by any meanes to ſupport her vnles it be a father, a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a kinſman a huſbande or ſome ſuch like.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:16377:10"/>
But <hi>Thucidides</hi> will needes approue that woman to be
moſt honeſt, that is leaſt knowne &amp; I thinke indeed that
the moſt honeſt woman is leaſt ſpoken of, for they doe
pleaſe the leaſt in number, and vertue was neuer graced
by the multitude, now to ſpeake mine owne knowledge
I haue not heard of thoſe wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ouer much cloied

            <p>
               <hi>The lippes of a harlot (ſaith Salomon) drop like the honny

            <p>I ſay with <hi>Salomon,</hi> beware of the ſlightes of a <hi>Harlot,</hi>

to inflame, <hi>a body</hi> to performe, and all theſe to poiſon.</p>
            <p>And as ſhee inticeth them thus by her ſlightes ſo ſhee
diſperſeth them againe at her pleaſure, for ſome ſhee
ſends to the phiſition to ſeeke for helpe, ſome to the ſpit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle

there expences, ſome to the priſon there to lie and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
ſome to the gallowes to ende a wretched life, and
all to the deuill if they haue not grace to repent in time.</p>
            <p>Theſe wanton countenances, theſe immodeſt beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours

in all their enterteinementes that they cut of all
hope from the vicious minded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vertuous woman girdeth her loynes with ſtrength</hi> (ſaith

            <p>We may ſee here the difference between the good wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man

and eſtimation the other he confineth in the highe
way of death.</p>
            <p>There is now one other qualitie that a good woman
muſt in no wiſe borrow from a ſhip and that is too much
rigginge, and it is a great deale of charge and to very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
purpoſe that is beſtowed on ſome ſhips in ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the paintinge of <hi>Caage workes</hi> like the painting of

let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> looke into the 3. of <hi>Eſay</hi> from the 16. to the 24 verſe
where they ſhall finde that the wanton diſpoſed women
that were in that age hath left preſidents to thoſe that
are inclined to lightnes now.</p>
            <p>It hath been a queſtion, whether chaſtity ioyned with
vanity, doth deſerue any commendations, but I will not
diſpute, becauſe I will not offend: yet I doe thinke that
this ouermuch affected folly doth liue with no leſſe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected

            <p>Shee is an ill huſwife therefore of her credite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
that will doe any thing, to bring it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
that will giue any ſignes or ſhewes of lightnes,
whereby ſhee may be ſuſpected, becauſe a woman that is

once tainted in her honour, muſt be driuen to a harde

theſe and many other thinges that might be yet ſpoken
of but the <hi>vauntcurrers</hi> of adultry.</p>
            <p>There is mention made of a <hi>cannon</hi> in the <hi>ciuill lawe</hi>
where it was ordeyned that if a man did offer violence
to any woman were ſhe neuer ſo vertuous or honeſt, yet
atired like a ſtrumpet, ſhe had no remedie againſt him by

            <p>But this exceſſe that is now vſed in apparell doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
bring three thinges with it the firſt, <hi>Offence to God</hi>
the ſecond, <hi>It giueth hope to the vycious,</hi> and thirdly <hi>It
bringeth deſtruction to the huſbande.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the vertuous woman houldeth it a matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
to attyre her ſelfe no more coſtly then may well
ſtand with her huſbandes eſtate and abilitie, ſhe is loath
to bring him into debt or to ſet him on the ſcore for her
pride and brauery.</p>
            <p>She doth her huſband good, and not euill, all the dayes of her
life, <hi>ſayth</hi> Salomon.</p>
            <p>But ſhe doth her huſband little good that maketh him
to hange on the ſcore, aſwell to his owne hinderance as
to the vndoinge of other men, and but to maintaine and

            <p>But as the ſinne of <hi>Adam beganne at Eue,</hi> ſo the ruine the

               <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> in his <hi>Annals</hi> maketh mention how
the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they vſed to ſend any officers, or other

they would not ſuffer them to carry their wiues with

women doe allure and corrupt the manners of men, by

            </p>
            <p>By this I do note the impudency of theſe common

too ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y of theſe women ſuiters in theſe dayes if all were

            <p>But to ſpeake yet a little of the pride of theſe times I
might bouldly avouch, there is more treaſure ſpent and

            <p>The ſummes were infinite to be ſet downe that are

in a particular manner, it were out of mine eliment, my

            <p>But alas for pitty, how woe begone is that poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

            <p>And there is no remedy, but my <hi>Lady</hi> muſt be coacht
ſhe can not go to church to ſerue God without a coach:
ſhee that her ſelfe and her mother before her, haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
many a myle a foote, can not nowe croſſe the

not debarre thoſe Ladies or Gentlewomen, of any thing
that might eyther eaſe or pleaſe them: thoſe (I meane)
that from there infancy haue beene trained vp by there
able and worthy parentes, in a more dainty and delicate
manner, then thoſe other againe that neuer knewe what

            <p>It is truth, nature is ſometimes holpen by Arte but

haue beene taught long ſithens by <hi>Licurgus whelpes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe women that be of highe parentage, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

a diſcipline more noble and excellent, they cannot in
common iudgement, but proue more admirable aſwell
in the beauty of the body, as in the giftes of the minde.</p>

be therefore the more imperfect, but eſpecially in thoſe

            <p>A further note is yet left vnto me, that as hee is not to
be accounted the beſt marchant to the common wealth
which bringeth in toyes and trifles, and ſuch other fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies
as are both vaine and needles, but that bringeth in
ſuch commodities as may beſt ſerue neceſſitie, neither is
ſhe alwayes the beſt wife that is muſt adorned with new

that which is moſt needfull.</p>
            <p>And as thoſe ſhippes that are ſometimes the faireſt to
ſhowe, are not alwayes the fitteſt for vſe, neither are thoſe
women the more to be eſteemed, but much the rather to
be ſuſpected that do prank vp themſelues with too many

            <p>Yet in great and worthy perſons, ſuch as are of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

            <p>It is written of the daughter of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> when on a day

O (ſaid he) how farre more ſeemely is this attyre for the

ſhee aunſwered (and that with reuerence) then ſir, I vſed

            <p>The like example was vſed by that vertuous woman
<hi>Heſter,</hi> when ſhee proteſted to <hi>God</hi> that the ſumptuous
attyre which ſometimes ſhe vſed, carryed no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

that had choſen her for his owne.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Iudeth,</hi> when ſhee ſtripped her ſelfe out of her
ſackcloath, into more glorious garmentes, and decked
herſelfe with ſo many rich ornamentes, was it for any
other cauſe then to performe a ſeruice to the <hi>glory</hi> of
<hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not the <hi>Frocke,</hi> therefore that maketh the <hi>Frier</hi>
the more deuout, nor the garmentes of euery woman a
true confirmation of incontinency of life.</p>
            <p>This therefore may well be avowed by the rules of
Chriſtian ſobrietie, that a woman, neither exceeding the
decency of faſhion, nor going beyond the limites of her
owne eſtate, nor ſurpaſſing the boundes of her huſbands
calling, I do not thinke but ſuch a woman may weare
any thinge.</p>
            <p>Prouided alwayes, that ſhee braues it not out with
other mens goodes, that ſhee hanges not in the <hi>Mercers</hi>
bookes, in the <hi>Goldſmithes</hi> bookes, in the <hi>Taylers</hi> booke,
maintaininge her pride with other mens purſes like <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſops
Iay,</hi> that deckt her ſelfe with other birdes feathers</p>
            <p>This beauty which is ſo much eſteemed amongſt wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men
ſhould be <hi>a Looking glaſſe,</hi> whereby we might a farre
off, diſplay the Maieſty of the creator, and from thence
ſhould paſſe with the winges of our cogitations to the
contemplation of the higheſt fayre, which is the inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
beautie of the almightie God, from whence as from
a fountaine all ſmaller riuers deriue their beauties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:16377:15"/>
And as beauty is a bleſſing to a woman, ſo ſhee ſhould
learne of her mother nature to hide it, who couereth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
faire &amp; precious thing vnder ſhelles barkes rockes
yea and in bottomles deapthes, and not to lay it open as a
thing common.</p>
            <p>Precious thinges are not euery day ſet to open ſale,
and beautie layeth open her riches, not onely in the <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
but likewiſe in the compounds, not only on the ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perficiall
partes of the <hi>Earth,</hi> but euen within the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
thereof where ſhee hordeth them vp as in a ſafe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury:
the beautie of the minde is much more worth then
the beauty of the body, the inuiſible of better eſteeme
then the viſible.</p>
            <p>A beautifull woman knowinge her owne perfection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſhould ſo much the rather guide her ſelfe by the zeale of
honour and the bridle of ſhamefaſtnes, and not to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

of immodeſtie.</p>
            <p>A beautifull woman being robbed and ſpoyled of
thoſe excellent ornamentes of <hi>Modeſtie,</hi> and <hi>Baſhfullnes,</hi>
ſhee remaines naked both in price and honour and is ſo
much the more to be hated and deteſted.</p>
            <p>The beautie of the body, is but a ſliding ſhadow that
quickly vaniſheth away, wee ſhould therefore turne our
eyes to the beautie of the minde which is indeed, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
light that is free from all chaunge.</p>
            <p>If beautie it ſelfe be thus vaine and brittle, what is then

            <p>For this painting of faces, I thinke it exceedes ſo much
the more in many women to pleaſe the eyes of men
which they thinke are the ſooner drawne to a liking by
ſome appearing beauty wherein they ſomtimes exceede
ſo farre, that in ſteade of making themſelues louely, they
many times become loathſome and odious, not onely in
the conceiptes of all honeſt men, but euen to thoſe to
whom they be moſt deſirous to pleaſe and content.</p>
            <p>But ſhee that is not aſhamed to falſiſie thoſe exterior

            <p>And how many worthy women be there againe in
theſe dayes in whom the outward beauties of ther bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
do but expreſſe the inward beautie of the mindes.</p>
            <p>Nature hath ordained in all good and vertuous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
this affection of ſhame faſtnes, which ſerueth as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
to withhould them from thoſe artificiall abilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
that doe either ſmell of vanitie, or breed ſuſpect
of honeſty: for <hi>Baſhfulnes</hi> is it that moderates there

The bluſh of a womans face is an approbation of achaſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16377:16"/>
and honorable minde, and a manifeſt ſigne, that ſhee
doth not approoue any intemperate actions, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
laſciuious ſpeeches, and demeanours that are either
offered to herſelfe, or to any in her preſence.</p>
            <p>The woman that hath forgotten to bluſh, it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
ſhee is paſt grace, for <hi>Shamefaſtnes</hi> is not onely a
bridle to ſinne, but it is likewiſe the common treaſury of
feminine vertue.</p>
            <p>We haue hitherto heard, that a woman is likened to a
ſhip, the veruous <hi>to a ſhip of marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts:</hi> the vicious <hi>to a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>

and copper is like gold, yet all is not gold that gliſtereth,
and if euill women were not ſometimes like to good,
which indeed they be not, they could not deceiue ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
men as they doe.</p>
            <p>Let vs now ſee likewiſe what the vertuous woman doth,
for being, is knowne by doing as the tree is knowne by
his fruite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shee ſeeketh woolle and flaxe, and laboureth, ſhee putteth
her handes to the wheell &amp;c,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> pointed her a houſe-worke it ſhould ſeeme,
ſhee muſt not be a gadder about the ſtreetes but a <hi>Home

not her ſelfe to bodily labour, yet <hi>Shee ouer ſeeth the wayes
of her houſhould,</hi> ſhe muſt ſee to her children her ſeruantes
and her family.</p>
            <p>And a vertuous woman though ſhee bringe in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
that is of her owne earning, gotten with her

by her wiſdome by her gouernement and by her

            <p>The <hi>Harlot</hi> is of an other condition, for ſhee rather
ſeeketh to ſpend in vanity, then to bring in honeſtly, and
what is lewdly gotten is commonly as lewdly ſpent.</p>
            <p>As the certaine markes of a vertuous woman, is to be
a good huſwife, and to keepe her owne houſe, ſo one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eſpeciall note of the adulterous woman is:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Her feete cannot abide in her houſe, but now ſhee is without

            <p>A diſhoneſt woman is hardly kept within her owne

<hi>Iacob</hi> was warned by God, to make his returne amongſt
his owne kinred: <hi>He ſent and called Rahell and Leah to the
fieldes vnto his flocke:</hi> he ſent, and the meſſenger founde
them, for they were not to ſeeke, but <hi>the pathes of a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
are moueable, they are hard to be found</hi> (ſayth <hi>Solomon</hi>)
It was not ſo with them, for they were not ſo ſodainely
ſent for, but they were as readily found, and came away
with as great ſpeede: and ſuch expedition was made by
their willing readines, that <hi>Laban</hi> followed ſeuen dayes
iourny, before he could ouertake them.</p>
            <p>By this it might appeare, that <hi>Iacobs</hi> two wiues <hi>Rahell</hi>
and <hi>Leah,</hi> were no gadders amongſt their goſſips: onely
<hi>Iacobs</hi> daughter <hi>Dinah,</hi> in a gadding iourny to take the
gaze, made an ill voyage and came home with ſhame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:16377:17"/>
And <hi>Iacob</hi> himſelfe, though he were a good man, yet
hee had his infirmities, for as hee loued one wife better
then an other: ſo he loued one ſonne more dearely then
an other, which amongſt the reſt of his children cauſed
that malice and deſpite, as might haue coſt the life of
<hi>Ioſeph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>Iacob</hi> was not free from theſe infirmities, ſo he
was ſubiect to other ſeuerall croſſes: firſt <hi>Laban</hi> beguileth
him: then his moſt dearly beloued wife, was a long time
barren: his ſonne <hi>Ruben</hi> defileth his bed, &amp; committeth
inceſt with <hi>Bilhah,</hi> his daughter <hi>Dinah</hi> was rauiſhed in the
idle iourny ſhee made to viſite the daughters of a ſtrange
people.</p>
            <p>But if I ſhould ſpeake of the diſorders of his children
in generall, I might amplifie much more then properly
belongeth to the ſubiect that I haue taken in hand: but
theſe are examples for our learning, to teach vs to walke
warily, and to be very circumſpect how we gouerne our
ſelues in the affayres of this vncertaine world, where our
affections are apt and ready to leade vs aſtray.</p>
            <p>The matter that I would make euident is, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
men may ſometimes be wronged by a diſloyal wife:
and heere is yet a further note to be obſerued: for <hi>Rahel</hi>
and <hi>Leah</hi> that had beene trayned vp in a generous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by <hi>Laban</hi> their father, (and were both of them aſwel
perfected by nature as by nurture) continued the honor
and dignity of their ſexe to their dying day; but <hi>Bilhah</hi>
that was a woman of a more ſeruile eſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſhee wronged <hi>Iacob,</hi> defiling his bedde with one of
his owne ſonnes: the hyſtory is very well knowne, and
by the circumſtances wee may boldly conclude, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16377:17"/>
whatſoeuer hee bee, that will take ſuch a wife as hath
beene trayned vp in a baſe education, let him be ſure
ſhee will ſhew her ſelfe no leſſe baſe in condition.</p>
            <p>But to returne to our former purpoſe, we haue heard
that the woman of honeſt life, keepeth her owne houſe:
<hi>Shee ouer ſeeth the wayes of her houſhold,</hi> but the other, <hi>her
feete can not abide in her houſe: but ſhee ſitteth in her doores,
inticing the paſſers by, to enter, but her gueſts that goe in are
in the depth of hell. Pro.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Depart from her therefore, thou that are wiſe, keepe thy
ſelfe aloofe from her, and come not neare the doores of her houſe</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt theſe inſtructions thus left vnto vs, there is
yet one other note ſet downe by <hi>Solomon,</hi> what the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
woman doth: <hi>She eateth not the bread of idlenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſpeake truly, ſhee that is ſo negligent to looke
into her houſhold affaires, that her diligence doth not
counteruaile her meate, ſhee is vnworthy to eate at all,
but our women now are growne to bee ſo dainty mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed,
that the ordinary foode that their mothers were
brought vpp withall, is nowe become too baſe for the
daughters.</p>
            <p>All muſt bee dainty, though ſometimes creditors do
wring for it, yea, and their owne huſbands ſometimes
for company: like <hi>Eue</hi> the wife of <hi>Adam,</hi> who amongſt
all the trees in paradiſe, none woulde ſerue, but that
which was her husbands bane.</p>
            <p>I do not ſpeake againſt <hi>Hoſpitality,</hi> or good houſekee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping:
for bounty is neuer repugnant to honeſty, but doth
alwayes rather accompany it.</p>
            <p>The matter that I reprehend, is this prodigall nicity,
that is good for nothing, vnleſſe to verifie the prouerbe,
<hi>Farre fetcht and dear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:16377:18"/>
Theſe womens mindes that are not ruled by the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of <hi>Shamefaſtnes,</hi> they doe ſet their whole deſires of
thoſe things which doe beſt befit their owne pleaſures
and delightes, and doe hunt after nothing elſe, but after
ſuch things as doe giue way to their owne contents, and
that is, to loue variety aſwell in meates, as in all other
things, to deſire nouelties, to follow delicacies, and are
common gueſtes at banquets, and are apt and ready to
frequent tables, that be furniſhed and peſtred with too
many ſuperfluities: the which doe naturally incline to
concupiſcence, for this diuerſity of nouriſhing meates
(being ſo much the more increaſed by ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
odours and perfumes) it carries them headlong to
the higheſt degree of <hi>Intemperance:</hi> for where <hi>Senſe</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
ſway, and without the Curbe or Bridle of <hi>Vertue,</hi> is
made predominant: there <hi>Reaſon</hi> is made a <hi>Slaue,</hi> and
is ledd into a delight ſome kinde of <hi>Lethargie,</hi> to the end
it ſhould not be able to diſcerne that <hi>error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Such is the way of an adulterous woman</hi> (ſayth <hi>Solomon</hi>)
<hi>ſhee eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſayth, I haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Me thinkes <hi>Solomon</hi> in theſe words, hath painted out
the perfect picture of a <hi>harlot,</hi> as ſhee ſitteth at her table.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shee eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſayth, I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
no iniquitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shee eateth, but not of the labour of her handes, or
of her owne honeſt indeuours: but ſhee eateth the bread
of idlenes, and not of idlenes alone, but of that which
is brought in by ſinne, by wickednes, by deceipt, and
many times, by filthy abhomination.</p>
            <p>Yet ſhee ſitteth and ſimpereth amongſt the infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
fooles that frequent her, and (alas ſayth ſhee) I
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16377:18"/>
am innocent, free from ill thought, I am not vengable,
I am not malicious: I am loath to offend any, I neuer did
wronge, alas I am harmeles,</p>
            <p>And thus ſhee wipeth her mouth &amp; ſayeth, <hi>I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
no iniquitie:</hi> when in truth there is nothing in her
but malice, there is nothing in her but miſcheife, there is
nothing in her but diſſention, but lying, but ſlandering,
but ſtirring of ſtrife, but drawing of quarrels, but ſetting
of men together by the eares, but coſening and cheating
to maintaine pompe and prodigalitie: and pompe and
prodigallity vphoulden againe thereby to draw in <hi>Fools</hi>
to be coſened and cheated.</p>
            <p>O beware therefore, of the ſubtleties of a <hi>Harlot,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware

for looking out of my window in an euening, I ſaw a yong man
paſſing through the ſtreetes, and behould a woman met with
him, that was of a Harlotes behauiour, ſmooth of her tongue

            <p>This deſcription is made by <hi>Salomon</hi> in his booke

One other note of the vertuous woman: <hi>Shee openeth
her mouth with wiſedome, and the law of grace is in her tongue</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The woman of modeſty openeth not her mouth but
with diſcretion, neither is there any bitternes in her
tongue: ſhee ſeemeth in ſpeaking, to hould her peace,
and in her ſilence ſhee ſeemeth to ſpeake.</p>
            <p>Her very countenance doth preach modeſty, ſobrietie
baſhfullnes, continency, temperance, ſtayednes humilitie
grace and goodnes:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Harlot</hi> is full of words <hi>Shee is babling and lowde</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Salomon</hi>) <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>She is bould, ſhe is impudent, ſhee is ſhameles ſhee is
immodeſt, ſhee will bluſh at nothing, ſhee is preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
ſhee is a diſgrace to womanhood and fit for no com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany
but for the laſciuious, yet againe the vertuous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>will doe her huſband good and not ill all the dayes of her
life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the wicked woman is a reproch to her huſband,
and ſhee doth him more iniury, then all her good is able
to counteruaile, he ſhall find it in his purſe by her prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie,
by her pride, by her vanitie: for ſhee maketh him
ſtill fitter to craue new credite, then to pay old debtes</p>
            <p>He ſhall find it in his credite and reputation, for he is
mocked ſcorned and derided, by as many as knowe him
and is pointed at as he paſſeth through the ſtreetes.</p>
            <p>To conclude <hi>a vertuous woman is a crowne to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
but ſhee that maketh him aſhamed is as corruption in his
bones. Pro.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>We do ſee that a vertuous woman is compared in the
ſcriptures to be like vnto many thinges: for ſometimes
ſhee is likened to a marchantes ſhip, ſometimes to a lilie
ſometimes to a garden of pleaſant flowers, ſometimes to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16377:19"/>
a ſpring of ſweete water: <hi>Dauid</hi> likeueth her to a fruitfull
vine and here ſhee is compared to a crowne.</p>
            <p>We may ſee, a vertuous woman is like vnto many
thinges: but as <hi>Salomon</hi> hath ſaid <hi>pearles and precious ſtones
are not like vnto her:</hi> ſhee is ineſtimable.</p>
            <p>Theſe notes of women thus formerly ſpoken of, are
giuen vs by <hi>Salomon,</hi> whereby to diſtinguiſh the good
from the bad, for as I haue already ſaid there hath beene
both good and bad and that from the beginning.</p>
            <p>And as ſaint <hi>Paule,</hi> writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſaith
<hi>there muſt be Heriſies that they that are proued may be known</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſay I: amongſt women there muſt be bad amongſt
the good that thoſe that are good may be the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>As vertues then had their beinge in the world: ſo vices
did neceſſaryly accompany them and haue the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
or decreaſing the one as the other.</p>
            <p>It cannot therefore be ſaid: that vices do more abound
at this preſent then in former ages, but we muſt confeſſe
the like of vertues, that are more exceeding now then in
times paſt they haue beene for what is there remaininge
vnder the heauens that is not perfected.</p>
            <p>I dare bouldly avouch, there is no arte no ſcience no
occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor handicraft, nor any other profeſſion what
ſo euer, but there is innouation, and from age to age, all
thinges are perfected bettered and drawne to a forme of
greater excellency then euer our preadeceſſours vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of.</p>
            <p>And as by this continuance of time, goodnes is made
better, ſo ill is made worſe: &amp; as good women are more
vertuous, ſo ill women are more vicious.</p>
            <p>From hence I would conclude, that as the world was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16377:20"/>
yet neuer deſtitute of good women, but that from age to
age it was ſtill repleniſhed, and that in moſt aboundant
manner: ſo I am perſwaded, that at this preſent howre,
good women are not onely as plentifull as they haue
beene in times paſt, but that they are nowe more ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent,
then euer they were before, not for that the
good women of former ages, did omitte any goodnes
that then was known, but becauſe our predeceſſors were
ignorant (indeede) of many things appertaining both
to good and ill, that is now frequent and conuerſant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to euery vnderſtanding.</p>
            <p>Wee haue now learned from <hi>Salomon,</hi> the true notes
and markes of a good woman, both what ſhee is, and
whereby we may both know and finde her.</p>
            <p>And wee ſee it is not ſhee, that can ſhow the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
face, it is not ſhee that can dance the moſt lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſinquapace, it is not ſhee that is too lauiſh of her lips,
or to looſe of her tongue, it is not ſhee that hath forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to bluſh, nor to be aſhamed at any thing, it is not ſhe
that is either too coy, or yet too curteous: why then? mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie
is it, that is the true marke of euery good woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;
ſhee that hath once loſt that vertue, ſhe hath loſt her eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
ſhe hath nothing to ſhow that ſhe is a woman, but
rather a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſter in the habit or ſhape of a woman, odible
in the ſight of <hi>God</hi> and hatefull and deteſtable before all
good men: if there be any that will impugne theſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
thus ſet downe by <hi>Salomon,</hi> they can be none but
ſuch as wil impugne the verity of the holy ſcriptures: for
if the ſcriptures be true <hi>Salomon</hi> was the wiſeſt that euer
was amongſt men: and out of the depth of this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
hee hath giuen vs theſe notes which he hath left
vnto vs in his bookes of <hi>Prouerbes,</hi> a booke firſt inſpired
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16377:20"/>
by the ſpirit of <hi>God,</hi> a booke <hi>Cannonized</hi> allowed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The infallible markes of a vertuous woman then, as
they are ſet downe by <hi>Salomon</hi> are theſe, ſhee muſt haue
<hi>modeſty, haſhfullnes, ſilence, abſtinence, ſobrietie:</hi> ſhee muſt be
tractable to her huſband, <hi>Shee doth her huſband good &amp;c.
Shee</hi> muſt not bee a vaine talker <hi>She openeth her mouth
with wiſdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shee muſt be carefull of her family <hi>Shee ouerſeeth the
wayes of her houſhould,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shee muſt be full of exerciſes: <hi>Shee eateth not the bread
of idlenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the woman that is <hi>impudent, immodeſt, ſhameles,
inſolent, audacious, a night walker, a company keeper, a gadder
about the ſtreets,</hi> if ſuch a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred amongſt
thoſe women that be good, then <hi>Salomon</hi> was a <hi>Foole,</hi>
that hath avowed the contrary, and then the ſcriptures

ſelfe is a promiſe breaker, and was not true of his word
