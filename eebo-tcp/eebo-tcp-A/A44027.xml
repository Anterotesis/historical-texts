            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN regard that the turbulent Spirit of Phanaticiſm cannot promote its Intereſt, or delude the People, unleſs they are made to have an ill opinion of their Lawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Paſtours, it hath alway had recourſe to Forgery and Lying, as its principal Sanctuary, defending it ſelf, and endeavouring to appear Innocent by other mens reproaches. Which hath ever been the way of upholding Faction; and (although it be most horribly detestable) hath had its dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous deſigned Effects in a very great meaſure, while cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous men too readily receive and countenance the Authors of malicious Relations. One Example whereof we have in this, that is the occaſion of this enſuing Narrative, which his Lordſhip the Right Reverend Father in God, the Biſhop of <hi>Briſtol</hi> hath permitted to be Publiſhed to undeceive thoſe, who have been abuſed by the bold and notoriouſly falſe Reports concerning Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi>'s Impriſonment and Death.

            </p>
            <p>On the Tenth of <hi>February</hi> 1674, Mr. <hi>John Thompſon</hi> was committed by <hi>Ralph Olliffe</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> our Mayor, Sir <hi>John Knight</hi> K<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, and others His Majeſty's Juſtices of the Peace here, upon the Act of Parliament, made for reſtraining of Non-conformiſts from coming into Cities and Corporations; to remain a Priſoner, without Bayl or Mainpriſe, for Six Months.</p>
            <p>The next day after his Commitment I offered Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> (being a corpulent man) the liberty and favour to walk upon the Leads, and take the freſh Air, (which is not uſually allowed to other Priſoners) which offer was by him willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. I accompanied him thither, whence we took a proſpect of the City, and Countrey adjacent, and Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> was pleaſed to declare the Air there to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29762:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 71 -->be very wholeſom; and he walked there ſeveral other times afterwards (being allowed the Keys for that purpoſe) as often as he pleaſed; he having Company with him, and not being denyed the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the Society of any that came to viſit him.</p>
            <p>But within three days after his Commitment he complained to me he was ſick in his Stomach, and ſaid he would take a Vomit: I told him, I ſuppoſed a Vomit not ſafe for him by reaſon of his corpulency, and therefore did, in ſome meaſure, diſſwade him from it. But by advice of Dr. <hi>Chancy</hi> he took a Vomit, which, as I verily believe, did not work kindly with him: For, the Afternoon of the ſame day wherein he took it, he complained to me that he was very Sick, and had a great pain in his Head; which Diſtemper continued, and increaſed violently on him till his Death, which was the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> following.</p>
            <p>The firſt four days of his Commitment he had for his Lodging the privareſt Chamber in the Houſe, being no part of the Common Priſon, but of the Apartments belonging to my ſelf, (as Keeper) and my Family, and the beſt Room that was then void, and at my command, and had the company of his Wife till the Monday after his Commitment, being the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February;</hi> when Mr. <hi>Hardcaſtle</hi> and Mr. <hi>Weeks</hi> were committed to my cuſtody, for the like offence againſt the ſame Act. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hardcaſtle,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Weeks,</hi> with ſeveral Friends of theirs ſolicited me to ſpare them the largeſt, faireſt, and moſt pleaſant Chamber in the Priſon, which ſome of Your Lordſhips Servants well know to be ſuch.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:29762:5"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 71 -->
            <p>This Room (though taken up by ſeveral other Priſoners, who lodged there before Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi>'s Commitment) I was willing on the requeſt of Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hardcaſtle,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Weeks,</hi> and their Friends, to procure the former Priſoners to quit, and reſign to them; which was accordingly done.</p>
            <p>In this Chamber (having in it two large Feather-Beds, and furniture anſwerable) theſe three Gentlemen were lodged, until that Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi>'s Sickneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, and his company proving more troubleſom, Mr. <hi>Hardcaſtle</hi> and Mr. <hi>Weeks</hi> deſired to have another Chamber, wherein were two other Feather-Beds; which was granted them, and they continued there till Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi>'s Death.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> being dead, I cauſed an Inquiſition to be taken, (as the manner is) a Copy whereof Signed by one of the Coroners, I lately ſent to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. During all this time of Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi>'s Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, he was Accommodated both in his Health and Sickneſs, with variety of all ſorts of the beſt Proviſions and Wines our City affords; and with three Phyſician,, who attended him in his Sickneſs, His Diſtemper whereof he dyed, was, as his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians all agreed, a violent and malignant Feaver; being dead, he was decently interr'd in Chriſtian Burial.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgotten to acquaint Your Lordſhip of <hi>Andrew Gifford</hi>'s Commitment, who came in about ten days after Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> for the like Offence as the reſt.</p>
            <p>And whereas 'tis reported that theſe Gentlemen were put into a Dungeon, and denyed neceſſary

            <p>But on the contrary, the Impriſonment of Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> was, and that of the other three is managed with ſo much Chriſtian tenderneſs towards them, that they were admitted to partake of all the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes their Friends were pleaſed to heap on them; which conſiſted in daily entertaining them with all ſorts of the beſt Proviſions and Wines. If I ſhould tell Your Lordſhip what farther Favours and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes theſe Priſoners have been indulged, ſince their Commitment, I may poſſibly ſubject the Sheriffs (my Maſters) and my ſelf to juſt Cenſure and Penalties; and therefore ſhall beg Your Lordſhips pardon, and, in haſt, reſt</p>
