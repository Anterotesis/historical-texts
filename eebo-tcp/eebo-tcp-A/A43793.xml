         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> Received yours of the <hi>20th</hi> Inſtant, in which you
deſire to be Inform'd of the Truth of a Story, which
you ſay, you have ſeen in a ſmall Printed Paper,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46414:3"/>
called, <hi>The Happy Virgin,</hi> of a <hi>French</hi> Girl late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Cured after an extraordinary manner in a moment
of time of an old inveterate Lameneſs, which hath
been always thought Incurable by any Art of Man;
as ſhe was Reading the Story of our Saviours Healing
and Pardoning of the Paralitic; being therefore always
ready to ſerve you in what I may, and being my
ſelf alſo much affected with the thing, I have enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fully into the Matter, and do not in the leaſt doubt
of its Truth and Certainty; though I am very much
concern'd and ſcandalized at that Relation, which you
have ſeen in that Printed Paper, becauſe it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
untrue in many things, and particularly in what it
ſays of an unhappy Fall from a Table, which bruiſed
and broke the Childs Hip and other Bones; which are
nothing ſo, but do very much diſparage the Story it ſelf
in the Account it pretends to give of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having Inform'd my ſelf ſufficiently (as I think)
about it, I ſhall give you a Plain and True Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the matter of Fact, without any Remarks, or
Obſervations of my own, for the thing being undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
true, needs nothing to ſet it off, or recommend it
to the World, there being no Parties of Men that I
know of that endeavour to ſerve themſelves by it any
further than to be ſatisfied of its Truth, and give
Glory to God for the things that he hath done; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46414:3"/>
you are your ſelf too great a Judg of ſuch
watters, for me to Attempt any thing more than the
Relation it ſelf, which in Obedience to your Commands,
for ſuch all your Requeſts are with me, I here withal
ſend you, and give you free leave to impart it to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of your Friends as you think fit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MAriane Maillard,</hi> the Perſon of whom you
deſire an Acconnt, is the Daughter of
one Mr. <hi>John Maillard</hi> a French Proteſtant, of the
Town of <hi>Cognar,</hi> in <hi>Saintonge,</hi> where he Lived
in good repute, being a Sword-Cutler by Trade,
and a very Honeſt Man, and had four Children,
of which this <hi>Mariane</hi> was the Eldeſt, who when
ſhe was Six Months Old, became Lame by an
accidental Fall out of her Fathers Arms, who
being very fond of her, would be frequently
playing with her, toſſing her up, and catching
her again, till at laſt he very unhapyily let her
fall to the Ground, where ſhe received, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
afterwards, a very conſiderable hurt in her
left ſide; which he not then apprehending any
danger from, thinking that it might be only a
little Bruiſe that would be ſoon well again; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46414:4"/>
being unwilling to tell his Wife of it, for fear of
frighting, or troubling of her, took no further
care about it, till at laſt perceiving that her Hip
was out, by the wryneſs of the Leg and Foot,
and very diſtorted motion when the Child began
to go, the Heel turning almoſt quite forward, he
became extreamly concern'd at it, and deſir'd the
help of ſeveral Surgeons, who after they had
ſeen it, declar'd it to be incurable, as did alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other Surgeons, both in <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
and particularly Mr. <hi>Dubatt,</hi> a very Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Surgeon in <hi>Green-Street</hi> near <hi>Leiſter-Fields,</hi>
to whom it was ſhewn by her Parents afterwards,
and that the Cure of it could not be attempted
without endangering the Life of the Child, and
expoſing it to the moſt exquiſite Pain and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which the Parents by no means conſenting
to, choſe rather to ſubmit to the Will of God,
than try ſo cruel and deſperate an Experiment:
And by this means the Child continued Lame,
growing ſtill more and more crooked and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as it grew up, being always ready to fall as
ſhe went along; and thus ſhe continued till ſhe
was 6 or 7 years old, when her Father was forc'd
to fly out of <hi>France,</hi> upon the Dragooning part
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46414:4"/>
of the <hi>French</hi> Perſecution, chuſing rather to do ſo
than change his Religion; and ſo taking his Wife
and Four Children with him, of which this was
the Eldeſt, he fled firſt into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> traveling
only by Night, enduring great hardſhips, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping
many dangers; where having ſtaid ſome
time, he came from thence through <hi>Germany</hi> into
<hi>Holland;</hi> and at laſt came over into <hi>England</hi> about
the time of the late Revolution; but being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
poor, and not able to maintain his Wife
and Children, he obtain'd to be made a Serjeant
in one of the <hi>French</hi> Regiments that went over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> under the Command of Capt. <hi>De La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheroſi,</hi>
in Col. <hi>Corbon</hi>'s Regiment, where he ſerved
the Regiment Two Years, but the Pay not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
his Expectation and Neceſſities, he was
forc'd to quit that Imployment, and return to his
Trade, and went over every year with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
into <hi>Flanders,</hi> there to mend and ſell Swords.
His Wife alſo being an Induſtrious and Skillful
Woman, went amongſt the <hi>French</hi> Refugees, to
make the Beds, and clean the Rooms of thoſe
that were ſick, by which means ſhe got a ſmall
ſubſiſtence for her ſelf and Children, being paid
an half penny for each Room. And in this ſort
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46414:5"/>
of Service ſhe continued for ſome time, taking
this Girl, for the moſt part, along with her,
who us'd, as far as ſhe was able, to aſſiſt her
Mother, and ſoon became very ſerviceable to
her, till one day as ſhe was attending thus upon
one Madam <hi>Laulan,</hi> who fled hither from the
<hi>French</hi> Perſecution, and formerly, for about 12
or 13 years together had been a Domeſtick of
Marſhal <hi>Turene;</hi> during his being a Proteſtant,
waiting upon his Lady (a Perſon of Eminent Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
Charity and Wiſdom, and a great Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of all of the Reform'd Religion in <hi>France</hi> that
needed her Countenance and Aſſiſtance) in the
Quality of her Woman, who perceiving the Girl
very towardly, and willing to do any thing ſhe
could for her Mother, was ſo pleas'd with her,
(being then very ill her ſelf, and having a Son
alſo ſick at the ſame time, who is ſince dead) that
ſhe took her to look to them both, and to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
upon Errands as ſhe had occaſion, inſtead of
a Nurſe, or other Servant, which ſhe was not
able to maintain; And with her ſhe lived Three
Years, doing all things with greater care and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
than could have been expected from her
Years and Condition, being then but a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46414:5"/>
nine years old, and withal ſo much afflicted
with extream Pains by reaſon of her Lameneſs,
that ſhe rather ſeem'd to need one to attend upon
her, than to be put to attend upon an other;
and indeed if meer poverty had not forced her
to it, ſhe might well have been excuſed from
that ſort of Service; but her Parents not being
able to maintain her better, were glad of the
opportunity to diſpoſe of her ſo well, knowing
Madam <hi>Laulan</hi> to be a very pious and good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
Woman, and indeed the Girl was ſo pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with her New Service, and took ſuch a liking
to her Miſtreſs, that ſhe ſeem'd well contented
with her Condition, and bore her Affliction with
the greateſt patience (tho ſhe often felt great
pain in her Hip and Leg on that ſide on which
ſhe was Lame, eſpecially in Foggy Miſty Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.)</p>
               <p>The only thing that moſt ſenſibly Afflicted her,
was the ſcoffing perſecution which ſhe daily met
with from the Boys in the Streets; who ſeeing her
ſtrange diſtorted manner of goiug (which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
very unuſual) were wont to follow her, and
pull her with great Rudeneſs, calling her <hi>Crooked
Monſter,</hi> &amp;c. of which ſhe frequently complain'd
to her Mrs. who being a very good Chriſtian, gave
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46414:6"/>
her ſtill the beſt Advice and Comfort that ſhe
could, telling her, that there was no help for her.
and therefore ſhe muſt bear it with patience; which
indeed ſhe did for a long time.</p>
               <p>But on <hi>Sunday,</hi> the 26th of <hi>November,</hi> laſt paſt,
as ſhe return'd home in the Evening from Church,
ſhe was much concern'd to ſee a Man, as ſhe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
about Forty years of Age, joyn with the
Boys in abuſing and tormenting of her, telling
her Miſtreſs when ſhe came home, with many
Tears, that ſhe thought he might have been
better Imployed than to Laugh at her, who had
already but too much Sorrow and Affliction from
her Condition; her Miſtreſs endeavoured to
Comfort her again, as ſhe uſed to do, and told
her, That if ſhe would thus trouble her ſelf
every time ſhe was ſo uſed, ſhe would have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uough
to do, and never want for Vexation,
ſince her Lameneſs was Incurable, and would
remain ſo all her Life long, and that therefore
ſhe muſt reſolve to be Patient, and to Commit
her Cauſe to God, uſing ſeveral other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with her to the ſame purpoſe, to pacify
her Mind, and allay her Trouble, and the more
to put theſe thoughts out of her head, having
eaten a little Supper, ſhe bid her take her Bible
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46414:6"/>
and Read a Chapter to her, as ſhe uſed to do
every day in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> The place that
ſhe was then to Read, in the courſe of her daily
Reading, was the 2d of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> but opening
the Bible, ſhe hapned to meet with that place of
St. <hi>Matt.</hi> where the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſpeaks of St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Peter's</hi>
Mother, who lay ſick of a Fever, and was by our
Saviour's touching of her immediately cur'd.</p>
               <p>Her Mrs. liking that place, becauſe it had ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to her preſent diſtemper, which was an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Fever, and r<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>turn'd every day, and continu'd
for a long time, bid her read that out before ſhe
turn'd to her own Chapt. Which ſhe did, and when
ſhe had done they had ſome diſcourſe upon it, the
Mrs. ſaying, <hi>Oh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how happy ſhould I be if I were thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
from my Fever: And I</hi> (adding the maid) <hi>if I were
Cur'd of my Lameneſs.</hi> After this ſhe turn'd to her own
Chapter, which hepned to be the 2<hi>d</hi> of St. <hi>Mark;</hi>
where upon reading the Story of the man that was
ſick of the <hi>Palſie,</hi> whoſe Faith our Saviour there
commends; amongſt the reſt that aſſiſted in letting
him down thro' the Roof into his preſence, and
whom he not only cures, but grants beſides the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
of his ſins too: She made a ſtop, and began
to exclaim againſt the <hi>Scribes,</hi> not only for perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their incredulity, but for accuſing our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46414:7"/>
alſo of Blaſphemy, ſaying to her <hi>Mrs. Oh how wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

when he had done ſo many Miraeles; I am ſure I ſhould
have done quite otherwiſe; and if I ſhould hear of ſuch a thing
I ſhould immediately run to him and believe.</hi> And whilſt
ſhe was thus ſpeaking, ſhe had her leg ſtretch'd out
towards her <hi>Mrs.</hi> who bid her pull it back, telling
her it was not decent to put it ſo near her; to whom
the maid reply'd, <hi>Mrs. I did not complain much to day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you forbad me, but I do aſſure you I have felt a great
deal of pain, as I uſe to do in all miſty weather.</hi> And at the
ſame time as they were thus talking together, they
heard ſuddenly a great ſnap, which they both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
very plain, the <hi>Mrs.</hi> thinking it had been ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the fire that made that noiſe; but the maid
riſing up very haſtily, crys Out, <hi>Mrs. Did you hear the
noiſe? It was my Hip-bone that is certainly reſtored to its place;</hi>
and throwing her ſelf upon her mrs. with ſuch
tranſports of Joy, as if she had been beſide her ſelf;
she embrac'd her knees about ſo faſt, that she could
not get her off, ſaying, <hi>my dear miſtriſs,</hi> I <hi>am well, my pain
is all gone, and</hi> I <hi>hear ſomething that ſays, thou art cured, my
joy is ſo great that</hi> I <hi>cannot tell where</hi> I <hi>am, nor what</hi> I <hi>do:
pray feel your ſelf and ſee here the hollow place is filled up, and
the ſwelling quite gone; Oh God be thanked; pray let me go
and ſhew it the Landlord and Landlady, and the Maid below</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:46414:7"/>
                  <hi>Stairs;</hi> and ſo walkt ſeveral turns about the Room
without any pain at all, her foot being now ſtrait as
the other. And thus she has continu'd ever ſince, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that leg being a little shorter than the other (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
through the long continuance out of its place
which hindred its due growth, and the neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion
of the Nerves and Sinews; She therefore halts
a little ſtill, but has nothing at all of that monſtrous
diſtorted lameneſs which she had before, and which
all that knew her then, and have ſeen her now, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but extreamly wonder at, and praiſe God for.</p>
               <p>Her Mrs. ſeeing her in theſe tranſports of joy, was
afraid at firſt that she was or would be quite beſide
her ſelf; but conſidering the matter well, and ſeeing
with her own Eyes the wonderful change that was
made in her condition, the hollow place which she
had often, and but that very day ſeen and felt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
fill'd up, the bone in its proper place, and her
leg and foot now ſtrait and right as it should be;
She bid her not think of going down ſtairs that
night, but rather fall upon her <hi>knees,</hi> and give God
his due praiſe, who had done ſo much for her, and
who in a minutes time had cur'd a pain and lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that had been of 12 years continuance, which
no Art of man could do; aud ſo they accordingly
did, it being then late, went both to bed, vvhere the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46414:8"/>
poor Girl could hardly reſt or ſleep for Joy. The
next morning she shew'd it to as many of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
as she could meet with, who could not
but wonder at ſo ſtrange and unlook'd for a thing.
Her Parents ſavv it vvith tears of Joy, and have, as
they ought, ſent Bills into the Churches, that God
might be the more glorified, and his praiſes be ſet
forth the better by vvhole Congregations.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, I have given you a plain, but very
true and exact Account of this Matter, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with your earneſt and well intended en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
after it, to which I might indeed add, for
the full Confirmation of it, a great number of
Certificates and Affidavits (having ſome by me)
from many hundreds of Perſons that have ſeen
and known this Girl both before and ſince her
Cure, and are able to give a full and ſatisfactory
Account of her, to all that ſhall be deſirous more
particularly to be Inform'd about her; but to
what purpoſe ſhould I give my ſelf and you that
Trouble, ſince the ſame enquiry into the Truth
of thoſe Certificates and Affidavits, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the confirmatiod of them, would be
ſufficient to ſatisfy any body of the Truth of the
thing; let it ſuffice therefore to ſhew you that
ſhe was Perſonally known to Mr. <hi>Du Batt,</hi> whom
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46414:8"/>
I mention'd before; to the Lady <hi>Sunderland,</hi> and
her Family, whether ſhe often reſorted, and
where ſhe was always well accepted, and receiv'd
many Charitable Kindneſſes, both in Meat and
Mony, and who will all Teſtify to the Truth of
her Lameneſs; as will alſo moſt of Mr. <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s
Family, whither ſhe alſo went very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſell ſome little things for her Mrs. which
they uſed in Charity and Compaſſion to Buy of
her; to theſe I might add above 100 perſons more
of this Nation, beſides an innumerable company
of her own, who all knew and pittied her ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and who now rejoyce and wonder to ſee
her ſo perfectly Cur'd in ſo ſhort a time. One thing
indeed will be neceſſary for me to give you a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
account concernidg the place of her abode,
and where ſhe may be found, that ſo all doubting
perſons may be fully ſatisfied in the Truth of this
matter that are any ways deſirous to be inform'd
of it, and when this ſtrange and amazing Cure was
Wrought, ſhe liv'd with her Mrs. who Lodg'd at
an <hi>Apothecary</hi>'s Houſe whoſe Name is <hi>Tent,</hi> in an
Ally at the <hi>Eaſt</hi> end of S. <hi>James</hi>'s Church, that goes
up from <hi>Germain-Street</hi> into <hi>Pickadilly;</hi> but <hi>Tent</hi>
being behind hand with his Rent, went away pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
with his Goods on <hi>Sunday</hi> Night, the 17th
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46414:9"/>
inſtant, which the Landlord hearing of, came the
next day to the Houſe, and finding Mrs. <hi>Laulan</hi> in it,
Seiz'd her Goods, ſuppoſing them to be <hi>Tents,</hi> and
turns her and the Girl out of doors; upon vvhich
they were forc'd to part, till Mrs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Laulan</hi> can get her
Goods again. In the mean time she lodges among
ſome of her acquaintance, but as yet at no certain
place. The Girl is now vvith her Father, at the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Newport-Ally</hi> near <hi>Soho,</hi> and may be ſeen and
ſpoken vvith at any time by any that deſire it. Her
Father is a Senſible Good Man, and no vvays exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
above vvhat is fitting for a Good Chriſtian up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch an Extraordinary Occaſion, being more
Glad and Thankful in the Mercy, than any ways of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiouſly
concern'd to have any body believe it;
whicb does indeed ſeem to me to Give no little
Credit to the truth of the ſtory it ſelf.</p>
               <p>I shall now conclude, Sir, in the <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi>
of the man that vvas born blind, vvho told the
inquiſitive and unhelieving <hi>Phariſee, That he was their
Son, and was born blind, but they could not tell how he came
to ſee.</hi> The ſame, in a manner, may hundreds ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this Child, <hi>That they knew her to be lame, and now
ſee her cur'd, but how ſhe came to be ſo they know not, and
can believe it to be no other than a very extraordinary and
amazing thing.</hi> Which is all at preſent from,</p>
