            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PUBLISHER
TO THE
Reader.</head>
            <p>TO keep the Reader from being at
all ſurpriz'd at the <hi>Date</hi> of the
Title-Page, I muſt inform him,
that a good part of the enſuing Tracts
were Printed off, and in my cuſtody,
the laſt year; and the reſt had come
out with them divers moneths ago, if
the Noble Author had not been hinder'd
from committing them to the Preſs by
the deſire and hope of being able in a
ſhort time to ſend them abroad more
numerous, and by his being hinder'd
to do ſo partly by Remove, partly by the
want of ſome Papers that were odly
loſt or ſpoil'd, and partly by the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of himſelf, and divers of his near
<pb facs="tcp:60281:4"/>
Relations. And ſome of theſe Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
do yet ſuppreſs what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
intended ſhould have made a part
of the Book, which now he ſuffers to
be publiſh'd without them, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of his Papers about ſome other
<hi>particular Qualities</hi> have been written
ſo long ago, as to have lain for many
years neglected among other of his old
Writings: Which that he may have
both leaſure and health to review, and
fit for publication, is the ardent wiſh of
the ſincere Lovers of Real Knowledge,
who have reaſon to look on it as no
mean proof of his conſtant kindneſs to
Experimental Philoſophy, that in theſe
Tracts he perſeveres in his courſe of
freely and candidly communicating his
Experiments and Obſervations to the
publick, notwithſtanding the liberty
that hath been too boldly taken to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
them as their own by ſome later
Writers; as particularly by the Compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of the Treatiſe, entitul'd <hi>Polygra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phice,</hi>
who in two Chapters hath allow'd
himſelf to preſent his Reader with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Fifty Experiments, taken out of
<pb facs="tcp:60281:4"/>
our Authors <hi>Book of Colours,</hi> without
owning any one of them to Him, or ſo
much as naming him or his <hi>Book</hi> in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of thoſe Chapters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
in any of the others. Nor did
I think this practice juſtified by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
made in the <hi>Preface,</hi> importing,
that the Compiler had taken the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
he deliver'd from the Writings
of others. For, this general and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory
acknowledgment neither doth
right to <hi>particular</hi> Authors, nor, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
them, enables the Reader to know,
whether the things deliver'd come from
perſons fit to be credited or not: And
therefore, ſince 'tis but too likely, that
ſuch Concealment of the Names, if not
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation of the Labours of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors
to Philoſophy, will prove much
more forbidding to many others to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
their Experiments, than <hi>as yet</hi>
they have to our generous Author; it
ſeems to be the Intereſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
of Learning openly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance
ſo diſcouraging a practice,
and to ſhew, that they do not think it
fit that Poſſeſſors of uſeful pieces of
<pb facs="tcp:60281:5"/>
knowledge ſhould be ſtrongly tempted
to envy them to the Publick, to the end
onely that a few Compilers ſhould not
be put upon ſo reaſonable and eaſie a
work, as by a few words or names to
ſhew themſelves juſt, if not grateful.</p>
            <p>But not to keep the Reader any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from the peruſal of theſe Tracts
themſelves, I ſhall conclude with inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
onely, that what our Author
ſaith in one of them concerning the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency</hi>
of the <hi>Chymical Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
for explaining the Effects of Nature,
is not at all intended by him to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
from the ſober Profeſſors of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry,
or to diſcourage them from uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Chymical Operations; foraſmuch as
I had the ſatisfaction, ſome years ſince,
to ſee in the Authors hands a Diſcourſe
of his about the <hi>Uſefulneſs of Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi>
for the <hi>Advancement of Natural
Philoſophy;</hi> with which alſo 'tis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
he will e're long gratifie the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>

Relating to the following
TREATISE.</head>
            <p>TO obviate ſome miſapprehenſions
that may ariſe concerning the
enſuing Notes about Particular
Qualities, it may not be improper to adde
ſomething in this place to what has been
ſaid in another<note n="†" place="margin">See Tracts about Coſmical Qualities, &amp;c. to which is prefixt an <hi>Introduction to the Hiſtory of Particular Qualities;</hi> Printed at <hi>Oxford</hi> 1671.</note> Paper
in reference to thoſe
Notes, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to premiſe to the
particular Experiments
ſome few general Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements
about them.</p>
            <p>And I. we may conſider, that there
may be three differing ways of treating
Hiſtorically of Particular Qualities. For
<hi>either</hi> one may in a full and methodical
Hiſtory proſecute the Phaenomena; <hi>or</hi> one
may make a Collection of various Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
and Obſervations whence may be
gathered divers Phaenomena to illuſtrate
<hi>ſeveral,</hi> but not all of the Heads or Parts
of ſuch an ample or methodical Hiſtory;
<hi>or</hi> (in the third place) one may in a more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60281:6"/>
confin'd way content ones ſelf to deliver
ſuch Experiments and Obſervations of
the Production, or the Deſtruction or
Change of this or that Quality, as, being
duly reaſon'd on, may ſuffice to ſhew
wherein the nature of that Quality doth
conſiſt, eſpecially in oppoſition to thoſe
erroneous conceits that have been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
about it. Of the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe
three ways of treating of a Quality I
pretend not to have given any <hi>compleat</hi>
example; but you will find, that I have
begun ſuch Hiſtories in my <hi>Specimens</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Fluidity</hi> and <hi>Firmneſs,</hi> and in the
Experiments, Obſervations, &amp;c. that I
have put together about <hi>Cold.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi>
ſort of Hiſtorical Writings I have given an
Inſtance of in my Experiments about <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;</hi>
but in theſe enſuing Notes, the
occaſion I had to make them having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
me chiefly to have an eye to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proval
of the errours of the Peripateticks
and the Chymiſts about them, I hope I
ſhall not be thought to have fallen very
ſhort in my Attempt, if I have (here
and there) perform'd what may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the <hi>Third</hi> way of writing Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically
of a Quality; my preſent Deſign
being <hi>chiefly</hi> to give an Intelligent and

adde to thoſe, that tend more directly to
diſcover the <hi>Nature</hi> or Eſſence of the
Quality treated of, and to derive it from
<hi>Mechanical</hi> Principles, ſome others (which
happen'd to come in my way) that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
us but with ſome of the leſs luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
Phaenomena.</p>
            <p>II. That you may not miſtake what is
driven at in many of the Experiments and
Reaſonings deliver'd or propos'd in the
enſuing Notes about <hi>Particular Qualities,</hi>
I muſt deſire you to take notice with me,
what it is that I pretend to offer you ſome
proofs of. For, if I took upon me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,
that the Qualities of bodies
<hi>cannot</hi> proceed from (what the Schools
call) <hi>Subſtantial Forms,</hi> or from any other
Cauſes but Mechanical, it might be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
enough expected, that my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould directly exclude them all.
But ſince, in my Explications of Qualities,
I pretend only, that they <hi>may</hi> be explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Mechanical Principles,</hi> without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring,
whether they are explicable by
any other; that which I need to prove, is,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60281:7"/>
not that Mechanical Principles are the
<hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>onely</hi> things whereby Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
may be explain'd, but that probably
they will be found <hi>ſufficient</hi> for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.
And ſince <hi>theſe</hi> are confeſſedly
more manifeſt and more intelligible than
<hi>ſubſtantial Forms</hi> and other Scholaſtic En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
(if I may ſo call them) 'tis obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
what the conſequence will be of our
not being oblig'd to have recourſe to
things, whoſe exiſtence is very diſputable,
and their nature very obſcure.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral ways that may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
ſome on one occaſion, and ſome on
another, either more directly to reduce
<hi>Qualities</hi> (as well as divers other things
in nature) to Mechanical Principles; or,
by ſhewing the inſufficiency of the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetic
and Chymical Theories of Qualities,
to recommend the Corpuſcularian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of them.</p>
            <p>For further Illuſtration of this Point, I
ſhall adde on this occaſion, that there are
three diſtinct ſorts of Experiments (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
other proofs) that may be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
employ'd, (though they be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
efficacious) when we treat of the
<hi>Origine</hi> of Qualities. For ſome Inſtances
may be brought to ſhew, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
Quality may be Mechanically <hi>intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd</hi>
into a portion of matter, where it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60281:7"/>
was not before. Other Inſtances there
may be to ſhew, that by the ſame means
the Quality may be notably <hi>varied</hi> as to
degrees, or other not eſſential Attributes.
And by ſome Inſtances alſo it may appear,
that the Quality is Mechanically <hi>expell'd</hi>
from, or <hi>aboliſh'd</hi> in, a portion of matter
that was endow'd with it before. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
alſo by the ſame Operation the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
quality is deſtroyed, and a new one
is produc'd. And each of theſe kinds of
Inſtances may be uſefully employ'd in our
Notes about Particular Qualities. For, as
to the <hi>firſt</hi> of them, there will be ſcarce
any difficulty. And as to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> ſince
the permanent Degrees as well as other
Attributes of Qualities are ſaid to flow
from (and do indeed depend upon) the
ſame Principles that the Quality it ſelf
does; if, eſpecially in bodies inanimate, a
change barely Mechanical does notably
and permanently alter the <hi>degree</hi> or other
conſiderable attribute; it will afford,
though not a clear proof, yet a probable
preſumption, that the Principles whereon
the Quality it ſelf depends are Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.
And <hi>laſtly,</hi> if, by a bare Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
change of the internal Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſtructure of a body, a permanent
Quality, confeſs'd to flow from its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
Form or inward Principle, be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oliſh'd,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60281:8"/>
and perhaps alſo immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by a new Quality Mechanically
producible; if, I ſay, this come to paſs in
a body Inanimate, eſpecially if it be alſo,
as to ſenſe ſimilar, ſuch a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> will
not a little favour that <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> which
teaches, that theſe Qualities depend upon
certain contextures and other Mechanical
Affections of the ſmall parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that are indowed with them, and
conſequently may be aboliſh'd when that
neceſſary Modification is deſtroyed. This
is thus briefly premis'd to ſhew the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
of alledging differing kinds of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
and <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in favour of the
Corpuſcular <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> about Qualities.</p>
            <p>What has been thus laid down, may, I
hope, facilitate and ſhorten moſt of the
remaining work of this Preamble, which
is to ſhew, though but very briefly, that
there may be ſeveral ways, not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
employable to recommend the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcularian
Doctrine of Qualities.</p>
            <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> it may ſometimes be ſhewn,
that a <hi>Subſtantial Form</hi> cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be the neceſſary Principle of
this or that Quality; as will (for inſtance)
hereafter be made manifeſt in the <hi>Aſperity</hi>
and <hi>Smoothneſs</hi> of bodies, and in the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical
Vertue</hi> reſiding in a piece of Iron
that has been impregnated by a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60281:8"/>
'Tis true, that the force of ſuch
Inſtances is indirect, and that they do not
expreſly prove the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> in whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
they are alledged; but yet they
may do it good ſervice by diſproving the
Grounds and Concluſions of the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
and ſo (by removing Prejudices,)
making way for the better entertainment
of the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> we may ſometimes obtain the
ſame or the like Quality by Artificial and
ſometimes even temporary Compoſitions,
which, being but factitious bodies, are by
Learned Adverſaries confeſs'd not to have
<hi>Subſtantial Forms,</hi> and can indeed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
be preſum'd to have but reſulting
Temperaments: As will be hereafter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifi'd
in the production of <hi>Green</hi> by
compounding Blew and Yellow, and in
the <hi>Electrical</hi> Faculty of Glaſs; and in the
temporary whiteneſs produc'd by beating
clear Oyl and fair Water into an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and by beating water into a froth,
and, more permanently, in making Coral
white by flawing it with heat; and in
divers other Particulars, that will more
properly be elſewhere mention'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> then, in ſome caſes the Quality
propos'd may be either <hi>introduced;</hi> or <hi>vary'd,</hi>
or <hi>diſtroy</hi>'d in an inanimate body, when
no change appears to be made in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60281:9"/>
except what is Mechanical, and what
might be produc'd in it, ſuppoſing ſuch a
parcel of matter were <hi>artificially</hi> fram'd
and conſtituted as the body is, though
without any <hi>Subſtantial Form,</hi> or other
ſuch like internal Principle. So when a
piece of Glaſs, or of clarify'd Roſin, is,
by being beaten to powder, deprived of
its Tranſparency, and made white, there
appears no change to be made in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriz'd
body, but a comminution of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a multitude of Corpuſcles, that by
their number and the various ſcituations
of their ſurfaces are fitted copiouſly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
the ſincere Light ſeveral ways, or
give ſome peculiar Modification to its
Rayes; and hinder that free paſſage of
the beams of Light, that is requiſite to
Tranſparency.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> as in the caſes belonging to
the foregoing number there appears not
to intervene in the Patient or Subject of
the change, any thing but a <hi>Mechanical</hi>
alteration of the Mechanical Structure or
Conſtitution; ſo in ſome other caſes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
not, that the Agent, whether natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or factitious, operates on the Patient
otherwiſe than Mechanically, employing
onely ſuch a way of acting as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the Mechaniſme of the matter,
which it ſelf conſiſts of, and that of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60281:9"/>
body it acts upon. As when Goldſmiths
burniſh a Plate or Veſſel of Silver, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been lately boil'd lookt white before,
though they deprive it of the greateſt
part of its colour, and give it a new power
of reflecting the beams of Light and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Objects, in the manner proper to
ſpecular bodies; yet all this is done by
the intervention of a burniſhing Tool,
which often is but a piece of Steel or Iron
conveniently ſhap'd; and all that this
Burniſher does, is but to depreſs the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
prominencies of the Silver, and reduce
them, and the little cavites of it, to one
phyſically level or plain Superficies. And
ſo when a Hammer ſtriking often on a
Nail, makes the head of it grow hot, the
Hammer is but a purely Mechanical A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and works by local motion. And
when by ſtriking a lump of Glaſs, it breaks
it into a multitude of ſmall parts that
compoſe a white powder, it acts as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically
in the production of that
Whiteneſs as it does in driving in a Nail
to the head. And ſo likewiſe, when the
powder'd Glaſs or Colophony lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
is, by the fire, from a white and
opacous body, reduc'd into a colourleſs
(or a reddiſh) and tranſparent one, it
appears not, that the fire, though a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Agent, need work otherwiſe than
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60281:10"/>
Mechanically, by colliquating the inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
grains of powder into one maſs;
wherein, the ranks of pores not being
broken and interrupted as before, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
beams of Light are allow'd every
way a free paſſage through them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> the like Phaenomena to thoſe
of a Quality to be explicated, or at leaſt
as difficult in the ſame kind, may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
in bodies and caſes, wherein 'tis
plain we need not recurre to <hi>Subſtantial
Forms.</hi> Thus a varying Colour, like that
which is admired in a Pigeons Neck, may
be produc'd in changeable Taffety, by a
particular way of ranging and connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Silk of ſeveral Colours into one piece
of Stuff. Thus we have known <hi>Opals</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
imitated and almoſt excell'd by
Glaſs, which luckily degenerated in the
Furnace. And ſomewhat the like change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and very delightful Colour I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to have introduced into common
Glaſs with Silver or with Gold and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.
So likewiſe meerly by blowing fine
Cryſtal-Glaſs at the flame of a Lamp to
a very extraordinary thinneſs, we have
made it to exhibit, and that vividly, all
the Colours (as they ſpeak) of the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow;
and this power of pleaſing by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifying
the Light, the Glaſs, if well
preſerved, may keep for a long time. Thus
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60281:10"/>
alſo by barely beating Gold into ſuch
thin leaves as Artificers and Apothecaries
are wont to employ, it will be brought
to exhibite a green Colour, when you
hold it againſt the Light, whether of the
day, or of a good Candle; and this kind
of Greenneſs as 'tis permanent in the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated
Gold, ſo I have found by trial,
that if the Sun-beams, ſomewhat united
by a Burning-glaſs, be trajected through
the expanded Leaf, and caſt upon a piece
of white paper, they will appear there as
if they had been tinged in their paſſage.
Nay, and ſometimes a flight and almoſt
momentany Mechanical change will ſeem
to over-rule Nature, and introduce into
a body the quite oppoſite Quality to that
ſhe had given it: As when a piece of
black Horn is, onely by being thinly ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with the edge of a knife or a piece
of glaſs, reduced to permanently white
Shavings. And to theſe Inſtances o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Colours, ſome Emphatical and ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent,
might be added divers belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to other Qualities, but that I ought
not to anticipate what you will elſewhere
meet with.</p>
            <p>There is yet another way of arguing
in favour of the <hi>Corpuſcularian</hi> Doctrine
of Qualities, which, though it do not
afford direct proofs of its being the beſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60281:11"/>
               <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> yet it may much ſtrengthen
the Arguments drawn from other To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,
and thereby ſerve to recommend
the Doctrine it ſelf. For, the uſe of an
<hi>Hypotheſis</hi> being to render an intelligible
account of the Cauſes of the Effects or
Phaenomena propos'd, without croſſing
the Laws of Nature or other Phaenomena,
the more numerous and the more vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
the Particulars are, whereof ſome are
<hi>explicable</hi> by the aſſign'd Hypotheſis, and
ſome are <hi>agreeable</hi> to it, or at leaſt are
not diſſonant from it, the more valuable
is the Hypotheſis, and the more likely to
be true. For 'tis much more difficult, to
finde an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> that is not true which
will ſuit with <hi>many</hi> Phaenomena, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if they be of various kinds, than but
with <hi>few.</hi> And for this Reaſon I have
ſet down among the Inſtances belonging
to particular Qualities ſome ſuch Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Obſervations, as we are now
ſpeaking of, ſince, although they be not
direct proofs of the preferrableneſs of our
Doctrine, yet they may ſerve for Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of it; though this be not the only
or perhaps the chief Reaſon of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mention'd. For whatever they may be
as Arguments, ſince they are matters of
fact, I thought it not amiſs to take this
occaſion of preſerving them from being
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60281:11"/>
loſt; ſince, whether or no they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<hi>much</hi> to the eſtabliſhment of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
Doctrine about Qualities, they
will at leaſt contribute to the Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of them.</p>
            <p>III. I ſhall not trouble the Reader with
a Recital of thoſe unlucky Accidents,
that have hinder'd the Subjects of the
following Book from being more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and I hope he will the more eaſily
excuſe their paucity, if he be advertiſed,
that <hi>although</hi> the particular Qualities, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which ſome Experiments and Notes,
by way of <hi>Specimens,</hi> are here preſented,
be not near half ſo many as were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be treated of; <hi>yet</hi> I was careful to
chuſe them ſuch as might comprehend in
a ſmall number a great variety; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſcarce one ſort of Qualities, of which
there is not an Inſtance given in this ſmall
Book, ſince therein Experiments and
thoughts are deliver'd <hi>about</hi> Heat and
Cold, which are the chief of the four
<hi>FIRST Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ALITIES; about</hi> Taſts
and Odours, which are of thoſe, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the immediate objects of Senſe, are
wont to be call'd <hi>SENSIBLE Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITIES;
about</hi> Volatility and Fixity,
Corroſiveneſs and Corroſibility, which, as
they are found in bodies purely natural,
are referrable to thoſe Qualities, that many
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60281:12"/>
Phyſical Writers call <hi>SECOND QVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITIES,</hi>
and which yet, as they may be
produced and deſtroyed by the Chymiſts
Art, may be ſtiled <hi>Chymical Qualities,</hi> and
the Spagyrical ways of introducing or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
them may be referr'd to <hi>Chymical
Operations,</hi> of which there is given a more
ample <hi>Specimen</hi> in the Mechanical account
of <hi>Chymical Precipitations.</hi> And laſtly,
ſome Notes are added <hi>about Magnetiſm</hi> and
<hi>Electricity,</hi> which are known to belong to
the Tribe of <hi>Occult Qualities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. If a want of apt Coherence and
exact Method be diſcover'd in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Eſſays, 'tis hop'd, that defect will
be eaſily excus'd by thoſe that remember
and conſider, that theſe Papers were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
little better than a kind of Repſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Experiments, Thoughts, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
occaſionally thrown together
by way of Annotations upon ſome Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of a Diſcourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (about the differing
Parts and Red integration of Nitre) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſome things were <hi>pointed at</hi> relating to
the particular Qualities that are here
more largely <hi>treated of.</hi> And though the
Particulars that concern ſome of theſe
Qualities, were afterwards (to ſupply the
place of thoſe borrow'd by other Papers
whilſt theſe lay by me) increas'd in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
yet it was not to be expected, that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60281:12"/>
their Acceſſion ſhould as well correct the
Form as augment the Matter of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations.
And as for the two Tracts,
that are inſerted among theſe Eſſays about
Qualities; I mean <hi>the Diſcourſe of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of the Chymical Doctrine of them,</hi>
and the Reflections on the <hi>Hypotheſis of
Acidum and Alcali,</hi> the occaſion of their
being made parts of this Book is ſo far
expreſs'd in the Tracts themſelves, that
I need not here trouble the Reader with
a particular Account of it.</p>
            <p>V. I do not undertake, that all the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Accounts of Particular Qualities
would prove to be the very true ones, nor
every Explication the beſt that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd.
For beſides that the difficulty of
the Subject, and Incompleatneſs of the
Hiſtory we yet have of Qualities, may
well deterre a man, leſs diffident of his
own abilities than I juſtly am, from aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ſo much to himſelf, it is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary to my preſent Deſign.
For, Mechanical Explications of natural
Phaenomena do give ſo much more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to ingenious minds, than thoſe
that muſt employ <hi>Subſtantial Forms, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,
Antipathy,</hi> &amp;c. that the more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
of the vulgar Philoſophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
prefer them before all others, when
they can be had; (as is elſewhere ſhewn
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60281:13"/>
at large,) but then they look upon them
either as confined to Mechanical Engines,
or at leaſt but as reaching to very few of
Nature's <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> and, for that reaſon,
unfit to be received as Phyſical Principles.
To remove therefore this grand Prejudice
and Objection, which ſeems to be the chief
thing that has kept off Rational Inquirers
from cloſing with the Mechanical Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
it may be very conducive, if not
ſufficient, to propoſe ſuch Mechanical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of Particular Qualities themſelves,
as are intelligible and poſſible, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> whereto they
are applied. And to this it is no more
neceſſary that the account propos'd ſhould
be the trueſt and beſt that can poſſibly be
given, than it is to the proving that a
Clock is not acted by a vital Principle, (as
thoſe <hi>Chineſes</hi> thought, who took the firſt,
that was brought them out of <hi>Europe,</hi> for
an <hi>Animal,</hi>) but acts as an Engine, to do
more than aſſign a Mechanical Structure
made up of Wheels, a Spring, a Hammer,
and other Mechanical pieces, that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
ſhew and ſtrike the hour, whether
this Contrivance be or be not the very
ſame with that of the Particular Clock
propos'd; which may indeed be made to
move either with Springs or Weights, and
may conſiſt of a greater or leſſer number of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60281:13"/>
Wheels, and thoſe differingly ſcituated
and connected; but for all this variety
'twill ſtill be but an Engine. I intend
not therefore by propoſing the Theories
and Conjectures ventur'd at in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Papers, to debar my ſelf of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
either of altering them, or of ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
others in their places, in caſe a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
progreſs in the Hiſtory of Qualities
ſhall ſuggeſt better <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> or Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And 'twas but agreeable to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of mine, that I ſhould, as I have
done, on divers occaſions in the following
Notes, imploy the word <hi>Or,</hi> and expreſs
my ſelf ſomewhat doubtingly, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more than one Cauſe of a <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi>
or Reaſon of an opinion, without dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
declaring for either; ſince my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in theſe Notes was rather to ſhew, it
was not neceſſary to betake our ſelves to
the Scholaſtick or Chymical Doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Qualities, than to act the Umpire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the differing <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcularians;</hi>
and, provided I kept my ſelf
within the bounds of Mechanical Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
my deſign allowed me a great lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in making explications of the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>
I had occaſion to take notice of.</p>

                     <p>MY firſt Experiment is afforded
me by the Diſſolution of Sal
Armoniac, which I have ſomewhat
wonder'd, that Chymiſts having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
occaſion to purifie that Salt by
the help of Water, ſhould not have,
long ſince, and publickly, taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of. For if you put into three
or four times its weight of Water a
pound or but half a pound (or even
leſs) of powder'd Sal Armoniack,
and ſtir it about to haſten the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
there will be produc'd in the
mixture a very intenſe degree of
Coldneſs, ſuch as will not be onely
very ſenſible to his hand that holds
the Glaſs whilſt the Diſſolution is
making, but will very manifeſtly
diſcover it ſelf by its Operation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Thermoſcope. Nay, I have
more than once by wetting the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of the Glaſs, where the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
was making, and nimbly ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

the Mixture, turn'd that exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
adhering water into real Ice,
(that was ſcrap'd off with a knife)
in leſs than a minute of an hour.
And this thus generated Cold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
conſiderably intenſe, whilſt
the action of diſſolution laſted; but
afterwards by degrees abated, and
within a very few hours ceas'd. The
particular Phaenomena I have noted
in the Experiment, and the practical
uſes that may be made of it I reſerve

                     <p>[I Remember that once I had a mind
to try, Whether the Coldneſs
produced upon the Solution of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Sal Armoniac in water, might
not be more probably referr'd to
ſome change of Texture or Motion
reſulting from the action of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
upon the Salt, than to any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigidation
of the water made by the
ſuddain diſperſion of ſo many Saline
grains of powder, which by reaſon
of their Solidity may be ſuſpected
to be actually more cold than the
Water they are put into; I therefore
provided a Glaſs full of that Liquor,
and having brought it to ſuch a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
that its warmth made the Spirit
of Wine in the ſeal'd Weather-glaſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60281:19"/>
manifeſtly, though not nimbly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend;
I took out the Thermoſcope,
and laid it in powder'd Sal Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac,
warm'd beforehand; ſo that the
tincted Liquor was made to aſcend
much nimblier by the Salt than juſt
before by the Water; and having
preſently remov'd the Inſtrument in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that Liquor again, and poured the
ſomewhat warm Sal Armoniac into
the ſame, I found, as I imagin'd, that
within a ſpace of time which I
gueſs'd to be about half a minute or
leſs, the Spirit of Wine began ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily
to ſubſide, and within a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
fell above a whole diviſion
and a quarter below the mark at
which it ſtood in the water, before
that Liquor or the Salt were warm'd.
Nor did the Spirit in a great while
reaſcend to the height which it had
when the water was cold.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Experiment, being at

                     <p>HAving a mind likewiſe to ſhew
ſome Ingenious men, how much
the production of Heat and Cold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon Texture and other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical

make again a Sal Armoniac by a
way I formerly publiſh'd, that I
might be ſure to know what Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
I employ'd, and ſhew their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
as well before conjunction as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it. I took then Spirit of Salt, and
Spirit of fermented or rather putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Urine; and having put a ſeal'd
Weather-glaſs into an open Veſſel,
where one of them was pour'd in, I
put the other by degrees to it, and
obſerv'd, that, as upon their mingling
they made a great noiſe with many
bubbles, ſo in this conflict they loſt
their former coldneſs, and impell'd
up the Spirit of Wine in the ſeal'd
Thermoſcope: Then ſlowly evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the ſuperfluous moiſture, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60281:20"/>
a fine ſort of Sal Armoniac
for the moſt part figur'd not unlike
the other, when being diſſolv'd and
filtrated, it is warily coagulated. This
new Salt being gently dry'd I put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a wide Glaſs of water, wherein I
had before plac'd a ſeal'd Weather-glaſs,
that the included Spirit might
acquire the temper of the ambient
Liquor, and having ſtirr'd this Salt
in the water, though I took it then
off the mantle-tree of a Chimney that
had had fire in it divers hours before,
it did, as I expected, make the tincted
Spirit haſtily ſubſide and fall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably

will be proper to add on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <p>We took a competent quantity of
acid ſpirit diſtill'd from Roch-allom,
(that, though rectifi'd, was but
weak,) which, in the ſpirit of that
ſalt, is not ſtrange. Of this we put
into a wide mouth'd Glaſs (that was
not great) more than was ſufficient
to cover the globulous part of a good
ſeal'd Thermoſcope, and then ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the inſtrument to ſtay a pretty
while in the liquor, that the Spirit
of wine might be cool'd as much as
the ambient was, we put in little by
little ſome volatile ſalt ſublimed from
Sal Armoniac and a fixt <hi>Alcali,</hi> and
notwithſtanding the very numerous
(but not great) bubbles, and the
noiſe and froath that were produced,
as is uſual upon the reaction of Acids
and Alcalys, the tincted ſpirit in the
Weather-glaſs, after having continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a good while at a ſtand, began a
little to deſcend, and continued
(though but very ſlowly) to do ſo,
till the ſpirit of Allom was glutted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60281:21"/>
with the volatile ſalt; and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
of the tincted liquor in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
being meaſur'd, appear'd to
be about an inch (for it manifeſtly
exceeded ſeven eighths.) By com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
this Experiment with the firſt
part of the foregoing, we may gather,
that when Volatile and Urinous Salts
or Spirits (for the ſaline particles
appear ſometimes in a dry and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in a liquid form) tumultuate
upon their being mixt with Acids,
neither the Heat nor the Cold that
enſues is produc'd by a Conflict with
the Acids preciſely as it is Acid, ſince
we have ſeen that an urinous ſpirit
produc'd an actual Heat with ſpirit of
Salt, and the diſtill'd Salt of Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac,
which is alſo Urinous, with the
acid ſpirit of Roch-Allom produces
not a true efferveſcence, but a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt

                     <p>WE took one part of Oyl of

twelve parts of water we made a
mixture, that at firſt was ſenſibly
warm; then ſuffering this to cool,
we put a ſufficient quantity of it into
a wide mouth'd glaſs, and then we put
a good Thermoſcope Hermetically

After ſome time had been allowed

might acquire the temper of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient;
we put in by degrees as much

a cold ebullition (if I may ſo ſtile it,)

                  <p>
                     <hi>POtential</hi> Coldneſs has been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
lookt upon, and that
partly perhaps upon the ſcore
of its very name, as ſo abstruſe a
Quality, that 'tis not onely rational
but neceſſary to derive it from the
<hi>ſubſtantial Forms</hi> of bodies. But I
confeſs I ſee no neceſſity of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it not to be referrable to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
Principles. For as to the
chief Inſtances of Potential Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which are taken from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of ſome Medicines and aliments
in the bodies of men, it may be ſaid
without improbability, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
Refrigeration proceeds chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from this, that the potentially
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60281:24"/>
cold body is made up of Corpuſcles
of ſuch ſize, ſhape, &amp;c. that being
reſolved and disjoined by the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum
of the ſtomach, or the fluids
it may elſewhere meet with, they
do ſo aſſociate themſelves with the
ſmall parts of the blood and other
liquors, as, by clogging them or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
to leſſen their wonted agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and perhaps make them act
in a peculiar way as well as leſs
briskly on the nervous and fibrous
parts; and the perception of this
Imminution (and perhaps change)
of motion in the organs of feeling is
that, which, being referr'd to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that produces it, we call its <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>
Coldneſs. Which Quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by this account to be, as I
was ſaying before, but a Relative
thing, and is wont to require the
diffuſion or diſperſion of the ſmall
parts of the Corpuſcles of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and their mingling themſelves
with the liquors or the ſmall parts
of the body they are to refrigerate.
And therefore, if it be granted, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60281:25"/>
in Agues there is ſome morbifick
matter of a viſcous or not eaſily diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
texture, that is harbor'd in
ſome part of the body, and requires
ſuch a time to be made fluid and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvable;
the Cold Fits of Agues
need not be ſo much admired as they
uſually are; ſince, though juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Fit the ſame parcel of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that is to produce it were actually
in the body, yet it was not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of its clammineſs actually reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into ſmall parts, and mingled
with thoſe of the bloud, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
could not make ſuch a
change in the motion of that liquor
as is felt in the <hi>Cold Fit</hi> of an Ague;
(for, of the further Change that
occaſions the <hi>Hot Fit,</hi> I am not here
to ſpeak) And in ſome other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eaſes
a ſmall quantity of matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſolved into minute parts, may
be able to produce a great ſenſe of
Coldneſs in ſome part of a body,
which by reaſon of the ſtructure
of that part may be peculiarly
diſpoſed to be affected thereby; as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60281:25"/>
I have known Hypochondriack and
Hyſterical women complain of great
Degrees of Coldneſs, that would
ſuddenly invade ſome particular
part, chiefly of the Head or Back,
and be for a good while trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
there. And that, if a frigori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic
vapour or matter be exceeding
ſubtile, an inconſiderable Quantity
of it being diſperſed through the
bloud may ſuffice to produce a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Refrigeration, I have learnt
by Inquiry into the Effects of ſome
Poyſons; and 'tis not very material,
whether the Poyſon, generally
ſpeaking, be cold or hot, if it meet
with a body diſpos'd to have thoſe
affections that paſs for cold ones
produced in it. For I have made a
Chymical Liquor, that was pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trant
and fiery enough to the Taſte,
and had acquired a Subtlety and
briskneſs from Diſtillation, with
which I could almost in a trice, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it but in the quantity of about
a drop, cast an <hi>Animal</hi> into that

And though Scorpions do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

happens, and their Poyſon proves,
in a high degree, potentially cold;

                  <p>I cannot now ſtay to enquire,
Whether there may not be in theſe
great Refrigerations, made by ſo
ſmall a quantity of Poyſon, ſome
ſmall Concretions or Coagulations
made of the minute particles of the
bloud into little clots, leſs agile and
more unwieldy than they were when
they moved ſeparately: which may
be illuſtrated by the little Curdlings
that may be made of the parts of
Milk by a very ſmall proportion of
Runnet or ſome acid liquor, and the
little coagulations made of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Wine by that of Urine: Nor
will I now enquire, whether, beſides
the retardment of the motion of the
bloud, ſome poyſons and other ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous
Agents may not give the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it a new modification, (as if
ſome Corpuſcles that uſually are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60281:27"/>
more whirl'd or brandiſh'd be put
into a more direct Motion) that
may give it a peculiar kind of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or other action upon the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and fibrous parts of the body.
Theſe, I ſay, and other ſuſpicions
that have ſometimes come into my
thoughts, I muſt not ſtay to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;
but ſhall now rather offer to
Conſideration, Whether, ſince ſome
parts of the humane body are very
differing from others in their ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
and internal Conſtitution; and
ſince alſo ſome Agents may abound
in Corpuſcles of differing ſhapes,
bulks, and motions, the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
may not in reference to the
ſame humane body be potentially
cold or potentially hot, according as
'tis applied; or perhaps may, upon
one or both of the accounts newly
mentioned, be cold in reference to
one part of the body, and hot in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the other. And theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
need not be always aſcrib'd to
the meer and immediate action of
the Corpuſcles of the Medicine, but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60281:27"/>
ſometimes to the new Quality they
acquire in their Paſſage by aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
themſelves with the bloud or
other fluids of the body, or to the
expulſion of ſome calorific or frigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rific
Corpuſcles, or to the Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they give the part on which they
operate, to be more or leſs perme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
and agitated than before by
ſome ſubtile aethereal matter, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Efficients of Heat or Cold.
Some of theſe Conjectures about the
Relative Nature of Potentially cold
bodies, may be either confirmed or
illuſtrated by ſuch Inſtances as theſe;
that Spirit of Wine being inwardly
taken is potentially very hot, and
yet being outwardly applied to
ſome Burns and ſome hot Tumours
does notably abate the Heat of the
inflamed parts, though the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
applied even outwardly to a
tender eye will cauſe a great and
dolorous agitation in it. And Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire,
which in the Doſe of leſs than
a half or perhaps a quarter of a
Scruple, has been obſerved to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60281:28"/>
a Heat through the body, is
with ſucceſs externally applied by
Phyſicians and Chirurgeons in refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerating
Medicines.</p>
                  <p>But I leave the further Inquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Operations of Medicines to
Phyſicians, who may poſſibly, by
what has been ſaid, be aſſiſted to
compoſe the differences between
ſome famous Writers about the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
of ſome Medicines, as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
Camphire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſome
will have to be cold, and others
maintain to be hot; and ſhall onely
offer by way of confirming, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that Potential Coldneſs is onely
a Relative Quality, a few Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
the firſt whereof is afforded
by comparing together the VI. and
the VII. Experiment before going,
(which have occaſion'd this Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
about Potential Coldneſs;) ſince
by them it ſeems probable, that the
ſame thing may have it in reference
to one body, and not to another,
according to the diſpoſition of the
body it operates upon, or that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60281:28"/>
upon it. And the Fumes of
Lead have been obſerved ſometimes
(for I have not found the Effect to
ſucceed always) to arreſt the fluidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Mercury, which change is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be the effect of a Potential
Coldneſs belonging to the Chymiſts
Saturn in reference to fluid Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
though it have not that operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on any other liquor that we know
of.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, (for I would not be
too prolix) though Nitre and Sal
Armoniac be both apart and joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Cold in reference to Water, and
though, however Nitre be throughly
melted in a Crucible, it will not take
fire of it ſelf, yet if, whilſt it is in
Fuſion, you ſhall by degrees caſt on
it ſome powder'd Sal Armoniac, it
will take fire and flaſh vehemently,

                     <p>IN the <hi>firſt</hi> Experiment we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that upon the pouring of

an intenſe degree of Cold, and
we have elſewhere recited, that the

inſtead of common water, Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol

ſhew further, what influence Motion
and Texture may have upon ſuch
Trials, it may not be amiſs to adde
the following Experiment: To
twelve ounces of Sal Armoniac we
put by degrees an equal weight of
water, and whilſt the Liquor was
diſſolving the Salt, and by that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
producing a great Coldneſs, we
warily pour'd in twelve ounces alſo
of good Oyl of Vitriol; of which
new mixture the event was, that a
notable degree of Heat was quickly
produced in the Glaſs wherein the
Ingredients were confounded, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
as it ſeemed, that, whereas
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60281:30"/>
each of the two Liquors is wont
with Sal Armoniac to produce an
intenſe Cold, both of them acting
on it together ſhould produce the
contrary Quality. But the reaſon I
had to expect the ſucceſs, I met with,
was this, that 'twas probable the
Heat ariſing from the mixture of the

Coldneſs produceable by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that were not acid, in the ſame Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum,
and even Spirit of Verdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe
(made <hi>per ſe</hi>) though a more
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60281:31"/>
potent Menſtruum than common Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

produce near ſuch a heat at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of its operation, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

Obſervation tranſcrib'd <hi>verbatim</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>[Into eight ounces of Spirit of

                     <p>'TIs very probable that further
Trials will furniſh us with
more Inſtances to ſhew how the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of Cold may in ſome caſes
be effected, varied, or hinder'd by
Mechanical Circumſtances that are
eaſily and uſually overlook'd. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
on this occaſion, that though
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60281:32"/>
in the Experiment above recited we
obſerv'd, that Oyl of Vitriol and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being firſt ſhaken together, the
volatil ſalt of Sal Armoniac being
afterwards put to them, produced a
ſenſible Coldneſs; yet I found, that if
a little Oyl of Vitriol and of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Salt were firſt put together,
though ſoon after a conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of water were added, there
would be produc'd not a Coldneſs,
but a manifeſt degree of Heat, which
would impell up the liquor in the
Thermoſcope to the height of ſome
inches. And I remember too, that
though Salt of Tartar will, as we
ſhall ſee e're long, grow hot in the
water, yet having diſtill'd ſome Salt
of Tartar and Cinaber in a ſtrong
fire, and put the whole <hi>Caput mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum</hi>
into diſtill'd or Rain-water, it
made indeed a hiſſing there as if it
had been Quick-lime, but produced
no Heat, that I could by feeling per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
I ſhall adde, that not onely,
as we have ſeen already, ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heeded
Circumſtances may promote
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60281:32"/>
or hinder the artificial Production of
Cold by particular Agents, but,
which will ſeem more ſtrange, ſome
unobſerv'd, and perhaps hardly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
Indiſpoſition in the Patient
may promote or hinder the effects of
the grand and Catholick Efficients of
Cold, whatever thoſe be. This ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
I repreſent as a thing that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
experience may poſſibly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
becauſe I have ſometimes
found, that the degree of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Cold has been much vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by latent Circumſtances, ſome
bodies being more wrought upon,
and others leſs, than was upon very
probable grounds expected. And
particularly I remember, that though
Oyl of Vitriol be one of the firieſt
liquors that is yet known, and does
perform ſome of the Operations of
fire it ſelf, (as we ſhall elſewhere
have occaſion to ſhew) and will thaw
Ice ſooner than Spirit of Wine or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other liquor, as I have tried; yet
having put about a pound or more,
by our eſtimate, of choice rectified
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60281:33"/>
Oyl of Vitriol into a ſtrong Glaſs-Vial
proportionable to it, we found,
that, except a little that was fluid at
the top, it was all congeal'd or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated
into a maſs like Ice, though
the Glaſs ſtood in a Laboratory
where a fire was conſtantly kept not
far from it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and where Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
very ſeldom or never has before
or ſince been obſerv'd to congeal or
coagulate ſo much as in part. And
the odneſs of our <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> was
increas'd by this Circumſtance, that
the Maſs continued ſolid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a good
while after the weather was grown
too mild to have ſuch Operations
upon Liquors far leſs indiſpos'd to
loſe their fluidity by Cold, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
common Oyl of Vitriol is. On
the other ſide I remember, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two years ago, I expos'd ſome
Oyl of ſweet Almonds hermetically
ſeal'd up in a Glaſs-bubble, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
what Condenſation an intenſe
cold could make of it, (for though
Cold expands water, it condenſes
common oyl;) but the next day I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60281:33"/>
found to my wonder, that not onely
the oyl remain'd unfrozen by the
ſharp froſt it had been expos'd to,
but that it had not its tranſparency
troubled, though 'tis known, that oyl
will be brought to concrete and
turn opacous by a far leſs degree
of Cold than is requiſite to freeze
water; notwithſtanding which this
liquor, which was lodged in a
glaſs ſo thin, that 'twas blown at the
flame of a Lamp, continued fluid
and diaphanous in very froſty wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo long till I loſt the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſeeing it congeal'd or concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And this brings into my mind,
that though Camphire be, as I
formerly noted, reckon'd by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
potentially cold, yet we kept
ſome oyl of it, of our making,
wherein the whole body of the
Camphire remain'd, being onely by
ſome Nitrous Spirits reduc'd to the
form of an Oyl; we kept it, I ſay,
in ſuch intenſe degrees of Cold, that
would have eaſily frozen water,
without finding it to loſe its Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60281:34"/>
or its Fluidity.</p>
                     <p>And here I ſhall put an end to the
firſt Section, (containing our Notes
about <hi>Cold</hi>) the deſign of which
may be not a little promoted by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
with them the beginning of
the enſuing Section. For if it be
true, that (as we there ſhew) the
nature of <hi>Heat</hi> conſiſts either one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or chiefly in the local motion of the
ſmall parts of a body Mechanically
modified by certain conditions, of
which the principal is the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the various agitations of thoſe
inſenſible parts; and if it be alſo
true, as Experience witneſſes it to be,
that, when the minute parts of a body
are in or arrive at ſuch a ſtate, that
they are more ſlowly or faintly agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
than thoſe of our fingers or
other organs of feeling, we judge
them cold: Theſe two things laid
together ſeem plainly enough to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
that a Privation or Negation of
that Local Motion that is requiſite to
conſtitute Heat, may ſuffice for the
denominating a body Cold, as Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60281:34"/>
is a quality of the Object, (which
as 'tis perceiv'd by the mind, is alſo
an affection of the Sentient:) And
therefore an Imminution of ſuch a
degree of former motion as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to make a body Hot as to
ſenſe, and which is ſufficient to the
Production of ſenſible Coldneſs, may
be Mechanically made, ſince Slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as well as Swiftneſs being a
Mode of Local motion is a Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
thing: And though its effect,
which is Coldneſs, ſeem a Privation
or Negation; yet the Cauſe of it
may be a poſitive Agent acting Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically,
by clogging the Agile
Calorific Particles, or deadning their
motion, or perverting their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
or by ſome other intelligible
way bringing them to a ſtate of Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as to ſenſe: I ſay Coldneſs as
to ſenſe; becauſe as 'tis a Tactile
Quality, in the popular acception of
it, 'tis relative to our Organs of
Feeling; as we ſee that the ſame
luke-warm water will appear hot
and cold to the ſame mans hands, if,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60281:35"/>
when both are plung'd into it, one
of them ſhall have been newly held
to the fire, and the other be benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with froſt. And indeed the
cuſtom of ſpeaking has introduced
an ambiguity into the word <hi>Cold,</hi>
which often occaſions miſtakes, not
eaſily without much attention and
ſometimes circumlocution alſo to be
avoided; ſince uſually by Cold is
meant that which immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
the ſenſory of him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
a body Cold, whereas ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
'tis taken in a more general
notion for ſuch a Negation or Immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of motion, as though it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates
not perceivably on our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
does yet upon other bodies; and
ſometimes alſo it is taken (which
is perhaps the more Philoſophical
ſenſe) for a perception, made in
and by the mind, of the alteration
produced in the Corporeal Organs
by the operation of that, whatever
it be, on whoſe account a body is
found to be cold.</p>

                  <p>AFter having diſpatched the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
I had to offer of the
Production of Cold, it remains that
I alſo propoſe ſome Experiments of
<hi>Heat,</hi> which Quality will appear the
more likely to be Mechanically pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible,
if we conſider the nature
of it, which ſeems to conſiſt mainly,
if not onely, in that Mechanical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of matter we call Local mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
mechanically modified, which
modification, as far as I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
is made up of three Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe is, that the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the parts be <hi>vehement,</hi> by
which degree or rapidneſs, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
proper to bodies that are hot
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60281:36"/>
diſtinguiſhes them from bodies that
are barely <hi>fluid.</hi> For theſe, as ſuch,
require not near ſo brisk an agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as is wont to be neceſſary to
make bodies deſerve the name of
<hi>hot.</hi> Thus we ſee that the particles
of water in its natural (or uſual)
ſtate, move ſo calmly, that we do not
feel it at all warm, though it could
not be a liquor unleſs they were in a
reſtleſs motion; but when water
comes to be actually hot, the motion
does manifeſtly and proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
appear more vehement, ſince
it does not onely briskly ſtrike our
organs of feeling, but ordinarily
produces ſtore of very ſmall bubbles,
and will melt butter or coagulated
oyl, caſt upon it, and will afford va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
that, by the agitation they
ſuffer, will be made to aſcend into
the air. And if the degree of Heat
be ſuch as to make the water boil,
then the agitation becomes much
more manifeſt by the confus'd moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and waves, and noiſe, and bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
that are excited, and by other
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60281:37"/>
obvious effects and Phaenomena of
the vehement and tumultuous moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is able to throw up viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
into the air great ſtore of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles,
in the form of vapours or
ſmoak. Thus in a heated Iron the
vehement agitation of the parts may
be eaſily inferr'd from the motion
and hiſſing noiſe it imparts to drops
of water or ſpittle that fall upon it.
For it makes them hiſs and boil, and
quickly forces their particles to quit
the form of a liquor, and flye into
the air in the form of ſteams. And
laſtly, Fire, which is the hotteſt body
we know, conſiſts of parts ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
agitated, that they perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and ſwiftly flye abroad in
ſwarms, and diſſipate or ſhatter all
the combuſtible bodies they meet
with in their way; fire making ſo
fierce a diſſolution, and great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion
of its own fuel, that we
may ſee whole piles of ſolid wood
(weighing perhaps many hundred
pounds) ſo diſſipated in very few
hours into flame and ſmoak, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60281:37"/>
there will not be one
pound of Aſhes remaining. And this
is the firſt Condition required to
Heat.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is this, that the <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
be very various,</hi> ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
moving towards the right, ſome
to the left, hand, ſome directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
ſome downwards, and ſome
obliquely, &amp;c. This variety of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
appears to be in hot bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
both by ſome of the Inſtances
newly mention'd, and eſpecially that
of flame, which is a body; and by
the diffuſion that metals acquire,
when they are melted, and by the
operations of Heat that are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd
by hot bodies upon others, in
what poſture or ſcituation ſoever the
body to be heated be applied to
them. As a thoroughly ignited Coal
will appear every way red, and will
melt wax, and kindle brimſtone,
whether the body be apply'd to the
upper or to the lower, or to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of the burning Coal. And
congruouſly to this Notion, though
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60281:38"/>
air and water be mov'd never ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently,
as in high Winds and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts,
yet we are not to expect
that they ſhould be manifeſtly hot,
becauſe the vehemency belongs to
the progreſſive motion of the whole
body; notwithſtanding which, the
parts it conſiſts of may not be near
ſo much quickned in their motions
made according to other determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as to become ſenſibly hot.
And this Conſideration may keep
it from ſeeming ſtrange, that in ſome
caſes, where the whole body, though
rapidly moved, tends but one way,
'tis not by that ſwift motion percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be made Hot.</p>
                  <p>Nay, though the agitation be very
<hi>various</hi> as well as <hi>vehement,</hi> there is
yet a third Condition required to
make it Calorific, namely, that the
agitated particles, or at leaſt the
greateſt number of them, be ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
as to be ſingly <hi>inſenſible.</hi> For
though a heap of ſand or duſt it ſelf
were vehemently and confuſedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated
by a whirlwind, the bulk of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60281:38"/>
the grains or Corpuſcles, would keep
their agitation from being properly
Heat, though by their numerous
ſtrokes upon a man's face, and the
brisk commotion of the ſpirits and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſmall particles that may thence
enſue, they may perchance occaſion
the production of that Quality.</p>
                  <p>If ſome attention be employ'd in
conſidering the formerly propos'd
Notion of the nature of Heat, it
may not be difficult to diſcern, that
the Mechanical production of it may
be divers ways effected. For, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
in ſome few Anomalous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
(wherein the regular courſe of
things happens to be over-rul'd,) by
whatever ways the <hi>Inſenſible parts</hi> of
a body are put into a very <hi>confus'd</hi>
and <hi>vehement agitation,</hi> by the ſame
ways Heat may be introduc'd into
that body: agreeably to which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
as there are ſeveral Agents
and Operations by which this Calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rific
Motion (if I may ſo call it) may
be excited, ſo there may be ſeveral
ways of Mechanically producing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60281:39"/>
Heat, and many Experiments may
be reduc'd to almoſt each of them,
chance it ſelf having in the Labora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of Chymiſts afforded divers
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> referrable to one or other
of thoſe Heads. Many of the more
familiar Inſtances, applicable to our
preſent purpoſe, have been long
ſince collected by our juſtly famous
<hi>Verulam</hi> in his ſhort, but excellent,
Paper <hi>de forma calidi,</hi> wherein
(though I do not acquieſce in every
thing I meet with there) he ſeems
to have been, at leaſt among the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns,
the Perſon that has firſt hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Doctrine of <hi>Heat</hi> like an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall
Philoſopher. I ſhall
therefore decline accumulating a
multitude of Inſtances of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of Heat, and I ſhall alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to inſiſt on ſuch known things,
as the Incaleſcence obſervable upon
the pouring either of Oyl of Vitriol
upon Salt of Tartar, (in the making
of <hi>Tartarum Vitriolatum</hi>) or of <hi>Aqua
fortis</hi> upon Silver or Quickſilver, (in
the diſſolution of theſe Metals) but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60281:39"/>
ſhall rather chuſe to mention ſome
few Inſtances not ſo notorious as the
former, but not unfit by their variety
to exemplifie ſeveral of the differing
ways of exciting Heat.</p>
                  <p>And yet I ſhall not decline the
mention of the moſt obvious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Inſtance of all, namely the
Heat obſerved in Quick-lime upon
the affuſion of cold water, becauſe
among learned men, and eſpecially
Peripateticks, I find cauſes to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
that are either juſtly queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
or manifeſtly erroneous. For
as to what is inculcated by the
Schools about the Incaleſcence of a
mixture of Quick-lime and water by
vertue of a ſuppoſed <hi>antiperiſtaſis</hi> or
Invigoration of the internal Heat of
the Lime by its being invironed by
cold water, I have elſewhere ſhewn,
that this is but an Imaginary Cauſe,
by delivering upon Experiment
(which any man may eaſily make)
that, if inſtead of cold water the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
be poured on very hot, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition
of the Lime will not be the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60281:40"/>
leſs, but rather the greater: And
Oyl of Turpentine, which is a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and is lookt upon as a ſubtiler li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
than water, though it be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
quite cold on Quick-lime, will
not, that I have obſerved, grow ſo
much as ſenſibly hot with it.</p>
                  <p>And now I have mentioned the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caleſcence
of Lime, which, though
an abvious <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> has exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
the wits of divers Philoſophers
and Chymiſts, I will adde two or
three Obſervations in order to an
Inquiry that may be ſome other time
made into the genuine Cauſes of it;
which are not ſo eaſie to be found as
many learned men may at firſt ſight
imagine. The acute <hi>Helmont</hi> indeed
and his followers have ingeniouſly
enough attempted to derive the Heat
under conſideration from the conflict
of ſome Alcalizate and Acid ſalts,
that are to be found in Quick-lime,
and are diſſolved, and ſo ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to fight with one another by the
water that ſlakes the Lime. But
though we have ſome manifeſt marks
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60281:40"/>
of an Alcalizate Salt in Lime, yet
that it contains alſo an Acid Salt, has
not, that I remember, been proved;
and if the emerging of Heat be a
ſufficient reaſon to prove a latent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
Salt in Lime, I know not, why I
may not inferr, that the like Salt lies
conceal'd in other bodies, which the
Chymiſts take to be of the pureſt or
meereſt ſort of <hi>Alcalys.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <div n="1-4" type="experiment">

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">EXPER. </seg>I</label> that by putting a
pretty quantity of dry Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
in the palm of my hand, and wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it well in cold water, there has
been a very ſenſible Heat produced
in the mixture; and when I have
made the trial with a more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
quantity of ſalt and water in a
Viol, the heat proved troubleſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intenſe, and continued to be at
leaſt ſenſible a good while after.</p>
                     <p>This Experiment ſeems to favour
the opinion, that the Heat produced
in Lime whilſt 'tis quenching, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the <hi>Empyreuma,</hi> as the
Chymiſts call it, or impreſſion left
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60281:41"/>
by the violent fire, that was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
to reduce the ſtone to Lime.
But if by <hi>Empyreuma</hi> be meant a bare
impreſſion made by the fire, 'twill
be more requiſite than eaſie, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
intelligibly, in what that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
conſiſts, and how it operates
to produce ſuch conſiderable effects.
And if the effect be aſcribed to
ſwarms of Atomes of fire, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
adherent to the ſubſtance of the
Lime, and are ſet at liberty to flye
away by the liquor, which ſeems to
be argued by the ſlaking of Lime
without water, if it be for ſome
time left in the air, whereby the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
of fire get opportunity to flye
away by little and little: If this, I
ſay, be alledged, I will not deny but
there may be a ſenſe, (which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
explicate in few words) wherein
the Cooperation of a ſubſtantial <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvium,</hi>
for ſo I call it, of the fire,
may be admitted in giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of our <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> But the
Cauſe formerly aſſigned, as 'tis
crudely propoſed, leaves in my mind
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60281:41"/>
ſome Scruples. For 'tis not ſo eaſie
to apprehend, that ſuch light and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
bodies as thoſe of fire are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
ſhould be ſo long detained as
by this Hypotheſis they muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be, in Quick-lime, kept in
well-ſtopt veſſels, from getting out
of ſo laxe and porous a body as
Lime, eſpecially ſince we ſee not a

upon the pouring of water upon
<hi>Minium,</hi> or <hi>Crocus Martis per ſe,</hi>
though they have been calcined by

or Emanations appear to
adhere to them by the increaſe of
weight, that Lead, if not alſo <hi>Mars,</hi>
does manifeſtly receive from the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
of the Fire. To which I
ſhall adde, that, whereas one would
think that the igneous Atoms ſhould
either flye away, or be extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the ſupervening of water, I
know, and elſewhere

not ſo odd, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
ſought and found in Salt of
Tartar, from which, after it had
been once heated by the affuſion of

the Liquor without violence of fire,
till the Salt was again dry; and then
putting on water a ſecond time, the
ſame Salt grew hot again in the Vial,
and, if I miſremember not, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
this Incaleſcence the third
time, if not the fourth; and might
probably have done it oftner, if I
had had occaſion to proſecute the
Experiment. Which ſeems at leaſt
to argue, that the great violence of

                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:60281:42"/>
And on this occaſion I ſhall ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to adde, that I have ſometimes
doubted, whether the Incaleſcence
may not much depend upon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Diſpoſition of the calcined
body, which being deprived of its
former moiſture, and made more
porous by the fire, doth by the help
of thoſe igneous Effluviums, for the
moſt part of a ſaline nature, that
are diſperſed through it, and adhere
to it, acquire ſuch a Texture, that
the water impell'd by its own weight,
and the preſſure of the Atmoſphere,
is able to get into a multitude of its
pores at once, and ſuddenly diſſolve
the Igneous and Alcalizate Salt it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where meets with there, and
briskly disjoyn the earthy and ſolid
particles, that were blended with
them; which being exceeding nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
though each of them perhaps
be very minute, and moves but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little way, yet their multitude
makes the confuſed agitation of the
whole aggregate of them, and of the
particles of the water and ſalt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60281:43"/>
enough to produce a ſenſible
Heat; eſpecially if we admit, that
there is ſuch a change made in the
Pores, as occaſions a great increaſe
of this agitation, by the ingreſs and
action of ſome ſubtile ethereal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
from which alone <hi>Monſieur des
Cartes</hi> ingeniouſly attempts to derive
the Incaleſcence of Lime and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as well as that of metals diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in corroſive Liquors; though as
to the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> we have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
there ſeems at leaſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
a peculiar diſpoſition of body,
wherein Heat is to be produced to
do one or both of theſe two things,
namely, to retain good ſtore of the
igneous <hi>Effluvia,</hi> and to be, by their
adheſion or ſome other operation of
the fire, reduced to ſuch a Texture
of its component Particles, as to be
fit to have them eaſily penetrated,
and briskly as well as copiouſly diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated,
by invading water. And
this Conjecture (for I propoſe it as
no other) ſeems favour'd by divers
<hi>Phaenomena,</hi> ſome whereof I ſhall
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60281:43"/>
now annex. For here it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that both the diſſolved Salt
of Tartar lately mentioned, and the
artificial Liquor that grows hot with
the natural, reacquires that Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Incaleſcence upon a bare
Conſtipation or cloſer Texture of
the parts from the ſuperfluous moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
they were drowned in before:
The Heat that brought them to this
Texture having been ſo gentle, that
'tis no way likely that the igneous
Exhalations could themſelves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſuch a Heat, or at leaſt that
they ſhould adhere in ſuch numbers
as muſt be requiſite to ſuch an effect,
unleſs the Texture of the Salt of
Tartar (or other body) did pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
diſpoſe it to detain them; ſince
I have found by Trial,
that Sal Armoniac diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
in water,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">EXPER. </seg>IV</label> though
boiled up with a brisker fire to a dry
ſalt, would, upon its being again diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
in water, not produce any
Heat, but a very conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Cold. I ſhall adde, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60281:44"/>
though one would expect a great
Cognation between the particles of
Fire adhering to Quick-Lime, and
thoſe of high rectified Spirit of
Wine, which is of ſo igneous a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as to be totally inflammable;
yet I have not found, that the affu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Alkaol of Wine upon
Quick-Lime, would produce any
ſenſible Incaleſcence, or any viſible
diſſolution or diſſipation of the Lime,
as common water would have done,
though it ſeemed to be greedily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
ſoaked in by the lumps of
Lime. And I further tried, that, if
on this Lime ſo drenched I poured
cold water, there inſued no manifeſt
Heat, nor did I ſo much as find the
lump ſwelled, and thereby broken,
till ſome hours after; which ſeems
to argue, that the Texture of the
Lime was ſuch, as to admit the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Spirit of Wine into
ſome of its pores, which were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
larger or more congruous, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
admitting it into the moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
ones, whereinto the Liquor
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60281:44"/>
muſt be received, to be able ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to diſſipate the Corpuſcles of
Lime into their minuter particles,
into which (Corpuſcles) it ſeems
that the change that the aqueous
particles received by aſſociating with
the ſpirituous ones, made them far
leſs fit to penetrate and move brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there, than if they had enter'd
alone.</p>
                     <p>I made alſo an Experiment that
ſeems to favour our Conjecture,
by ſhewing how much the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Lime to Incaleſcence may
depend upon an idoneous Texture,
and the Experiment, as I find it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred
in one of my Memorials, is
this.</p>

ſtrong Spirit of Wine as would
drench it, and ſwim a pretty way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60281:45"/>
gentle fire, we drew off ſome Spirit

Phlegm following it, the fire was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd,

                     <p>Theſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> ſeem to argue,
that the Diſpoſition that Lime has to

on ſome peculiar Texture, ſince the
aqueous parts, that one would think
capable of quenching all or moſt of
the Atomes of Fire that are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to adhere to Quick-lime, did not
near ſo much weaken the diſpoſition
of it to Incaleſcence, as the acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſpirituous Corpuſcles and
their Contexture, with thoſe of the
Lime, increaſed that igneous Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
And that there might inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene
ſuch an aſſociation, ſeems to
me the more probable, not onely
becauſe much of the diſtill'd Liquor
was as phlegmatick, as if it had been
robb'd of its more active parts, but
becauſe I have ſometimes had Spirit
of Wine come over with Quick-lime
not in unobſerved ſteams, but white
fumes. To which I ſhall adde, that,
beſides that the Taſte, and perhaps
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60281:46"/>
Odour of the Spirit of Wine, is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
manifeſtly changed by a well-made
Diſtillation from Quick-lime;
I have ſometimes found that Liquor
to give the Lime a kind of Alcalizat
penetrancy, not to ſay fierineſs of
Taſte, that was very brisk and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.
But I will not undertake,
that every Experimenter, nor I my
ſelf, ſhall always make trials of this
kind with the ſame ſucceſs that I had

that I have found Quick-limes to

that eſpecially, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering

with an inſtance or two of
the Production of Heat, wherein
there appears not to intervene any
thing in the part of the Agent or

natural Effects of it. And as to this
ſort of Experiments, a little attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and reflection may make ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
<hi>Phaenomenon</hi> appoſite to our
preſent purpoſe. When, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
a Smith does haſtily hammer
a Nail or ſuch like piece of iron, the
hammer'd metal will grow exceeding
hot, and yet there appears not any
thing to make it ſo, ſave the forcible
motion of the hammer which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
a vehement and variouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
agitation of the ſmall parts
of the Iron; which being a cold
body before, by that ſuperinduc'd
commotion of its ſmall parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
in divers ſenſes hot; firſt in a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60281:47"/>
more <hi>lax acceptation</hi> of the word in
reference to ſome other bodies, in
reſpect of whom 'twas cold before,
and then <hi>ſenſibly hot;</hi> becauſe this
newly gain'd agitation ſurpaſſes
that of the parts of our fingers.
And in this Inſtance 'tis not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlookt,
that oftentimes neither
the hammer, <hi>by</hi> which, nor the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<hi>on</hi> which a <hi>cold piece of Iron</hi> is
forged, (for all iron does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
precedent ignition to make it
obey the hammer) continue cold,
after the operation is ended; which
ſhews, that the Heat acquir'd by the
forged piece of iron was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
by the Hammer or Anvil
as Heat, but produc'd in it by moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was great enough to put
ſo ſmall a body as the piece of iron
into a ſtrong and confus'd motion of
its parts without being able to have
the like operation upon ſo much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
maſſes of metal, as the Hammer
and the Anvil; though if the percuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
were often and nimbly renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Hammer were but ſmall,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60281:47"/>
this alſo might be heated, (though
not ſo ſoon nor ſo much as the iron;)
by which one may alſo take notice,
that 'tis not neceſſary, a body ſhould
be it ſelf hot, to be calorific. And
now I ſpeak of ſtriking an iron with
a Hammer, I am put in mind of an
Obſervation that <hi>ſeems</hi> to contradict,
but does <hi>indeed</hi> confirm, our Theory:
Namely, that, if a ſomewhat large
nail be driven by a hammer into a
plank or piece of wood, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
divers ſtrokes on the head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it grow hot; but when 'tis dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the head, ſo that it can go no
further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a few ſtrokes will ſuffice to

a conſiderable degree of Heat will

be well objected, that upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

not do; ſince, to omit other anſwers,

when they were very diligently mixt

gradually ſublim'd in a glaſs veſſel,
giving a ſmart fire towards the latter

deſired, far the greateſt part of the
Sal Armoniac ſtaid at the bottom
with the metal; then taking out the

throughly to cool, but in a Glaſs

the moiſture of the Air, (as it is
very apt to do.) And laſtly,

Conjecture is ſomewhat favoured by

of Antimony, and an equal weight
of Sal Armoniac being diligently

of fire ſublimed in a Glaſs-veſſel,
by which Operation we obtain'd
three differing Subſtances, which we
cauſed to be ſeparately powder'd,
when they were taken out of the
Subliming Glaſs, leſt the air or time
ſhould make any change in them;
and having before put the ball of a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60281:53"/>
good ſeal'd Weather-glaſs for a
while into water, that the Spirit of
Wine might be brought to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the external Liquor, we put
on a convenient quantity of the
powder'd <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to two ounces, and ſeemed
to be little other than Antimony,
which accordingly did ſcarce ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
raiſe the Spirit of Wine in the
Thermoſcope, though that were a
tender one. Then laying aſide that
water, and putting the Inſtrument
into freſh, of the ſame temper, we
put to it a very yellow Sublimate,
that aſcended higher than the other
parts, and ſeemed to conſiſt of the
more ſulphureous flowers of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,
with a mixture of the more
volatile parts of the Sal Armoniac.
And this Subſtance made the tinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Spirit in the Thermoſcope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
very ſlowly about a quarter of
an inch; but when the Inſtrument
was put into freſh water of the ſame

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60281:53"/>
which was dark coloured,
though both the Antimony and Sal

thereby ſpeedily and notably cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
inſomuch, that the Spirit of

deſcended, and continued to ſink,

ſome Moderns call the Theory,

is more eaſie to be found by a little
conſideration, than to be made out
in few words.</p>
                     <p>We made alſo an Experiment like
that above recited, by ſubliming
three ounces a piece of Minium and
Sal Armoniac; in which Trial we
found, that though in the <hi>Caput mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum,</hi>
the Salt had notably wrought
upon the <hi>Calx</hi> of Lead, and was in
part aſſociated with it, as appear'd

And this brings into my mind
a pleaſant adventure afforded by
theſe Liquors, of each of which,
having for the Production of Heat

an inteſtine agitation, which you

the newly mention'd Heat, whoſe

by common water in flower or
fine powder of Sulphur, and Filings
of Steel or Iron. For when, in
Summer time, I caus'd to be mingled
a good quantity, (as half a pound

and caus'd them to be

the mixture would in a ſhort

grow ſo hot, that the Veſſel that

                  <p>TO make out the Mechanical
Origine or Production of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors,</hi>
as far as is neceſſary for my
preſent purpoſe, 'twill be expedient
to premiſe in general, that, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our notion of Taſts, they
may depend upon the bigneſs, figure
and motion of the ſaporifick corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles,
conſidered ſeparately, and as
the affections of ſingle and very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
particles of matter; or elſe in a
ſtate of conjunction, as two or more
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60281:73"/>
of theſe affections, and the particles
they belong to, may be combined or
aſſociated, either among themſelves,
or with other particles, that were
not ſaporous before. And as theſe
Coalitions and other Aſſociations
come to be diverſified; ſo the Taſts,
reſulting from them, will be altered
or deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>But, to handle theſe diſtinctly and
fully, were a task not onely too dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
and long, but improper in this
place, where I pretend to deliver
not Speculations, but matters of Fact:
in ſetting down whereof nevertheleſs,
to avoid too much confuſion, I am
content, where I can doe it readily
and conveniently, in ſome of my Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
to couch ſuch references as may
beſt point at thoſe Heads, whence
the Mechanical explications may be
derived, and conſequently our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
confirmed.</p>
                  <p>By Taſt conſidered as belonging to
the Object, (under which Notion I
here treat of it,) I mean that quality,
or whatever elſe it be, which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles

                  </p>
                  <p>That this ſomething, whether you
will call it a quality, or whatever elſe
it be that makes or denominates an
object <hi>ſaporous,</hi> or rather (if I may
be allowed a barbarous term) <hi>ſapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick,</hi>
may ſo depend upon the ſhape,
ſize, motion, and other Mechanical
affections of the ſmall parts of the
taſted body, and reſult from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation
of two or more of them,
not excluding their congruity or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity

                     <p>THis may be performed by the

of compoſing Salt-peter. For if

to ſatiate the Alkaly, (for if there

gentle evaporation, and ſometimes
without it, and that in a few minutes,
obtain Cryſtals, which, being dried
after they have been, if it be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
freed from any adhering par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
(not of their own nature,) will
have upon the tongue neither a ſharp

to Salt-peter, if it be pure Salt-peter;
for the impure may perhaps
ſtrongly reliſh of the common Salt
that is uſually contained in it.</p>
                     <p>The like production of Salt-peter
we have ſometimes made in far leſs
time, and ſometimes indeed in a trice,
by ſubſtituting, in ſtead of the fixed
Salt of Nitre, the ſaline parts of good
Pot aſhes, carefully freed by ſolution
and filtration from the earthy and
feculent ones.</p>
                     <p>I have ſometimes conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of theſe two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
may not be explicated by
ſuppoſing them to ariſe from the new
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60281:75"/>
magnitudes and figures of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which the fire, by breaking
them, or forcibly rubbing them one
againſt the other, or alſo againſt the
Corpuſcles of the additament, may
be preſumed to give them; as if, for
example, ſince we find the larger and
beſt formed Cryſtals of Nitre to be
of a priſmatical ſhape with ſix ſides,
we ſhould ſuppoſe the corpuſcles of
Nitre to be little priſms, whoſe angles
and ends are too obtuſe or blunt to
make vigorous and deep impreſſions
on the tongue; and yet, if theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
priſms be by a violent heat ſplit,
or otherwiſe broken, or forcibly
made as it were to grind one another,
they may come to have parts ſo much
ſmaller than before, and endowed
with ſuch ſharp ſides and angles, that,
being diſſolved and agitated by the
ſpittle that uſually moiſtens the
tongue, their ſmalneſs may give
them great acceſs to the pores of that
organ, and the ſharpneſs of their ſides
and points may fit them to ſtab and
cut, and perhaps ſear the nervous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60281:76"/>
and membranous parts of the organ
of Taſt, and that variouſly, according
to the grand diverſities, as to ſhape
and bulk, of the ſaporifick particles
themſelves. And this being granted,
it ſeemed further conceivable, that
when the Alkalizate and Acid parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
come to be put together in the
fluid mixture, wherein they ſwam,
many of them might, after a multitude
of various juſtlings and occurſions,
meet with one another ſo luckily and
opportunely, as to recompoſe little
priſms, or convene into other bodies,
almoſt like thoſe that made up the
Cryſtals of Nitre, before 'twas expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the fire. To illuſtrate which,
we may conceive, that, though a
priſm of iron may be ſo ſhaped, that
it will be wholly unfit to pierce the
skin; yet it may be ſo cut by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
planes reaching to the oppoſite
<hi>baſes</hi> or ends, as to afford wedges,
which, by the ſharpneſs of their ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
may be fit both to cleave wood,
and cut the skin; and theſe wedges,
being again put together after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60281:76"/>
manner, may recompoſe a
priſm, whoſe extreams ſhall be too
blunt to be fit for the former uſe.
This may be alſo illuſtrated by the
breaking of a dry ſtick circularly cut
off at the ends, which though it is
unapt, whilſt intire and of that
bulk, to prick the hand; yet if it be
violently broken, the ragged ends
of it and the ſplinters may prove ſtiff,
ſlender, and ſharp enough to pierce
and run into the hand: To which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other ſuch Mechanical Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
might be added. But, ſince I
fear you think, as well as I, the main
conjecture may not be worthy any
farther proſecution, I ſhall not inſiſt
any longer on it. And becauſe the
hiſtorical part of theſe Experiments
was for the main delivered by me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

in what ſenſe I do or do not

                     <p>To illuſtrate this, I thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
to endeavour to imitate the

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60281:84"/>
Compoſitions or Preparations,
but found it not eaſie, beforehand
to be aſſured of the ſucceſs of ſuch
Trials: And therefore I ſhall content
my ſelf here to mention three or four
Inſtances, that, except the firſt, are
rather Obſervations than ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
as we are ſpeaking of.</p>
                     <p>I remember then, that, making
ſome Trials to alter the ſenſible Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of Smell, Taſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Oil of
Vitriol, and Spirit of Wine, I obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from them, among other things
that ſuited with my deſign, a certain
Liquour, which, though at firſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
would, at a certain nick of time,
make one that had it in his mouth
think it had been imbued with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
                     <p>And this brings into my mind, that
a skilful perſon, famous for making
good Sider, coming one day to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
with me, what he ſhould doe to
heighten the taſt of it, and make it
keep the longer, complained to me,
that having, among other trials, put
into a good Veſſel full of juice of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60281:84"/>
Apples a certain proportion of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-ſeed,
with hopes it would make
the Sider more ſpirituous and pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
he found, to his wonder and
loſs, that, when he came to draw it,
it ſtank of Garlick ſo rank, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body rejected it.</p>
                     <p>I remember alſo, that, by fermenting
a certain proportion (for that we
found requiſite) of <hi>ſemen Dauci</hi> with
Beer of Ale, the Liquour had a very
pleaſant Reliſh of Limon-pills.</p>
                     <p>But that ſeems much more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
which I ſhall now add; That,
with an inſipid Metal and a very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive
Menſtruum, one may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
a taſt, that I have ſeveral
times obſerved to be ſo like a Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
that I preſume it may deceive
many. This may be done by diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Gold, without any groſs Salt,
in the mixture of Aqua fortis and the
Spirit of Salt, or even in common A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua
Regis, made by diſſolving Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac
in Aqua fortis. For if the
Experiment be happily made, one
may obtain either a Solution or a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60281:85"/>
Salt, whoſe auſtere taſt will very
much reſemble that of Sloes, or of
unripe Bullace. And this taſt, with
ſome little variety, I found in Gold
diſſolved without any diſtilled Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour
at all; and alſo, if I much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
not, in Gold that by a peculiar
Menstruum I had volatilized.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Inſtance I ſhall give of
the imitation of Taſts, I found to
have been, for the main, known to
ſome ingenious Ladies. But to make
the Experiment ſucceed very well,
a due proportion is the principal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
which is wont to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
I cannot readily call to mind
that which I found to ſucceed beſt;
but the Trial may be indifferently
well made after ſuch a manner as
this:</p>
                     <p>Take a pint or a pound of <hi>Malaga</hi>
or <hi>Canary</hi> Sack, (for though <hi>French</hi>
and the like Wines may ſerve the
turn, yet they are not ſo proper;)
and put into it a drachm or two of
good odoriferous Orrice Roots, cut
into thin ſlices, and let them infuſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60281:85"/>
in the Liquour a convenient time,
'till you perceive that they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it a deſired taſt and ſmell; then
keep the thus perfumed Wine exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtopped in a cool place: According
to which way, I remember, that
(when I hit on the right proportion
of Ingredients, and kept them a due
time in infuſion) I had many years
ago a Wine, which, being coloured
with <hi>Cocheneele,</hi> or ſome ſuch tingeing
ingredient, was taken for good Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-Wine,
not onely by ordinary
perſons, but, among others, by a
couple of eminent Phyſicians, one of
whom pretended to an extraordinary
criticalneſs of palate on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
both of them wondering, how
at ſuch an unlikely time of the year,
as I choſe to preſent them that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour
among others, I could have
ſuch excellent Rasberry-Wine: Some
of which (to add that by the by) I
found to preſerve the ſpecifick taſt
two or three years after it was made.</p>

EXCURSION
About ſome Changes made
OF
TASTS
BY
MATURATION.</head>
                  <p>IT will not perhaps be thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
but rather neceſſary, to
add a word or two on this occaſion
for their ſakes, that think the Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Fruits, and the changes of
Taſts, by which 'tis uſually known,
muſt needs be the effect of the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Soul of the Plant. For, after
the Fruit is gathered, and ſo, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no longer a part of the Tree,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60281:86"/>
does, according to the moſt common
opinion, ceaſe to be a part of the
living Plant, as a Hand or a Foot cut
off is no more reckoned among the
Lims of the man it belonged to;
yet 'tis very poſſible that ſome Fruits
may receive maturation, after they
have been ſevered from the Plants
that bore them. For, not to mention,
that Apples, gathered ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time, by lying in heaps, do
uſually obtain a mellowneſs, which
ſeems to be a kind or degree of Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
or that Medlars, gathered
whilſt they are hard and harſh, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
afterwards in proceſs of time ſoft
and better taſted; in which ſtate
though ſome ſay they are rotten, yet
others think that ſuppoſed rottenneſs
is the proper Maturity of that kind of
Fruit: Not to mention theſe, I ſay,
or the like Inſtances, 'tis a famous
Aſſertion of ſeveral Writers of the
Indian affairs, that the Fruit they call
<hi>Bananas</hi> is uſually gathered green,
and hung up in bunches or cluſters in
the houſe, where they ripen by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60281:87"/>
and have an advantageous
change made both of their colour
and of their taſt. And this an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
acquaintance of mine, a literate
and obſerving perſon, of whom I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
about it, aſſured me, he had
himſelf lately tried and found to be
true in <hi>America.</hi> And indeed I ſee
not, why a convenient degree of
warmth, whether external from the
Sun and fire, or internal from ſome
degree of fermentation or analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous
inteſtine Commotion, may not
(whether the Fruit be united to the
Plant or no) put the ſporifick Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
into motion, and make them,
by various and inſenſible tranſcurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
rub againſt each other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
make the little bodies more ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or thin, and leſs rigid, or cutting
and harſh, than they were before,
and by various motions bring the
Fruit they compoſe to a ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is more ſoft in point of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,
and abound in Corpuſcles leſs
harſh and more pliable, than they
were before, and more congruous
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60281:87"/>
to the pores of the organ of Taſt:
And, in a word, make ſuch a change
in the conſtitution of the Fruit, as
men are wont to expreſs by the name
of <hi>Maturity.</hi> And that ſuch Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
changes of Texture may much
alter the Qualities, and among them
the Taſt of a Fruit, is obvious in brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Cherries and Apples, which in
the bruiſed parts ſoon come to look
and taſt otherwiſe than they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
This poſſibility of this is alſo
obvious by <hi>Wardens,</hi> when ſlowly
roaſted in embers with ſo gentle a
fire, as not to burn off the paper they
are wont to be wrapt in, to be kept
clean from the aſhes. And I have
ſeen, in the bordering Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> a ſort of
Pears, (whoſe name I now remember
not,) which being kept for ſome
hours in a moderate heat, in a Veſſel
exactly cloſed, with embers and aſhes
above and beneath them, will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to a juicy Subſtance of a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
red colour, and very ſweet and
luſhious to the taſt. Many other ſorts
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60281:88"/>
of Fruit in other Countries, if they
were handled after the ſame way, or
otherwiſe skilfully wrought on by a
moderate heat, would admit as great
alterations in point of taſt. Neither
is that ſort of Pear to be here omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which by meer Compreſſion,
duly ordered, without external heat,
will in a few minutes be brought to
exchange its former hardneſs and
harſhneſs for ſo yielding a Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and pleaſant a taſt, as I could
not but think very remarkable. And
that even more ſolid and ſtubborn
Salts than thoſe of Vegetables, may
have the ſharpneſs and piercingneſs of
their taſts very much taken off by
the bare internal action of one part
upon the other, without the addition
of any ſweetning body, I have been
induced to think by having found,
upon trial, that, by the help of inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
Water, we may, without any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
of Fire, reduce Sea-ſalt into a
Brine of ſo mild and peculiar (I had
almoſt ſaid) pleaſant a taſt, that one
would ſcarce ſuſpect what it had
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60281:88"/>
been, or believe that ſo great a
change of a Mineral body could be
effected by ſo ſlight an inteſtine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
as indeed produced it; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
ſince the alteration of taſts was
not the moſt conſiderable that was
produced by this Operation.</p>
                  <p>As to Liquours that come from
Vegetables, the emerging of new <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors</hi>
upon the inteſtine Commotion
of the ſaporifick parts, as Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſuch Commotions, is more
obvious than is commonly conſidered
in the juice of Grapes, which, from
a ſweet and ſpiritleſs Liquour, do
by that internal motion we call Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
acquire that pleaſing pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
and briskneſs of taſt that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to Wine, and afterwards dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates
into that acid and cutting
taſt that is proper to Vinegar; and
all this, by a change of Conſtitution
made by the action of the parts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on one another, without the

                     <p>I Shall not now examine, whether
the Local motion of an external
Agent may not, without materially
concurring to the operation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60281:94"/>
by agitating and ſhuffling the

their odours, but ſo far produce
them, as to make them perceptible
by the ſenſe, which otherwiſe would
not be ſo, may be gathered from ſome
obſervations, which, being obvious,
are not ſo proper for this place.
Wherefore I ſhall rather take notice,
that I know ſeveral Bodies that are
not onely inodorous when cold, but
when conſiderably hot, and are fixt in
the fire, and yet, by having their
parts put into a peculiar kind of agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
will preſently grow plainly
odorous. On this occaſion I ſhall
add, that, as there are ſome very hard
Woods, that acquire a ſtrong ſmell
by the motion they may be expoſed
to in a Turner's Lath, (as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

And having inquired about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of Beech-wood whilſt it is turning,
they both agreed, that it would emit

bought a great block of that

that a Body, which it ſelf is not onely

by being wrought on by, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

pleaſure, that, when the fulmination
was recently made, the ſteams, which
were afforded by the metal that had
been fired, were endowed with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
ſmell, not unlike that of musk.
From which Experiment and the
foregoing we may learn, that Art,
by lucky Contextures, may imitate
the odours that are preſumed to be
natural and ſpecifick; and that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and Vegetable Subſtances may
compound a ſmell that is thought to
be peculiar to Animals.</p>
                     <p>And as Art ſometimes imitates Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the production of Odours, as
may be confirmed by what is above
related concerning counterfeit Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-Wine,
wherein
thoſe that drank it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
they did not onely
taſt,<note place="margin">See in the Paper of Taſts, <hi>Exper. XII.</hi>
                        </note> but ſmell the Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry;
ſo ſometimes Nature ſeems
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60281:100"/>
to imitate her ſelf, in giving like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
to bodies extreamly differing.
For, not yet to diſmiſs the ſmell of
Musk, there is a certain Seed, which,
for the affinity of its odour to that
perfume, they call the <hi>Musk-ſeed;</hi> and
indeed, having ſome of it preſented
me by a Gentleman, that had newly
brought it from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> I
found it, whilſt 'twas freſh, to have
a fragrancy ſuitable to the name that
was given it. There is alſo a ſort of
Rats in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> whoſe skins,
whereof I have ſeen ſeveral, have a
ſmell that has procured them the name
of <hi>Musk-Rats.</hi> To which I know
not, whether we may not add the
mention of a certain ſort of Ducks,
which ſome call <hi>Musk-Ducks,</hi> becauſe
at a certain ſeaſon of the year, if they
be chaf'd by violent motion, they
will under the wing emit a musky
in ſtead of a ſweaty ſent; which upon
trial I perceived to be true. On the
other ſide, I have known a certain
Wood growing in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which,
eſpecially when the ſent is excited by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60281:100"/>
rubbing, ſtinks ſo rankly and ſo like
<hi>Paracelſus</hi>'s <hi>Zibetum Occidentale,
(ſtercus Humanum,</hi>) that one would
ſwear it were held under his Noſe.
And ſince I have been ſpeaking of
good ſents produced by unlikely
means, I ſhall not pretermit this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
that, though generally the
fire impreſſes a ſtrong offenſive ſmell,
which Chymiſts therefore call <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreumatical,</hi>
upon the odorous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
that it works ſtrongly on; yet
the conſtitution of a body may be
ſuch, that the new Contexture that
is made of its parts, even by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
of the fire, ſhall be fit to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
Effluviums rather agreeable to
the organs of ſmelling, than any way
offenſive. For I remember, that, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for a certain purpoſe diſtilled
<hi>Saccharum Saturni</hi> in a Retort with a
ſtrong fire, I <hi>then</hi> obtained, (for I
dare not undertake for the like ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
to every Experimenter,) beſides
a piercing and Empyreumatical Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour
that was driven over into the
Receiver, a good Lump of a <hi>Caput
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60281:101"/>
Mortuum</hi> of a grayiſh colour, which,
notwithſtanding the ſtrong impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it had received from the fire, was
ſo far from having any Empyreuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
ſent, that it had a pleaſing one,
and when 'twas broken, ſmelt almoſt
like a fine Cake new baked, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
whilſt yet warm. And <hi>as</hi> the
fire, notwithſtanding the <hi>Empyreuma</hi>
it is wont to give to almoſt all the
bodies it burns, may yet be reduced
to confer a good ſmell on ſome of
them, if they be fitted upon ſuch a
contexture of their parts to emit
ſteams of ſuch a nature, (whatever
were the efficient cauſe of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture;)
<hi>ſo</hi> we obſerve in the <hi>Musk
animal,</hi> that Nature in that Cat, or
rather Deer, (though it properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to neither kind,) produces Musk
by ſuch a change, as is wont in other
Animals to produce a putrefactive
ſtink. So that, provided a due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of parts be introduced into
a portion of matter, it may on that
account be endowed with noble and
deſirable Sents, or other Qualities,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60281:101"/>
though that Conſtitution were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by ſuch unlikely means, as
Combuſtion and Putrefaction them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
In Confirmation of which,
I ſhall ſubjoyn in the inſuing account
a notable, though caſual, Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
that occurr'd to a couple of
<hi>Virtuoſi</hi> of my Acquaintance.</p>
                     <p>An eminent Profeſſor of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
affirmed to me, that, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
one day in the heat of Summer
with another Mathematician (who I
remember was preſent when this was
told) to paſs by a large Dunghil that
was then in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-fields,</hi> when
they came to a certain diſtance from
it, they were both of them ſurprized
to meet with a very ſtrong ſmell of
Musk, (occaſioned, probably, by a
certain degree or a peculiar kind of
Putrefaction,) which each was for a
while ſhy of taking notice of, for
fear his Companion ſhould have
laughed at him for it; but, when they
came much nearer the Dunghill,
that pleaſing ſmell was ſucceeded by
a ſtink proper to ſuch a heap of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60281:102"/>
This puts me in mind of
adding, that, though the excrements
of Animals, and particularly their
ſweat, are uſually foetid; yet, that
'tis not the nature of an excrement,
but the conſtitutions, that uſually
belong to them, make them ſo, hath
ſeemed probable to me upon ſome
Obſervations. For, not to mention,
what is related of <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great, I knew a Gentleman of a
very happy Temperature of body,
whoſe ſweat, upon a critical exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
wherein I made uſe alſo of a
ſurprize, I found to be fragrant;
which was confirmed alſo by ſome
Learned men of my acquaintance,
and particularly a Phyſician that lay
with him.</p>
                     <p>Though <hi>Civet</hi> uſually paſſes for a
Perfume, and as ſuch is wont to be
bought at a great rate; yet it ſeems to
be but a clammy excrement of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
that affords it, which is ſecreted
into Bags provided by Nature to
receive it. And I the rather men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>Civet,</hi> becauſe it uſually affords
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60281:102"/>
a Phaenomenon that agrees very well
with the Mechanical Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Odours,</hi> though it do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
it. For, when I have had
the curioſity to viſit divers of thoſe
Civet-Cats, (as they call them) though
they have heads liker Foxes than
Cats; I obſerved, that a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Laxity (if I may ſo ſtyle it)
of the odorous Atmoſphere was
requiſite to make the ſmell fragrant.
For, when I was near the Cages,
where many of them were kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
or any great Veſſel full of
Civet, the ſmell (probably by the
plenty, and perhaps the over-brisk
motion of the <hi>effluvia,</hi>) was rather
rank and offenſive than agreeable;
whereas, when I removed into the
next room, or to ſome other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
diſtance, the ſteams (being leſs
crowded, and farther from their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,)
preſented themſelves to my
Noſtrills under the notion of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume.</p>
                     <p>And, not to diſmiſs this our Eleventh
Experiment without touching once
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60281:103"/>
more upon Musk, I ſhall add, that an
Ingenious Lady, to whom I am near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
related, ſhewed me an odd <hi>Monkey,</hi>
that had been preſented her as a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
by the then Admiral of <hi>England,</hi>
and told me, among other things, that
ſhe had obſerved in it, that, being ſick,
he would ſeek for Spiders as his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
remedies, for ſome of which he
then ſeemed to be looking, and
thereby gave her occaſion to tell me
this; which when he had eaten, the
alteration it made in him would
ſometimes fill the room with a musky
ſent: But he had not the good luck
to light on any whilſt my viſit laſted.</p>

'tis not, as 'tis commonly preſumed,
the plenty of the richeſt Ingredients,

of them, that makes the nobleſt and
moſt laſting perfume, of which I
have had ſufficient experience; ſo
that with a far leſs quantity of Musk
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60281:104"/>
and Amber, than not onely ordinary
perſons, but Perfumers themſelves
are wont to imploy, we have had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Perfumes, that for fragrancy
were much preferred to thoſe where
Musk and Amber-greece are ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
imployed. The proportions
and ways of mixture we beſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of, would be too long, and are
not neceſſary, to be here ſet down;
but you will not much erre in making
uſe of ſuch a proportion as this, <hi>viz.</hi>
eight parts of Amber-greece, two of
Musk, and one of Civet: which
quantities of Ingredients if they be
skilfully and exactly mingled, you
will not miſs of a good Compoſition,
with which you may innoble other
materials, as <hi>Benzoin, Storax,</hi> ſweet
Flowers, &amp;c. fit to make Paſtills,
Ointments for Leather, Poman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
&amp;c. And we may here add,
that, upon the ſcore of the new Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
acquired by Compoſition, ſome
things, that are not fragrant them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
may yet much heighten the
fragrancy of Odoriferous bodies.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60281:104"/>
And of liquid perfumes I remember,
'twas the ſecret of ſome Court-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
noted for Curioſity about per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes,
to mingle always a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of Wine-vinegar with the
odoriferous Ingredients. And on
this occaſion, to ſhew the power of
mixtures in improving <hi>Odours,</hi> I ſhall
add ſomething about a Liquour of
mine, that has had the good fortune
to be very favourably ſpoken of by
perſons of Quality accuſtomed to
choice Perfumes. This Liquour;
though thought an elaborate prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as well for another reaſon, as
to recommend it to ſome, whoſe
Critical palates can taſt the very
titles of things, I called it <hi>Eſſence of
Musk,</hi> is indeed a very plain ſimple
preparation, which I thus make.</p>
                     <p>I take an arbitrary Quantity of
choice Musk without finely powde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it, and pour upon it about a
finger's breadth of pure Spirit of
Wine; theſe in a Glaſs cloſely ſtopt
I ſet in a quiet place to digeſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of any Furnace, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60281:105"/>
after ſome days, or a few weeks, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as Circumſtances determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,)
the Spirit, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
odd, will in the cold have made
a ſolution of the fineſt parts of the
Musk, and will be thereby much
tinged, but not of a red colour.
This Liquour being decanted, I
keep by it ſelf as the richeſt of all;
and pour a like quantity of Spirit
on the remaining Musk, which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
will in the cold, though more
ſlowly, draw a tincture, but fainter
than the former, which being pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
off, the remaining Musk may be
imployed for inferiour uſes. Now
that which made me mention this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
as pertinent to our preſent
Subject, is this Phaenomenon of it,
that the firſt eſſence, or rather tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
being ſmelt to by it ſelf, has
but a faint, and not very pleaſing, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of Musk, ſo that every body
would not diſcover that there was
Musk in it; but if a ſingle drop, or
two drops at moſt, were mixt with a
pint, or perhaps a quart, of good Sack,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60281:105"/>
the whole body of the Wine would
preſently acquire a conſiderably mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sky
ſent, and be ſo richly perfumed
both as to taſt and ſmell, as ſeemed
ſtrange enough to thoſe that knew
the vaſt diſproportion of the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <p>SInce a great part of thoſe Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Men, eſpecially Phyſicians,
who have diſcerned the defects
of the vulgar Philoſophy, but are
not yet come to underſtand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the <hi>Corpuſcularian,</hi> have ſlid into
the Doctrine of the Chymiſts; and
ſince the Spagyriſts are wont to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to make out all the Qualities of
bodies from the Predominancy of
ſome one of their three <hi>Hypoſtatical
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60281:108"/>
Principles,</hi> I ſuppoſe it may both keep
my opinion from appearing too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous,
and (which is far more
conſiderable) may make way for the
fairer Reception of the <hi>Mechanical</hi>
Hypotheſis about Qualities, if I here
intimate (though but briefly and in
general) ſome of thoſe defects, that
I have obſerved in Chymiſts Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Qualities.</p>
                  <p>And I might begin with taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the <hi>Obſcurity</hi> of thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which is no ſmall defect in
Notions whoſe proper office it ſhould
be to conduce to the illuſtration of
others. For, how can that facilitate
the underſtanding of an obſcure
Quality or Phaenomenon which is it
ſelf ſcarcely intelligible, or at leaſt
needs almoſt as much explanation as
the thing 'tis deſigned &amp; pretended
to explicate? Now a man need not
be very converſant in the writings
of Chymiſts to obſerve, in how Laxe,
Indefinite, and almoſt Arbitrary Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
they employ the Terms of <hi>Salt,
Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> of which I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60281:108"/>
could never find that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon any certain Definitions
or ſetled Notions; not onely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Authors, but not unfrequently
one and the ſame, and perhaps in the
ſame Brook, employing them in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
differing ſenſes. But I will not give
the Chymiſts any riſe to pretend, that
the chief fault that I find with their
Hypotheſis is but verbal; though
that it ſelf may not a little blemiſh
any Hypotheſis, one of the firſt of
whoſe Requiſites ought to be <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>
and therefore I ſhall now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
and take notice of defects that
are manifeſtly of another kind.</p>
                  <p>And firſt the Doctrine that all their
Theory is grounded on, ſeems to me
<hi>Inevident</hi> and undemonſtrated, not
to ſay precarious. It is ſomewhat
ſtrange to me, that neither the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyriſts
themſelves, nor yet their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
ſhould have taken notice,
that Chymiſts have rather ſuppoſed
than evinced, that the Analyſis of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
by fire, or even that at leaſt ſome
<hi>Analyſis</hi> is the onely inſtrument of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigating
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60281:109"/>
what Ingredients mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are made up of, ſince in divers
caſes That may be diſcovered by
Compoſition as well as by Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
as it may appear, that Vitriol con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of metalline parts (whether Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
or Venereal, or both) aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Coagulation with acid ones,
one may, I ſay, diſcover this as well
by making true Vitriol with Spirit
(improperly called Oil) of Sulphur,
or that of Salt, as by diſtilling or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
Vitriol by the fire.</p>
                  <p>But I will not here enlarge on this
ſubject, nor yet will I trouble you
with what I have largely diſcourſed in
the <hi>Sceptical Chymiſt,</hi> to call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
the grounds on which Chymiſts
aſſert, that all mixt bodies are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</hi>
For it may ſuffice me now to
tell you, that, whatſoever they may
be able to obtain from other bodies,
it does not appear by Experience,
which is the grand, if not the onely,
Argument they rely on, that all mixt
bodies that have Qualities, conſiſt of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60281:109"/>
their <hi>tria prima,</hi> ſince they have not
been able, that we know, truly, and
without new Compoſitions, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
into thoſe three, either <hi>Gold,</hi> or
<hi>Silver,</hi> or <hi>Cryſtal,</hi> or <hi>Venetian Talck,</hi>
or ſome other bodies, that I elſewhere
name; &amp; yet theſe bodies are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with divers <hi>Qualities,</hi> as the
two former with Fuſibleneſs and
Malleability, and all of them with
Weight and Fixity; ſo that in theſe
and the like bodies, whence Chymiſts
have not made it yet appear, that
their Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, can
be truly and adequately ſeparated,
'twill ſcarce be other than precarious,
to derive the malleableneſs, colour,
and other <hi>Qualities</hi> of ſuch bodies
from thoſe Principles.</p>
                  <p>Under this Head I conſider alſo,
that a great part of the Chymical
Doctrine of Qualities is bottom'd on,
or ſuppoſes, beſides their newly que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
Analyſis by fire, ſome other
things, which, as far as I know, have
not yet been well proved, and I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
whether they ever will be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60281:110"/>
One of their main Suppoſitions is,
that this or that Quality muſt have
its <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as <hi>Sennertus,</hi> the
Learnedſt Champion of this opinion,
calls it, or ſome particular material
Principle, to the participation of
which, as of the primary native and
genuine ſubject, all other bodies muſt
owe it: But upon this point having
purpoſely diſcourſed elſewhere, I
ſhall now onely obſerve, that, not to
mention Local motion and Figure,
I think 'twill be hard to ſhew, what
is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of Gravity, Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility,
Heat, Sonorouſneſs, Tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
and Opacity, which are Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
to be indifferently met with in
bodies whether ſimple or mixt.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Spagyriſts are
wont to argue, that, becauſe this or
that Quality is not to be derived truly
from this or that particular Principle,
as <hi>Salt,</hi> for inſtance, and <hi>Mercury;</hi>
therefore it muſt needs be derivable
from the third, as <hi>Sulphur.</hi> This way
of arguing involves a farther Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
than that newly examined.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60281:110"/>
For it implies, that every Quality in
a compounded body muſt ariſe from
ſome one of the <hi>tria prima,</hi> whereas
experience aſſures us, that bodies
may, by Compoſition, obtain Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that were not to be found in any
of the ſeparate Ingredients. As we
ſee in painting, that though blew and
yellow be neither of them green, yet
their mixture will be ſo. And though
no ſingle Sound will make an octave
or <hi>diapaſon;</hi> yet two ſounds, whoſe
proportion is double, will have an
eighth. And Tinn and Copper mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and mingled together in a due
proportion, will make a bell-metal far
more ſonorous than either of them
was before. 'Tis obvious enough
for Chymiſts themſelves to obſerve,
that, though Lead be an inſipid body,
and Spirit of Vinegar a very ſharp
one, yet <hi>Saccharum Saturni,</hi> that is
compounded out of theſe two, has
a ſweetneſs that makes it not ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
its name.</p>
                  <p>But this ill-grounded Suppoſition
of the Chymiſts, is extended farther
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60281:111"/>
in an uſual Topic of theirs, according
to which they conclude, That I know
not how many Qualities, as well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
as occult, muſt be explicated
by their <hi>tria prima,</hi> becauſe they are
not explicable by the four elements
of the <hi>Peripateticks.</hi> To make which
argumentation valid, it muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
(which I fear it will never be)
that there are no other wayes, by
which thoſe Qualities may be expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
but by a determinate number
of Material Principles, whether four
or three: Beſides that, till they have
ſhewn that ſuch Qualities may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly
explicated by <hi>their</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
the objection will lye as ſtrong
for the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> againſt them, as
for them againſt the <hi>Ariſtotelians.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                  <p>NExt I conſider, that there are
divers Qualities even in mixt
bodies, wherein it does not appear,
that the uſe of the Chymical Doctrine
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60281:111"/>
is <hi>Neceſſary.</hi> As, <hi>for inſtance,</hi> when
pure <hi>Gold</hi> is by Heat onely brought
to fuſion, and conſequently to the
ſtate of fluidity, and upon the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of that heat, grows a ſolid and
conſiſtent body again, what addition
or expulſion or change of any of the
<hi>tria prima</hi> does appear to be the cauſe
of this change of conſiſtence? Which
is eaſie to be accounted for according
to the <hi>Mechanical</hi> way, by the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
agitation that the fire makes of
the minute parts of the Gold to bring
it to fuſion; and the coheſion of thoſe
parts, by vertue of their gravity and
fitneſs to adhere to one another,
when that agitation ceaſes. When
<hi>Venice Glaſs</hi> is meerly by being bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to pouder deprived of its Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency
and turned into a body opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous
and white, what need or uſe of
the <hi>tria prima</hi> have we in the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of this Phaenomenon? Or of
that other which occurs, when by
barely melting down this white and
opacous body it is deprived of its
opacity and colour, and becomes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60281:112"/>
diaphanous? And of this ſort of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
you will meet with divers in
the following Notes about particular
Qualities; for which reaſon I ſhall
forbear the mention of them here.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                  <p>I Obſerve too, that the Spagyrical
Doctrine of Qualities is <hi>Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi>
and too narrow to reach to all
the Phaenomena or even to all the
notable ones, that ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
by them. And this Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
I find to be two-fold; for, <hi>firſt,</hi>
there are divers Qualities, of which
Chymiſts will not ſo much as attempt
to give us explications, and of other
particular Qualities the explications,
ſuch as they are that they give us,
are often very deficient and unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory;
and do not ſometimes ſo
much as take notice of divers conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Phaenomena that belong to
the Qualities whereof they pretend
to give an account; of which you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60281:112"/>
will meet with divers Inſtances in the
inſuing Notes. And therefore I ſhall
onely, (to declare my meaning the
better,) invite you to obſerve with
me, that though <hi>Gold</hi> be the body
they affect to be moſt converſant
with; yet it will be very hard to ſhew,
how the ſpecific weight of Gold can
be deduced from any or all of the
three Principles, ſince <hi>Mercury</hi> it ſelf,
that is of bodies, known to us, the
heavieſt next to Gold, is ſo much
lighter than Gold, that, whereas I
have uſually found Mercury to be to
an equal weight of water, ſomewhat,
though little, leſs than fourteen to
one, I find <hi>pure</hi> Gold to be about
nineteen times as heavy as ſo much
water. Which will make it very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
not to ſay impoſſible for them
to explain, how Gold ſhould barely
by participating of Mercury, which is
a body much lighter than it ſelf, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that great ſpecific gravity we
find it to have; for the two other
Hypoſtatical Principles, we know,
are far lighter than Mercury. And I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60281:113"/>
think it would much puzzle the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
to give us any examples of a
compounded body, that is ſpecifical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heavier than the heavieſt of the
Ingredients that it is made up of. And
this is the <hi>firſt</hi> kind of Inſufficiency I
was taking notice of in the Chymical
Doctrine of Qualities.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>other</hi> is, That there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
bodies which the moſt Learned
among themſelves confeſs not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of their <hi>tria prima,</hi> and yet are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with Qualities, which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
are not in thoſe ſubjects to
be explicated by the <hi>tria prima</hi> which
are granted not to be found in them.
Thus <hi>elementary Water,</hi> though never
ſo pure, (as diſtilled Rain-water,)
has fluidity and coldneſs and humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and tranſparency and volatility,
without having any of the <hi>tria prima.</hi>
And the pureſt <hi>Earth,</hi> as Aſhes care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
freed from the fixt ſalt, has gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
and conſiſtence and dryneſs and
colour and fixity, without owing
them either to Salt, Sulphur, or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;
not to mention, that there are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60281:113"/>
Celeſtial bodies which do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
nor are wont to be pretended,
to conſiſt of the <hi>tria prima,</hi> that yet
are indowed with Qualities. As the
<hi>Sun</hi> has Light, and as many Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
think, Heat, and Colour; and
the <hi>Moon</hi> has a determinate conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
and figuration, (as appears by
her mountains) and Aſtronomers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that the higher Planets and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Fixt ſtars appear to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feringly
coloured. But I ſhall not
multiply Inſtances of this kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
what I have ſaid, may not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſerve for my preſent purpoſe, but
bring a great Confirmation to what
I lately ſaid, when I noted, that the
Chymical Principles were in many
caſes <hi>not neceſſary</hi> to explicate Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities:
For ſince in Earth, Water, &amp;c.
ſuch diffuſed Qualities, as gravity,
fixtneſs, colour, tranſparency and
fluidity, muſt be acknowledged not
to be derived from the <hi>tria prima;</hi>
'tis plain, that portions of matter may
be endowed with ſuch Qualities by
other cauſes and agents than Salt,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60281:114"/>
Sulphur and Mercury. And then
why ſhould we deny, that alſo in
compounded bodies thoſe Qualities
may be (ſometimes at leaſt) produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the ſame or the like Cauſes?
As we ſee, that the reduction of a
diaphanous Solid to pouder, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
whiteneſs, whether the commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
happens to Rock-cryſtal or
to Venice glaſs, or to Ice: The firſt
of which is acknowledged to be a
natural and perfectly mixt body; the
ſecond a factitious and not onely
mixt but decompounded body; and
the laſt, for ought appears, an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
body, or at moſt very ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and imperfectly mixt. And ſo by
mingling Air in ſmall portions with a
diaphanous Liquor, as we do when
we beat ſuch a Liquor into foam, a
whiteneſs is produced, as well in pure
Water, which is acknowledged to be
a ſimple body, as in white Wine,
which is reckoned among perfectly
mixt bodies.</p>

will readily believe, that a Chymiſt
will not eaſily make out by his Salt,

capp'd with ſteel may be made
to take up a great deal more Iron,
ſometimes more than eight or ten
times as much, than if it be immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to be attracted by the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole,
for inſtance, of the Load-ſtone,
the other Pole of the Load-ſtone
will not attract it but drive it away:
or, why a bar or rod of iron, being
heated red-hot and cooled perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60281:115"/>
will with its lower end drive
away the flower de Luce, or the
North-end of a Marriners Needle,
which the upper end of the ſame barr

have reckon'd up, I do not remember
that any three have been by Chymiſts
ſo much as attempted to be ſolved by
their three Principles. And even in
thoſe Qualities, in whoſe explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
theſe Principles may more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
than elſewhere pretend to have
a place, the Spagyriſts accounts are
wont to fall ſo ſhort of being diſtinct
and particular enough, that they uſe
to leave divers conſiderable <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
untouch'd, and do but very
lamely or ſlightly explicate the more
obvious or familiar. And I have ſo
good an opinion of divers of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracers
of the Spagyrical Theory of
Qualities (among whom I have met
with very Learned and worthy men)
that I think, that if a Quality being
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60281:115"/>
pos'd to them, they were at the ſame
time preſented with a good Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of the Phaenomena, that they
may take, in the Hiſtory of it, as it
were with one view, they would
plainly perceive that there are more
particulars to be accounted for, than
at firſt they were aware of; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of them ſuch, as may quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
conſidering men from taking
upon them to explain them all by the
<hi>Tria prima,</hi> and oblige them to have
recourſe to more Catholic and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
Principles. I know not,
whether I may not add on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that, methinks, a Chymiſt, who
by the help of his <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> takes
upon him to interpret that Book of
Nature of which the Qualities of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
make a great part, acts at but a
little better rate than he, that ſeeing
a great book written in a Cypher,
whereof he were acquainted but with
three Letters, ſhould undertake to
decypher the whole piece. For
though 'tis like, he would in many
words find one of the Letters of his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60281:116"/>
ſhort key, and in divers words two
of them, and perhaps in ſome all
three; yet, beſides that in moſt of
the words wherein the known Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Letters may be met with, they
may be ſo blended with other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Letters as to keep him from
decyphering a good part of thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
words, 'tis more than probable,
that a great part of the book would
conſiſt of words wherein none of his
three Letters were to be found.</p>

               <div n="5" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. V.</head>
                  <p>AND this is the <hi>firſt</hi> account, on
which I obſerve that the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Theory of Qualities does not
reach far enough: But there is <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
branch of its deficiency. For
even, when the explications ſeem to
come home to the Phaenomena, they
are not primary, and, if I may ſo
ſpeak, <hi>Fontal</hi> enough. To make this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60281:116"/>
appear, I ſhall at preſent imploy but
theſe two Conſiderations. The <hi>firſt</hi>
is, that thoſe ſubſtances themſelves,
that Chymiſts call their Principles,
are each of them indowed with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Qualities. Thus <hi>Salt</hi> is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent,
not a fluid, body; it has its
weight, 'tis diſſoluble in water, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diaphanous or opacous, fixt or
volatile, ſapid <hi>or</hi> inſipid; (I ſpeak
thus disjunctively, becauſe Chymiſts
are not all agreed about theſe things;
and it concerns not my Argument,
which of the diſputable Qualities be
reſolved upon.) And <hi>Sulphur,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>them,</hi> is a body fuſible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable,
&amp;c. and, according to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
is conſiſtent, heavy, &amp;c. So
that 'tis by the help of more primary
and general Principles, that we muſt
explicate ſome of thoſe Qualities,
which being found in bodies, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be perfectly ſimilar or homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous,
cannot be pretended to be
derived in one of them from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And to ſay, that 'tis the nature
of a Principle to have this or that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60281:117"/>
Quality, as, for inſtance, of Sulphur
to be ſuſible, and therefore we are
not to exact a Reaſon why it is ſo;
though I could ſay much by way of
anſwer, I ſhall now only obſerve, that
this Argument is grounded but upon
a ſuppoſition, and will be of no force,
if from the primary affections of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
one may deduce any good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
Explication of Fuſibility in
the general, without neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
ſuch a Primigeneal Sulphur,
as the Chymiſts fancy, or deriving
it from thence in other bodies. And
indeed, ſince not only Salt-peter, Sea
ſalt, Vitriol and Allum, but Salt of
Tartar, and the Volatile Salt of Urine
are all of them fuſible; I do not well
ſee, how Chymiſts can derive the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs
even of Salts obtained by
their own <hi>analyſis</hi> (ſuch as Salt of
Tartar and of Urine) from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of the Sulphureous Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
eſpecially ſince, if ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
ſhould be made, it would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of three Simple
bodies, whereof they will have all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60281:117"/>
mixt ones to be compounded; and
ſtill 'twould remain to be explicated,
upon what account the Principle, that
is ſaid to endow the other with ſuch
a Quality, comes to be endowed
therewith it ſelf. For 'tis plain, that
a maſs of Sulphur is not an Atomical
or Adamantine body; but conſiſts of
a multitude of Corpuſcles of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Figures, and connected after a
determinate manner: ſo that it may be
reaſonably demanded, why ſuch a
Convention of particles, rather than
many another that does not, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
a fuſible body.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="6" type="chapter">

                  <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
                  <p>AND this leads me to a further
Conſideration, which makes me
look upon the Chymiſts explications
as not deep and radical enough; and
it is this, that, when they tell us, for
inſtance, that the fuſibleneſs of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
proceeds from Sulphur, in caſe
they ſay true, they do but tell us
<hi>what</hi> material Ingredient 'tis that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mingled with and diſpers'd
through the other parts of a body,
makes it apt to melt: But this does
not intelligibly declare, <hi>what it is</hi>
that makes a portion of matter fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
and <hi>how</hi> the ſulphureous Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
introduces that diſpoſition into
the reſt of the maſs, wherewith 'tis
commixt or united. And yet 'tis ſuch
explications as theſe, that an inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Naturaliſt chiefly looks after, and
which I therefore call <hi>Philoſophical.</hi>
And to ſhew, that there may be more
Fontal explications, I ſhall only
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60281:118"/>
obſerve, that, not to wander from
our preſent inſtance, Sulphur it ſelf
is fuſible. And therefore, as I lately
intimated, Fuſibility, which is not
the Quality of one Atome, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
but of an Aggregate of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
ought it ſelf to be accounted
for in that Principle, before the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs
of all other bodies be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from it. And 'twill in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
notes appear, that in <hi>Sulphur</hi>
it ſelf that Quality may be probably
deduced from the convention of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
of determinate ſhapes and
ſizes, contexed or connected after a
convenient manner. And if either
nature, or art, or chance, ſhould
bring together particles endowed with
the like Mechanical Affections, and
aſſociate them after the like manner,
the reſulting body would be fuſible,
though the component particles had
never been parts of the Chymiſts pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mordial
ſulphur: And ſuch particles
ſo convening might perhaps have
made Sulphur it ſelf, though before
there had been no ſuch body in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60281:119"/>
world. And what I ſay to thoſe
Chymiſts, that make the ſulphureous
Ingredient the cauſe of fuſibility, may
eaſily, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> be applied
to <hi>their</hi> Hypotheſis, that rather aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
that quality to the Mercurial or
the Saline Principle, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cannot give a rational account of
the fuſibility of Sulphur. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though I readily allow (as I ſhall
have afterwards occaſion to declare)
that Sulphur, or an other of the <hi>tria
prima,</hi> may be met with, and even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in ſeveral bodies endowed
with the quality that is attributed to
their participation of that Principle;
yet that this may be no certain ſign
that the propos'd Quality muſt flow
from that Ingredient, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be aſſiſted to diſcern by this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration,
That if Tin be duly mixt
with Copper or Gold, or, as I have
tried, with Silver or Iron, it will make
them very brittle; and it is alſo an
Ingredient of divers other bodies that
are likewiſe brittle, as blew, green,
white, and otherwiſe colour'd, Amels,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60281:119"/>
which are uſually made of calcin'd
Tin (which the Tradeſmen call <hi>Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,</hi>)
colliquated with the Ingredients
of Cryſtal-glaſs and ſome ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mineral pigment. But though
in all the above-named brittle bodies,
Tin be a conſiderable Ingredient; yet
'twere very unadviſed to affirm, that
Brittleneſs in general proceeds from
Tin. For provided the ſolid parts of
conſiſtent bodies touch one another
but according to ſmall portions of
their ſurfaces, and be not implicated
by their contexture, the Metalline or
other Compoſition may be brittle,
though there be no Tin at all in it.
And in effect, the materials of glaſs
being brought to fuſion will compoſe
a brittle body, as well when there is
no Puttee colliquated with them, as
when there is. Calcin'd Lead by the
action of the fire may be melted into
a brittle maſs, and even into tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Glaſs, without the help of Tin
or any other additament. And I need
not add, that there are a multitude of
other bodies, that cannot be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60281:120"/>
to owe their brittleneſs to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of Tin, of which they have
no need, if the matter they conſiſt of
wants not the requiſite Mechanical
Diſpoſitions.</p>
                  <p>And here I ſhall venture to add, that
the way employed by the Chymiſts,
as well as the Peripateticks, of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
for things by the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
whether Elements, Principles,
or other bodies, that they ſuppoſe
them to conſiſt of, will often fruſtrate
the Naturaliſts expectation of events,
which may frequently prove differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from what he promis'd himſelf, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Conſideration of the Qualities
of each Ingredient. For the enſuing
Notes contain divers Inſtances,
wherein there emerges a new Quality
differing from, or even contrary to,
any that is conſpicuous in the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients;
as two tranſparent bodies
may make an opacous mixture, a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
body and a blew, one that is
green, two malleable bodies, a brittle
one, two actually cold bodies, a hot
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60281:120"/>
one, two fluid bodies, a conſiſtent
one, &amp;c. And as this way of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by material Principles hinders the
foreknowledg of Events from being
certain; ſo it much more hinders the
aſſignation of Cauſes from being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory;
ſo that perhaps ſome would
not think it very raſh to ſay, that thoſe
who judg of all mixt bodies as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
do of Medicines, barely by
the Qualities and Proportions of the
Ingredients (ſuch as among the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotelians</hi>
are the four Elements, and
among the Chymiſts the <hi>tria prima,</hi>)
do, as if one ſhould pretend to give
an account of the Phaenomena and
operations of Clocks and Watches,
and their Diverſities by this, That
ſome are made of braſs wheels, ſome
of iron, ſome have plain ungilt
wheels, others of wheels overlaid
with Gold, ſome furniſhed with gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings,
others with little chains, &amp;c.
and that therefore the Qualities and
Predominancies of theſe metalls that
make parts of the Watch, ought to
have aſcribed to them, what indeed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60281:121"/>
flows from their Coordination and

                  <p>THE <hi>laſt</hi> defect I obſerve in the
Chymical Doctrine of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
is, that in many caſes it agrees not
well with the Phaenomena of Nature,
and that by one or both of theſe ways.
<hi>Firſt,</hi> there are divers changes of
Qualities, wherein one may well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that a Chymical Principle ſhould
have a great ſtroak, and yet it does
not at all appear to have ſo. He that
conſiders, what great operations di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Hermeticks aſcribe to
this or that Hypoſtatical Principle,
and how many Qualities according
to them muſt from it be derived, can
ſcarce do other than expect, that a
great change as to thoſe Qualities
happening in a mixt body, ſhould at
leaſt be accompany'd with ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
action <hi>of,</hi> or alteration <hi>in</hi> the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60281:121"/>
Principle. And yet I have met with
many inſtances, wherein Qualities are
produced, or aboliſhed, or very much
altered, without any manifeſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
expulſion, or conſiderable
change of the Principle, whereon
<hi>that</hi> Quality is ſaid to depend, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
of either of the two <hi>others:</hi>
As when a piece of fine ſilver, that
having been neald in the fire, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to cool leiſurely, is very flexible,
is made ſtiff and hard to bend, barely
by a few ſtroaks of a hammer. And
a ſtring of a Lute acquires or loſes a
ſympathy, as they call it, with another
ſtring of the ſame or another Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
barely by being either ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo as to make an Uniſon with it,
or ſcrew'd up or let down beyond
or beneath that degree of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>To multiply inſtances of this kind
would be to anticipate thoſe, you will
hereafter meet with in their due pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And therefore I ſhall paſs on
from the firſt ſort of <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that
favour not the Chymical Hypotheſis
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60281:122"/>
about Qualities, to the other which
conſiſts of thoſe, wherein either that
does not happen which according to
their Hypotheſis ought to happen, or
the contrary happens to what accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Hypotheſis may juſtly be
expected. Of this you will meet with
inſtances hereafter; I ſhall now trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you but with one, the better to
declare my meaning. 'Tis not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to thoſe Chymiſts, that work
much in Silver and in Copper, that
the former will endure Ignition and
become red-hot in the fire, before it
will be brought to fuſion; and the
latter is yet far more difficult to be
melted down than the other; yet if
you ſeparately diſſolve thoſe two
metalls in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and by evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
reduce them to Cryſtalls,
theſe will be brought to fuſion in a
very little time, and with a very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Heat, without breaking the
glaſſes that contain them. If you
ask a vulgar Chymiſt the cauſe of
this facility of fuſion, he will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
tell you without ſcruple, that 'tis
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60281:122"/>
from the ſaline parts of the <hi>Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
which, being imbodied in the
metals and of a very fuſible nature,
impart that eaſineſs of fuſion to the
metals they are mixt with. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to which plauſible explication
one might well expect, that, if the
ſaline Corpuſcles were exquiſitly
mingled with Tin, they would make
it far more fuſible than of it ſelf it is.
And yet, as I have elſewhere noted,
when I put Tin into a convenient
quantity of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> the metal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
corroded, ſubſided, as is uſual, in
the form of whites of eggs, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well dried, the Tinn was ſo far
from being grown more fuſible by the
addition of the ſaline particles of the
<hi>Menſtruum,</hi> that, whereas 'tis known
that ſimple Tin will melt long before
it come to be red-hot, this prepar'd
Tin would endure for a good while
not only a thorow ignition, but the
blaſt of a pair of double bellows,
(which we uſually imploy'd to melt
Silver and Copper it ſelf,) without
being at all brought to fuſion. And
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60281:123"/>
as for thoſe Spagyriſts that admit, as
moſt of them are granted to do, that
all kinds of metals may be turned into
Gold by a very ſmall proportion of
what they call the Philoſophers
<hi>Elixir,</hi> one may I think ſhew them
from their own conceſſions, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Qualities may be changed even
in ſuch conſtant bodies as Metals,
without the addition of any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
proportion of the ſimple Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,
to which they are wont to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
thoſe Qualities; provided the
Agent, (as an efficient rather than as a
material Cauſe,) be able to make a
great change in the Mechanical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the parts whereof the
metal it acts on is made up. Thus if
we ſuppoſe a pound of Silver, a pound
of Lead, and a pound of Iron to be
tranſmuted into Gold, each by a grain
of the powder of projection, this
tinging powder, as a material Cauſe
is inconſiderable, by reaſon of the
ſmallneſs of its bulk, and as an effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
cauſe it works differing and even
contrary effects, according to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60281:123"/>
wherein it finds the metal to
be tranſmuted, and the changes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
in the conſtituent Texture of it.
Thus it brings Quick-ſilver to be fixt,
which it was not before, and deprives
it of the Fluidity which it had before;
it brings Silver to be indiſſolvable in
<hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> which readily diſſolved
it before, and diſſoluble in <hi>Aqua Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,</hi>
which before would not touch it;
and which is very conſiderable to our
preſent purpoſe, whereas it makes
Iron much more fuſible than <hi>Mars,</hi> it
makes Lead much leſs fuſible than
whileſt it retained its priſtine form,
ſince <hi>Saturn</hi> melts ere it come to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
which Gold requires to bring
it to fuſion. But this is propoſed
only as an Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> till
the Truth of the tranſmutation of
metals into Gold, by way of projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
be ſufficiently proved, and the
circumſtances and phaenomena of it
particularly declared.</p>
                  <p>I muſt not forget to take notice,
that ſome learned modern Chymiſts
would be thought to explicate divers
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60281:124"/>
of the Changes that happen to Bodies
in point of Odours, Colours, &amp;c. by
ſaying that in ſuch alterations the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
or other Hypoſtatical Principle
is <hi>intraverted</hi> or <hi>extraverted,</hi> or, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſpeak, <hi>inverted.</hi> But I confeſs,
to me theſe ſeem to be rather new
terms then real explications. For, to
omit divers of the Arguments men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in this preſent Treatiſe, that
may be applied to this way of ſolving
the Phaenomena of Qualities, one may
juſtly object, that the ſuppoſed Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverſion
or Intraverſion of Sulphur
can by no means reach to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of ſo great a variety of Odours,
Colours, and other Qualities as may
be found in the changed portions of
matter we are ſpeaking of. And
which is more, what they call by theſe
and the like names, cannot be done
without Local motion tranſpoſing the
particles of the matter, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
producing in it a change of
Texture, which is the very thing we
would infer, and which being ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
we may grant Sulphur to be often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60281:124"/>
actually preſent in the altered
Bodies, without allowing it to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
neceſſary to produce the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
in them, ſince Corpuſcles ſo
condition'd and contex'd would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
ſuch Effects, whether Sulphur,
as ſuch, did, or did not, make up the
ſubject matter of the Change.</p>
                  <p>And now I ſhall conclude, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recapitulate what has been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in this and the two foregoing
Chapters, with this ſummary conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
That the Chymiſt's Salt,
Sulphur and Mercury themſelves are
not the firſt and moſt ſimple Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Bodies, but rather primary
Concretions of Corpuſcles or Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
more ſimple than they, as being
endowed only with the firſt, or moſt
radical (if I may ſo ſpeak) and moſt
Catholick Affections of ſimple Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
namely Bulk, Shape, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Reſt; by the different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
or Coalitions of which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteſt
portions of matter are made
thoſe differing Concretions that
Chymiſts name Salt, Sulphur and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60281:125"/>
Mercury. And to this Doctrine it
will be conſonant, that ſeveral Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of this or that Spagyrical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
need not be derived from Salt,
for inſtance, or Sulphur as ſuch, but
may be explained by the help of ſome
of thoſe Corpuſcles that I have lately
call'd more Simple and Radical; and
ſuch Explications being more ſimple
and Mechanical, may be thought upon
that ſcore more fundamental and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory.</p>

                  <p>I Know it may be objected in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Chymiſts, that as their
Hypoſtatical Principles, Salt, Sulphur

Corpuſcularian Principles are but
very few; and the chief of them
<hi>Bulk, Size,</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> are but three

not only Triangles, Squares, Rhom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes,
Rhomboids, Trapezions, and
a multitude of Polygons, whether
ordinate or irregular; but, beſides
Cubes, Priſmes, Cones, Spheres, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linders,
Pyramids, and other Solids
of known Denominations, a ſcarce
numerable multitude of hooked,
branched, Eel-like, ſcrew-like, and
other irregular bodies; whereof
though theſe, and ſome others, have
diſtinct appellations, yet the greateſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60281:126"/>
part are nameleſs; ſo that it need be
no wonder, that I ſhould make the
Mechanical Principles ſo much
more fertile, that is, applicable to
the production and explication of a
far greater number of <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> than
the <hi>Chymical;</hi> which, whileſt they
are conſidered but as ſimilar bodies,
that are Ingredients of mixt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
ones, are chiefly variable
but by the greater or leſſer quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that is employed by Nature or Art
to make up the mixt body. And
Painters obſerve, that Black and
White, though mixt in differing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
will ſtill make but lighter
and darker grays. And if it be ſaid,
that theſe Ingredients, by the Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
reſulting from their mixtures,
may acquire Qualities that neither of
them had before; I ſhall anſwer, that,
to alledge this, is in effect to confeſs,
that they muſt take in the <hi>Mechanical</hi>
Principles, (for to them belongs the
Texture or Structure of bodies) to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the <hi>Chymical</hi> ones. And on this
occaſion, to borrow an illuſtration
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60281:126"/>
from our unpubliſhed <hi>Dialogue of the
Requiſites of a good Hypotheſis,</hi> I ſhall
add, that a Chymiſt that ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that becauſe his three Principles
are as many as thoſe of the Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularians,
they are as ſufficient as theſe
to give an account of the Book of
Nature, methinks, I ſay, he would
do like a man that ſhould pretend,
that with four and twenty words he
would make up a language as well as
others can with the four and twenty
Letters of the Alphabet, becauſe he
had as many words already formed,
as they had of bare Letters; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that inſtead of the ſmall
number of variations that can be
made of his words by Prepoſitions
and Terminations, the Letters of the
Alphabet being variouſly combined,
placed and reiterated, can be eaſily
made to compoſe not only his four
and twenty words, with their variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but as many others as a whole
language contains.</p>

                  <p>NOtwithſtanding all that I have
been obliged to ſay to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
of the Chymical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
in reference to the Explication
of Qualities, I would not be thought
to grant, that the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> have
reaſon to triumph, as if their four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
afforded a better Theory of
Qualities. For, if I had, together with
leiſure enough to perform ſuch a
Task, any obligation to undertake it,
I preſume, it would not be difficult
to ſhew, that the <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Doctrine
about particular Qualities is liable to
ſome of the ſame Objections with the
Chymical, and to ſome others no leſs
conſiderable; and that, to derive all the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> their Doctrine ought to
ſolve from <hi>Subſtantial Forms</hi> and <hi>real
Qualities Elementary,</hi> is to impoſe on
us a Theory more barren and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
than that of the Spagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:60281:127"/>
That to derive the particular Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of bodies from thoſe Subſtantial
Forms, whence the Schools would
have them to flow, is but an inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and unfit way of accounting for
them, may appear by this, that <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Forms</hi> themſelves are things,
whoſe exiſtence many Learned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
deny, whoſe Theory many
of them think Incomprehenſible, and
the moſt Candid and Judicious of the
<hi>Peripateticks</hi> themſelves confeſs it to
be very abſtruſe; ſo that from ſuch
doubtful and obſcure Principles we
can hardly expect clear Explications
of the nature and <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
not to urge, that the <hi>Ariſtoteli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Definitions, both of Qualities in
general, and of divers of the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Qualities in particular, as Heat,
Cold, Moiſture, Diaphaneity, &amp;c. are
far enough from being clear and well
framed, as we elſewhere have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſhew.</p>
                  <p>Another thing, which makes the
Scholaſtic Doctrine of Qualities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory,
is, that it ſeldom ſo much
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60281:128"/>
as attempts to teach the Manner how
the Qualities themſelves and their
Effects or Operations are produced.
Of this you may elſewhere find an
Inſtance given in the Quality that is
wont to be firſt in the liſt, viz that of
<hi>Heat,</hi> which though it may intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and probably be explicated by the
Corpuſcular Hypotheſis, yet in the
<hi>Peripatetic</hi> account that is given of it,
is both too queſtionable and too ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
to give much Content to a
Rational Inquirer. And indeed to ſay,
that a <hi>Subſtantial Form</hi> (as that of the
<hi>Fire</hi>) acts by a Quality (call'd Heat)
whoſe Nature 'tis to produce ſuch an
effect (as to ſoften Wax or harden
Clay) ſeems to be no other in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
than to ſay, that it produces
ſuch an effect by ſome power it has
to produce it. But what that power
is, and how it operates, is that, which,
though we moſt deſire to know, we
are left to ſeek. But to proſecute the
Imperfections of the <hi>Peripatetick Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi>
were to intrench upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſcourſe, where they are more
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60281:128"/>
fully laid open. And therefore I
ſhall now but lightly glance upon a
couple of imperfections, that more
particularly relate to the Doctrine of
Qualities.</p>
                  <p>And firſt I do not think it a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Argument that is wont to be
imployed by the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> for
their <hi>Elements,</hi> as well as by the
<hi>Chymiſts</hi> for their <hi>Principles,</hi> that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this or that Quality, which they
aſcribe to an Element or a Principle,
is found in this or that body, which
they call mixt, therefore it muſt owe
that Quality to the participation of
that Principle or Element. For, the
ſame Texture of parts or other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification
of matter may produce the
like Quality in the more ſimple and
the more compounded body, and
they may both ſeparately derive it
from the ſame Cauſe, and not one
from the Participation of the other.
So Water and Earth and Metals and
Stones, &amp;c. are heavy upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the common Cauſe of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and not becauſe the reſt partake
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60281:129"/>
of the Earth; as may appear in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
water, which is as ſimple a
body as it, and yet is heavy: So wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and oil, and exactly deflegm'd Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Wine, and Mercury, and alſo
Metals and Glaſs of Antimony, and
Minium or calcin'd Lead, whileſt theſe
three are in fuſion are fluid, being
made ſo by the variouſly determined
motions of their minute parts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cauſes of Fluidity, and not by
the participation of water, ſince the
arid <hi>Calces</hi> of Lead and Antimony
are not like to have retained in the
fire ſo volatile a liquor as water, and
ſince Fluidity is a Quality that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
enjoys in a more durable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
than Water it ſelf: For that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline
liquor, as alſo Spirit of Wine
well Rectified, will not be brought to
freeze with the higheſt degree of
Cold of our ſharpeſt winters, though
a far leſs degree of Cold would make
water ceaſe to be fluid and turn it into
Ice.</p>
                  <p>To this I ſhall only add (in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place,) that 'tis not unpleaſant
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60281:129"/>
to ſee, how arbitrarily the <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
derive the Qualities of bodies
from their four Elements, as if, to give
an inſtance in the lately named Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<hi>Liquidity,</hi> you ſhew them exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deflegmed Spirit of Wine, and ask
them, whence it has its great Fluid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
they will tell you from water,
which yet is far leſs fluid than it, and
this ſpirit of wine it ſelf is much leſs
ſo than the flame into which the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of wine is eaſily reſoluble. But if
you ask, whence it becomes totally
inflammable, they muſt tell you, from
the fire; and yet the whole body, at
leaſt as far as ſenſe can diſcover, is
fluid, and the whole body becomes
flame, (and then is moſt fluid of all;)
ſo that fire and water as contrary as
they make them, muſt both be by vaſt
odds predominant in the ſame body.
This ſpirit of wine alſo, being a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
whoſe leaſt parts that are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
are actually heavy, and compoſe
a Liquor which is ſeven or eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
times as heavy as Air of the
ſame bulk, which yet experience
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60281:130"/>
ſhews not to be devoid of weight,
muſt be ſuppoſed to abound with
Earthy particles, and yet this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
liquor may in a trice become
Flame, which they would have to be
the lighteſt body in the world.</p>
                  <p>But, to enlarge on this ſubject,
would be to forget, that the deſign
of this Tract engages me to deal not
with the <hi>Peripatetic</hi> School, but the
<hi>Spagyrical.</hi> To which I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
return, and give you this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement
about it, that what I
have hitherto objected is meant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the more common and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Doctrine about the Material Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of bodies reputed mixt, as 'tis
wont by vulgar Chymiſts to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the rendring an account of
the Qualities of ſubſtances Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real;
and therefore I pretend not,
that the paſt objections ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
againſt other Chymical Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
than that which I was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to queſtion. And if <hi>adept</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
(ſuppoſing there be ſuch) or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60281:130"/>
any other more than ordinarily Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Spagyriſts, ſhall propoſe any
particular Hypotheſes, differing from
thoſe that I have queſtioned, as their
Doctrine and Reaſons are not yet
known to me; ſo I pretend not that
the paſt Arguments ſhould conclude
againſt them, and am willing to think,
that Perſons advantaged with ſuch
peculiar opportunities to dive into
the Myſteries of Nature, will be able
to give us, if they ſhall pleaſe, a far
better account of the Qualities of
bodies than what is wont to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by the generality of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.</p>
                  <p>Thus, dear <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I have laid
before you ſome of the chief Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
I have obſerved in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Chymiſts Doctrine of Qualities,
and conſequently I have given you
ſome of the chief Reaſons that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me from acquieſcing in it. And
as my objections are not taken from
the Scholaſtical ſubtleties nor the
doubtful ſpeculations of the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks
or other Adverſaries of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60281:131"/>
Hermetick Philoſophy, but from the
nature of things and from Chymical
experiments themſelves; ſo I hope,
if any of your Spagyrical friends have
a minde to convince me, he will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to doe it by the moſt proper
way, which is, by actually giving us
clear and particular explications, at
leaſt of the grand <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
which, if he ſhall do, he will find
me very ready to acquieſce in a Truth
that comes uſher'd in, and endear'd by
ſo acceptable and uſeful a thing, as a
Philoſophical Theory of Qualities.</p>

                  <p>I Preſume, it will not be difficult
to diſcern, that much of what has
been ſaid about the <hi>Imperfection
of the vulgar Chymical Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Qualities,</hi> may with eaſie va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations
be applied to ſome other <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes</hi>
that are of kin to that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and particularly to their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60281:133"/>
Theory, that would derive both the
Qualities of Bodies and the reſt of the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature from what they
call <hi>Acidum</hi> and <hi>Alcali.</hi> For though
theſe two differences may be met
with in a great number and variety
of bodies, and conſequently the
Conſideratin of them may frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough be of good uſe, (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Spagyriſts, and Phyſitians, when
they are converſant about the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
and (if I may ſo call them) Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Cauſes and Operations of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

acquieſce in this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keli</hi>
and <hi>Acidum,</hi> in the latitude,
wherein I find it urged and applied by
the Admirers of it, as if it could be

                  </p>

what vulgar Chymiſts do to

of the objections we have made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the vulgar Chymical Doctrine,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60281:133"/>
may, as I lately intimated, be applied,
by a little variation, to this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall need but to touch upon

                  <p>AND <hi>firſt,</hi> it ſeems precarious to
affirm, that in all bodies, or even
in all the ſenſible parts of mixts, <hi>Acid</hi>
and <hi>Alcalizate</hi> parts are found; there
not having been, that I know, any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
Induction made of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
any thing near numerous
enough to make out ſo great an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in divers bodies, wherein
Experience is vouch'd for the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of theſe Principles, that Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
is indeed proved not by direct
and clear experience, but upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
that ſuch and ſuch effects
flow from the operations of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
Principles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60281:134"/>
Some Spagyriſts, when they ſee
<hi>Aqua fortis</hi> diſſolve Filings of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
conclude from thence, that the
Acid ſpirits of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> meet in
the metal with an <hi>Alcali</hi> upon which
they work; which is but an unſafe
way of arguing, ſince good Spirit of
Urin, which they take to be a volatile
<hi>Alcali,</hi> and which will make a great
Conflict with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> will, as I
have elſewhere noted, diſſolve filings
of Copper both readily enough and
more genuinly than the Acid liquor is
wont to do. So when they ſee the
Magiſtery of Pearl or Coral, made
by dropping oil of Tartar into the
ſolutions of thoſe bodies made with
ſpirit of Vinegar, they aſcribe the
Precipitation to the fixt <hi>Alcali</hi> of the
<hi>Tartar,</hi> that mortifies the Acidity
of the ſpirit of Vinegar; whereas the
Precipitation would no leſs inſue, if,
inſtead of Alcalizat oil of Tartar, we
imploy that highly acid liquor which
they call <hi>Oleum Sulphuris per Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60281:134"/>
I think alſo it may be doubted,
whether thoſe, I reaſon with, are ſo
certain as they ſuppoſe, that at leaſt
when they can manifeſtly diſcover an
Acid, for inſtance, in a body, the
operation of that body upon another,
which they judge to abound with an
<hi>Alcali,</hi> muſt be the effect of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
between thoſe two jarring Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
or, if I may ſo call them, Duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.
For an Acid body may do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things, not ſimply as an acid, but on
the ſcore of a Texture or modificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which endows it with other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
as well as Acidity, whoſe being
aſſociated with thoſe other Qualities
in ſome caſes may be but accidental
to the effect to be produced; ſince by
one or more of theſe other Qualities
the body may act in caſes, where Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
may make a Chymiſt conſider
nothing but Acidity. Thus when
ſome Chymiſts ſee an acid <hi>Menſtruum,</hi>
as <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> ſpirit of Salt, oil of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
&amp;c. diſſolve Iron, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſcribe the effect to an Acidity of
the liquors, whereas well dephlegmed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60281:135"/>
Urinous Spirits, which they hold to
have a great Antipathy to Acids, will,
as I have tried in ſome of them, readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough diſſolve crude Iron even
in the Cold. And on the other ſide,
<hi>Mercury</hi> will not work on the filings
of Iron, though this be ſo open a metal
that even weak liquors will do it;
and yet if one ſhould urge, that
Quickſilver readily diſſolves Gold in
Amalgamation, he may expect to be
told, according to their Doctrine, that
<hi>Mercury</hi> has in it an occult acid, by
which it performs the ſolution;
whereas it ſeems much more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that Mercury has Corpuſcles of
ſuch a ſhape and ſize as fit them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate
themſelves into the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate
Pores they meet with in Gold,
but make them unfit to enter readily
the Pores of Iron, to which Nature
has not made them congruous; as on
the other ſide the ſaline Corpuſcles of
<hi>Aqua fortis</hi> will eaſily find admiſſion
into the Pores of Iron, but not into
thoſe of Gold, to which they do not
correſpond as they do to the others.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60281:135"/>
And when a knife, whoſe blade is
touched with a Load-ſtone, cuts
bread and takes up filings of Iron, it
does neither of them upon the ſcore
of <hi>Alcali</hi> and <hi>Acidum,</hi> but the one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the viſible ſhape and the ſtiffneſs
of the blade, and the other upon the
latent Contrivance or change of Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
produced by the operation of
the Load-ſtone in the particles that
compoſe the Steel.</p>
                  <p>This may perhaps be farther illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
by adding, that when blew
<hi>Vitriol,</hi> being beaten and finely ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
makes a white pouder, that
whiteneſs is a quality which the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
has not as being of a Vitriolate
Nature. For Rock-Cryſtal or
Venice-glaſs being finely beaten will
have the ſame operation on the Eye,
but it proceeds from the tranſparen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the body and the minuteneſs,
multitude and confus'd ſcituation of
the Corpuſcles that make up the
Pouder. And therefore, if other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
be brought by Comminution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
parts endow'd with ſuch Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60281:136"/>
affections, as we have named;
theſe aggregates will act upon the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of Sight as white bodies.</p>

Exception againſt the <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
of the Duelliſts, which is, that the
Framers of it ſeem <hi>arbitrarily</hi> to have
aſſigned Provinces or Offices to each
of their two Principles, as the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi>
do to each of their <hi>tria prima,</hi>
and the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> to each of their
<hi>Four Elements.</hi> For 'tis not enough
to Say, that an <hi>Acid,</hi> for inſtance, as
ſuch, performs theſe things, and an
<hi>Alkali</hi> ſo many others, that they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the Operations and <hi>Phaenomena</hi>
of nature, or at leaſt (as ſome, more
cautious, are content to ſay) of mixt
bodies between them; ſince Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſuch great moment ought not
to be advanc'd or received without
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60281:136"/>
ſufficient Proof. And perhaps the
very diſtribution of Salts into <hi>Acids</hi>
and <hi>Alcalies</hi> hath ſomewhat of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
in it, ſince others may, without
aſſuming much more, take the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to diſtribute them otherwiſe,
there being not only ſeveral things
wherein Acids and Alcalies agree, but
alſo ſeveral things wherein Salts of
the ſame denomination widely differ.
As, for Inſtance, ſome Alkalies, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thoſe I reaſon with, are, like
ſalt of Tartar, fixt, and will endure the
violence of the fire; others, like ſalt
of Urin or Harts-horn, are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
fugitive, and will be driven up
with a ſcarce ſenſible degree of Heat;
ſome, as ſalt of Tartar, will precipitate
the ſolution of Sublimate into an
Orange-tawny; others, as ſpirit of
Blood and Harts-horn, precipitate
ſuch a ſolution into a milky ſubſtance.
Oil of Tartar will very ſlowly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
upon filings of Copper, which
Spirit of Urin and Harts-horn will
readily diſſolve in the Fire.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:60281:137"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60281:137"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60281:138"/>
And among <hi>Acids</hi> themſelves the
difference is no leſs if not much
greater. Some of them will diſſolve
bodies that others will not, as <hi>Aqua
fortis</hi> will diſſolve Silver and Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but leave Gold untouched; or as
<hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> though made without <hi>Sal
Armoniac</hi> that diſſolves Gold readily,
will diſſolve Mercury but ſcurvily,
and Silver not at all. And this may
happen, when the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> that will
not diſſolve the body is reputed much
ſtronger than that which does; as
dephlegm'd ſpirit of Vinegar will
diſſolve Lead, reduc'd to minute parts
in the cold; which is an effect that
Chymiſts are not wont to expect
from Spirit of Salt. Nay, which is
more, one Acid will precipitate what
another has diſſolved, and contrarily;
as ſpirit of Salt will precipitate Silver
out of ſpirit of Nitre. And I found
oil of Vitriol to precipitate bodies of
divers kinds, Minerals and others, out
of ſome acid Menſtruums, particularly
ſpirit of Vinegar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60281:138"/>
To this might be added the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
peculiar to ſome particular
Acids, as that <hi>Spirit of Nitre</hi> or <hi>Aqua
fortis</hi> will diſſolve Camphire into an
Oil, and coagulate common oil into a
conſiſtent and brittle ſubſtance like
Tallow; and, though it will both
corrode Silver, Copper, Lead, and
Mercury, and keep them diſſolved, it
will quickly let fall almoſt the whole
body of Tin, very ſoon after it has
corroded as much as it can of it. By
all which, and ſome other like Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
I am induc'd to queſtion, whether
the <hi>Acidum</hi> and <hi>Alkali,</hi> we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, have the ſimplicity that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
requires in Principles; and
ſhall be kept from wondering, if
others ſhall think it as free for them
to conſtitute other Principles, as 'tis
for the Learned men I reaſon with, to
pitch upon <hi>Acidum</hi> and <hi>Alkali.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſome perhaps will be bold to
ſay, that, ſince the former of thoſe
Principles comprehend ſuch a number
of bodies, that are, many of them, very
differing, and ſome of them directly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60281:139"/>
contrary in their operations, it ſeems
a ſlight and not Philoſophical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Nature, to define an
Acid by its Hoſtility to an Alcali,
which (they will ſay) is almoſt as if
one ſhould define a <hi>Man</hi> by ſaying,
that he is an Animal that is at enmity
with the Serpent; or a <hi>Lyon,</hi> that he
is a fourfooted beaſt that flies from a
Crowing Cock.</p>

               <div n="4" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
                  <p>BUT although one of the chiefeſt
Conditions that Philoſophers
may juſtly require in Principles, is,
that, being to explain other things,
they ſhould be very clear themſelves;
yet I do not much wonder, that the
Definitions given us of <hi>Acidum</hi> and
<hi>Alcali</hi> ſhould be but unaccurate and
ſuperficial, ſince I find not, that they
have themſelves any clear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Notion or ſure marks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to know them diſtinctly, without
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60281:139"/>
which Chymiſts will ſcarce be able
to form clear and ſetled Notions of
them. For to infer, as is uſual, that,
becauſe a body diſſolves another,
which is diſſoluble by this or that
known acid, the Solvent muſt alſo be
acid; or to conclude, that, if a body
precipitates a diſſolved metal out of
a confeſſedly acid Menſtruum, the
Precipitant muſt be an Alcali, to argue
thus, I ſay, 'tis unſecure; ſince, not to
repeat what I ſaid lately of Copper, I
found, that filings of Spelter will be
diſſolved as well by ſome Alcalies, (as
ſpirit of Sal Armoniac) as by Acids.
And bodies may be precipitated out
of acid Menſtruums, both by other
Acids, and by liquors, where there
appears not the leaſt <hi>Alcali:</hi> As I
have found, that a ſolution of Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs,
made in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> would be
precipitated both by Spirit of Salt
and by common or rain water. And
as for the other grand way that Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
employ, to diſtinguiſh Acids and
Alcalies, namely by the Heat, Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and bubbles that are excited,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60281:140"/>
upon their being put together, that
may be no ſuch certain ſign as they
preſume, they having indeed a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon particular Contextures
and other Mechanical affections, that
Chymiſts are not wont to take any
notice of. For almoſt any thing that
is fitted variouſly and vehemently to
agitate the minute parts of a body,
will produce Heat in it; and ſo,
though water be neither an Acid nor
an Alcalizate liquor, yet it would
quickly grow very hot, not only
with the highly acid Oil of Vitriol,
but (as I have more than once pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
tried and found) with the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Alcalizat Salt of Tartar. And 'tis
to be noted, that neither in the one
nor the other of theſe Incaleſcent
mixtures, there is produced any ſuch
viſible or audible conflict, as, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Doctrine of the Chymiſts
I reaſon with, one would expect. And
as for the production of bubbles,
eſpecially if accompanied with a
hiſſing noiſe, neither is that ſuch a
certain ſign as Chymiſts imagine: For
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60281:140"/>
the production of bubbles is not a
neceſſary effect or concomitant of
Heat excited by Conflicts, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
very much upon the peculiar
Diſpoſition of Bodies put together to
extricate, produce, or intercept par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Air, (or <hi>Steams,</hi> for the time
equivalent to them;) and therefore as
Oil of Vitriol, mixt in a due proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with fair water, may be brought to
make the water too hot to be held in
ones hand, without exciting bubbles;
ſo I have found by trials purpoſely
made, that Alcalizat Spirit of Urine
drawn from ſome kinds of Quick-lime,
being mixt with Oil of Vitriol
moderately ſtrong, would produce an
intenſe Heat, whileſt it produced ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
no manifeſt bubbles at all, or
ſcarce any, though the Urinous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
was ſtrong, and in other Trials
operated like an <hi>Alcali;</hi> and although
alſo with Spirit of Urin, made <hi>per ſe</hi>
the common way, the oil of Vitriol
will produce a great hiſſing and a
multitude of conſpicuous bubbles.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60281:141"/>
On the other ſide I have ſometimes,
though not ſo conſtantly, found, that
ſome Acid Spirits, eſpecially that of
Verdigreaſe made <hi>per ſe,</hi> would, when
poured upon Salt of Tartar, make a
Conflict with it, and produce a copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
froth, though we obſerved it not
to be accompanied with any manifeſt
Heat. And I elſewhere mention two
bodies, upon whoſe putting together
numerous bubbles would, for a long
time, and not without noiſe, be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
and ſucceed one another,
though I could perceive no Heat at
all to accompany this Tumult.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Taſt,</hi> which by many is
made a great Touchſtone, whereby
to know Acids and Alcalies, I conſider
that there is a multitude of mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
wherein we can ſo little diſcern
by the Taſt, which of the Principles
is Predominant, that this Senſe would
not oblige one to ſuſpect, much leſs to
conclude, there were one grain of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them to be found there; ſuch
bodies are Diamonds and Rubies, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60281:141"/>
moſt Gems, beſides many ignobler
Stones, and Gold and Silver and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
and I know not how many other
bodies. On the other ſide, there are
bodies that abound with Acid or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calizat
Salts, which either have no
Taſt, or a quite differing one from
that of the Chymical Principle. As
though Venice-glaſs be in great part
compoſed of a fixt <hi>Alcali;</hi> yet to the
Tongue it is inſipid, and Cryſtalls
of Lune and of Lead made with <hi>Aqua
fortis,</hi> and containing great ſtore of
the Acid particles of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi>
have nothing of Acidity in the mouth,
the latter having a ſaccharine ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the former an extream bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs.
And even in Vegetable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
that have a manifeſt Taſt, 'tis
not ſo eaſie to know by that, whether
it be the Acid or the Alcalizat Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
that is predominant in them; as
in the Eſſential oils of Spices and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Vegetables. And in the groſs
Empereumatical Oils of Woods, and
even in high Rectified Spirit of Wine,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60281:142"/>
which therefore ſome will have to be
an Alcalizat liquor, and others liſt it
among Acids, though I did not find it
neither to be deſtroyed or much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by being put upon Coral or ſalt
of Tartar, as would happen to an acid
<hi>Menſtruum,</hi> nor yet by being digeſted
with and diſtilled from ſea Salt, as
might be probably expected from an
Alcalizat one: Aand among thoſe very
bodies which their Taſts perſwade
Chymiſts to reckon amongſt Acids, one
may (according to what I formerly
noted) obſerve ſo great a difference
and variety of reliſhes, that, perhaps
without being too ſevere, I may ſay,
that if I were to allow Acids to be
One Principle, it ſhould be only in
ſome ſuch Metaphyſical ſenſe, as that
wherein Air is ſaid to be One Body,
though it conſiſt of the aſſociated ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviums
of a multitude of Corpuſcles
of very differing Natures, that agree
in very little ſave in their being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
enough to concur to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of a fluid aggregate, conſist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60281:142"/>
of flying parts. But having dwelt
longer than I intended on One Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
'tis time that I proceed to thoſe
that remain.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V.</head>
                  <p>ANother particular, I am unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with in the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of
<hi>Alcali</hi> and <hi>Acidum,</hi> is, that 'tis in divers
caſes either needleſs or uſeleſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Qualities,
there being ſeveral of theſe produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
deſtroyed, or altered, where there
does not appear any acceſſion, receſs,
or change of either of thoſe two
Principles; as when fluid water by
hard beating is turn'd into conſiſtent
froth, and when tranſparent red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
is, barely by being beaten and
ſifted finely, changed into a white and
opacous powder; and as when a very
flexible piece of fine ſilver being
hammer'd is brought to have a brisk
ſpring, and after a while will, inſtead
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60281:143"/>
of continuing malleable, crack or
cleave under the hammer; and as
when (to diſpatch and omit other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances)
a ſufficiently thin leaf of
Gold, held between the Light and the
Eye, appears green.</p>
                  <p>Another thing (of kin to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,)
that I like not in the Doctrine
of <hi>Acidum</hi> and <hi>Alcali,</hi> is, that though
the Patrons of it, whileſt they would
ſeem to conſtitute but two Principles,
are fain (as I lately intimated) to make
I know not how many differing ſorts
of Acids, beſides ſome variety of Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
<hi>yet</hi> their Principles are too few
and narrow to afford any ſatisfactory
explication of the <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> For
I fear, 'twill be very difficult for them
to give a Rational Account of Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Springineſs, Light, and Emphatical
Colours, Sounds, and ſome other
Qualities that are wont to be called
manifeſt; and much more of ſeveral
that are confeſt to be occult, as Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctricity,
and Magnetiſm; in which
laſt I ſee not, how the affirming that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60281:143"/>
there is in the Magnet an Acid and
an Alcali, and that theſe two are of
contrary Natures, will help to explain,
how a Load-ſtone does, as they ſpeak,
attract the ſame end of a poiſed
needle with one of its Poles, which
'twill drive away with the other, and
determine that needle when freely
placed, to point North and South, and
enable it to communicate by its bare
touch the ſame Properties, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of other ſtrange ones, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
piece of Steel. But I forbear to
alledge particular Examples refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the ſeveral Qualities above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
whether manifeſt or hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
becauſe that in great part is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done in our Notes about parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Qualities, in which 'twill appear
how little able the employing of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali</hi>
and <hi>Acidum</hi> will be to afford us an
account of many things. And though
I enlarge not here on this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet I take it to be of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that, though there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this were enough to ſhew that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60281:144"/>
the Hypotheſis that is liable to it, is
Inſufficient for the explication of
Qualities; and therefore 'twill not I
preſume be thought ſtrange that I
add, that, as for thoſe that would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
this narrow Chymical Doctrine
to the whole object of Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
they muſt do more than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
they will be able before they can
make me their Proſelyte, there being
a multitude of <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in nature
(divers whereof I elſewhere take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in reference to the Chymiſts

                  <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
                  <p>THE laſt thing (which comprizes
ſeveral others) that ſeems to
me a defect in the Doctrine of <hi>Alcali</hi>
and <hi>Acidum,</hi> is, that divers if not moſt
of thoſe very things that are preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be explicated by them, are not
ſatisfactorily explicated, ſome things
being taken into the explications that
are either not fundamental enough or
not clearly intelligible, or are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with both thoſe Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>And firſt I am diſſatisfied with the
very fundamental Notion of this
Doctrine, namely a ſuppoſed Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
between the tribe of Acids and
that of Alkalies, accompanied, if you
will have it ſo, with a friendſhip or
ſympathy with bodies belonging to
the ſame tribe or Family. For I look
upon Amity and Enmity as Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Intelligent Beings, and I have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60281:145"/>
not yet found it explained by any,
how thoſe Appetites can be placed
in Bodies Inanimate and devoid of
knowledge, or of ſo much as Senſe.
And I elſewhere endeavour to ſhew,
that what is called Sympathy and
Antipathy between ſuch bodies does
in great part depend upon the actings
of our own Intellect, which, ſuppoſing
in every body an innate appetite to
preſerve it ſelf both in a defenſive and
an offenſive way, inclines us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that that body, which, though
deſignleſly deſtroys or impairs the
ſtate or texture of another body, has
an Enmity to it, though perhaps a
ſlight Mechanical change may make
bodys, that ſeem extreamly hoſtile,
ſeem to agree very well and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate
to the production of the
ſame effects. As if the acid ſpirit of
Salt and the volatile <hi>Alkali</hi> (as they
will have it) that is commonly called
Spirit of Urine be put together, they
will, after a ſhort though fierce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
upon a new contexture unite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60281:145"/>
into a Salt, little, if at all, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Sal Armoniac, in which the
two reconciled Principles will amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
join in cooling of water, diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome metalline bodys, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
divers other effects. And ſo, if
upon a ſtrong ſolution of Salt of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhes
or of Salt of Tartar, good Spirit
of Nitre be dropt in a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
after the Heat and Tumult and
Ebullition are over, the Acid and the
Alkalizat Salts will convene into ſuch
a Concretion as Salt-peter, which is
taken to be a natural body, either ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous,
or at leaſt conſiſting of
parts that agree very friendly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and conſpire to conſtitute the
particular kind of Salt that Chymiſts
call Nitre.</p>
                  <p>But the Sympathy and Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
that is ſaid to be betwixt Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
bodys, I elſewhere more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
conſider, and therefore I ſhall
now add in the ſecond place, That
the Explications made of <hi>Phaenomena</hi>
according to the Doctrine of <hi>Alcali</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:60281:146"/>
and <hi>Acidum</hi> do not, in my apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
perform what may be juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from Philoſophical Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
'Tis ſaid indeed, that the <hi>Acidum</hi>
working on the <hi>Alcali,</hi> or this upon
that, produces the effect propoſed;
but that is only to tell us, what is the
Agent that operates, and not the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the operation, or the means
and proceſs whereby it produces the
effect propoſed, and 'tis this <hi>modus</hi>
that Inquiſitive Naturaliſts chiefly
deſire to learn. And if it be ſaid, that
it is by the mutual hoſtility of the
Principles that the effect is produced,
it may be anſwered, that beſides, that
that hoſtility it ſelf is not, as we have
juſt now obſerved, a thing clear, if ſo
much as Intelligible; this is ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and indeterminate a way of expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
things, as can afford little or no

numerous and very various the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Qualities are.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
                  <p>TO clear up and to countenance
what I have been now ſaying,
I ſhall only take notice of ſome few
obvious Phaenomena of one of the
moſt familiar Operations wherein
Acidum and Alcali are ſuppoſed to
be the grand Agents. 'Tis known
to the very Boys of Chymiſts, that
<hi>Aqua Regis</hi> will diſſolve Gold, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and Mercury, and that with theſe
metals, eſpecially with the ſecond,
it will produce an intenſe degree of
heat. If now the Cauſe of this
Heat be demanded, it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that the Patrons of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elliſts
will anſwer, that 'tis from the
action of the Acid ſalts of the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum
upon the Alcali they meet
with in the Metalls. But not to
mention how many things are here
preſumed, not proved; nor that I
know ſome Acid Menſtruums, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60281:147"/>
ſome much more evidently Alcali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zate
Bodys than theſe Metals are,
which yet do not upon their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
produce any ſenſible heat; not,
I ſay, to mention theſe, it is eaſie to
diſcern, that this anſwer names in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
two ſuppoſed efficients of Heat,
but does not explicate or declare
<hi>how</hi> theſe Agents produce that Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which depends upon a certain
vehement and various agitation of
the ſingly inſenſible parts of Bodys,
whether the Duelliſts, or any other,
though very differing, Cauſes put
them into a motion ſo modified.
And therefore Gold and Copper by
bare Concuſſion may be brought to
an intenſe degree of heat without
the acceſſion of any acid parts to
work upon them. But then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when we are told, that <hi>Aqua
Regis</hi> by its Acidity working on the
Metalline Alcali makes a diſſolution
of the Metal; I am told indeed
what they think to be the Agent in
this change, but not at all ſatisfied
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60281:147"/>
how this Agent effects it; for, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
being a very hard metal, and
Gold generally eſteemed by Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
the cloſeſt and compacteſt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in nature, I would gladly know,
by what power and way ſuch weak
and probably either brittle or flex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible
bodys as acid Salts, are enabled
with that force to disjoin ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
and cloſely coherent Corpuſcles
as make up the viſible maſſes of
Copper and Gold, nay, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them with that violence as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to toſs up multitudes of them
into the air. And ſince in the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of theſe Metals there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Phaenomenon to be accounted
for, as well as the forcing of the
parts aſunder, namely the ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Metal in the Menſtruum,
the Chymiſts would have much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
me, if they had well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
how their Acidum and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali
is able to ſuſtain and give flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
to the Corpuſcles of the diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Metal, which though it be but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60281:148"/>
Copper, is nine times as heavy as a
bulk of water equal to it, and if it
be Gold, is nineteen times heavier
than the Liquor that muſt keep it
from ſinking; and at leaſt divers
times heavier in ſpecie than the Salts,
that are mingled with the aqueous
parts, can make the Menſtruum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of them both. Whereas Trial
has aſſured me, that, if a piece of
Wax or any other ſuch matter be
made by leſs than the hundredth
part heavier than an equal bulk of
Water, it will, when thoroughly
immerſed, fall to the bottom and reſt
there. I might alſo ask a further
Queſtion about theſe Diſſolutions, as
why, whereas <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> diſſolves
Mercury without being much chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in colour by it, Gold retains its
own Citrinity or yellowneſs in the
ſolvent, and the ſolution of Copper
is of a colour, which being greeniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blew
is quite differing from that of
the metal that affords it, as well as
from that of the ſolvent? And I
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60281:148"/>
might recruit theſe with other Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
not impertinent, but that theſe
may ſuffice (for a ſample) on this
Occaſion, and allow me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this Chapter, by repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
One thing which I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recommend and inculcate to you,
namely, that <hi>Thoſe Hypotheſes do
not a little hinder the progreſs of
Humane knowledge that introduce
Morals and Politicks into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
of Corporeal Nature,
where all things are indeed tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
according to Laws Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi>

                  <p>I Might eaſily have been more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
in the Inſtances annext to
the foregoing Animadverſions, but
that, being deſirous to be ſhort as
well as clear, I purpoſely declined
to make uſe of divers others, that
ſeemed proper to be employed, and
indeed might ſafely enough have
been ſo, becauſe thoſe I have <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,</hi>
and eſpecially thoſe, (which
make a great part of them) that are
Mechanical, are not liable to the
ſame exceptions, that I foreſaw
might be made to elude the force of
the Examples I <hi>paſſed by.</hi> And
though I think I could very well
make thoſe foreſeen Objections ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
groundleſs or unſatisfactory;
yet that could ſcarce be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
engaging in Controverſies that
would prove more tedious than I

                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:60281:149"/>
And yet, although what I have
ſaid in this Excurſion be but a part
of what I could ſay, I would not
be thought to have forgot what I
intimated at the beginning of it.
For though the Reaſons I alledged
keep me from acquieſcing in the
Doctrine of <hi>Alcali</hi> and <hi>Acidum,</hi> as
'tis propoſed under the notion of a
Philoſophical <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> ſuch as the
Carteſian or Epicurean, which are
each of them alledged by their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracers
to be Mechanical, and of
a very Catholick extent; yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not, that the Conſideration of
the Duelliſts (or the two jarring
Principles of <hi>Alcali</hi> and <hi>Acidum</hi>)
may be of good uſe to Spagyriſts
and Phyſitians, as I elſewhere fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
declare. Nor do I pretend by
the paſt diſcourſe that queſtions one
Doctrine of the Chymiſts, to beget
a general contempt of their Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and much leſs of their Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For the operations of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry
may be miſapplied by the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60281:150"/>
Reaſonings of the Artiſts
without ceaſing to be themſelves
things of great uſe, as being appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
as well to the Diſcovery or
Confirmation of ſolid Theories, as
the production of new <hi>Phaenomena,</hi>
and beneficial effects. And though
I think, that many <hi>Notions</hi> of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi>
and <hi>Helmont</hi> and ſome other
Eminent Spagyriſts are unſolid, and
not worthy the veneration that their
Admirers cheriſh for them; yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the <hi>Experiments,</hi> which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are alledged to favour theſe
notions, or on other accounts are to
be met with among the followers of
theſe men, deſerve the curioſity if
not the eſteem of the Induſtrious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers
into Natures Myſteries.
And looking upon Chymiſtry in
groſs as a Diſcipline ſubordinate to
Phyſiques, even Mechanical Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
may juſtly, in my opinion,
think favourably of it, ſince, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Imperfections, or, if they pleaſe,
Extravagancies there may be in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60281:150"/>
the Principles and Explications of
<hi>Paracelſus</hi> or other Leading Artiſts,
theſe faults of the Theorical part
may be ſufficiently compenſated
by the Utilities that may be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Practical part. And
this I am the rather induced to
ſay, becauſe the Experiments, that
Chymiſtry furniſhes, may much
aſſiſt a Naturaliſt to rectifie the
Erroneous Theories that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
accompany Them, and even
thoſe (Miſtakes) that are endeavour'd
to be evinced by them.</p>
                  <p>And (to conclude) Chymiſtry
ſeems to deal with men in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

to Metals, aſſiſting wary
men to detect the Errors, unto
which it may have miſled the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary:

                  <p>WHen, after I had gone through
the common Operations of
Chymiſtry, I began to make ſome
ſerious Reflections on them, I
thought 'twas pity, that Inſtruments
that might prove ſo ſerviceable to
the advancement of Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
ſhould not be more ſtudiouſly
and skilfully made uſe of to ſo good
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60281:154"/>
a purpoſe. I ſaw indeed, that divers
of the Chymiſts had by a diligent
and laudable employment of their
pains and induſtry, obtain'd divers
Productions, and lighted on ſeveral
Phaenomena conſiderable in their
kind, and indeed more numerous,
than, the narrowneſs and ſterility of
their Principles conſider'd, could
well be expected. But I obſerved
too, that the generality of thoſe that
buſie themſelves about Chymical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations;
ſome becauſe they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
Phyſick; and others becauſe
they either much wanted, or gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
coveted money, aimed in their
Trials but at the Preparation of
good Medicines for the humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or to diſcover the ways of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Diſeaſes or Imperfections of
Metals, without referring their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
to the advancement of Natural
Philoſophy in general; of which
moſt of the Alchymiſts ſeem to have
been ſo incurious, that not onely
they did not inſtitute Experiments
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60281:154"/>
for that purpoſe, but overlookt and
deſpis'd thoſe undeſign'd ones that
occurr'd to them whilſt they were
proſecuting a preparation of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
or a Tranſmutation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.
The ſenſe I had of this too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
omiſſion of the Chymiſts, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
me ſometimes to try, whether
I could do any thing towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
of it by handling Chymiſtry,
not as a Phyſician, or an Alchymiſt,
but as a meer Naturaliſt, and ſo by
applying Chymical Operations to
Philoſophical purpoſes. And in
purſuance of theſe thoughts, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I drew up a Scheme of what
I ventur'd to call a <hi>Chymia Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phica,</hi>
not out of any affectation of
a ſplendid Title, but to intimate,
that the Chymical Operations, there
treated of, were not directed to the
uſual ſcopes of Phyſicians, or Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muters
of Metals, but partly to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate
or confirm ſome Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Theories by ſuch Operations;
and partly to explicate thoſe Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60281:155"/>
by the help of ſuch Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p>But before I had made any great
progreſs in the purſuit of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
the fatal Peſtilence that raged
in <hi>London,</hi> and in many other parts of
<hi>England,</hi> in the years 1664 and 65,
obliging me among the reſt to make
ſeveral removes; which put me upon
taking new meaſures, and engaging
me in other employments of my
time, made me ſo long neglect the
Papers I had drawn up, that at laſt I
knew not where to finde them,
(though I hope they are not yet
miſlaid beyond recovery,) which I
was the leſs troubled at, becauſe the
great difficulties, to be met with in
ſuch an undertaking, did not a little
diſcourage me, ſuch a Task requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
as well as deſerving a Perſon
better furniſhed, than I had reaſon
to think my ſelf, with Abilities, Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
Chymical Experiments, and
Conveniences, to try as many more
as ſhould appear needful. But yet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60281:155"/>
to break the Ice for any that may
hereafter think fit to ſet upon ſuch a
Work, or to ſhorten my own La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
if I ſhould ſee cauſe to reſume
it my ſelf, I was content to throw in
among my Notes about other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Qualities, ſome Experiments
and Obſervations about ſome of
thoſe, that I have elſewhere call'd
<hi>Chymical Qualities,</hi> becauſe 'tis chieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Operations of Chymiſts,
that men have been induced to take
ſpecial notice of them. Of theſe
Notes I have aſſigned to ſome Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
more, and to ſome fewer, as
either the nature or importance of
the Subject ſeemed to require, or
my Leiſure and other Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
would permit. And though I
have not here handled the Subjects
they belonged to, as if I intended
ſuch a <hi>Chymia Philoſophica</hi> as I late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mentioned, becauſe my deſign
did not make it neceſſary, but did
perhaps make it impertinent for me
to do ſo, yet in ſome of the larger
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60281:156"/>
Notes about <hi>Volatility</hi> and <hi>Fixtneſs,</hi>
and eſpecially about <hi>Precipitation,</hi> I
have given ſome little <hi>Specimens</hi> of
the Theorical part of a Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Account of thoſe Qualities or
Operations, that I hope will not be
wholly uſeleſs. I know, it may be
objected, that I ſhould have employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Inſtances ſome more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Experiments, if not <hi>Arcana;</hi>
but though poſſibly I am not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unfurniſhed with ſuch, yet
aiming rather to promote Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
than appear a Poſſeſſor of ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
Proceſſes, I declined ſeveral
Experiments that required either
more skill, or more time, or more
expence than could be well expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from moſt Readers, and choſe
rather to employ ſuch Experiments
as may be more eaſily or cheaply
tried, and, which is mainly to be
conſider'd, being more ſimple, are
more clearly intelligible, and more fit
to have Notions and Theories built
upon them; eſpecially conſidering,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60281:156"/>
that the Doctrine of Qualities being
it ſelf converſant about ſome of the
Rudimental parts, if I may ſo call
them, of Natural Philoſophy, it
ſeemed unfit to employ intricate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
and whoſe Cauſes were
liable to many diſputes, to ſettle a
Theory of them. In ſhort, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
being to hold a Taper not ſo
much to Chymiſts as to the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts,
'twas fit I ſhould be leſs ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
to gratifie the former than to
inform the later.</p>

                     <p>AS far as I have yet obſerved, the
Qualifications or Attributes,
on whoſe account a portion
of matter is found to be <hi>Volatile,</hi> are
chiefly four; whereof the three for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
moſt regard the ſingle Corpuſcles
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60281:158"/>
as ſuch; and the laſt, the manner of
their Union in the aggregate or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
they make up.</p>
                     <p>But before I enter upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
give me leave to advertiſe you
here once for all, That in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Notes about <hi>Volatility</hi> and <hi>Fixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
when I ſpeak of the Corpuſcles
or minute parts of a body, I doe not
mean ſtrictly either the Elementary
parts, ſuch as Earth and Water, or
the Hypoſtatical Principles, ſuch as
Salt, Sulphur, or Mercury; for theſe
things come not here into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But onely ſuch Corpuſcles,
whether of a ſimple, compounded or
decompounded Nature, as have the
particles they conſiſt of ſo firmly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that they will not be totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
or diſſipated by that degree
of Fire or Heat, wherein the matter
is ſaid to be volatile or to be fixt.
But theſe combined particles will in
their aggregate either aſcend, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
unraiſed <hi>per modum <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nius</hi> (as
they ſpeak) or as one intire Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcle.
As in a Corpuſcle of Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60281:158"/>
whether it be a natural or fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
thing, or whether it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
ſimilar, or compounded of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
parts, I look upon the intire
Corpuſcle as a volatile portion of
matter; and ſo I doe on a Corpuſcle
of Sulphur, though experience ſhews
when 'tis kindled, that it has great
ſtore of acid Salt in it, but which is
not extricated by bare ſublimation:
And ſo Colcothar of Vitriol falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our conſideration as a fixt body,
without inquiring what cupreous or
other mineral and not totally fixt
parts may be united with the Earthly
ones; ſince the fires, we expoſe it
to, do not ſeparate them.</p>
                     <p>And this being premiſed in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
I now proceed to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
And firſt to make a volatile
body, the parts ſhould be very ſmall.
For, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> thoſe that are ſo,
are more eaſily put into motion by
the action of the fire and other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
and conſequently more apt to
be elevated, when, by the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the movent, the ſituation
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60281:159"/>
of the neighbouring bodies, or other
Mechanical Circumſtances, the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
Corpuſcles can continue their
motion with leſs reſiſtance upwards
than any other way, (as either down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
or horizontally.) And if, as
'tis highly probable, that which in
light bodies, or at leaſt in moſt of
them, is wont to paſs for <hi>poſitive</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
be but a leſs degree of gravity
than that of thoſe contiguous bodies
that raiſe them; it will happen, that
in very many caſes, (for I ſay not in
all) the great proportion of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of a Corpuſcle to its bulk, (which
is uſually greater in the leſſer parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles)
by making it more apt to be
wrought on, either by the air agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the fire, or by the <hi>effluvia</hi> of
kindled fuell, or by the impulſe of
the ſhaken Corpuſcles of the body it
ſelf, will much facilitate the elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſuch a minute particle, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
a greater portion of it to the
action of the agent, as it will often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
alſo facilitate the renewed ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation
of ſuch a ſmall body in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60281:159"/>
air, which reſiſts more the deſcent of
particles whoſe ſurfaces are large,
than of others of the ſame gravity
and bulk: As a leaf of paper diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
will much longer hover in the
Air, than if it were reduced into a
ball or pellet. That this minuteneſs
of particles may diſpoſe them to be
carried upwards, by the impulſe of
other bodies and that of the agitated
Air, is very obvious to be obſerved:
As we ſee, that Horſes in a high-way,
though they be not able with the
ſtrokes of their feet to make ſtones,
or gravel, or clods of Earth fly up,
yet they will eaſily raiſe clouds of
duſt oftentimes mingled with the
ſmaller grains of ſand. And where
Timber is ſawing, the ſame wind that
will not in the leaſt move the beams,
and ſcarce at all move the chips, will
eaſily carry up the Saw-duſt into the
Air. And we ſee in our Chimneys,
that the ſmoak readily aſcends, whilſt
even ſmall clods of ſoot, which is but
an aggregate of the particles of ſmoak,
fall headlong down.</p>

                  <div n="2" type="chapter">

                     <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                     <p>THE next qualification requiſite
in the corpuſcles of Volatile
bodies is, that they be not too ſolid
or heavy. For if they be ſo, though
their bulk be very ſmall, yet, unleſs
other Circumſtances do much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate
their weight, 'twill be very
difficult to elevate them, becauſe of
the great diſproportion of their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific
gravity <hi>to</hi> that of the Air,
(which contributes to ſuſtain and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
raiſe many ſorts of volatile parts)
and <hi>to</hi> the ſtrength of the igneous
effluvia or other agents that would
carry them up. Thus we ſee, that
filings of Lead or Iron, and even
Minium (which is the calx of Lead)
though the grains they conſiſt of be
very ſmall, will not eaſily be blown
up like common duſt, or meal, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
powders made of leſs ponderous
materials.</p>
                     <p>A third Qualification to be deſired
in the corpuſcles that ſhould make
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60281:160"/>
up a Volatile body is, that they be
conveniently ſhaped for motion. For
if they be of branched, hook'd, or
other very irregular or inconvenient
figures, they will be apt to be ſtopt
and detained by other bodies, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
among themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
very difficult to be carried
upwards, in regard that, whilſt they
are thus faſtened either to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or to any ſtable body, each
ſingle Corpuſcle is not onely to be
conſidered, as having its own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
bulk, ſince its coheſion with the
other corpuſcle or body that detains
it, makes them fit to be look'd upon
<hi>per modum <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nius;</hi> that degree of
heat they are expoſed to being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
uncapable of disjoyning them.
And this may be one Reaſon, why
Water, though it be ſpecifically hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
than Oil, yet is much more eaſily
brought to exhale in the form of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
than is Oil, whoſe corpuſcles
by the laſting ſtains they leave on
cloath, wood, wool, &amp;c. (which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will but tranſiently moiſten, not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60281:161"/>
ſtain) ſeems to be of very intangling
figures.</p>
                     <p>The fourth and laſt qualification
requiſite in a Volatile body is, that
the parts do looſely adhere, or at
leaſt be united in ſuch a manner, as
does not much indiſpoſe them to be
ſeparated by the fire in the form of
fumes or vapours.</p>
                     <p>For he that conſiders the matter,
will eaſily grant, that, if the contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the corpuſcles, whereof a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
conſiſts, be intricate, or their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion
ſtrong, their mutual implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or their adherence to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
will make one part hinder ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from flying ſeparately away, and
their conjunction will make them too
heavy or unweildy to be elevated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as intire though compounded
parts. Thus we ſee, that in Spring,
or the beginning of Summer, a wind,
though not faint, is unable to carry
off the lighteſt leaves of trees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſtick faſt to the bows and
twigs on which they grow, but in
Autumn, when that adheſion ceaſes,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60281:161"/>
and the leaves ſit but looſely on, a
wind no ſtronger than that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
before, will with eaſe blow
them off, and perhaps carry them up
a good way into the Air. But here
note, that it was not without ſome
cauſe, that I added above, that in a
fluid body, the parts ſhould at leaſt
be united in ſuch a manner, as does
not much indiſpoſe them to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.
For 'tis not impoſſible, that
the parts of a body may, by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and ſmoothneſs of the ſurfaces,
be ſufficiently apt to be put into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and yet be indiſpoſed to admit
ſuch a motion as would totally ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them and make them fly up into
the Air. As, if you take two pieces
of very flat and well-poliſhed marble
or glaſs, and lay them one upon the
other, you eaſily make them ſlide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
each others ſurfaces, but not
eaſily pull up one of them, whileſt
the other continues its ſtation. And
when Glaſs is in the ſtate of fuſion,
the parts of it will eaſily ſlide along
each other, (as is uſual in thoſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60281:162"/>
fluids) and conſequently change
places, and yet the continuity of
the whole is not intirely broken, but
every corpuſcle does ſomewhere
touch ſome other corpuſcle, and
thereby maintain the coheſion that
indiſpoſes it for that intire ſeparation
accompanied with a motion upwards
that we call avolation. And ſo,
when Salt-peter alone, is in a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
expoſed to the fire, though a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
moderate degree of it will ſuffice
to bring the Salt to a ſtate of fuſion,
and conſequently to put the corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles
that compoſe it into a reſtleſs
motion; yet a greater degree of heat,
than is neceſſary to melt it, will not
extricate ſo much as the Spirits, and
make them fly away.</p>

                     <p>THE foregoing Doctrine of the
Volatility of bodies may be
as well illuſtrated as applied, if we
proceed to deduce from it the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60281:162"/>
ways of Volatilization of bodies,
or of introducing volatility into an
aſſigned portion of matter. For
theſe wayes ſeem not inconveniently
reducible to five, which I ſhall ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
mention, though Nature and
Art do uſually imploy two or more
of them in conjunction. For which
Reaſon I would not, when I ſpeak of
one of theſe wayes, be underſtood as
if, excluding the reſt, I meant that no
other concurred with it.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of the five ways or means
of Volatilizing a body is, to reduce it
into minute parts, and, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi>
the more minute they are the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>That the bringing a body into ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
minute parts may much conduce
to the volatilizing of it, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from the vulgar practice of
the Chymiſts, who when they would
ſublime or diſtill Antimony, Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac,
Sea-ſalt, Nitre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
wont to beat them to powders to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
their receiving a further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
by the action of the fire.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60281:163"/>
And here I obſerve, that in ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
this comminution ought not to
be made onely at firſt, but to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
afterwards. For Chymiſts find
by experience, though perhaps with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conſidering the reaſon of it, that
Sea-ſalt and Nitre, will very hardly
afford their Spirits in Diſtillations,
without they be mingled with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
clay or bole, or ſome ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
additament, which uſually twice
or thrice exceeds the weight of the
Salt it ſelf: Although theſe addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
being themſelves fixt, ſeem
unlikely to promote the volatiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the bodies mixt with them,
yet by hindering the ſmall grains of
Salt to melt together into one lump
or maſſe, and conſequently by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in the ſtate of Comminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they much conduce to the driving
up of the Spirits or the finer parts of
the Salts by the operation of the
fire.</p>
                     <p>But to proſecute a little what I
was ſaying of the Conduciveneſs of
bringing a body into ſmall parts to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60281:163"/>
the volatilization of it, I ſhall add,
that in ſome caſes the Comminution
may be much promoted by employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Phyſical, after Mechanical, ways;
and that, when the parts are brought
to ſuch a pitch of exiguity, they may
be elevated much better than before.
Thus, if you take filings of <hi>Mars,</hi> and
mix them with <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> ſome
few parts may be ſublimed; but if,
as I have done, you diſſolve thoſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
in good Spirit of Salt inſtead of
Oil of Vitriol, and having coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ſolution, you calcine the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Cryſtalls or <hi>vitriolum Martis</hi> that
will be afforded, you may with eaſe,
and in no long time, obtain a <hi>Crocus
Martis</hi> of very fine parts; ſo that I
remember, when we exquiſitely min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
this very fixt powder with a
convenient proportion of <hi>Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac,</hi>
and gradually preſs'd it with a
competent fire, we were able to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
at the firſt Sublimation a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
part of it; and adding a like,
or ſomewhat inferiour, proportion of

                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:60281:164"/>
we could raiſe ſo conſiderable
a part of that alſo, and in it of the
<hi>Crocus,</hi> that we thought, if we had
had Conveniency to purſue the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
we ſhould, by not many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Sublimations, have elevated
the whole <hi>Crocus,</hi> which (to hint that
upon the by,) afforded a Sublimat of
ſo very aſtringent a Taſt, as may
make the trial of it in ſtanching of
blood, ſtopping of fluxes, and other
caſes, where potent aſtriction is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,

                     <p>THE ſecond means to volatilize
bodies is, to rub, grind, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
reduce their corpuſcles to
be either ſmooth, or otherwiſe fitly
ſhaped to clear themſelves, or be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intangled
from each other.</p>
                     <p>By reaſon of the minuteneſs of the
corpuſcles, which keeps them from
being ſeparately diſcernible by the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60281:164"/>
Eye, 'tis not to be expected, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
and ocular Inſtances ſhould
be given on this occaſion; but that
ſuch a change is to be admitted in the
ſmall parts of many bodies, brought
to be volatile, ſeems highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from the account formerly given
of the requiſites or conditions of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latility,
whoſe introduction into a
portion of matter will ſcarce be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
without the intervention of
ſuch a change. To this ſecond Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Volatilization, in concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with the firſt, may probably
be referred the following Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:
In the two firſt of which there
is imployed no additional volatile In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient;
and in the fourth, a fixt
body is diſpoſed to volatility by the
operation of a Liquour, though this
be carefully abſtracted from it.</p>
                     <p>1. If Urine freſhly made be put to
diſtill, the Phlegm will firſt aſcend,
and the Volatile ſalt will not riſe 'till
that be almoſt totally driven away,
and then requires a not inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
degree of fire to elevate it. But,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60281:165"/>
if you putrefie or digeſt Urine,
though in a well-cloſed Glaſs-Veſſel,
for ſeven or eight weeks, that gentle
warmth will make the ſmall parts ſo
rub againſt, or otherwiſe act upon,
one another, that the finer ones of
the Salt will perhaps be made more
ſlender and light, and however will
be made to extricate themſelves ſo
far as to become volatile, and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
in a very gentle heat, leave
the greateſt part of the phlegm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them.</p>
                     <p>2. So, if Muſt, or the ſweet juice
of Grapes, be diſtilled before it have
been fermented, 'tis obſerved by
Chymiſts, and we have tried the like
in artificial Wine made of Raiſins,
that the phlegm, but no ardent Spirit,
will aſcend. But when this Liquour
is reduced to Wine by fermentation,
which is accompanied with a great
and inteſtine commotion of the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
parts, hitting and rubbing againſt
one another, whereby ſome proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
come to be broken, others to be
variouſly ground and ſubtilized, the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60281:165"/>
more ſubtile parts of the Liquour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extricated, or ſome of the parts
being, by theſe operations, brought
to be ſubtile, they are qualified to
be raiſed by a very gentle heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the phlegm, and convene into
that fugitive Liquour, that Chymiſts,
for its activity, call Spirit of Wine.
Nor is it onely in the ſlighter Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
afforded by Animals and Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
that Volatility may be effected
by the means lately mentioned: For
experience hath aſſured me, that 'tis
poſſible, by an artificial and long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion,
wherein the parts have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
for frequent juſtlings and attriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſo to ſubtilize and diſpoſe the
corpuſcles even of common Salt for
Volatility, that we could make them
aſcend in a moderate fire of Sand
without the help of Bole, Oil of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
or any Volatilizing additament;
and, which is more conſiderable, the
Spirit would in riſing precede the
Phlegm, and leave the greateſt part
thereof behind it.</p>
                     <p>This inteſtine commotion of parts
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60281:166"/>
capable of producing Volatility in the
more diſpoſed portions of a body,
though it be much more eaſie to be
found in Liquours, or in moiſt and
ſoft bodies, yet I have ſometimes,
though rarely, met with it in dry
ones. And particularly I remember,
that ſome years ago having, for trial
ſake, taken Muſtard-ſeed, which is a
body pregnant with ſubtile parts, and
cauſed it to be diſtilled <hi>per ſe</hi> in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort,
I had, as I hoped, (without any
more ado,) a great many grains of a
clear and figured Volatile ſalt at the
very firſt diſtillation: which Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
having, for the greater ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
made a ſecond time with the like
ſucceſs, I mentioned it to ſome Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Chymiſtry, as what I juſtly
ſuppoſed they had not heard of. I
leave it to farther Inquiry, whether,
in a body ſo full of Spirits as Muſtard-ſeed,
the action and re-action of the
parts among themſelves, perhaps pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
by juſt degrees of fire, might
not ſuffice to make in them a change
equivalent in order to Volatilization,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60281:166"/>
and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the yielding a Volatile Salt, to
that which we have obſerved Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Putrefaction to have made
in the juice of Grapes, Urine, and
ſome other bodies. How far the like
ſucceſs may be expected in other Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,
I cannot tell; eſpecially not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by me any Notes of the events
of ſome Attempts which that Inquiry
put me upon: Onely I remember in
general, that, as ſome trials, I made
with other Seeds, and even with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatick
ones, did not afford me any
Volatile Salt; ſo the ſucceſs of other
trials made me now and then think,
that ſome ſubjects of the Vegetable
kingdom, whence we are wont to
drive over acid Spirits, but no dry
Salt, may be diſtilled with ſo luckily
regulated a heat, as to afford ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
though but little, of Volatile
Salt; and that perhaps more bodies
would be found to doe ſo, were they
not too haſtily or violently preſt by
the fire, whereby ſuch ſaline ſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſms
of the deſired parts of the
matter are (by being diſſipated or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60281:167"/>
confounded) deſtroyed or vitiated;
as in a ſlow, dextrous, or fortunate
way of management would come
forth, not in a liquid, but a ſaline
form. Of which Obſervation we
may elſewhere mention ſome Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and ſhall before the cloſe of this
paper name one, afforded us by crude
Tartar.</p>
                     <p>3. Though Silver be one of the
fixedſt bodies that we know of, yet
that 'tis not impoſſible but that, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a change of Texture, it may
ſtrangely be diſpoſed to Volatility, I
was induced to think by what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
once happened to me. A
Gentleman of my acquaintance, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
of Chymical <hi>Arcana,</hi> having
lighted on a ſtrange Menſtruum,
which he affirmed, and I had ſome
cauſe to believe, not to be corroſive,
he abſtracted it from ſeveral metalls,
(for the ſame Liquour would ſerve
again and again,) and brought me the
<hi>Remainders,</hi> with a deſire that I
would endeavour to reduce thoſe of
Lead and Silver into the priſtine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60281:167"/>
again, which he had in vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to doe: whereupon, though
I found the white Calx of Lead re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible,
yet when I came to the Calx
of Silver, I was not able to bring it
into a body; and having at length
melted ſome Lead in a gentle fire, to
try whether I could make it ſwallow
up the <hi>Calx,</hi> in order to a farther o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
I was not a little ſurprized
to find, that this mild heat made the
<hi>Calx</hi> of Silver preſently fly away and
ſublime in the form of a <hi>farina volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
which whitened the neighbouring
part of the Chimney, as well as the
upper part of the Crucible.</p>
                     <p>4. From that which Chymiſts
themſelves tell us, I think we may
draw a good Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi>
to prove, that Volatility depends
much upon the texture and other
Mechanical affections of a body. For
divers of thoſe Hermetick Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
(as they are called) that write
of the <hi>Elixir,</hi> tell us, that when their
Philoſophick Mercury or grand Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
being ſealed up together with a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60281:168"/>
third or fourth part of Gold in a glaſs-Egg,
is kept in convenient degrees of
fire, the whole matter, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Gold, will, by the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
operation of the included Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
be ſo changed, that not onely
'twill circulate up and down in the
glaſs, but, in caſe the digeſtion or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
ſhould be broken off at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
inconvenient time, the Gold
would be quite ſpoil'd, being, by the
paſt and untimely-ended operation,
made too Volatile to be reducible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into Gold: whereas, if the decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be duly continued unto the end,
not onely the Gold, but all the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical
Mercury or <hi>Menſtruum</hi> will
be turned into a Sulphur or powder of
a wonderfully fixt nature. I know,
there are ſeveral Chryſopaeans, that
ſpeak much otherwiſe of this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and tell us, that the Gold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
about it muſt be Philoſophick
Gold: But I know too, that there
are divers others (and thoſe too none
of the leaſt candid or rational) that
ſpeak of it as I have done; and That
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60281:168"/>
is ſufficient to ground an Argument
on towards all thoſe that embrace
Their doctrine. And in this caſe
'tis conſiderable, that 'tis not by any
ſuperadded additament, that the moſt
fixt body of Gold is made volatile,
but the ſame maſſy matter, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
of Gold and Philoſophick Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
is, by the change of texture
produced or occaſioned by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
degrees and operations of fire
upon it, brought to be firſt Volatile,
and then extreamly fixt. And having
ſaid this in reference to one tribe of
the Modern Spagyriſts; to another of
them, the <hi>Helmontians,</hi> I think I can
offer a good Argument <hi>ad hominem</hi>
from the Teſtimony and Experiments
of the Founder of their Sect.</p>
                     <p>5. The acute <hi>Hemont,</hi> among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prodigious powers that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
to the Alkaheſt, affirms, that,
by abſtracting it frequently enough,
it would ſo change all tangible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and conſequently ſtones and
metals, that they might be diſtilled
over into Liquours equiponderant
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60281:169"/>
to the reſpective bodies that afforded
them, and having all the Qualities
of Rain-water; which if they have, I
need not tell you that they muſt be
very Volatile. And I ſee not how
thoſe that admit the Truth of this
ſtrange Alkaheſtical operation, can
well deny, that Volatility depends
upon the Mechanical affections of
matter, ſince it appears not, that the
Alkaheſt does, at leaſt in our caſe,
work upon bodies otherwiſe than
Mechanically. And it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that the ſame material parts of
a portion of corporeal ſubſtance,
which, when they were aſſociated
and contexted (whether by an <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
ſeed, form, or what elſe you
pleaſe,) after ſuch a determinate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
conſtituted a ſolid and fixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as a Flint or a lump of Gold; by
having their Texture diſſolved; and
(perhaps after being ſubtilized) by
being freed from their former impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
or firm coheſions, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the parts of a fluid body total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Volatile.</p>

                     <p>THE fourth means of making a
body Volatile is, by aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the particles to be raiſed with
ſuch as are more Volatile than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and of a figure fit to be faſtened
to them, or are at leaſt apt, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
added to them, to make up with
them corpuſcles more diſpoſed than
they to Volatility. This being the
grand Instrument of Volatilization,
I ſhall ſpend ſomewhat the more time
about it: But I ſhall firſt here a little
explain the laſt clauſe, (that I may not
be obliged to reſume it elſewhere,) by
intimating, that 'tis not impoſſible,
that the particles of an additament,
though not more volatile than thoſe
of the body 'tis mixt with, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
though not volatile at all, will
yet conduce to volatilize the body
wherewith 'tis mingled. For the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the additament may be of
ſuch figures, and ſo aſſociated with
thoſe of the body to be elevated,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60281:170"/>
as in this to enlarge the former pores,
or produce new ones, by intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
little cavities (for they muſt not
be great ones) between the particles
of a body to be raiſed, and thoſe of
the additament. For, by theſe and
other ſuch ways of aſſociation, the
corpuſcles, reſulting from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
or coalition of two or more
of theſe differing particles, may,
without becoming too big and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy,
become more conveniently
ſhaped, or more light in proportion
to their bulk, and ſo more eaſily
buoyed up and ſuſtained in the air,
(as when the Lid of a Copper-box
being put on, makes the whole box
emerge and ſwim in water, becauſe of
the intercepted cavity, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the parts of the box would
doe ſo,) or otherwiſe more fitted for
avolation than the particles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were before their being joined
to thoſe of the additament.</p>
                     <p>By two things chiefly the corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles
of the additament may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the elevation of a body. For
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60281:170"/>
                        <hi>firſt,</hi> the parts of the former may be
much more diſpoſed for avolation
than is neceſſary to their own Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility.
As when in the making of
Sal Armoniac, the ſaline particles of
Urine and of Soot are more fugitive
than they need be to be themſelves
ſublimed, and thereby are advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to carry up with them the more
ſluggiſh corpuſcles whereof Sea-ſalt
conſiſts. And <hi>next,</hi> they may be of
figures ſo proper to faſten them well
to the body to be elevated, that the
more fugitive will not be driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
or disjoyned from the more fixt
by ſuch a degree of Heat as is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to raiſe them both together: To
which effect the congruity or figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is as well required, as the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or volatility of the particles of
the additament. And therefore ſome
of the fugitiveſt bodies that we
know, as Spirit of Wine, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> will not volatilize many
bodies which will be elevated by
far leſs fugitive additaments; becauſe
the corpuſcles of Spirit of Wine ſtick
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60281:171"/>
not to thoſe of the body they are
mingled with, but, eaſily flying up
themſelves, leave thoſe behind them,
which they did rather barely touch
than firmly adhere to: Whereas far
leſs fugacious Liquours, if they be
indowed with figures that fit them
for a competently firm coheſion with
the body they are mingled with, will
be able to volatilize it. Of which
I ſhall now give you ſome Inſtances
in bodies that are very ponderous, or
very fixt, or both.</p>
                     <p>And I ſhall begin with Colcothar,
though it being a vitriolate <hi>calx,</hi> made
by a laſting and vehement fire, 'tis
(conſequently) capable of reſiſting
ſuch a one. This being exquiſitely
ground with an equal weight of Sal
Armoniac, which is it ſelf a Salt but
moderately volatile, will be in good
part ſublimed into thoſe yellow
Flowers, which we have elſewhere
more particularly taught to prepare,
under the name of <hi>Ens primum Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi>
in which, that many vitriolate
corpuſcles of the Colcothar are really
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60281:171"/>
elevated, you may eaſily find by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a grain or two of that reddiſh
Subſtance into a ſtrong infuſion of
Galls, which will thereby immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquire an inky colour.</p>
                     <p>Steel alſo, which, to deſerve that
name, muſt have endured extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
violences of the fire, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than is needfull to obtain other
metalls from their Mother Earth;
Steel it ſelf, I ſay, being reduced to
filings, and diligently ground with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
an equal weight of Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac,
will, if degrees of fire be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
adminiſtred, (for 'tis eaſie to
err in that point,) without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
calcination or reduction to a
<hi>Crocus,</hi> ſuffer ſo much of the metall
to be carried up, as will give the Sal
Armoniac a notable colour, and an
ironiſh taſt.</p>
                     <p>And here it will be proper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
for the ſake of practical Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
that the Quantity or Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Volatile additament is to
be regarded; though not ſo much as
its Nature, yet more than it is wont
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60281:172"/>
to be: And divers bodies, that are
thought either altogether unfit for
Sublimation, or at leaſt uncapable to
have any conſiderable portion of
them elevated, may be copiouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
ſublimed, if a greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the additament, than we uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
content our ſelves with, be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
imployed. And in the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mentioned
Inſtance of Filings
of Steel, if, in ſtead of an equal
weight of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> the treble
weight be taken, and the operation
be duly managed, a far greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the metall may be raiſed, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if freſh <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ground with the <hi>Caput Mortuum.</hi>
And Sal Armoniac may perhaps be
compounded with ſuch other bodies,
heavier than it ſelf, as may qualifie it,
when it is thus clogged, to elevate
ſome congruous bodies better than
it would of it ſelf alone. And I
ſhall venture to add this farther Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement,
That if, beſides the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the additament, there be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
fitneſs of its particles to lay
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60281:172"/>
hold on thoſe of the body to be
wrought on, Mineral bodies, and
thoſe ponderous enough, may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to volatilize other heavy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
And I am apt to think, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
if not more than almoſt, all
Metalls themſelves may by copious
additaments and frequent Cohobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be brought to paſs through the
neck of the Retort in diſtillation;
and perhaps, if you melt them not
with equal parts, but with many
parts of <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and
then proceed as the hints now given
will direct you, you will not find
cauſe to deſpiſe what I have been
ſaying.</p>
                     <p>You know what endeavours have
been, and are ſtill fruitleſsly, imployed
by Chymiſts to elevate ſo fixt a body
as <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> by additaments. I
ſhall not now ſpeak much of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
in generall, deſigning chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to tell you on this occaſion, that,
whereas frequent experience ſhews,
that <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> being abſtracted
from <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> not onely the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60281:173"/>
Salt of Tartar is left at the bottom,
but a good part of the Sal Armoniac
is left behind with it; I ſuſpected the
cauſe might be, that Sal Armoniac,
by the operation of the Alkaly of
Tartar, is reduced into Sea-ſalt, and
Urinous or fuliginous Salt, as 'twas at
firſt compoſed of thoſe differing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients;
and that by this means
the volatil Salt being looſened or
disintangled from the reſt, and being
of a very fugacious Nature, flyes
eaſily away it ſelf, without ſtaying
long enough to take up any other
Salt with it. And therefore, if this
<hi>Analyſis</hi> of the Sal Armoniac could
be prevented, it ſeemed not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to me, that ſome part of the
Salt of Tartar, as well as of Colco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar
and Steel, might be carried up
by it: And accordingly having cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Ingredients to be exceedingly
well dryed, and both nimbly and
carefully mixt, and ſpeedily expoſed
to the fire, I have ſometimes had a
portion of Salt of Tartar carried up
with the Sal Armoniac: but this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60281:173"/>
ſo very rarely, that I ſuſpected
ſome peculiar fitneſs for this work
in ſome parcels of Sal Armoniac, that
are ſcarce but by the effect to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
from others. But however,
what has happened to us may argue
the Poſſibility of the thing, and may
ſerve to ſhew the volatilizing efficacy
of Sal Armoniac; which is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
that I elſewhere recommend,
and doe it now again, as one of the
uſefulleſt Productions of vulgar Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry.</p>
                     <p>And ſince I have mentioned the
Volatilization of <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
your Curioſity will make you
deſire my Opinion about the Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of it, I ſhall propoſe to you a
diſtinction, that perhaps you doe not
expect, by ſaying, that I think there
is a great deal of difference between
the making a Volatile Salt of Tartar,
and the making Salt of Tartar Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile.
For, though this ſeem to be
but a Nicety, yet really it is none;
and it is very poſſible, that a man may
from Tartar obtain a Volatile ſalt,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60281:174"/>
and yet be no wiſe able to volatilize
that Tartareous Salt, that has been
once by the incineration of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
brought to fixt Alkaly. I have
in the <hi>Sceptical Chymiſt</hi> ſummarily
delivered a way, by which both I,
and ſome Spagyriſts that learned it
of me, obtained from a mixture of
Antimony, Nitre, and crude Tartar,
a Volatil ſalt, which in probability
comes from the laſt named of thoſe
three bodies; but experience care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
made has aſſured me, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any additament, by a diſtillation
warily and very ſlowly made, (inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that I have ſpent near a week
in diſtilling one pound of matter)
very clean Tartar, or at leaſt the
Cryſtalls of Tartar, may, in conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
ſhaped Veſſels, be brought
to afford a Subſtance that in Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
will aſcend to the upper part
of the Veſſel, in the form of a Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Salt, as if it were of Urine or of
Harts-horne; of which (Tartareous)
Salt, I keep ſome by me: But this
operation requires not onely a dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60281:174"/>
but a patient diſtiller.</p>
                     <p>But now as to the making a fixt
Alkaly of Tartar become Volatil, I
take it to be another, and have found
it to be a far more difficult, work; the
common Proceſſes of performing it
being wont to promiſe much more
than they can make good; which I
may juſtly ſay of ſome other, that
private men have vaunted for great
<hi>Arcana,</hi> but upon triall have ſatisfied
me ſo little, that I have divers times
offered pretenders to make Salt of
Tartar Volatil, that without at all
inquiring into their Proceſſes, I would
lay good wagers, that they could not
doe what they pretended; not onely
as divers Philoſophical Spagyriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
without any viſible additament,
but by any additament whatever;
provided I were allowed to bring the
Salt of Tartar my ſelf, and to examine
the Succeſs, not by what may appear
in the Alembic and Receiver, but
by the weight of what would remain
in the bottom. For I have convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ſome of the more Ingenuous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60281:175"/>
that the Salt that ſublimed was
not indeed the Alkaly of Tartar, but
ſomewhat that was by the operation
produced, or rather extricated out
of the additaments. But yet I would
not be thought to affirm, that 'tis not
poſſible to elevate the fixt Salt of
Tartar. For ſometimes I have been
able to doe it, even at the firſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation,
by an artificial additament
perhaps more fixt than it ſelf; but,
though the operation was very grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to me, as it ſhewed the Poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the thing, yet the paucity of
the Salt ſublimed and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
kept me from much valuing
it upon any other account. And there
are other wayes, whereby Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
has aſſured me, that Salt of
Tartar may be raiſed. And if one
of them were not ſo uncertain, that
I can never promiſe before hand that
it will at all ſucceed, and the other
ſo laborious, difficult and coſtly, that
few would attempt or be able to
practice it, I ſhould think them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
valuable things; ſince by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60281:175"/>
way moſt part of the Salt of
Tartar was quickly brought over in
the form of a Liquor, whoſe pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
ſmell was ſcarce tolerable; and
by the latter way ſome Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
of my own, being put into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort,
and urged but with ſuch a fire
as could be given in a portable Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnace,
there remained not at the
bottom near one half of the firſt
weight, the additament having car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
up the reſt, partly in the form of
a Liquor, but chiefly in that of a
white Sublimate, which was neither
ill-ſented, nor in taſt corroſive, or
alcalizat, but very mild, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſweetiſh. And I doe not much
doubt, but that by other wayes the
fixt Alkaly of Tartar may be eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
eſpecially if, before it be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the laſt operation of the fire,
it be dextrouſly freed from the moſt
of thoſe Earthy and Viſcous parts,
that I think may be juſtly ſuſpected
to clog and bind the truly ſaline ones.</p>
                     <p>But I have too long digreſt, and
therefore ſhall intimate onely upon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60281:176"/>
the by, that even the ſpurious <hi>Sal
Tartari</hi> volatilized that is made with
Spirit of Vinegar, may, if it be well
prepared, make amends for its Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reumatical
ſmell and taſt, and may,
notwithſtanding them, in divers ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
be of no deſpicable uſe, both as a
Medicine, and a Menſtruum.</p>

                     <p>BEfore I draw towards a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of theſe Notes about Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latility,
perhaps it will not be amiſs,
to take notice of a Phaenomenon,
which may much ſurpriſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
diſappoint thoſe that deal in
Sublimations, unleſs they be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
of it. For though it be taken
for granted, and for the moſt part
may juſtly be ſo, that by carefully
mingling what is ſublimed with what
remains, and re-ſubliming the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a greater quantity of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be ſublimed may be elevated
the ſecond time than was the firſt,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60281:176"/>
and the third time than the ſecond,
and ſo onwards; yet I have not found
this Rule alwayes to hold, but in
ſome Bodies, as particularly in ſome
kinds of dulcified Colcothar, the Sal
Armoniac, would at the firſt Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
carry up more of the fixed pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
than at the ſecond or third. So
that I was by ſeveral Tryalls per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
when I found a very well
and highly coloured powder eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to lay it by for uſe, and thereby
ſave my ſelf the labour of a proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
that would not onely have
proved uſeleſs, but prejudicial. And
if I miſremember not, by often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Cohobations, (if I may ſo call
them) of Sal Armoniac upon crude
or Mineral Antimony, though the
Sublimate that was obtained by the
firſt Operation, was much of it vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
and in ſome places richly, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured;
yet afterwards, the Salt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from time to time paler and
paler, leaving the Antimony behind
it. Which way of making ſome
Minerals more fixt and fuſible I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60281:177"/>
may be of great uſe in ſome
Medicinal Preparations, though I
think it not fit to particularize them
in this place: Where my chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was, to mention the Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
it ſelf, and invite you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
whether it may be aſcribed to
this, that by the reiterated action of
the fire, and grinding together of the
body to be raiſed, either the corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles
of the Sal Armoniac, or thoſe
of the other body, may have thoſe
little hooked or equivalent particles,
whereby they take hold of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
broken or worn off; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the indiſpoſedneſs of the Colco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine
or Antimonial parts to aſcend,
may not in ſome caſes be promoted
by their having, by frequent attriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſo ſmoothed their Surfaces that
divers of them may cloſely adhere,
like pieces of poliſhed Glaſs, and ſo
make up Cluſters too unweildy to
be ſo raiſed, as the ſingle corpuſcles
they conſiſt of, were. Which change
may diſpoſe them to be at once leſs
Volatil and more Fuſible. Which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60281:177"/>
Conjectures I mention to excite you
to frame better, or at leaſt to make
amends for my omiſſion of examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe, by trying whether the Sal
Armoniac grown white again will be
as fit as it was at firſt to carry up
freſh bodies; and alſo by obſerving
the weight of the unelevated part,
and employing thoſe other wayes
of <hi>examen,</hi> which I ſhould have
done, if I had not then made Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
for another end, than to
clear up the Doctrine of Volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>And here it may be profitable to
ſome Chymiſts, though not neceſſary
to my Subject, to intimate, that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limations
may be uſeful to make very
fine Comminutions of divers bodies.
That thoſe that are elevated are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to a great fineneſs of parts, is
obvious to be obſerved in many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
whence it has been ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not abſurdly, ſaid, that Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are the Chymiſts Peſtles, ſince
(as in Flowers of Sulphur and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony)
they do really reſolve the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60281:178"/>
elevated bodies into exceeding fine
Flower, and much finer than Peſtles
and Mortars are wont to bring them
to. But that which I intend in this
Paragraph is not a thing ſo obvious,
ſince 'tis to obſerve, that ſometimes
even bodies ſo fixt as not at all to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
in Sublimation, may yet be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by that operation into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
extreamly fine. For exemplify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which, I ſhall put you in mind,
that though Spagyriſts complain much
of the Difficulty of making a good
Calx of Gold, and of the Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the few ordinary proceſſes
preſcribed to make it, (which would
be more complained of, but that
Chymical Phyſicians ſeldom attempt
to prepare it,) yet we are informed by
triall, that by exactly grinding a thick
amalgam of Gold and Mercury with a
competent weight, (at leaſt equal to
its own) of finely powdered Sulphur,
we may, by putting the mixture to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime
in a conveniently ſhaped Glaſs,
by degrees of fire obtain a Cinaber
that will leave behind it a finer Calx
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60281:178"/>
of Gold than will be had by ſome far
more difficult proceſſes.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis now time to draw towards
a Concluſion of our Notes about Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latility;
which Quality depends ſo
much upon the contexture of the
corpuſcles that are to be raiſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that even very ponderous
bodies may ſerve for volatilizing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaments,
if they be diſpoſed to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
themſelves ſufficiently to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
they are to carry up along with
them. For, though <hi>Lead</hi> be, ſave
one, the heavieſt ſolid we know
of, and though Quick-ſilver be the
heavieſt body in the world, except
Gold; yet trialls have aſſured us,
that <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> it ſelf being united
by Amalgamation with a ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of Lead, will by a fire that
is none of the violenteſt, and in cloſe
Veſſels, be made to carry over with it
ſome of the Lead. As we clearly found
by the increaſed weight of the Quick-ſilver
that paſſed into the Receiver;
which, by the way, may make us
cautious how we conclude Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60281:179"/>
to be pure, meerly from its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been diſtilled over.</p>
                     <p>There remains but one body
more heavy than thoſe I come from
naming, and that is <hi>Gold;</hi> which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo of a fixity ſo great that 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
admirable, I doe not wonder
that not onely the more wary Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts,
but the more ſevere among
the Chymiſts themſelves ſhould think
it incapable of being volatilized.
But yet, if we conſider, how very
minute parts Gold may be rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuppoſed to conſiſt of, and to be
diviſible into, me thinks it ſhould not
ſeem impoſſible, that, if men could
light on Volatil Salts endowed with
figures fit to ſtick faſt to the corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles
of the Gold, they would carry
up with them bodies, whoſe ſolidity
can ſcarce be more extraordinary
than their minuteneſs is: And in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
we have made more than one
<hi>Menſtruum,</hi> with which ſome particles
of Gold may be carried up. But
when I employed that which I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to you formerly under the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60281:179"/>
name of <hi>Menſtruum peracutum</hi> (which
conſiſts mainly, and ſometimes onely,
of Spirit of Nitre, ſeveral times drawn
from Butter of Antimony,) I was
able, without a very violent fire, in
a few hours to elevate ſo much crude
Gold, as, in the neck of the Retort,
afforded me a conſiderable Quantity
of Sublimate, which I have had red
as blood, and whoſe conſiſting partly
of Gold manifeſtly appeared by this,
that I was able with eaſe to reduce
that metall out of it.</p>
                     <p>In reckoning up the Inſtruments of
Volatilization, we muſt not quite
leave out the mention of the <hi>Air,</hi>
which I have often obſerved to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate
the elevation of ſome bodies
even in cloſe Veſſels; wherein, though
to fill them too full be judged by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a Compendious practiſe, becauſe
the ſtreams have a leſs way to aſcend,
yet Experience has ſeveral times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
me, that, at leaſt in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
they take wrong meaſures, and
that (to paſs by another Cauſe of
their diſappointment) a large propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60281:180"/>
of Air, purpoſely left in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
may more than compenſate the
greater ſpace that is to be aſcended
by the vapours or exhalations of the
matter that is to be diſtilled or ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
And if, in cloſe Veſſels, the
preſence of the Air may promote the
aſcenſion of bodies, it may well be
expected, that the elevation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of them may be furthered by
being attempted in open Veſſels, to
which the Air has free acceſs. And
if we may give any credit to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Relations of ſome Chymiſts,
the Air does much contribute to the
volatilization of ſome bodies that are
barely, though indeed for no ſhort
time, expoſed to it. But the account
on which the Air by its bare preſence
or peculiar operations conduces to
the Volatilization of ſome bodies, is
a thing very difficult to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
without having recourſe to ſome
Notions about Gravity and Levity,
and of the Conſtitution of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
that compoſe the Air; which
I take to be both very numerous and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60281:180"/>
no leſs various. And therefore I
muſt not in theſe occaſional Notes
lanch out into ſuch a Subject, though,
for fear I ſhould be blamed for too
much ſlighting my old acquaintance
the <hi>Air,</hi> I durſt not quite omit the
power it has to diſpoſe ſome bodies to
Volatility.</p>
                     <p>A moderate attention may ſuffice
to make it be diſcerned, that in what
hath been hitherto delivered, I have
for the moſt part conſidered the ſmall
portions of matter, to be elevated
in Volatilization, as intire Corpuſcles:
And therefore it may be now perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
to intimate in a Line or two,
that there may be alſo Caſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a kind of Volatilization, improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo called, may be effected, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
uſe of ſuch additaments as break
off or otherwiſe divide the particles
of the corpuſcles to be elevated, and
by adhering to, and ſo clogging, one
of the particles to which it proves
more congruous, inable the other,
which is now brought to be more
light or diſingaged, to aſcend. This
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60281:181"/>
may be illuſtrated by what happens,
when Sal Armoniac is well ground
with <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> or with ſome
fix'd Alkali, and then committed to
diſtillation: For the Sea-ſalt, that
enters the Compoſition of the Sal
Armoniac, being detained by the
ſtone or the Alkali, there is a divorce
made between the common Salt and
the urinous and fuliginous Salts, that
were incorporated with it, and being
now diſingaged from it, are eaſily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated.
I elſewhere mention, that
I have obſerved in Man's Urine a
kind of native Sal Armoniac, much
leſs Volatile than the fugitive that is
ſublim'd from Man's Blood, Hartſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore ſuppoſing,
that a ſeparation of parts may be
made by an Alkali, as well in this Salt
as in the common factitious Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac,
I put to freſh Urine a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
proportion (which was a
plentifull one) of Salt of Pot-aſhes
(that being then at hand) and diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Liquor, it yielded, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to expectation, a Spirit more Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60281:181"/>
than the Phlegm, and of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
piercing taſt; which way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a Spirit without any violence
of fire, and without either previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
abſtracting the Phlegm, (as we
are fain to do in freſh Urine) or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly
waiting for the fermentation
of ſtale Urine, I taught ſome Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
becauſe of the uſefulneſs of
Spirit of Urine; which being obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this innocent way, would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be employed with much leſs ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion
of corroſiveneſs, than if in
the operation I had made uſe of
Quick-lime. Another Illuſtration of
what I was not long ſince ſaying, may
be fetch'd from the Experiment of
making Spirit of Nitre by mixing
Salt-peter with Oil of Vitriol, and
diſtilling them together: For the
Oil does ſo divide or break the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
of the Nitre, that the now-diſpoſed
particles of that Salt, which
amount to a great portion of the
whole, will be made eaſily enough
to aſcend even with a moderate fire
of Sand, and ſometimes without any
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60281:182"/>
fire at all, in the form of Spirits, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
unquiet, ſubtle, and apt to
moak a way.</p>
                     <p>To which Inſtances of this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
kind of Volatilization more
might be added, but that you may
well think, I have detain'd you but
too long already with indigeſted
Notes about <hi>one</hi> Quality.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="7" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
                     <p>THe laſt means of Volatilizing
bodies is, the operation of the
Fire or ſome other actual Heat: But
of this, which is obvious, it would
be ſuperfluous to diſcourſe. Onely
this I ſhall intimate, that there may
be bodies, which, in ſuch degrees of
fire as are wont to be given in the
vulgar operations of Chymiſts, will
not be elevated, which yet may be
forced up by ſuch violent and laſting
fires, as are employed by the Melters
of Ores, and Founders of Guns, and
ſometimes by Glaſs-makers. And on
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60281:182"/>
this Conſideration I ſhall here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to you, ſince I did not doe it at
my entrance on theſe Notes, that
Chymiſts are wont to ſpeak, and I
have accordingly been led to treat,
of Volatility and Fixity in a popular
ſenſe of thoſe Terms. For if we
would conſider the matter more
ſtrictly, I preſume we ſhould find
that Volatility and Fixity are but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Qualities, which are to be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
eſpecially the former of them,
by the degree of fire to which the
body, whereto we aſcribe one or
other of thoſe Qualities, is expoſed;
and therefore it is much more difficult
than men are aware of, to determine
accurately, when a body ought to
be accounted Volatile and when not;
ſince there is no determinate degree
of Heat agreed on, nor indeed eaſie
to be deviſed, that may be as a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,
whereby to meaſure Volatility
and Fixtneſs: And 'tis obvious, that
a body, that remains fixt in one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of fire, may be forced up by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
To which may be added,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60281:183"/>
agreeably to what I lately began to
obſerve, that a body may paſs for
abſolutely fixt among the generality
of Chymiſts, and yet be unable to
perſevere in the fires of Founders and
Glaſs-makers: Which brings into my
mind, that not having obſerved, that
Chymiſts have examined the Fixity
of other bodies than metalline ones
by the Cupel, I had the Curioſity to
put dry Salt of Tartar upon it, and
found, as I expected, that in no long
time it manifeſtly waſted in ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a heat, wherein alſo the Air
came freely at it, (though Quick-lime,
handled after the ſame way, loſt not
of its weight,) and having well mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one ounce of good Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
with treble its weight of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co-pipe
Clay, we kept them but for
two, or at moſt three hours, in a
ſtrong fire; yet the Crucible being
purpoſely left uncovered, we found
the Salt of Tartar ſo waſted, that the
remaining mixture (which was not
flux'd) afforded us not near a quarter
of an ounce of Salt. And indeed I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60281:183"/>
ſcarce doubt, but that in ſtrictneſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of thoſe bodies that paſs for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
fixt, are but ſemi-fixt, or at
leaſt but comparatively and relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fix'd, that is, in reference to ſuch
degrees of fire, as they are wont to
be expoſed to in the Diſtillations,
Sublimations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Chymiſts; not
ſuch as are given in the raging fires of
Founders, and Glaſs-makers. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
even the fires of Glaſs-makers
and Say-maſters themſelves are not
the moſt intenſe that may poſſibly
be made in a ſhort time, provided
there be but ſmall portions of matter
to be wrought on by them. And in
effect, I know very few bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Gold, that will perſerve totally
fixt in the vehementeſt degrees of fire
that Trials have made me acquainted
with. And I elſewhere tell you, that,
though Tin, in our Chymical Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratories
themſelves, is wont to be
reduced but into a <hi>Calx</hi> that is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
very fixt; yet in thoſe intenſe
fires, that a <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
uſes in his Tin-Mines, there is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60281:184"/>
not ſeldom found quantities of Tin
carried up to a notable height in the
form of a whitiſh powder, which,
being in good maſſes forced off from
the places to which it had faſtened it
ſelf, does by a skillful reduction yield
many a pound weight of good mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable
metal, which ſeemed to me to
be rather more, than leſs, fine than
ordinary Tin.</p>

                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60281:186"/>
The Qualifications that conduce
moſt to the <hi>Fixity</hi> of a portion of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſeem to be theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> the <hi>groſsneſs</hi> or the bulk of
the corpuſcles it conſiſts of. For if
theſe be too big, they will be too
unwieldly and unapt to be carried up
into the Air by the action of ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
particles as thoſe of the Fire,
and will alſo be unfit to be buoyed
up by the weight of the Air; as we
ſee, that Vapours, whilſt they are ſuch,
are ſmall enough to ſwim in the Air,
but can no longer be ſuſtained by it,
when they convene into drops of rain
or flakes of ſnow. But here it is to
be obſerved, that when I ſpeak of the
corpuſcles that a fixt body conſiſts of,
I mean not either its Elementary or
its Hypoſtatical Principles, as ſuch,
but onely thoſe very little maſſes or
cluſters of particles, of what kind ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they be, that ſtick ſo firmly to
one another, as not to be diviſible
and diſſipable by that degree of fire
in which the body is ſaid to be fixt;
ſo that each of thoſe little Concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60281:186"/>
though it may it ſelf be made up
of two, three, or more particles of a
ſimpler nature, is conſidered here <hi>per
modum <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nius,</hi> or as one intire cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcle.
And this is one Qualification
conducive to the Fixtneſs of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>next</hi> is the <hi>ponderouſneſs</hi> or
ſolidity of the corpuſcles it is made up
of. For if theſe be very ſolid, and
(which ſolid and compact bodies
uſually are) of a conſiderable <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick</hi>
gravity, they will be too heavy
to be carried up by the <hi>effluvia</hi> or
the action of the fire, and their pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouſneſs
will make them as unwiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and indiſpoſed to be elevated by
ſuch Agents, as the groſſneſs of their
bulk would make bigger corpuſcles,
but of a proportionably inferiour
ſpecifick weight. On which account
the <hi>calces</hi> of ſome metals and mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
as Gold, Silver, &amp;c. though, by
the operation of Solvents, or of the
fire, or of both, reduced to powders
exceedingly ſubtile, will reſiſt ſuch
vehement fires, as will eaſily drive
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60281:187"/>
up bigger, but leſs heavy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
corpuſcles, than thoſe <hi>calces</hi>
conſiſt of.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> Qualification that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
to the Fixity of a body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to its <hi>Integral parts,</hi> not barely
as they are ſeveral parts of it, but as
they are aggregated or contexed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one body. For, the Qualification,
I mean, is the ineptitude of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
corpuſcles for avolation, by
reaſon of their branchedneſs, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
figures, crookedneſs, or other
inconvenient ſhape, which intangles
the particles among one another, and
makes them difficult to be extricated;
by which means, if one of them do
aſcend, others, wherewith 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated,
muſt aſcend with it; and,
whatever be the account on which
divers particles ſtick firmly together,
the aggregate will be too heavy or
unwieldy to be raiſed. Which I
therefore take notice of, becauſe
that, though uſually 'tis on the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and irregularity of corpuſcles,
that their coheſion depends; yet it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60281:187"/>
ſometimes happens, that the ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and flatneſs of their ſurfaces
makes them ſo ſtick together, as to
reſiſt a total divulſion; as may be
illuſtrated by what I have ſaid of the
coheſion of poliſhed marbles and the
plates of glaſs, and by the fixity of
glaſs it ſelf in the fire.</p>
                  <p>From this account of the Cauſes or
Requiſites of Fixity, may be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the following means of giving or
adding Fixation to a body, that was
before either Volatile, or leſs fixt.
Theſe means may be reduced to two
general Heads; <hi>Firſt,</hi> the action of
the Fire, as the parts of the body,
expoſed to it, are thereby made to
operate variouſly on one another.
And <hi>next,</hi> the aſſociation of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of a volatile body with thoſe
of ſome proper additament: Which
term, <hi>[of proper]</hi> I rather imploy than
that, one would expect, <hi>[of fixt;]</hi>
becauſe 'twill ere long appear, that,
in certain caſes, ſome volatile bodies
may more conduce to the fixation of
other volatile bodies, than ſome fixt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60281:188"/>
Ones doe. But theſe two Inſtruments
of Fixation being but general, I ſhall
propoſe four or five more particular
ones.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                  <p>AND <hi>firſt,</hi> in ſome caſes it may
conduce to Fixation, that, either
by an additament, or by the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the fire, the parts of a body be
brought to touch each other in large
portions of their ſurfaces. For, that
from ſuch a contact there will follow
ſuch a mutual coheſion, as will at
leaſt indiſpoſe the touching corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles
to ſuffer a total divulſion, may
appear probable from what we late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
noted of the coheſion of pieces of
marble and glaſs, and from ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> belonging to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of <hi>Firmneſs,</hi> from which we
may properly enough borrow ſome
inſtances, as leaſt for illuſtration, in
the Doctrine of <hi>Fixtneſs,</hi> in regard
that uſually, though not always,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60281:188"/>
the ſame things that make a body
<hi>Firm,</hi> give it ſome degree of <hi>Fixity,</hi>
by keeping it from being diſſipated
by the wonted degrees of Heat, and
Agitation it meets with in the Air.
But to return to the contact we were
ſpeaking of, I think it not impoſſible,
(though you may perhaps think it
ſtrange,) that the bare operation of
the Fire may, in ſome caſes, procure
a <hi>Coheſion</hi> among the particles, (and
conſequently make them more Fixt,)
as well as in others disjoyn them, and
thereby make them more <hi>Volatile.</hi>
For, as in ſome bodies, the figures and
ſizes of the corpuſcles may be ſuch,
that the action of the fire may rub
or tear off the little beards or hooks,
or other particles that intangle them,
and by that means make it more eaſie
for the corpuſcles to be disingaged
and fly upwards; ſo in other bodies,
the ſize and ſhape of the corpuſcles
may be ſuch, that the agitation, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the fire, may rub them one
againſt the other, ſo as by mutual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
to grind, as 'twere, their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60281:189"/>
ſurfaces, and make them ſo broad
and ſmooth, if not alſo ſo flat, as that
the contact of the corpuſcles ſhall
come to be made according to a large
portion of their ſuperficies, from
whence will naturally follow a firm
Coheſion. Which I ſhall illuſtrate
by what we may obſerve among thoſe
that grind glaſſes for Teleſcopes and
Microſcopes. For, theſe Artificers,
by long rubbing a piece of glaſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a metalline Diſh or concave
Veſſel, do by this attrition at length
bring the two bodies to touch one
another in ſo many parts of their
congruous ſurfaces, that they will
ſtick firmly to one another, ſo as
ſometimes to oblige the Work-man
to uſe violence to disjoyn them.
And this inſtance (which is not the
ſole I could alleage) may ſuffice to
ſhew, how a Coheſion of corpuſcles
may be produced by the mutual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptation
of their congruous ſurfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And if two groſſer corpuſcles, or
a greater number of ſmaller, be thus
brought to ſtick together, you will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60281:189"/>
eaſily believe, their Aggregate will
prove too heavy or unwieldy for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volation.
And to ſhew, that the fire
may effect a laevigation in the ſurfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſome corpuſcles, I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
cauſed <hi>Minium,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>calces,</hi> that I judged convenient,
to be melted for a competent time,
in a vehement fire conveniently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred;
whereby, according to
expectation, that which was before
a dull and incoherent powder, was
reduced into much groſſer corpuſcles,
multitudes of whoſe grains appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſmooth, glittering, and almoſt
ſpecular, like thoſe of fine litharge
of gold; and the maſſes that theſe
grains compoſed, were uſually ſolid
enough and of difficult fuſion. And
when we make glaſs of Lead <hi>per ſe,</hi>
(which I elſewhere teach you how
to doe,) 'tis plain, that the particles
of the Lead are reduced to a great
ſmoothneſs; ſince, whereſoever you
break the glaſs, the ſurfaces, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at the crack, will not be jagged,
but ſmooth, and conſiderably ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60281:190"/>
Nor do I think it impoſſible,
that, even when the fire does not
make any great attrition of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
of the body to be fixt, it may
yet occaſion their ſticking together,
becauſe by long tumbling them up
and down in various manners, it may
at length, after multitudes of revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
and differing occurſions, bring
thoſe of their ſurfaces together,
which, by reaſon of their breadth,
ſmoothneſs, or congruity of figure,
are fit for mutual coheſion; and
when once they come to ſtick, there
is no neceſſity, that the ſame cauſes,
that were able to make them paſs by
one another, when their contact was
but according to an inconſiderable
part of their ſurfaces, ſhould have
the ſame effect now, when their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact
is full; though perhaps, if the
degree of fire were much increaſed,
a more vehement agitation would
ſurmount this coheſion, and diſſipate
again theſe cluſters of coaleſcent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles.</p>
                  <p>Theſe conjectures will perhaps ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60281:190"/>
leſs extravagant, if you conſider
what happens in the preparation of
Quick-ſilver praecipitated <hi>per ſe.</hi> For
there, running Mercury, being put
into a conveniently ſhaped Glaſs, is
expoſed to a moderate fire for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
time: (For I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
found ſix or ſeven weeks to be
too ſhort a one.) In this degree of
fire the parts are variouſly tumbled,
and made many of them to aſcend,
till convening into drops on the ſides
of the glaſs, their weight carries them
down again; but at length, after
many mutual occurſions, if not alſo
attritions, ſome of the parts begin to
ſtick together in the form of a red
powder, and then more and more
Mercurial particles are faſtened to it,
till at length all, or by much the
greater part of the Mercury, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into the like <hi>Praecipitate,</hi> which,
by this coheſion of the parts, being
grown more fixt, will not with the
ſame degree of Heat be made to riſe
and circulate, as the Mercury would
before; and yet, as I elſewhere note,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60281:191"/>
I have found by trial, that, with a
greater and competent degree of
heat, this <hi>Praecipitate per ſe,</hi> would,
without the help of any volatilizing
additament, be eaſily reduced into
running Mercury again. Chymiſts
and Phyſicians, who agree in ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
this <hi>Praecipitate</hi> to be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any additament, will perchance
ſcarce be able to give a more likely
account of the conſiſtency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Fixity that is obtained in
the Mercury; in which, ſince no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is added to it, there appears not
to be wrought any but a <hi>Mechanical</hi>
change. And though, I confeſs, I
have not been without ſuſpicions,
that in Philoſophical ſtrictneſs this
<hi>Praecipitate</hi> may not be made <hi>per ſe,</hi>
but that ſome penetrating igneous
particles, eſpecially ſaline, may have
aſſociated themſelves with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial
Corpuſcles; yet even upon
this ſuppoſition it may be ſaid, that
theſe particles contribute to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that is produced, but by facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or procuring, by their oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60281:191"/>
Interpoſition, the mutual Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Corpuſcles that would not
otherwiſe ſtick to one another.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will not be altogether
impertinent to add, on this occaſion,
that, as for the generality of Chymiſts,
as well others as <hi>Helmontians,</hi> that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
the Tranſmutation of all metalls
into Gold by the Philoſopher's Stone,
me thinks, they may grant it to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that a new and fit Contexture
of the parts of a volatile body may,
eſpecially by procuring a full contact
among them, very much contribute
to make it highly fixt. For, to omit
what is related by leſs credible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,
'tis averred, upon his own
trial, by <hi>Helmont,</hi> who pretended not
to the Elixir, that a grain of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that was given him, tranſmuted
a pound (if I miſ-remember not) of
running Mercury; where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the Elixir to the Mercury
was ſo inconſiderable, that it cannot
reaſonably be ſuppoſed, that every
Corpuſcle of the Quick-ſilver, that
before was volatile, was made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60281:192"/>
fixt meerly by its Coalition
with a particle of the powder, ſince,
to make one grain ſuffice for this
Coalition, the parts it muſt be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into muſt be ſcarce conceivably
minute, and therefore each ſingle
part not likely to be fixt it ſelf, or at
leaſt more likely to be carried up by
the vehemently agitated Mercury,
than to reſtrain that from avolation;
whereas, if we ſuppoſe the Elixir to
have made ſuch a commotion among
the corpuſcles of the Mercury, as
(having made them perhaps ſomewhat
change their figure, and expelled ſome
inconvenient particles,) to bring them
to ſtick to one another, according to
very great portions of their ſurfaces,
and intangle one another, it will not
be diſagreeable to the Mechanical
Doctrine of Fixity, that the Mercury
ſhould, endure the fire as well as
Gold, on the ſcore of its new Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which, ſuppoſing the ſtory
true, appears to have been introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
by the new colour, ſpecifick
gravity, Indiſſolubleneſs in Aqua
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60281:192"/>
fortis, and other Qualities wherein
Gold differs from Mercury, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Malleableneſs, which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our Notes about that Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
uſually requires that the parts,
from whoſe union it reſults, be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hooked, branched, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
adapted and fitted to make them
take faſt hold of one another, or
ſtick cloſe to one another. And ſince,
in the whole maſs of the factitious
Gold, all ſave one grain muſt be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
the ſame body, which, before
the projection was made, was Quick-ſilver,
we may ſee how great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of volatile matter may, by
an inconſiderable quantity of fixing
additament, acquire ſuch a new Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of its parts, as to become
moſt fixt. And however, this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
will agree much better with
the Mechanical Doctrine about Fixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than with that vulgar Opinion
of the Chymiſts, (wherewith 'twill
not at all comply,) That if, in a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the volatile part do much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the fixt, it will carry up that,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60281:193"/>
or at leaſt a good portion thereof,
with it; and on the contrary. But
though this Rule holds in many caſes,
where there is no peculiar indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the effect that is aimed at; yet
if the Mechanical affections of the
bodies be ill ſuited to ſuch a purpoſe,
our Philoſophical Experiment mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
proves, that the Rule will not
hold, ſince ſo great a multitude of
grains of Mercury, in ſtead of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up with them one grain of the
Elixir, are detained by it in the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
fire. And thus much for the firſt
way of fixing Volatile Bodies.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>ſecond</hi> way of producing
<hi>Fixity,</hi> is by expelling, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
or otherwiſe diſabling thoſe
volatile Corpuſcles that are too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed
to be fixt themſelves, or are
fitted to carry up with them ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
as would not, without their
help, aſcend. That the Expulſion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60281:193"/>
of ſuch parts is a proper means to
make the aggregate of thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
more fixt, I preſume you will
not put me ſolicitouſly to prove;
and we have a manifeſt inſtance of it
in <hi>Soot,</hi> where, though many active
parts were by the violence of the
fire and current of the air carried up
together by the more volatile parts;
yet, when Soot is well diſtilled in a
Retort, a competent time being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for the extricating and avolation
of the other parts, there will at the
bottom remain a ſubſtance that will
not now fly away, as it formerly did.
And here let me obſerve, that the
receſſe of the fugitive corpuſcles may
contribute to the fixation of a body,
not barely becauſe the remaining
matter is freed from ſo many unfixt,
if not alſo volatilizing, parts; but, as
it may often happen, that upon their
receſſe the pores or intervals, they
left behind them, are filled up with
more ſolid or heavy matter, and the
body becomes, as more homogeneous,
ſo more cloſe and compact. And
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60281:194"/>
whereas I intimated, that, beſides
the expulſion of unfit corpuſcles,
they may be otherwiſe diſabled from
hindering the fixation of the maſſe
they belong to, I did it, becauſe it
ſeems very poſſible, that in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
they may, by the action of the
fire, be ſo broken, as with their frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to fill up the pores or intervals
of the body they appertained to; or
may make ſuch coalitions with the
particles of a convenient additament,
as to be no impediment to the Fixity of
the whole maſſe, though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in it. Which poſſibly you will
think may well happen, when you
ſhall have peruſed the Inſtances an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next
to the <hi>fourth</hi> way of fixing bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> means of fixing, or
leſſening the Volatility of, bodies,
is by preſerving that reſt among the
parts, whoſe contrary is neceſſary to
their Volatilization. And this may
be done by preventing or checking
that Heat, or other motion, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Agents ſtrive to introduce
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60281:194"/>
into the parts of the propoſed body.
But this means tending rather to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the actual avolation of a portion
of matter, or, at moſt, procure a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
abatement of its volatility,
than to give it a ſtable fixity, I ſhall
not any longer inſiſt on it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> way of producing
Fixity in a body, is by putting to it
ſuch an appropriated Additament,
whether <hi>fixt</hi> or <hi>volatile,</hi> that the
Corpuſcles of the body may be put
among themſelves, or with thoſe of
the additament, into a complicated
ſtate, or intangled contexture. This
being the uſual and principal way of
producing Fixity, we ſhall dwell
ſomewhat the longer upon it, and
give Inſtances of ſeveral degrees of
Fixation. For, though they do not
produce that quality in the ſtricteſt
acceptation of the word, <hi>Fixity;</hi>
yet 'tis uſefull in our preſent inquiry,
to take notice, by what means that
volatility comes to be <hi>gradually</hi> aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
ſince that may facilitate our
underſtanding, how the Volatility
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60281:195"/>
of a body comes to be <hi>totally</hi> aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and conſequently the body to
be fixt.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
                  <p>AND <hi>firſt</hi> we find, that a fixt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditament,
if its parts be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
ſhaped, may eaſily give a
degree of fixity to a very volatile
body. Thus <hi>Spirit of Nitre,</hi> that will
of it ſelf eaſily enough fly away in
the Air, having its ſaline particles aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated
with thoſe of <hi>fixt Nitre,</hi> or
<hi>ſalt</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> will with the Alkaly
compoſe a ſalt of a Nitrous nature,
which will endure to be melted in a
Crucible without being deprived
even of its Spirits. And I have found,
that the ſpirits of Nitre, that abound
in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> being concoagulated
with the Silver they corrode, though
one would not expect that ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Corpuſcles ſhould ſtick faſt to ſo
compact and ſolid a body as Silver;
yet Cryſtalls, produced by their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60281:195"/>
Coalition, being put into a Retort,
may be kept a pretty while in fuſion,
before the metal will let go the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
ſpirits. When we poured <hi>Oil</hi>
of Vitriol upon the <hi>Calx</hi> of Vitriol,
though many Phlegmatick and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sulphureous particles were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
away by the excited Heat; yet
the ſaline parts, that combined with
the fixt ones of the Colcothar, ſtuck
faſt enough to them, not to be eaſily
driven away. And if <hi>Oil of Vitriol</hi>
be in a due proportion dropt upon
<hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> there reſults a <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
vitriolatum,</hi> wherein the acid
and alkalizate parts cohere ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that 'tis not an ordinary degree
of fire will be able to disjoyn them.
Inſomuch that divers Chymiſts have
(though very erroniouſly) thought
this compounded Salt to be indeſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctible.
But a leſs heavy liquour than
the ponderous Oil of Vitriol may by
an Alkaly be more ſtrongly detained
than that Oil it ſelf; experience ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
aſſured me, that <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi>
being dropt to ſatiety upon a <hi>fixt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60281:196"/>
Alkaly,</hi> (I uſed either that of Nitre
or of Tartar,) there would be made
ſo ſtrict an union, that, having, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
additaments, diſtilled the reſulting
ſalt with a ſtrong and laſting fire, it
appeared not at all conſiderably to be
wrought upon, and was not ſo much
as melted.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis not the bare Mixture or
Commiſtion of Volatile particles
with Fixt ones, (yea though the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
be predominant in quantity,)
that will ſuffice to elevate the latter.
For, unleſſe the figures of the latter
be congruous and fitted to faſten to
the other, the volatile parts will fly
away in the Heat, and leave the reſt
as fixt as before: as when ſand or
aſhes are wetted or drenched with
water, they quickly part with that
water, without parting with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of their Fixity. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, it is not always neceſſary,
that the body, which is fitted to
deſtroy, or much abate, the volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of another ſubſtance, ſhould be
it ſelf fixt. For, if there be a skilful
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60281:196"/>
or lucky coaptation of the figures of
the particles of both the bodies,
theſe particles may take ſuch hold of
one another, as to compoſe corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles,
that will neither by reaſon of
their ſtrict union be divided by Heat;
nor by reaſon of their reſulting groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
be elevated even by a ſtrong
fire, or at leaſt by ſuch a degree of
Heat as would have ſufficed to raiſe
more indiſpoſed bodies than either of
the ſeparate Ingredients of the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
This obſervation, if duly made
out, does ſo much favour our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
about the <hi>Mechanical</hi> Origine
of Fixation, and may be of ſuch uſe,
not onely to <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> in ſome of their
operations, but to <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
the cauſes of divers <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
of Nature, that it may be worth
while to exemplifie it by ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p>The firſt whereof I ſhall take from
an uſual practice of the Chymiſts
themſelves: which I the rather doe,
to let you ſee, that ſuch known Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
are too often over-looked
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60281:197"/>
by them that make them, but yet
may hint or confirm Theories to
thoſe that reflect on them. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
I here ſpeak of, is that which
is afforded by the vulgar Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Bezoardicum Minerale.</hi> For,
though the rectified <hi>Butter</hi> or Oil of
<hi>Antimony</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre,</hi> that
are put together to make this white
<hi>Praecipitate,</hi> are both of them diſtilled
liquours; yet the copious powder,
that reſults from their Union, is, by
that Union of volatile parts, ſo far
fixt, that, after they have edulcora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it with water, they preſcribe the
calcining of it in a Crucible for five
or ſix hours: which operation it
could not bear, unleſs it had attained
to a conſiderable fixation. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
ſuppoſes with the generality
of Chymiſts, that the addition of a
due quantity of ſpirit of Nitre, is
neceſſary to be employed in making
the <hi>Bezoardicum Minerale.</hi> But if it
be a true Obſervation, which is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the Learned <hi>Guntherus Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lichius,</hi>
(but which I had no Furnace
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60281:197"/>
at hand to examine when I heard of
it,) if, I ſay, it be true, that a <hi>Bezo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardicum
Minerale</hi> may be obtained,
without ſpirit of Nitre, barely by a
ſlow evaporation, made in a Glaſſe-diſh,
of the more fugitive parts of
the Oil of Antimony; this Inſtance
will not indeed be proper in this
place, but yet will belong to the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
of the foregoing ways of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
Fixity. I proceed now to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage
other particulars in favour of
the above-mentioned Obſervation.</p>
                  <p>If you take ſtrong <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi>
that, when the Glaſs is unſtopt, will
ſmoak of it ſelf in the cold air, and
ſatiate it with the volatile <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> the ſuperfluous moiſture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abſtracted, you will obtain by
this preparation (which, you may
remember, I long ſince communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to you, and divers other <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi>)
a compounded Salt, ſcarce, if at all,
diſtinguiſhable from <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi>
and which will not, as the Salts it
conſiſts of will doe, before their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alition,
eaſily fly up of it ſelf into the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60281:198"/>
air, but will require a not deſpicable
degree of fire to ſublime it.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe ſemivolatile Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Salt I have made, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
mentioned, others, which I
ſhall not here repeat, but paſſe on to
other Inſtances pertinent to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
deſign.</p>
                  <p>I lately mentioned, that the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
of the ſpirits of Nitre may be
very much abated, by bringing them
to coagulate into Cryſtalls with
particles of corroded Silver; but I
ſhall now add, that I gueſſed, and by
trial found, that theſe Nitrous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
may be made much more fixt by
the addition of the Spirit of Salt,
which, if it be good, will of it ſelf
ſmoak in the Air. For, having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
a convenient quantity of Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalls
of Silver in diſtilled water, and
precipitated them, not with a <hi>Solution</hi>
of Salt, but the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Salt; the
phlegm being abſtracted, and ſome
few of the looſer ſaline particles;
though the remaining maſſe were
preſt with a violent fire that kept
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60281:198"/>
the Retort red-hot for a good while;
yet the Nitrous and Saline ſpirits
would by no means be driven away
from the Silver, but continued in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
with it; and when the maſſe was
taken out, theſe Spirits did ſo abound
in it, that it had no appearance of a
Metal, but looked rather like a thick
piece of Horn.</p>
                  <p>The next Inſtance I ſhall name is
afforded us by that kind of <hi>Turbith,</hi>
which may be made by <hi>Oil of Vitriol,</hi>
in ſtead of the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> imployed in
the common <hi>Turpethum Minerale.</hi> For,
though Oil of Vitriol be a diſtilled
liquour, and Mercury a body volatile
enough; yet, when we abſtracted
four or five parts of Oil of Vitriol
from one of Quick-ſilver, (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if the operation were repeated,)
and then waſhed off as much as we
could of the ſaline particles of the Oil
of Vitriol; yet thoſe that remained
adhering to the Mercury made it far
more fixt, than either of the liquours
had been before, and inabled it even
in a Crucible to endure ſuch a degree
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60281:199"/>
of fire, before it could be driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
as, I confeſs, I ſomewhat won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at. The like <hi>Turbith</hi> may be
made with Oil of Sulphur <hi>per Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam.</hi>
But this is nothing to what
<hi>Helmont</hi> tells us of the operation of
his <hi>Alkaheſt,</hi> where he affirms, that
that <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> which is volatile e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
being abſtracted from running
Mercury, not onely coagulates it, but
leaves it fixt, ſo that it will endure
the brunt of fires acuated by Bellows,
(<hi>omnem follium ignem.</hi>) If this be
certain, it will not be a ſlender proof,
that <hi>Fixity</hi> may be <hi>Mechanically</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
and however, the Argument
will be good in reference to the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montian</hi>
Spagyriſts. For if, as one
would expect, there do remain
ſome particles of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> with
thoſe of the metal, it will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
that two volatile ſubſtances
may perfectly fix one another.
And if, as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſeems to think,
the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> be totally abſtracted,
this ſuppoſition will the more favour
our Doctrine about <hi>Fixity;</hi> ſince, if
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60281:199"/>
there be no material additament left
with the Quick-ſilver, the Fixation
cannot ſo reaſonably be aſcribed to
any thing, as to ſome new Mechanical
modification, and particularly to
ſome change of Texture introduced
into the Mercury it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And that you may think this the
leſs improbable, I will now proceed
to ſome Inſtances, whereof the firſt
ſhall be this; That, having put a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
made of a certain proportion of
two dry, as well as volatile, bodies,
(<hi>viz.</hi> Sal Armoniac, and Flower or
very fine powder of Sulphur,) to half
its weight of common running Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
and elevated this mixture three
or four times from it, (in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſhaped, and not over-wide, glaſs)
the Mercury, that lay in the bottom
in the form of a ponderous and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
purpliſh powder, was, by this
operation, ſo fixt, that it long endured
a ſtrong fire, which at length was
made ſo ſtrong, that it melted the
Glaſs, and kept it melted, without
being ſtrong enough to force up the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60281:200"/>
Mercury: which, by ſome trials, not
ſo proper to be here mentioned,
ſeemed to have its ſalivating and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick
powers extraordinarily infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and ſometimes quite ſuppreſſed.
But this onely upon the bye. In all
the other Inſtances, (wherewith I
ſhall conclude theſe Notes,) I ſhall
employ one <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> Oil of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
and ſhew you the efficacy of it
in fixing ſome parts of volatile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
with ſome parts of it ſelf; by
which examples it may appear, that
a Volatile body may not onely leſſen
the volatility of another body, as in
the lately mentioned caſe of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
<hi>Sal Armoniac;</hi> but that two
Subſtances, that apart were volatile,
may compoſe a third, that will not
onely be leſs volatile, but conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
(if not altogether) fixt.</p>
                  <p>We mixed then, by degrees, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
equal parts of <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> and
<hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Turpentine:</hi> and though each of
them ſingle, eſpecially the latter, will
aſcend with a moderate fire in a
Sand-furnace; yet, after the Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60281:200"/>
was ended, we had a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
quantity, ſometimes (if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remember
not) a fifth or ſixth part,
of a <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> black as a Coal,
and whereof a great part was of a
ſcarce to be expected fixtneſs in the
fire.</p>
                  <p>To give a higher proof of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
that Oil of Vitriol has to
let ſome of its parts grow fixt by
combination with thoſe of an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
volatile additament, I mixed
this liquour with an equal or double
weight of highly rectified <hi>Spirit of
Wine,</hi> and not onely after, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
without, previous digeſtion, I
found, that the fluid parts of the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being totally abſtracted, there
would remain a pretty quantity of a
black Subſtance ſo fixt as to afford
juſt cauſe of wonder.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe <hi>Camphire</hi> is eſteemed
the moſt fugitive of conſiſtent bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
in regard that, being but laid
in the free air, without any help of
the fire, it will fly <hi>all</hi> away; I tried,
what Oil of Vitriol abſtracted from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60281:201"/>
                     <hi>Camphire</hi> would doe; and found at

Corroſive or fretting, (though not

more diſtinctly enumerated and
ſorted the Solvents of bodies.</p>
                  <p>The Attributes that ſeem the moſt

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Menſtruum conſiſt
of, or abound with, Corpuſcles not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60281:204"/>
too big to get in at the Pores or
Commiſſures of the body to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved;
nor yet be ſo very minute
as to paſs through them, as the beams
of Light do through Glaſs; or to
be unable by reaſon of their great
ſlenderneſs and flexibility to disjoyn
the parts they invade.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That theſe Corpuſcles
be of a ſhape fitting them to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

in order to the diſſociating of

degree of ſolidity to disjoyn
the Particles of the body to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved;
which Solidity of Solvent
corpuſcles is ſomewhat diſtinct from
their bulk, mention'd in the firſt
Qualification; as may appear by
comparing a ſtalk of Wheat and a

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Corpuſcles of
the Menſtruum be agile and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged
for motion, (ſuch as is fit to
disjoyn the parts of the invaded bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)
either by their ſhape, or their
minuteneſs, or their fitneſs to have
their action befriended by adjuvant
Cauſes; ſuch as may be (<hi>firſt</hi>) the
preſſure of the Atmoſphere, which
may impell them into the Pores of
bodies not fill'd with a Subſtance ſo
reſiſting as common Air: As we ſee,
that water will by the prevalent
preſſure of the Ambient, whether
Air or Water, be raiſed to the height
of ſome inches in capillary Glaſſes,
and in the pores of Spunges, whoſe
conſiſtent parts being of eaſier ceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than the ſides of Glaſs-pipes,
thoſe Pores will be enlarged, and
conſequently thoſe ſides disjoyn'd,
as appears by the dilatation and
ſwelling of the Spunge: And (<hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly</hi>)
the agitation, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
Corpuſcles may be fitted to
receive in thoſe Pores or Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
by the tranſcurſion of ſome
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60281:205"/>
ſubtile ethereal matter; or by the
numerous knocks and other pulſes of
the ſwimming or tumbled Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles
of the Menſtruum it ſelf, (which
being a fluid body, muſt have its
ſmall parts perpetually and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
moved) whereby the engaged
Corpuſcles, like ſo many little Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Leavers, may be enabled to
wrench open, or force aſunder the
little parts between which they have
inſinuated themſelves. But I ſhall
not here proſecute this Theory,
(which, to be handled fully, would
require a diſcourſe apart) ſince
theſe Conjectures are propos'd but
to make it probable in the general,
That the <hi>Corroſiveneſs</hi> of bodies may
be deduced from Mechanical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
But whether beſt from the
newly propos'd ones, or any other,
need not be anxiouſly conſider'd in

                     <p>'TIs obvious, that, though the
recently expreſt Juice of
Grapes be ſweet, whilſt it retains
the Texture that belongs to it as 'tis
new, (eſpecially if it be made of
ſome ſorts of Grapes that grow in
hot Regions,) yet after fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
'twill, in tract of time, as 'twere
ſpontaneouſly, degenerate into Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.
<hi>In which</hi> Liquor, to a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the more ſolid Corpuſcles
of the Muſt, their frequent and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Attritions may be ſuppoſed to
have given edges like thoſe of the
blades of ſwords or knives; and <hi>in
which,</hi> perhaps, the confuſed agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that preceded, extricated, or, as
it were, unſheathed ſome ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
that (deriv'd from the ſap of
the Vine, or, perchance more origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
from the juice of the Earth)
were at firſt in the Muſt, but lay
conceal'd, and as it were ſheathed,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60281:206"/>
among the other particles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they were aſſociated, when
they were preſt out of the Grapes.
Now this Liquor, that by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
(or other like) Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Changes is become Vinegar,
does ſo abound with Corpuſcles,
which, on the account of their edges,
or their otherwiſe ſharp and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trative
ſhape, are Acid and Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
that the better ſort of it will,
without any preparation, diſſolve
Coral, Crabs-eyes, and even ſome
Stones, <hi>Lapis ſtellaris</hi> in particular,
as alſo <hi>Minium,</hi> (or the <hi>Calx</hi> of
Lead) and even crude Copper, as
we have often tried. And not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the diſtill'd Spirit of it will do
thoſe things more powerfully, and
perform ſome other things that meer
Vinegar cannot; but the ſaline par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
wont to remain after Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
may, by being diſtill'd and
cohobated <hi>per ſe,</hi> or by being skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
united with the foregoing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
be brought to a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of
no ſmall efficacy in the diſſolution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60281:207"/>
and other preparations of metalline
bodies, too compact for the meer
Spirit it ſelf to work upon.</p>
                     <p>From divers other ſweet things
alſo may Vinegar be made; and even
of Honey, skilfully fermented with
a ſmall proportion of common wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
may be made a Vinegar ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than many of the common Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinegars;
as has been affirmed to
me by a very candid Phyſician,
who had occaſion to deal much in

Metals, the former of them Silver,

ſpeedily and copiouſly when an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
heat gives their inteſtine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
a new degree of Vehemency
or Velocity, which is but a mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

meaſure of Agitation is not onely
in the abovemention'd Inſtances a
powerfully aſſiſtant Cauſe in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
made by the lately mention'd
Corroſive Liquors, but is that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which ſome Menſtruums are not
wont ſenſibly to corrode ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
at all, as we have tried in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Quick-ſilver in three or four
times its weight of Oyl of Vitriol;
ſince in this Menſtruum I found not
the Mercury to be diſſolved or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60281:208"/>
though I kept it a long time
in the Cold: Whereas, when the
Oyl of Vitriol was excited by a
convenient heat, (which was not
faint) it corroded the Mercury into
a fine white <hi>Calx</hi> or powder, which,
by the affuſion of fair water, would
be preſently turn'd into a yellowiſh
<hi>Calx</hi> of the colour and nature of a
Turbith. I remember alſo, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for trials ſake diſſolv'd in a
weak Spirit of Salt, a fourth part of
its weight of fine Cryſtals of Nitre,
we found, that it would not in the
cold (at leaſt during a good while
that we waited for its operation) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
Leaf-gold; but when the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi>
was a little heated at the fire,
the Solution proceeded readily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
And in ſome caſes, though
the external heat be but ſmall, yet
there may intervene a brisk heat, and
much cooperate in the diſſolution of
a Body; as, for inſtance, of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver
in <hi>Aqua Fortis.</hi> For it is no
prodigy to find, that when a full
proportion of that fluid Metal has
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60281:209"/>
been taken, the Solution, though at
firſt altogether liquid, and as to ſenſe
uniform, comes to have after a
while a good quantity of coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or cryſtalliz'd matter at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
of which the cauſe may be,
that in the very act of Corroſion
there is excited an intenſe degree of
heat, which conferring a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of agitation to the Menſtruum,
makes it diſſolve a good deal more,
than afterwards, when the Conflict
is over, it is able to keep up.</p>

they be not reduc'd to that ſubtilty

ſome dry bodies a corroding power,
which they could not otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe;
as in the way of writing ones
name (or a <hi>Motto</hi>) upon the blade of
a knife with common Sublimate:
For, if having very thinly overlaid

you write with a bodkin or

Vinegar is not neceſſary. For after
a while all the parts of the blade

                     <p>THis brings into my mind an
Obſervation I have ſometimes
had occaſion to make, that I found
more uſeful than common, and it is,
That divers Bodies, whether di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd
or not diſtill'd, that are not
thought capable of diſſolving other
Bodies, becauſe in moderate degrees
of heat they will not work on them,
may yet by intenſe degrees of heat
be brought to be fit Solvents for
them. To which purpoſe I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that having a diſtill'd Liquor,
which was rather ſweet to the taſte,
than either acid, lixiviate or urinous,
though for that reaſon it ſeem'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to work on Pearls, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
did not diſſolve them in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
time, wherein they were
kept with it in a more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
warm digeſtion; yet the Glaſs
being for many hours (amounting
perhaps to ſome days) kept in ſuch
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60281:211"/>
an heat of ſand as made the Liquor
boil, we had a Diſſolution of Pearls,
that uniting with the Menſtruum
made it a very valuable Liquor.
And though the Solvents of crude
Gold, wont to be employed by
Chymiſts, are generally diſtill'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
that are acid, and in the lately
mention'd Solvent, made of crude
Salts and common water, Acidity
ſeem'd to be the predominant quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(which makes the uſe of Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

gave occaſion to theſe Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
may furniſh us with an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Inſtance of the Production of

it ſelf, when diſſolv'd in water,
is not obſerv'd to be a Menſtruum
for the Solution of the Metals here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after

if I may ſo ſpeak, and by Attrition,
or other Mechanical ways of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on them, reduc'd to the ſhapes
of Acid and Alcalizate Salts, it then
affords two ſorts of Menſtruums of
very differing natures, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them diſſolve or corrode a

that the increaſe of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the more penetrating Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles

to its Solutive power; and I ſhall
now adde, that the Shape and Size,
which are Mechanical affections, and
ſometimes alſo the Solidity of the

to qualifie a Liquor to diſſolve
this or that particular body. Of
this, even ſome of the more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar

us with Inſtances. For there is no

there is no neceſſity of having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to ſo groſs and compounded
a Body as Sal Armoniac to enable
<hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> to diſſolve Gold: For,
the Spirit of common Salt alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mingled in a due proportion, will
ſuffice for that purpoſe. Which (by
the way) ſhews, that the Volatile
Salt of Urine and Soot, that concur
to the making up of Sal Armoniac,
are not neceſſary to the diſſolution
of Gold, for which a Solvent may
be made with <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> and crude

becauſe the mention I had

brought into my mind what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd,
to make it probable, that a
ſmaller change, than one would
lightly imagine, of the bulk, ſhape,
or ſolidity of the Corpuſcles of a
Menſtruum may make it fit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
a Body it would not work on

becauſe the warier ſort of
Chymiſts themſelves are very ſhye
of the inward uſe or preparations

they find, and the venenoſity they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60281:213"/>
ſuſpect in that corroſive Menſtruum:
Whereas Spirit of Salt we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as a much more innocent Liquor,
whereof, if it be but diluted with
fair water or any ordinary drink,
a good Doſe may be ſafely given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
though it have not wrought
upon Gold or any other body, to
take off its acrimony. But, whether
or no this prove of any great uſe in
Phyſick, wherein perhaps, if any
quantity of Gold be to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
a greater proportion of Spirit
of Nitre would be needed; the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
will not be unfit to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in reference to what we were
ſaying of Solvents. For, whereas
we find not that our <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt</hi>
here in <hi>England</hi> will at all diſſolve
crude Gold, we found, that by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſome Leaf-gold into a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
quantity of good Spirit of Salt,
when we had dropt-in Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
(ſhaking the Glaſs at each drop,)
till we perceived, that the mixture
was juſt able in a moderate heat to
diſſolve the Gold, we found, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60281:214"/>
we had been oblig'd to employ but
after the rate of twelve drops of the
latter Liquor to an ounce of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
ſo that, ſuppoſing each of theſe
drops to weigh a grain, the fortieth
part of Spirit of Nitre being added,
ſerved to turn the Spirit of Salt into
a kind of <hi>Aqua Regia.</hi> But to know
the proportion otherwiſe than by
gheſs, we weigh'd ſix other drops of
the ſame Spirit of Salt, and found
them to amount not fully to three

                     <p>We took equal parts of good <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua

Spirit of Wine, and having min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60281:215"/>
(without which caution the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may prove dangerous,) we u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
them by two or three Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the whole mixture; which
afterwards we found not to have the
leaſt fretting taſte, and to be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of its corroſive nature, that it
would not work upon Silver, though
by Precipitation or otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to very ſmall parts; nay, it
would ſcarce ſenſibly work in a good
while on Filings of Copper, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other bodies, which meer Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
or perhaps Rheniſh wine will
corrode. Nay, I remember, that with
another Spirit, (that was not Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous)
and afterwards with <hi>Alkool</hi>

<hi>Specimen</hi> of the power of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the other Spirit to be poured, (which
it ſhould warily be) upon the agitated

but preſently after was

                     <p>Nor are theſe the onely acid Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums
that I have many years ſince
been able to correct by ſuch a way:
For I applied it to others, as Spirit
of Nitre, and even <hi>Aqua Regis</hi> it
ſelf; but it has not an equal opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon all, and leaſt of all (as
far as I can remember) upon Spirit
of Salt; as on the other ſide ſtrong
Spirit of Nitre was the <hi>Menſtruum</hi>
upon which its effects were the moſt
ſatisfactory.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of the Chymiſts pretend,

ought, according to them, to
be of a very ſulphureous nature;
yet we find not that 'tis in Chymical

And whereas Chymiſts tell
us, that the Solutions of Alcaly's,
ſuch as Salt of Tartar, or of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhes
in common Oyls, proceed
from the great cognation between
them, I demand, whence it happens,
that Salt of Tartar will by boiling
be diſſolved in the expreſt Oyl of

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60281:219"/>
and penetrant, being freed from the
earthy, aqueous and feculent parts,
which Diſtillation diſcovers to be in
the expreſt Oyls, you may boil Salt
of Tartar twenty times as long
without making any Soap of them,
or perhaps any ſenſible Solution of
the Alkaly. And Chymiſts know,
how difficult it is, and how unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully
'tis wont to be attempted to
diſſolve pure Salt of Tartar in pure
Spirit of Wine, by digeſting the
not peculiarly prepar'd Salt in the
cognate Menſtruum. I will not urge,
that, though the moſt conſpicuous
mark of Sulphur be inflammability,
and is in an eminent degree to be
found in Oyl as well as Sulphur;
yet an Alkaly and water which are

                     <p>IF we duly reflect upon the known
proceſs that Chymiſts are wont
to employ in making <hi>Mercurius dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
we ſhall find it very favourable
to our <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> For though we
have already ſhewn in the V. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
and 'tis generally confeſt,
that common Sublimate made of
Mercury is a highly corroſive body;
yet, if it be well ground with
near an equal weight of Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and be a few times ſublimed,
(to mix them the more exactly) it
will become ſo mild, that 'twill not
ſo much as taſte ſharp upon the
tongue; ſo that Chymiſts are wont
to call it <hi>Mercurius dulcis:</hi> And yet
this Dulcification ſeems to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in a Mechanical way. For
moſt part of the Salts, that made
the Sublimate ſo Corroſive, abide in
the <hi>Mercurius dulcis;</hi> but by being
compounded with more Quickſilver,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60281:222"/>
they are diluted by it, and (which
is more conſiderable) acquire a
new Texture, which renders them
unfit to operate, as they did before,
when the fretting Salts were not
joyn'd with a ſufficient quantity of
the Mercury to inhibit their corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
activity. It may perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
help us to conceive, how this
change may be made, if we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
<hi>that</hi> a company of meer Knife-blades
be firſt fitted with Hafts,
which will in ſome regard leſſen
their wounding power by covering
or caſing them at that end which is
deſign'd for the handle; (though
their inſertion into thoſe Hafts, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them into Knives, makes them
otherwiſe the fitter to cut and pierce)
and <hi>that</hi> each of them be <hi>afterwards</hi>
ſheathed, (which is, as it were, a
hafting of the Blades too;) for
then they become unfit to cut or
ſtab, as before, though the Blades
be not deſtroyed: Or elſe we may
conceive theſe Blades without Hafts
or Sheaths to be tied up in bundles,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60281:223"/>
or as it were in little faggots with
pieces of wood, ſomewhat longer
than themſelves, opportunely pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
between them. For neither in
this new Conſtitution would they
be fit to cut and ſtab as before. And
by conceiving the edges of more or
fewer of the Blades to be turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and thoſe that are not, to
have more or leſs of their points
and edges to be ſheath'd, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
cover'd by interpos'd bodies,
one may be help'd to imagine, how
the genuine effects of the Blades
may be variouſly leſſen'd or diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd.
But, whether theſe or any other
like changes of Diſpoſition be fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd,
it may by Mechanical Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
become intelligible, how the
Corroſive Salts of common Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
may loſe their efficacy, when
they are united with a ſufficient
quantity of Quickſilver in <hi>Mercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
dulcis:</hi> In which new ſtate the
Salts may indeed in a Chymical
phraſe be ſaid to be ſatiated; but
this Chymical phraſe does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60281:223"/>
how this Saturation takes
away the Corroſiveneſs from Salts
that are ſtill actually preſent in the
ſweet Mercury. And by Analogy
to ſome ſuch Explications as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
propoſ'd, a poſſible Account
may be render'd, why fretting Salts
do either quite loſe their ſharpneſs,
as Alkalies, whilſt they are imbodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Sand in common Glaſs; or
loſe much of their Corroſive Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as Oyl of Vitriol does when
with Steel it compoſes <hi>Vitriolum
Martis;</hi> or elſe are tranſmuted or
diſguis'd by conjunction with ſome
corroded bodies of a peculiar Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as when <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> does with
Silver make an extreamly bitter
Salt or Vitriol, and with Lead one
that is poſitively ſweet almoſt like
common <hi>Saccharum Saturni.</hi>

                     <p>TO ſhew, how much the Efficacy
of a Menſtruum may depend
even upon ſuch ſeemingly ſlight Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
Circumſtances as one would
not eaſily ſuſpect any neceſſity of, I
ſhall employ an Experiment, which
though the unpractis'd may eaſily
fail of making well, yet, when I
tried it after the beſt manner, I did
it with good ſucceſs. I put then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Lead a good quantity of well
rectified <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> in which the
Metal, as I expected, continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolved;
though, if the Chymiſts
ſay truly that the diſſolving power
of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> conſiſts onely in
the acid Salts that it abounds with,
it ſeems naturally to follow, that the
more abundance of them there is
in a determinate quantity of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
it ſhould be the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60281:224"/>
able to diſſolve Metalline and
Mineral bodies. And in effect we
ſee, that, if Corroſive Menſtruums
be not ſufficiently dephlegmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they will not work on divers of
them. But, notwithſtanding this
plauſible Doctrine of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
conjecturing that the Saline
Particles that ſwam in our <hi>Aqua
Fortis</hi> might be more throng'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
than was convenient for a
body of ſuch a Texture of Saline
parts, and ſuch intervals between
them, I diluted the Menſtruum by
adding to it what I thought fit of
fair water, and then found, that the
deſired Congruity betwixt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and the Patient emerged, and
the Liquor quickly began to fall
upon the Metal and diſſolve it. And
if you would try an Experiment to
the ſame purpoſe, that needs much
leſs circumſpection to make it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
you may, inſtead of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lead, reiterate what I elſewhere
mention my ſelf to have tried with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60281:225"/>
Silver, which would not diſſolve in
too ſtrong <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> but would be
readily fallen upon by that Liquor,
when I had weaken'd it with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
water.</p>
                     <p>And this it may ſuffice to have ſaid
at preſent of the power or faculty
that is found in ſome bodies of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding
or Diſſolving others. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I have not found among the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotelians,</hi>
I have met with, ſo
much as an Offer at an Intelligible
account. And I the leſs expect the
vulgar Chymiſts will from their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical
Principles afford us a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
one, when, beſides the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
that from the nature of the
things and <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Writings have
been lately alledg'd againſt their
<hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> I conſider, how ſlight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
they are wont to give us even
of the familiar <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Liquors. For if, for example,
you ask a vulgar Chymiſt why <hi>Aqua
fortis</hi> diſſolves Silver and Copper,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60281:225"/>
'tis great odds but he will tell you,
'tis becauſe of the abundance of fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Salt that is in it, and has a cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with the Salts of the Metal.
And if you ask him, why Spirit of
Salt diſſolves Copper, he will tell
you 'tis for the ſame reaſon; and yet,
if you put Spirit of Salt, though
very ſtrong, to <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
will not diſſolve Silver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
upon the mixture, the Liquors
acquire a new Gonſtitution as to the
Saline Particles, by vertue of which
the mixture will diſſolve, inſtead of
Silver, Gold. Whence we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
againſt the Chymiſts, that the
Inability of this compounded Liquor
to work on Silver does not proceed
from its being weaken'd by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Salt; as well becauſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them, Gold is far the more

a more potent Menſtruum to
work upon it, as becauſe this ſame

Copper. And to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Corroſibility</hi> of Bodies is as
well as their Corroſiveneſs a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
thing; as we ſee, that Gold,
for inſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will not be diſſolved
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60281:227"/>
by <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> but will by <hi>Aqua
Regis;</hi> whereas Silver is not ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by the latter of theſe Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums,
but is by the former. And this
relative Affection, on whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
a Body comes to be corrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> ſeems to conſiſt
chiefly in <hi>three</hi> things, which all of
them depend upon Mechanical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe Qualifications the <hi>firſt</hi>
is, that the Body to be corroded be
furniſh'd with Pores of ſuch a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and figure, that the Corpuſcles
of the Solvent may enter them, and
yet not be much agitated in them
without giving brisk knocks or
ſhakes to the ſolid parts that make
up the walls, if I may ſo call them,
of the Pores. And 'tis for want of
this condition, that Glaſs is penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a multitude of places, but not
diſſipated or diſſolv'd by the incident
beams of Light, which permeate its
Pores without any conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance;
and though the Pores and
Commiſſures of a Body were leſs
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60281:227"/>
minute, and capable of letting in
ſome groſſer Corpuſcles, yet if theſe
were, for want of ſolidity or rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
too flexible, or were of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
incongruous to that of the
Pores they ſhould enter, the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
would not inſue; as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
when pure Spirit of Wine is in
the cold put upon Salt of Tartar, or
when <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> is put upon powder
of Sulphur.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Qualification of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodible
Body is, that its conſiſtent
Corpuſcles be of ſuch a Bulk and
Solidity, as does not render them
uncapable of being disjoyn'd by the
action of the inſinuating corpuſcles
of the Menſtruum. Agreeable to
this and the former Obſervation is
the practice of Chymiſts, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes,
when they would have a
Body to be wrought on by a Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum
otherwiſe too weak for it in
its crude eſtate, diſpoſe it to receive
the action of the Menſtruum by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly
opening it, (as they ſpeak)
that is, by enlarging the Pores, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60281:228"/>
a comminution of the Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles,
or weakening their Coheſion.
And we ſee, that divers Bodies are
brought by fit preparations to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble
in Liquors that would not
work on them before. Thus, as was
lately noted, Lime-ſtone by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination
becomes (in part) diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble
in water; and ſome Metalline
Calces will be ſo wrought on by Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
as they would not be by the
ſame Agents, if the preparation of
the Metalline or other Body had not
given them a new Diſpoſition. Thus,
though crude Tartar, eſpecially in
lumps, is very ſlowly and difficultly
diſſoluble in cold water, yet when
'tis burnt it may be preſently diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in that Liquor; and thus,
though the Filings and the Calx of
Silver will not be at all diſſolv'd by
common water or Spirit of Wine;
yet if by the interpoſition of the
Saline Particles of <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> the
Lunar Corpuſcles be ſo disjoyn'd, and
ſuffer ſuch a comminution as they do
in Cryſtals of Lune, the Metal thus
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60281:228"/>
prepared and brought with its Saline
Additament into a new Texture
will eaſily enough diſſolve, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in water, but, as I have tried, in
well rectified Spirit of Wine. And
the like Solubility I have found in
the Cryſtals of Lead made with
Spirit of Verdigreaſe, or good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd
Vinegar, and in thoſe of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
made with <hi>Aqua Fortis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>laſt</hi> Diſpoſition to Corroſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
conſiſts in ſuch a coheſion of the
parts, whereof a Body is made up,
as is not too ſtrict to be ſuperable
by the action of the <hi>Menſtruum.</hi>
This Condition, though of kin to
the former, is yet ſomewhat differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from it, ſince a body may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of parts either bulky or ſolid,
which yet may touch one another
in ſuch ſmall portions of their Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces,
as to be much more eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociable
than the minute or leſs ſolid
parts of another Body, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact
is more full and cloſe, and ſo
their Coheſion more ſtrict.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:60281:229"/>
By what has been ſaid it may
ſeem probable, that, as I formerly
intimated, the Corroſibility of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
is but a Mechanical Relation,
reſulting from the Mechanical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and Contexture of its parts,
as they intercept Pores of ſuch ſizes
and figures as make them congruous
to thoſe of the Corpuſcles of the
<hi>Menſtruum,</hi> that are to pierce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, and disjoyn them.</p>
                  <p>That the Quality, that diſpoſes the
body it affects to be diſſolv'd by
Corroſive and other Menſtruums,
does (as hath been declared) in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
caſes depend upon the Mechanical
Texture and Affections of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in reference to the Menſtruum
that is to work upon it, may be
made very probable by what we are
in due place to deliver concerning
the Pores of Bodies and Figures of
Corpuſcles. But yet in compliance
with the deſign of theſe Notes, and

                     <p>IF we put highly rectified Spirit of

would lie in an undiſſolved powder
at the bottom: and yet, if before
any Liquor be employed, the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
be gently melted, and then the
Alkali of Tartar be by degrees put

                     <p>THe former Experiment is the
more remarkable, becauſe,
that though Oyl of Vitriol will in a

we have already related in the firſt

                     <p>IT agrees very well with our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
about the dependance of
the Corroſibility of Bodies upon
their Texture, that from divers Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
whilſt they are in conjunction
with others, there reſult maſſes, and
thoſe homogeneous as to ſenſe, that
are eaſily diſſoluble in Liquors, in
which a great part of the matter, if
it were ſeparated from the reſt,
would not be at all diſſolved. Thus
we ſee, that common Vitriol is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
diſſolved in meer water; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if it be skilfully calcin'd, it will
yield ſometimes near half its firſt
weight of inſipid Colcothar, which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60281:232"/>
not onely is not ſoluble in water,
but which neither <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> nor
<hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> though ſometimes they
will colour themſelves upon it, are
able (as far as I have tried) to
make Solutions of. We ſee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that ſimple water will, being
boil'd for a competent time with
Harts-horn, diſſolve it and make a
Jelly of it: And yet, when we have
taken Harts-horn throughly calcin'd
to whiteneſs, not onely we found
that common water was no longer a
fit Solvent for it, but we obſerved,
that when we put Oyl of Vitriol it
ſelf upon it, a good part of the
white powder was even by that
Corroſive Menſtruum left undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>

                     <p>IN the <hi>Fifteenth</hi> of the foregoing
Experiments I refer to a way of
making the Flower or Powder of
common Sulphur become <hi>eaſily diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble,</hi>
which otherwiſe 'tis far from
being, in highly rectified Spirit of
Wine. Wherefore I ſhall now adde,
that 'tis quickly perform'd by gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
melting the Sulphur, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating
with it by degrees an equal
or a greater weight of finely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
Salt of Tartar, or of fixt Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.
For if the mixture be put
warm into a Mortar that is ſo too;
and as ſoon as 'tis reduc'd to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
be put into a Glaſs, and well
ſhaken with pure Spirit of Wine,
it will, (as perhaps I may have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
obſerved,) in a few minutes
acquire a yellow colour, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
will grow deeper, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
it ſelf by the ſmell and effects
to be a real Solution of Sulphur;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60281:233"/>
and yet this Solubleneſs in Spirit of
Wine ſeems procur'd by the change
of Texture, reſulting from the
Commixtion of meer Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
which Chymiſts know, to their
trouble, to be it ſelf a body almoſt
as difficult as Sulphur to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in phlegmleſs Spirit of Wine,
unleſs the Conſtitution of it be firſt
alter'd by ſome convenient addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Which laſt words I adde,
becauſe, though Spirit of Verdigreaſe
be a Menſtruum that uſes to come
off in Diſtillation much more intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than other acid Menſtruums from
the bodies it has diſſolved; yet it
will ſerve well for an additament to
open (as the Chymiſts ſpeak) the
body of the Salt of Tartar. For
this purpoſe I employ Spirit of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digreaſe,
not made firſt with Spirit
of Vinegar, and then of Wine, after
the long and laborious way preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by <hi>Baſilius</hi> and <hi>Zwelfer,</hi> but eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and expeditiouſly by a ſimple Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation
of crude Verdigreaſe of
the better ſort. For when you have
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60281:234"/>
with this Liquor (being, if there
be need, once rectified) diſſolv'd as
much good Salt of Tartar, as 'twill
take up in the cold, if you draw off
the Menſtruum <hi>ad ſiccitatem,</hi> the
remaining dry Salt will be manifeſtly
alter'd in Texture even to the eye,
and will readily enough in high recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Spirit of Wine afford a Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which I have found conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in order to divers uſes that

                  <p>BY Precipitation is here meant
ſuch an agitation or motion of

As, on many occaſions, Chymiſts
call the ſubſtance that is made to fall
to the bottom of the liquor, the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate;</hi>
ſo for brevity ſake we ſhall
call the body that is put into the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
to procure that ſubſiding, the
<hi>Precipitant;</hi> as alſo that which is to
be ſtruck down, the <hi>Precipitable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
or matter,</hi> and the liquor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it ſwims before the ſeparation,

                  <p>When a haſty fall of a heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
body is procured by a <hi>Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi>
the Operation is called <hi>Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
in the proper or ſtrict ſenſe:
But when the ſeparation is made
without any ſuch addition, or the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ſeparated from the fluid part
of the liquor, inſtead of ſubſiding
emerges, then the word is uſed in a
more comprehenſive, but leſs proper,
acceptation.</p>
                  <p>As for the Cauſes of Precipitation
the very name it ſelf in its Chymical
ſenſe having been ſcarce heard of in
the Peripatetic Schools, it is not to be
expected, that they ſhould have given
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60281:242"/>
an account of the Reaſons of the
thing. And 'tis like, that thoſe
few <hi>Ariſtotelians,</hi> that have, by
their converſe with the laborato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
or writings of Chymiſts, taken
notice of this Operation, would, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their cuſtom on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
have recourſe for the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it to ſome ſecret ſympathy or
antipathy between the bodies whoſe
action and reaction intervenes in this
Operation.</p>
                  <p>But if this be the way propoſed, of
accounting for it, I ſhall quickly have
occaſion to ſay ſomewhat to it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the ways propoſed by the
Chymiſts, who were wont to refer
Precipitation, <hi>either,</hi> as is moſt uſual,
to a ſympathy betwixt the <hi>Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
body and the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> which
makes the Solvent run to the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the <hi>Precipitant,</hi> and ſo let fall
the particles of the body ſuſtained
before; <hi>or</hi> (with others) to a great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
or contrariety between the
acid ſalt of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> and the
fixed ſalt of the Oil, or ſolution of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60281:243"/>
calcined Tartar, which is the moſt
general and uſual <hi>Precipitant</hi> they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy.</p>
                  <p>But I ſee not, how either of theſe
cauſes will either reach to all the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
that have been exhibited, or
give a true account even of ſome of
thoſe, to which it ſeems applicable.
For firſt, in Precipitations, wherein
what they call a <hi>ſympathy</hi> between
the liquors, is ſuppoſed to produce
the effect, this admired ſympathy
does not (in my apprehenſion) evince
ſuch a myſterious occult Quality as
is preſumed, but rather conſiſts in a
greater congruity as to bigneſs, ſhape,
motion and pores of the minute parts
between the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> and the <hi>Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitant,</hi>
than between the ſame Solvent
and the body it kept before diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And though this ſympathy
rightly explained may be allowed to
have an intereſt in ſome ſuch Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitations
as let fall the diſſolved bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in its priſtine nature and form,
and only reduced into minute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
yet I find not, that in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60281:243"/>
of Precipitations this Doctrine
will hold; For in ſome that we have
made of Gold and Silver in proper
Menſtruums, after the ſubſiding mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had been well waſhed and dried,
ſeveral Precipitates of Gold made,
ſome with oil of Tartar, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds

uſual Precipitant, and ſome with an
Urinous Spirit, which works by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of a ſalt highly fugitive or Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile,
I found the powder to exceed
the weight of the Gold and Silver I
had put to diſſolve; and the Eye it
ſelf ſufficiently diſcovers ſuch Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates
not to be meer metalline pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

not (as hath been by ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſuſpected) of the combined Salts
alone, but of the metalline parts
alſo, may be ſtrongly concluded not
only from the ponderouſneſs of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of them in reference to their
bulk, but alſo manifeſtly from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of true malleable metals from
ſeveral of them.</p>

                  <p>THE other <hi>Chymical</hi> way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating
Precipitations may, in
a right ſence, be made uſe of by a
Naturaliſt on ſome particular occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But I think it much too narrow
and defective, as 'tis in a general way
propoſed, to be fit to be acquieſced
in. For firſt 'tis plain, that 'tis not
only Salt of Tartar and other fixed
Alcalies that precipitate moſt bodies
that are diſſolved in acid Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums;
as in making of <hi>Aurum
fulminans,</hi> oil of <hi>Tartar</hi> precipitates
the Gold out of <hi>Aqua Regis:</hi> But <hi>acid</hi>
liquors themſelves do on many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
no leſs powerfully precipitate
metals and other bodies out of one
another. Thus ſpirit of Salt, (as I
have often tried) precipitates Silver
out of <hi>Aqua fortis:</hi> The corroſive
Spirit of Nitre copiouſly precipitates
that white powder whereof they
make <hi>Bezoardicum Minerale:</hi> Spirit or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60281:244"/>
oil of Sulphur made by a glaſs-bell
precipitates Corals, Pearls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
in Spirit of Vinegar, as is
known to many Chymiſts, who now
uſe this <hi>Oleum Sulphuris per Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi>
to make the Magiſtery of
Pearls, &amp;c. for which vulgar Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
imploy <hi>Oleum Tartari per deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have ſometimes made a <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
wherein though there were both
Acid and Alcalizate Salts; yet I did not
find, that either acid Spirits or oil of
Tartar, or even Spirit of Urine would
precipitate the diſſolved ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>And I have obſerved, <hi>both</hi> that Salts
of a contrary nature will precipitate
bodies out of the ſame Menſtruum,
as not only Salt of Tartar, but Sea-ſalt
being diſſolved, will precipitate
each other, and each of them apart
will precipitate Silver out of <hi>Aqua
fortis; and</hi> that even, where there is
a confeſſed contrariety betwixt two
liquors, it may be ſo ordered, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them ſhall precipitate what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60281:245"/>
is diſſolved by the other; of which I
ſhall have occaſion to give ere long a
remarkable inſtance.</p>
                  <p>But it will beſt appear, that the
abovementioned Theories of the
Peripateticks and Chymiſts are at
leaſt inſufficient to ſolve the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
(many of which were probably
not known to moſt of them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not weigh'd by any,) if we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to obſerve the <hi>Mechanical</hi> ways,
by which Precipitations may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for; whereof I ſhall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
propoſe ſome Number, and ſay
ſomewhat of each of them apart;
not that I think all of them to be
equally important and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
or that I abſolutely deny, that
any one of them may be reduced to
ſome of the other; but that I think,
it may better elucidate the ſubject,
to treat of them ſeverally, when I
ſhall have premiſed, that I would not
thence infer, that though, for the moſt
part, Nature does principally effect
Precipitations by one or other of
theſe ways, yet in divers caſes ſhe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60281:245"/>
may not imploy two or more of them
about performing the operation.</p>
                  <p>To precipitate the Corpuſcles of a
metal out of a Menſtruum, wherein
being once throughly diſſolved it
would of it ſelf continue in that ſtate,
the two general ways that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing ſeems to ſuggeſt to
him that conſiders it, are, <hi>either</hi> to
add to the weight or bulk of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
Corpuſcles, and thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them unfit to accompany the
particles of the Menſtruum in their
motions; <hi>or</hi> to weaken the ſuſtaining
power of the Menſtruum, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
diſable it to keep the metalline
particles ſwimming any longer: which
falling of the deſerted parts of the
metal or other bodie, does often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the more eaſily inſue, becauſe in
many caſes, when the ſuſtaining parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Menſtruum come to be
too much weakned, that proves an
occaſion to the metalline Corpuſcles,
diſturbed in the former motion that
kept them ſeparate, to make occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and coalitions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60281:246"/>
and their fall becomes the
effect, though not equally ſo, of both
ways of Precipitation; as on the
other ſide, there are ſeveral occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on which the ſame Precipitant,
that brings the ſwimming particles of
the metal to ſtick to one another,
does likewiſe, by mortifying or
diſabling the ſaline Spirits or other
parts of the ſolvent, weaken the
ſuſtaining power of that liquor.</p>

               <div n="3" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                  <p>TO deſcend now to the diſtinct
Conſiderations about theſe two
ways: The firſt of the moſt genera
Cauſes of Precipitation is ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haeſion
procured by the Precipitant
in the ſolution, as makes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
corpuſcles, or at leaſt the
aſſociated particles of the diſſolved
body, too heavy to be ſuſtained, or
too bulky to be kept in a ſtate of
fluidity by the liquor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60281:246"/>
That in many Precipitations there
is made a coalition betwixt the ſmall
parts of the Precipitant and thoſe of
the diſſolved metal, or other body,
and frequently alſo with the ſaline
ſpirits of the Menſtruum, may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
ſhewn by the weight of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate,
which though carefully
waſhed and dryed, often ſurpaſſes,
and ſometimes very conſiderably,
that of your crude metal that was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved;
of which we lately gave an
inſtance in <hi>Aurum fulminans</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
Silver; &amp; we may yet give a
more conſpicuous one, in that which
Chymiſts call <hi>Luna Cornea:</hi> For,
if having diſſolved Silver in good
<hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> you Precipitate it with
the ſolution of Sea-ſalt in fair water,
and from the very white Precipitate
waſh the looſe adhering ſalts, the
remaining powder, being dryed
and ſlowly melted, will look much
leſs like a metalline body than
like a piece of horn, whence alſo
it takes its name; ſo conſiderable is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60281:247"/>
the additament of the ſaline to the
metalline particles.</p>
                  <p>And that part of ſuch additaments
is, retained, may not only be found
by weighing, but in divers caſes
may be argued from what is obvious
to the Eye: as if you diſſolve Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and into the phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
ſolution drop ſpirit of Salt, or
ſalt-water, or an urinous ſpirit, as of
Sal Armoniac, you will have a very
white Precipitate; but if inſtead of
any of theſe, you drop-in deliquated
ſalt of Tartar, your Precipitate will
be of a brick or orange colour.
From which experiment and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
I would gladly take a riſe to
perſwade Chymiſts and Phyſitians,
that 'tis not ſo indifferent, as thoſe
ſeem to think who look on Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
but as a kind of Comminution,
by what means the precipitation is
performed. For by reaſon of the
ſtrict adheſion of divers ſaline par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the precipitant and the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
the precipitated body, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the wonted abluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60281:247"/>
may have its qualities much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified
by thoſe of the particles of
the liquors, when theſe are fitted to
ſtick very faſt to it. Which laſt
words I add, becauſe, though that
ſometimes happens, yet it does not
always, there being a geater differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
than every body takes notice
of between Precipitations; as you
will be induced to think, if you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
the ſolution of Silver with
Copper, with ſpirit of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi>
with ſalt water, with oil of Tartar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with quick-ſilver, with crude Tartar
and with Zink. And in the lately
propoſed Example, you will think it
probable, that 'tis not all one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to diſſolved Mercury or Silver,
you imploy the ſubtile diſtilled Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Salt, or the groſs body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a dry form, or barely diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in common water. And thus
much of the Conduciveneſs of <hi>weight</hi>
to the ſtriking down the Corpuſcles
of a diſſolved Body.</p>
                  <p>That alſo the <hi>Bulk</hi> of a body may
very much contribute to make it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60281:248"/>
ſink or ſwim in a liquor, appears by
obvious inſtances. Thus Salt or
Sugar, being put into water either in
lumps or even in powder that is but
groſs, falls at firſt to the bottom, and
lies there, notwithſtanding the Air
that may be intercepted between its
parts or externally adhere to it. But
when by the inſinuating action of
the water it is diſſolved into minute
particles, theſe are carried up and
down with thoſe of the liquor and
ſubſide not. The like happens, when
a piece of ſilver is caſt into <hi>Aqua for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
and in many other caſes.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide I have ſeveral
times obſerved, that ſome bodies that
had long ſwam in a Menſtruum,
whilſt their minute parts were kept
from convening in it, did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by the coalition of many of
thoſe particles into bodies of a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
bulk coagulate and ſubſide,
(though ſometimes, to hinder the
evaporation of the Menſtruum, the
veſſels were kept ſtopt.) Of this I
elſewhere mention divers examples;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60281:248"/>
and particularly in urinous and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
ſpirits, well dephlegm'd, I have
found, that after all had for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
time continued in the form
of a perfect liquor, and as to ſenſe
homogeneous, ſtore of ſolid cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles,
convening together, ſetled
at the bottom of the glaſſes in the
form of ſaline Cryſtals. Having
alſo long kept a very red ſolution of
Sulphur firſt unlock'd, (as they
ſpeak) made with highly rectified
ſpirit of urine, I obſerved, that at
length the Sulphureous particles,
making little concretions between
themſelves, totally ſubſided and left
the liquor almoſt devoid of tincture.
By which you may ſee, that 'twas not
impertinent to mention (as I lately
did) among the ſubordinate cauſes
of Precipitation, the aſſociating of
the particles of a diſſolved body
with one another. Of which I elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
give a notable Example in
the ſhining powder that I obtained
from Gold diſſolved in a peculiar
Menſtruum, without any Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60281:249"/>
by the coalition of the metalline
particles, to which a tract of time gave
opportunity to meet and adhere in a
convenient manner.</p>
                  <p>If in what the Chymiſts call <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
per ſe,</hi> the Mercury be indeed
brought to loſe its fluidity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a powder without being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
with any additional body,
(which doubt I elſewhere ſtate and
diſcourſe of) it will afford us a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
inſtance to prove, that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitions
of particles into cluſters of
the ſelf ſame matter will render
them unfit for the motion requiſite
to fluidity. For in this odd precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
by fire, wherein the ſame
Menſtruum is both the Liquor and
the Precipitate, being not all made at
once, the Corpuſcles that firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe
themſelves by their redneſs,
are rejected by thoſe of the Mercury
that yet remains fluid, as unable to
accompany them in the motions that
belong to Mercury as ſuch.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
                  <p>BEfore I diſmiſs that way of Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating,
that depends upon the
unwieldineſs which the Precipitant
gives to the body it is to ſtrike down,
it may not be impertinent, eſpecially
in reference to the foregoing part of
this Paper, to conſider, that perhaps in
divers caſes the Corpuſcles of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
body may be made unfit to be
any longer ſuſtained in the Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
though the Precipitant adds very
little to their bulk, or at leaſt much
more to their ſpecific weight than to
it. For I have elſewere ſhewn, that
in divers ſolutions made of bodys by
acid Menſtruums, there are either ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
or extricated many ſmall
Aerial particles; and it will be eaſily
granted, that theſe may be ſmall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be detained in the pores of
the liquor and be inviſible there, if we
conſider, what a multitude of aerial
and formerly imperceptible bubbles
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60281:250"/>
is afforded by common water in our
Pneumatical Receivers, when the
incumbent air that before preſſed the
liquor, is pumpt out. And if the
Corpuſcles of the diſſolved body have
any little Cavities or pores fit to lodge
Aerial particles, or have aſperous
ſurfaces, between whoſe prominent
parts the generated air may conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
lie; in ſuch caſes, I ſay, theſe
Inviſible bubbles may be lookt upon,
as making with the ſolid Corpuſcles
they adhered to, little aggregates
much lighter <hi>in ſpecie</hi> than the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
themſelves would be; and
conſequently if the Precipitant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of particles of ſuch a ſize and
ſhape as are fit to expel theſe little
bubbles, and lodge themſelves in the
cavities poſſeſſed by them before,
there will be produced new aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
compoſed of the Corpuſcles of
the diſſolved body and the particles
of the Precipitant; which aggregates
though they do take up very little or
perhaps not at all more room (take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that word in a popular ſenſe) than
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60281:250"/>
thoſe, whereof the Aerial bubbles
made a part, will yet be Specifically
heavier than the former Aggregates
were, and may thereby overcome
the ſuſtaining power of the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum.</p>
                  <p>One thing more may be fit to be
taken notice of before we paſs on
further, namely, that 'tis upon the
ſcore of the Specific gravity of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and not barely upon the action of
the Precipitant, that an aggregate or
a Convention of particles does ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fall to the bottom than riſe
to the top. For, though the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
that procured the Coalition,
make the cluſter of particles become
of a bulk too unwieldy to continue
in the liquor as parts of it; yet if
each of them be lighter <hi>in ſpecie</hi> than
an equal bulk of the Menſtruum, or
if they ſo convene as to intercept a
ſufficient number of little bubbles or
aerial Corpuſcles between them, and
ſo become lighter than as much of
the Menſtruum as they take up the
room of, they will not be precipitated
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60281:251"/>
but emerge; as may be ſeen in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of thoſe Magiſteries of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables,
I elſwhere mention; where
ſome deeply colour'd plants being
made to tinge plentifully the Lixivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
they are boyled in, are afterwards
by the addition of Alum made to
curdle, as it were, into coloured Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions,
which being (totally or in
part) too big to ſwim as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they conven'd, and too light in
compariſon of the Menſtruum to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
emerge to the top and float there.
An eaſier and neater Example to the
ſame purpoſe I remember I ſhewed by
diſſolving Camphire in highly recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
ſpirit of Wine, 'till the ſolution
was very ſtrong. For though the
Camphire, when put in Lumps into
the ſpirit, ſunk to the bottom of it;
yet, when good ſtore of water, (a
liquor ſomewhat heavier in <hi>Specie</hi>
than Camphire,) was poured upon
the ſolution, the Camphire quickly
concreted and returned to its own
nature, and within a while emerged
to the top of the mingled liquors and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60281:251"/>
floated there. Theſe particulars I was
willing to mention here, that I might
give an inſtance or two of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitations,
that I formerly ſpake of
as improperly ſo called. And here
I muſt not decline taking notice of a
Phaenomenon, that ſometimes occurs
in Precipitations, and at firſt ſight
may ſeem contrary to our Doctrine
about them. For now and then it
happens, that after ſome drops of the
Precipitant have begun a Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at the top or bottom of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
one ſhakes the veſſel, that the
Precipitant may be the ſooner diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
through the other liquor, but
then they are quickly ſurprized to
find, that inſtead of haſtning the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Precipitation, the matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
precipitated diſappears, and
the ſolvent returns to be clear, or, as
to ſenſe, as uniform, as it was before
the Precipitant was put into it. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>u
this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> does not at all croſs
our Theory. For, when this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
though that part of the Solvent,
to which the Precipitant reaches, is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60281:252"/>
diſabled for Reaſons mentioned in
this Diſcourſe to ſupport the diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
body, yet this quantity of the
Precipitant is but ſmall in proportion
to the whole bulk of the ſolvent.
And therefore, when the agitation of
the veſſel diſperſes the cluſters of
looſly concreted particles through
the whole liquor, (which is ſeldom
ſo exactly proportioned to the body
it was to work on, as to be but juſt
ſtrong enough to diſſolve it) that
greater part of the Liquor, to which
before the ſhaking of the veſſel the
Precipitant did not reach, may well
be lookt upon as a freſh Menſtruum,
which is able to mortifie or overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the ſmall quantity of the Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
that is mingled with it, and ſo to
deſtroy its late operation on the body
diſſolved, by which means the ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
returns, as to ſenſe, to its former
ſtate. Which may be illuſtrated by
a not unpleaſant Experiment, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I have long ſince made by
precipitating a brick-coloured pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
out of a ſtrong ſolution of Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60281:252"/>
made in fair water. For this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding
matter, being laid to dry in
the Philter, by which 'twas ſeparated
from the water, would retain a deep
but ſomewhat dirty colour; and if
then, putting it into the bottom of a
wine glaſs, I poured upon it, either
clear oil of Vitriol, or ſome other
ſtrong acid Menſtruum, the Alcali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zat
particles being diſabled and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by ſome of the acid ones of
the Menſtruum, the other acid ones
would ſo readily diſſolve the reſidue
of the powder, that in a trice the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of it would diſappear and the
whole mixture be reduced into a clear
Liquor, without any ſediment at the
bottom.</p>
                  <p>Thus much may ſuffice at preſent
about the firſt general way of Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating
Bodies out of the Liquors
they ſwam in.</p>

                  <p>THE other of the two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
ways, by which Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be effected, is the diſabling
of the Solvent to ſuſtain the diſſolved

                  <p>There may be many inſtances,
wherein this ſecond way of effecting
Precipitations may be aſſociated by
Nature with the firſt way formerly
propoſed; but notwithſtanding the
caſes, wherein Nature may (as I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
noted) imploy both the ways
therein, yet in moſt caſes they ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
differ, in regard that in the
former way the ſubſiding of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
body is chiefly, if not only,
cauſed by the additional weight as
well as action of the external Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitant;
whereas in moſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the later way, the effect is
produced <hi>either</hi> without ſalt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
or any ſuch Precipitant, <hi>or</hi> by
ſome other quality of the Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant

                     <hi>more than</hi> by its weight, or at
leaſt <hi>beſides</hi> the weight it adds:
Though I forget not, that I lately
gave an example of a ſhining pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Gold, that fell to the bottom
of a Menſtruum without the help of
an External Precipitant: But that
was done ſo ſlowly, that it may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
whether it were a true Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation;
and I alledged it not as
ſuch, but to ſhew, that the increaſed
bulk of Particles may make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to ſwim in Menſtruums, wherein
they ſwam whilſt they were more
minute. And the like anſwer may
be accommodated to the Precipitate
<hi>per ſe</hi> newly mentioned.</p>
                  <p>This premiſed, I proceed now to
obſerve, that the general way, I laſt
propoſed, contains in it ſeveral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
wayes, that are more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
of which I ſhall now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the chief that occur to me, and
though but briefly, illuſtrate each of
them by examples. And firſt a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation
may be made, if the ſaline
or other diſſolving particles of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60281:254"/>
Menſtruum are mortified or rendred
unfit for their former function, by
particles of a Precipitant that are of
a contrary nature.</p>
                  <p>Thus Gold and ſome other mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
being diſſolved in <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi>
will be precipitated with ſpirit of
urine and other ſuch liquors aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with volatile and ſalino-ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
Corpuſcles, upon whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it is that they act; whence
theſe ſalts themſelves, though caſt
into a Menſtruum in a dry form, will
ſerve to make the like Precipitations.
And I the rather on this occaſion
mention Urinous ſpirits than Salt of
Tartar, becauſe thoſe volatile par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
add much leſs of weight to the
little Concretions, which compoſe
the Precipitated powder.</p>
                  <p>Upon inſtances of this kind, many
of the modern Chymiſts have built
that Antipathy betwixt the Salts of
the ſolvent and thoſe of the Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
to which they aſcribe almoſt all
Precipitations. But againſt this I
have repreſented ſomething already,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60281:254"/>
and ſhall partly now, and partly in
the ſequel of this diſcourſe add ſome
farther reaſons of my not being ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with this Doctrine. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that 'tis inſufficient to reach ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
(as will ere long be ſhown,) and
beſides that 'tis not eaſie to make out,
that there is any real antipathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
inanimate bodies; I conſider,
1. That ſome of thoſe Menſtruums,
to which this Antipathy is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
do after a ſhort commotion
(whereby they are diſpoſed to make
convenient occurſions and coaliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
amicably unite into concretions
participating of both the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents;
as I have ſomewhere ſhewn
by an Example purpoſely devis'd to
make this out; to do which I drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
a clear ſolution of fixed Nitre,
inſtead of the uſual one of common
ſalt, upon a ſolution of ſilver, in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua-fortis:</hi>
For the ſaline particles
of the Solvent and thoſe of the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitant,
will, as I have elſewhere reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recited,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60281:255"/>
for the moſt part friendly
unite into ſuch Cryſtals of Nitre for
the main, as they were obtained
from: And though this notion of the
Chymiſts, if well explained, be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to far more inſtances than
the propoſers of it ſeemed to have
thought on, and may be made good
uſe of in Practice; yet I take it to
be ſuch as is not true Univerſally,
and, where it is true, ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
according to Mechanical
Principles. For, if the particles of
the Menſtruum and thoſe of the
Precipitant be ſo framed, that upon
the action of the one upon the other,
there will be produced Corpuſcles
too big and unwieldy to continue in
the ſtate of fludity, there will inſue a
Precipitation: But if the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the corpuſcles of the Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
and of the Diſſolved body be
ſuch, that the Precipitant alſo it ſelf
is fit to be a Menſtruum to diſſolve
that body in; then, though there be
an union of the Salts of the Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60281:255"/>
and the metal (or other <hi>Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>)
and perhaps of the ſolvent too,
yet a Precipitation will not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
follow, though the ſaline par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the two liquors ſeemed, by
the heat and ebullition excited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them upon their meeting, to
exerciſe a great and mutual antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.
To ſatisfie ſome Ingenious men
about this particular, I diſſolved <hi>Zink</hi>
or <hi>Speltar</hi> in a certain urinous ſpirit;
(for, there are more than one that
may ſerve the turn;) and then
put to it a convenient quantity of a
proper acid ſpirit; but though there
would be a manifeſt conflict thereby
occaſioned betwixt the two liquors;
yet the ſpeltar remained diſſolved in
the mixture. And I remember, that for
the ſame purpoſe I deviſed another
Experiment, which is ſomewhat more
eaſie and more clear. I diſſolved
Copper calcined <hi>per ſe,</hi> or even crude,
in ſtrong ſpirit of ſalt; (for unleſs
it be ſuch, it will not be ſo proper,)
and having put to it by degrees a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60281:256"/>
good quantity of ſpirit of Sal-Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac
or fermented Urine, though
there would be a great commotion
with hiſſing and bubbles produced,
the Copper would not be precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
becauſe this Urinous ſpirit will
as well as the Salt, (and much more
readily) diſſolve the ſame metal, and
it would be kept diſſolved notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their operation on one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the intervening of which, and
their action upon the metalline cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles,
may be gathered from hence,
that the green ſolution, made with
ſpirit of ſalt alone, will by the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
urinous ſpirits be changed
either into a blewiſh green, or, if the
proportion of this ſpirit be very
great, into a rich blew almoſt like
ultramarine. And from theſe two
Experiments we may probably argue,
that when the Precipitation of a
metal &amp;c. inſues, it is not barely or
the account of the ſuppoſed Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
betwixt the Salts, but becauſe
the cauſes of that ſeeming Antipathy
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60281:256"/>
do likewiſe upon a Mechanical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
diſpoſe the Corpuſcles of the
confounded liquors ſo to cohere, as to
be too unwieldy for the fluid part.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="6" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
                  <p>ANother way, whereby the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
particles of a Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
may be rendred unfit to ſuſtain
the diſſolved body, is to preſent them
another that they can more eaſily
work on.</p>
                  <p>A notable Experiment of this you
have in the common practice of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finers,</hi>
who, to recover the Silver out
of Lace and other ſuch mixtures
wherein it <hi>abounds,</hi> uſe to diſſolve
it in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and then in the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
leave Copper plates for a whole
night (or many hours.) But if you
have a mind to ſee the Experiment
without waiting ſo long, you may
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60281:257"/>
imploy the way, whereby I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
quickly diſpatched it. As ſoon
then as I have diſſolved a convenient
quantity, which needs not be a great
one, of Silver in cleanſed <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi>
I add twenty or twenty five times as
much of either diſtilled water or rain
water; (for though common water
will ſometimes do well, yet it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
does ſo well;) and then into
the clear ſolution I hang by a ſtring a
clean piece of Copper, which will be
preſently covered with little ſhining
plates almoſt like ſcales of fiſh, which
one may eaſily ſhake off and make
room for more. And this may illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
what we formerly mentioned
about the ſubſiding of metalline cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles,
when they convene in liquors,
wherein, whilſt they were diſperſed
in very minute parts, they ſwam
freely. For in this operation the
little ſcales of Silver ſeemed to be
purely metalline, and there is no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Precipitant, as Salt of Tartar or
of Urine, imployed to make them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60281:257"/>
ſubſide. Upon the ſame ground, Gold
and Silver diſſolved in their proper
Menſtruums may be precipitated
with running Mercury; and if a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of blew Vitriol (ſuch as the
Roman, Eaſt-Indian, or other of the
like colours) be made in water, a
clean plate of Steel or Iron being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed
in it, will preſently be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid
with a very thin caſe of Copper-which
after a while will grow thick,
er; but does not adhere to the iron
ſo looſely as to be ſhaken off, as the
Precipitated ſilver newly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
may be from the Copper-plates
whereto it adheres. And that in
theſe operations the ſaline particles
may really quit the diſſolved body,
and work upon the Precipitant,
may appear by the lately mentioned
practice of <hi>Refiners,</hi> where the <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi>
that forſakes the particles of
the ſilver, falls a working upon the
copper-plates imployed about the
Precipitation, and diſſolves ſo much
of them as to acquire the greeniſh
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60281:258"/>
blew colour of a good ſolution of
that metal. And the Copper we
can eaſily again without ſalts obtain
by Precipitation out of that liquor
with iron, and that too, remaining
diſſolved in its place, we can preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate
with the taſtleſs powder of
another Mineral.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe two ways of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Menſtruum, namely, by
mortifying its ſaline particles or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
them to work on other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and to forſake thoſe they firſt
diſſolved, there are ſome other ways
of weakning the Menſtruum.</p>
                  <p>A Third way of effecting this, is by
leſſening or diſturbing the agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſolvent. And indeed ſince
we find by experience, that ſome
liquors when they are heated, will
either diſſolve ſome bodies they
would not diſſolve at all when they
were cold, or diſſolve them more
powerfully or copiouſly when hot
than cold; 'tis not unreaſonable to
ſuppoſe, that what conſiderably leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60281:258"/>
that agitation of the parts of the
Menſtruum that is neceſſary to the
keeping the diſſolved body in the
ſtate of fluidity, ſhould occaſion the
falling of it again to the bottom. In
ſlow operations I could give divers
examples of the precipitating power
of Cold; there being divers ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and particularly that of Amber-greece,
that I had kept fluid all the
Summer, which in the Winter would
ſubſide. And the like may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
obſerved in far leſs time in
the ſolutions of Brimſtone made in
certain oleaginous Menſtruums; and I
have now &amp; then had ſome ſolutions,
and particularly one of <hi>Benzoin</hi> made
in ſpirit of wine, that would ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
me with the turbidneſs (which
begins the ſtate of Precipitation) it
would acquire upon a ſudden change
of the weather towards Cold, though
it were not in the winter ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Another way of weakening the
Menſtruum and ſo cauſing the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation
of a body diſſolved in it, is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60281:259"/>
the diluting or leſſening the tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it, whether that tenacity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from viſcoſity or the compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
number and conſtipation of the
parts.</p>
                  <p>Of this we have an inſtance in the
Magiſteries (as many Chymiſts are
pleaſed to call them) of Jalap, Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoin,
and of divers others, Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and Gummous bodies diſſolved
in ſpirit of wine. For by the affuſion
of common water, the Menſtruum
being too much diluted is not able
to keep thoſe particles in the ſtate of
fluidity, but muſt ſuffer them to <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi>
(as they uſually do in the form
of white powder,) or, (as it may
happen ſometimes,) make ſome parts
emerge. Examples alſo of this kind
are afforded us by the common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
of <hi>Mercurius Vitae.</hi> For
though in oil of Autimony, made by
the Rectification of the butter, the
ſaline particles are ſo numerous and
keep ſo cloſe to one another, that
they are able to ſuſtain the Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60281:259"/>
Corpuſcles they carried over
with them in Diſtillation, and keep
them together with themſelves in
the form of a liquor; yet when by
the copious affuſion of the water,
thoſe ſuſtaining particles are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and removed to a diſtance from
each other, the Antimonial Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
and the Mercurial (if any ſuch
there were,) being of a ponderous
nature, will eaſily ſubſide into that
Emetic powder, which, (when well
waſhed) the Chymiſts flatteringly
enough call <hi>Mercurius Vitae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here I muſt interpoſe an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement,
which will help to ſhew
us, how much Precipitations depend
upon the Mechanical contextures of
bodies. For, though not only in
the newly recited examples, but in
divers others, the affuſion of water,
by diluting the ſalts and weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Menſtruum, makes the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
or other diſſolved body fall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitately
to the bottom; yet if the
ſaline particles of the ſolvent, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60281:260"/>
thoſe of the body be fitted for ſo
ſtrict an union, that the Corpuſcles
reſulting from their Coalitions will
not ſo eaſily be ſeparated by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of water, as ſuffer themſelves
to be carried up and down with
them, whether becauſe of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteneſs
of theſe compounded Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles,
or becauſe of ſome congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
betwixt them and thoſe of the
water; they will not be precipitated
out of the weakened ſolution, but
ſtill continue a part of it; as I have
tryed partly with ſome ſolution of
Silver and Gold, made in acid Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums,
but much more ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in ſolutions of Copper, made in
the urinous ſpirit of Sal Armoniac.
For, though that blew ſolution were
diluted with many thouſand times as
much diſtilled water as the diſſolved
metal weighed; yet its ſwimming
Corpuſcles did by their colour mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
appear to be diſperſed through
the whole liquor.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
                  <p>BUT, to proſecute our former
diſcourſe, which we broke off
after the mention of <hi>Mercurius Vitae,</hi>
'twill now be ſeaſonable to add, that
we have made divers other Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
by the bare affuſion of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
out of ſolutions, and ſometimes
out of diſtilled liquors; which, for
brevity ſake, I here omit, that I may
haſten to the laſt way I ſhall now
ſtay to mention.</p>
                  <p>Another way then, whereby Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitations
of bodies may be produced
by debilitating the Menſtruum they
ſwim in, is by leſſening the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Solvent to the <hi>Solutum,</hi>
without any evaporation of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.
Theſe laſt words I add, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that, when there is an
obſtruction or any other expulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Menſtruum by heat, if
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60281:261"/>
it be total, 'tis called Exſiccation, as
when dry ſalt of Tartar is obtained
from the filtrated <hi>Lixivium</hi> of the
calcined Tartar; and though the
evaporation be not total, yet
the effects of it are not wont to
be reckoned amongſt Precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And although the way, I am
about to propoſe, if it be attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſidered, has much affinity with
the foregoing, and the <hi>Phaenomena</hi>
may perhaps in ſome ſort be reduced
to them; yet the inſtances that I
ſhall name, having not, I know,
been thought of by others, and being
ſuch as every one would not deduce
from what I have been mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
I ſhall add a word of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
I had to make the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
as well as of the ſucceſs of
them.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering then, that Water will
not diſſolve Salts indefinitely, but
when it has received its due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
'twill then diſſolve no more,
but, if they be put into it, let them
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60281:261"/>
fall to the ground and continue
undiſſolved; and that if when
water is ſatiated, any of the liquor
be evaporated or otherwiſe waſted,
it will in proportion let fall the ſalt
it had already taken up; I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that if I could mingle with
water any liquor, with which its
particles would more readily aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
than with thoſe of Salt, the
depriving the ſolution of ſo many
of its aqueous particles would be
equivalent to the evaporation of as
much water or thereabouts, as they,
by being united, could compoſe.
Wherefore making a <hi>lixivium</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled
water or clean rain-water,
and of Salt of Tartar ſo ſtrong, that
if a grain more were caſt in it, it
would lie undiſſolved at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom;
I put a quantity of this fiery
Lixivium into a ſlender cylindrical
veſſel, till it had therein reached
ſuch a height as I thought fit; then
taking as much as I thought ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
of ſtrong ſpirit of wine, that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60281:262"/>
would burn every drop away, that
ſo it might have no flegm nor wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of its own, I poured this upon
the ſaline ſolution, and ſhaking the
liquors pretty well together to
bring them to mix as well as I could,
I laid the tube in a quiet place,
and afterwards found, as I expected,
that there was a pretty quantity of
white ſalt of Tartar fallen to the
bottom of the veſſel, which ſalt had
been meerly forſaken by the aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
particles that ſuſtained it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but forſook it to paſs into the
ſpirit of wine, wherewith they were
more diſpoſed to aſſociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
which I concluded, becauſe
having, before I poured on this laſt
named liquor, made a mark on the
glaſs to ſhew how far the <hi>lixivium</hi>
reached, I found (what I looked
for) that after the Precipitation, the
<hi>Lixivium,</hi> that remained yet ſtrong
enough to continue unmixed with
the incumbent ſpirit, had its ſurface
not where the mark ſhewed it had
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60281:262"/>
been before, but a conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
beneath it, the ſpirit of wine
having gained in extent what it loſt
in ſtrength by receiving ſo many
aqueous particles into it. I choſe to
make this tryal rather with a <hi>Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium</hi>
of Salt of Tartar than with
oyl of Tartar <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in this laſt named liquor
the aqueous and ſaline particles are
more cloſely combined and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
more difficult to be ſeparated
than I thought they would be in a
<hi>Lixivium</hi> haſtily made, though very
ſtrong. And though by much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
I have ſometimes obtained
ſome ſalt of Tartar from the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
oil; yet the experiment
ſucceeded nothing near ſo well
with that liquor as with a <hi>Lixivium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I made alſo the like tryal with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
dephlegmed ſpirit of wine,
and as ſtrong a Brine as I could
make of common ſalt diſſolved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
heat in common water; and I
thereby obtained no deſpicable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of finely figured ſalt, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60281:263"/>
was let fall to the bottom. But this
experiment, to be ſuccesful, requires
greater care in him that makes it,
than the former needs.</p>
                  <p>To confirm, and ſomewhat to
vary this way of Precipitation, I
ſhall add, that having made a clear
ſolution of choice Gum Arabic in
common water, and poured upon it
a little high rectified ſpirit of wine,
on this occaſion there was alſo
made, and that in a trice, a copious
precipitation of a light and purely
white ſubſtance not unpleaſant to
behold. And for further Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I diſſolved a full proportion of
Myrrhe in fair water, and into the
filtrated ſolution, which was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent,
but of a high brown colour,
I dropt a large proportion (which
Circumſtance is not to be omitted)
of carefully dephlegm'd ſpirit of
wine, which according to expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made a copious Precipitate of
the Gum. And theſe inſtances I
the rather ſet down in this place,
becauſe they ſeem to ſhow, that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60281:263"/>
ſimple water is a real Menſtruum,
which may have its diſſolving and
ſuſtaining virtue weakened by the
acceſſion of Liquors, that are not
doubted to be much ſtronger than it.</p>
                  <p>By ſpecifying the hitherto menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
wayes, whereby Precipitations
may be Mechanically performed
and accounted for, I would by no
means be thought to deny, that there
may be ſome omitted here, which
either others that ſhall conſider
the matter with more attention,
or I my ſelf, if I ſhall have leiſure to
do it, may think on. For I propoſe
theſe but as the chief that occurr to
my preſent thoughts; and I forbear
to add more inſtances to exemplifie
them, becauſe I would not injure
ſome of my other papers, that have
a greater right to thoſe Inſtances.
Only this I ſhall note in general, that
the Doctrine and Hiſtory of Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitations,
if well delivered, will be
a thing of more extent and moment
than ſeems hitherto to have been
imagined; ſince <hi>not only</hi> ſeveral of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60281:264"/>
the changes in the blood and other
liquors and juices of the humane
body may thereby be the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood;
and they prevented, or
their ill conſequences remedied;
<hi>but</hi> in the practical part of Minera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
divers uſefull things may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be performed by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of ſuch a Doctrine and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
To keep which conjecture
from ſeeming extravagant, I ſhall
only here intimate, that 'tis not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in bodies that are naturally
or permanently liquid, but in thoſe
ſolid and ponderous bodies, that are
for a ſhort time made ſo by the
violence of the fire, that many of
the things ſuggeſted by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
may have place. For whilſt
divers of thoſe Bodies are in fuſion,
they may be treated as liquors; and
metalls, and perhaps other hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous
bodies may be obtained
from them by fit though dry Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitants,

ABOUT THE

OF
MAGNETICAL
QUALITIES.</head>
                  <p>THough the vertues of the
<hi>Loadſtone</hi> be none of the
leaſt famous of <hi>Occult</hi> Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and are perhaps the moſt juſtly
admired; yet I ſhall venture to offer
ſomething to make it probable, that

to remove that general and

from ſo much as thinking of any

which is a belief, that theſe Qualities
do immediately flow from the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial

to our underſtandings.<label type="milestone">

for my part, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
I ſee no neceſſity
of admitting this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
for I ſee, that a piece of
Steel fitly ſhaped and well excited,
will, like a Loadſtone, have its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
Poles, and with them
point at the North and South; it will
draw other pieces of Iron and Steel
to it, and which is more, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to them the ſame kind, though
not degree, of attractive and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
vertue it had it ſelf, and will
poſſeſs theſe faculties not as light
and tranſient impreſſions, but as ſuch
ſetled and durable Powers that it
may retain them for many years, if
the Loadſtone, to which it has been
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60281:267"/>
duly applied, were vigorous enough:
Of which ſort I remember I have
ſeen one (and made ſome tryals
with it) that yielded an income to
the owner, who received money
from Navigators and others for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
them to touch their needles,
ſwords, knives &amp;c. at his excellent
Magnet. Now, in a piece of ſteel
or iron thus excited, 'tis plain, that
the Magnetic operations may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
performed for whole years
by a body, to which the form of a
Loadſtone does not belong, ſince,
as it had its own form before, ſo it
retains the ſame ſtill, continuing as
malleable, fuſible &amp;c. as an ordinary
piece of the ſame metal unexcited:
ſo that, if there be introduced a fit
diſpoſition into the internal parts of
the metal by the action of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
the metal, continuing of the
ſame <hi>Species</hi> it was before, will need
nothing ſave the continuance of that
acquired diſpoſition to be capable
of performing Magnetical Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and if this diſpoſition or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

particularly declared.</p>
                     <p>And I will confirm what I have
been ſaying with an experiment that
you do not perhaps expect; namely,
that though it be generally taken
for granted (without being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
that I know of by any man)
that, in a ſound Loadſtone, that has
never been injured by the fire, not
only the attractive Power, but the
particular Vertue that it has to
point conſtantly, when left to it
ſelf, with one of its determinate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
to one determinate pole,
flowes immediately from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
or at leaſt eſſential Form;
yet this Form remaining undeſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Fire, the Poles may be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and that with eaſe and ſpeed.
For among my notes about Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical

                     <p>TO ſhew that the virtue that a
Loadſtone hath by this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Pole or Extream to attract,
for example, the South-end of a poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

extream or Pole the North-end of
the ſame needle, I made among other
tryals the following Experiment.</p>
                     <p>Taking a very ſmall fragment of
a Loadſtone, I found, agreeably to
my conjecture, that by applying
ſometimes one Pole, ſometimes the
other, to that pole of (a ſmall but) a
very vigorous Loadſtone that was
fit for my purpoſe, I could at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
in a few minutes, change the
Poles of the little fragment, as I
tryed by its operations upon a needle
freely poiſed; though by applying
a fragment a pretty deal bigger, (for
in it ſelf it appeared very ſmall,) I
was not able in far more hours than
I employed minutes before, to make
any ſenſible change of the Poles.</p>

This ſhort Memorial being added
to the preceding part of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
will, I hope, ſatisfie you, that
how unanimouſly ſo ever men have
deduced all magnetick operations
from the form of the Loadſtone;
yet ſome internal change of pores
or ſome other Mechanical alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or inward diſpoſition, either of
the excited Iron or of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
it ſelf, may ſuffice to make a
body capable or uncapable of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing
ſome determinate magnetical
operations; which may invite you
to caſt a more unprejudiced eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe few particulars, I ſhall now
ſubjoin to make it probable, that
even Magnetical Qualities may be
Mechanically produced or altered.</p>

                     <p>WE elſewhere obſerve, which
perhaps you alſo may have
done, that the Iron bars of windows,
by having ſtood very long in an
erected poſture, may at length grow
Magnetical, ſo that, if you apply the
North point of a poiſed and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Needle to the bottom of the
Bar, it will drive it away, &amp; attract
the Southern; and if you raiſe the
magnetick needle to the upper part
of the Bar, and apply it as before,
this will draw the Northern extream,
which the other end of the bar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled;
probably becauſe, as 'tis
elſewhere declared, the bar is in tract
of time, by the continual action of
the Magnetical <hi>effuvia</hi> of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raqueous
Globe, turned into a kind
of Magnet, whoſe lower end becomes
the North-pole of it, and the other
the Southern. Therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Magnetical Laws, the
former muſt expel the Northern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream

                     <head>EXPER. VIII.</head>
                     <p>I Have found indeed, and I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
not but other obſervers
may have done ſo too, that, if a bar
of Iron, that has not ſtood long in
an erected poſture, be but held per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular,
the forementioned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
will ſucceed, (probably up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch an account as that I have
lately intimated:) But then this vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
diſplayed by the extreams of
the bar of Iron, will not be at all
permanent, but ſo tranſient, that,
if the bar be but inverted and held
again upright, that end which juſt
before was the uppermoſt, and drew
the north-end of the needle, will
now, being lowermoſt, drive it away,
which, as was lately obſerved, will
not happen to a bar which has been
ſome years or other competent time
kept in the ſame Poſition. So that,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60281:271"/>
ſince length of time is requiſite to
make the verticity of a bar of Iron
ſo durable &amp; conſtant, that the ſame
extream will have the ſame virtues in
reference to the Magnetical needle,
whether you make it the upper end
or the lower end of the bar, it ſeems
not improbable to me, that by
length of time the whole Magnetick
virtue of this Iron may be increaſed,
and conſequently ſome degree of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
acquired.</p>
                     <p>And by this Conſideration I ſhall
endeavour to explicate that ſtrange
thing, that is reported by ſome
Moderns to have happened in <hi>Italy,</hi>
where a bar of Iron is affirmed to
have been converted into a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
whereof a piece was kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other rarities in the curious
<hi>Aldrovandus</hi> his <hi>Muſaeum Metallicum.</hi>
For conſidering the greatneſs of its
Specific Gravity, the malleableneſs
and other properties, wherein Iron
differs from Loadſtone, I cannot eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe, that, by ſuch a way as is
mentioned, a metal ſhould be turned
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60281:272"/>
into a ſtone. And therefore, having
conſulted the book it ſelf, whence
this Relation was borrowed, I found
the ſtory imperfectly enough delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
The chiefeſt and cleareſt thing
in it being, that at the top of the
Church of <hi>Arimini</hi> a great iron-bar,
that was placed there to ſupport a
Croſs of an hundred pound weight,
was at length turned into a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.
But whether the reality of
this tranſmutation was examined,
and how it appeared that the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Loadſtone preſented to
<hi>Aldrovandus</hi> was taken from that
bar of Iron, I am not fully ſatisfied
by that Narrative. Therefore, when
I remember the great reſemblance I
have ſometimes ſeen in colour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
other manifeſt Qualities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
ſome Loadſtones and ſome
courſe or almoſt ruſty Iron, I am
tempted to Conjecture, that thoſe
that obſerved this Iron-bar when
broken to have acquired a ſtrong
Magnetical virtue, which they
dreamed not that tract of time might
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60281:272"/>
communicate to it, might eaſily be
perſwaded, by this virtue and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of colour, that the Iron
was turned into Loadſtone: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
they being prepoſſeſs'd with
that <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Maxim, whence our
Author would explain this ſtrange
<hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> that <hi>inter Symbolum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentia
facilis eſt tranſmutatio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, leaving this as a bare conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
we may take notice, that what
virtue an oblong piece of Iron may
need a long tract of time to acquire,
by the help onely of its poſition, may
be imparted to it in a very ſhort time,
by the intervention of ſuch a nimble
agent, as the fire. As may be often,
though not always,
obſerved in Tongs,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">EXPER. </seg>IX</label>
and ſuch like Iron
Utenſils, that, having been ignited,
have been ſet to cool, leaning againſt
ſome wall or other prop, that kept
them in an erected poſture, which
makes it probable that the great
commotion of the parts, made by the
vehement heat of the fire, diſpoſed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60281:273"/>
the Iron, whilſt it was yet ſoft, and
had its pores more lax, and parts
more pliable, diſpoſed it, I ſay, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
much quicker impreſſions from
the Magnetical <hi>effluvia</hi> of the Earth,
than it would have done, if it had
ſtill been cold.<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">EXPER. </seg>X</label>
And 'tis very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
to our
preſent purpoſe, what differing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
are produced by the operation
of the fire, upon two Magnetick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
according to their reſpective
conſtitutions. For, by keeping a
Loadſtone red-hot, though you cool
it afterwards in a perpendicular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
you may deprive it of its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
power of manifeſtly attracting:
But a bar of Iron being ignited, and
ſet to cool perpendicularly, does
thereby acquire a manifeſt verticity.
Of which differing events I muſt not
now ſtay to inquire, whether or no
the true reaſon be, That the peculiar
Texture or internal conſtitution that
makes a Loadſtone ſomewhat more
than an ordinary Ore of Iron, (which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60281:273"/>
metal, as far as I have tried, is the
uſual ingredient of Loadſtones) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpoiled by the violence of the fire,
this rude Agent leaves it in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of common Iron, or perhaps
of ignited Iron-ore: whereas the
fire does ſoften the Iron it ſelf
(which is a metal not an Ore) agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
its parts, and making them the
more flexible, and by relaxing its
pores, diſpoſes it to be eaſily and
plentifully pervaded by the Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
ſteams of the Earth, from which
it may not improbably be thought to
receive the verticity it acquires; and
this the rather, becauſe, as I have
often tryed, and
elſewhere mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">EXPER. </seg>XI</label>
if an oblong
Loadſtone, once ſpoil'd by the fire,
be thorowly ignited and cooled ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perpendicularly, or lying hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontally
North and South, it will, as
well as a piece of Iron handled after
the ſame manner, be made to acquire
new poles, or change the old ones,
as the skilful experimenter pleaſes.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60281:274"/>
But whatever be the true cauſe of
the diſparity of the fires operation
upon a ſound Loadſtone and a bar of
Iron, the effect ſeems to ſtrengthen
our conjecture, That Magnetical o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
may much depend upon
Mechanical Principles. And I hope
you will find further probability ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to it, by ſome Phaenomena reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

For it has been ſometimes obſerved, that
the bare continuance of a Loadſtone it ſelf
in a contrary poſition to that, which,
when freely placed, it ſeems to effect, has
either corrupted or ſenſibly leſſened the
vertue of it. What I formerly obſerved
to this purpoſe. I elſewhere relate, and

very extraordinary, and which, whilſt it
was in an Artificers hand, was therefore
held at a high rate, I was careful, being
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60281:275"/>
by ſome occaſions call'd out of <hi>London,</hi> to
lock it up, with ſome other rarities, in a
Cabinet, whereof I took the key along
with me, and ſtill kept it in my own
Pocket. But my ſtay abroad proving much
longer than I expected, when, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>London,</hi> I had occaſion to make
uſe of this Loadſtone for an Experiment,
I found it indeed where I left it, but ſo
exceedingly decayed, as to its attractive
power, which I had formerly examin'd
by weight, by having lain almoſt a year in
an inconvenient poſture, that if it had not
been for the circumſtances newly related,
I ſhould have concluded that ſome body
had purpoſely got it out in my abſence,
and ſpoiled it by help of the fire, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
being ſo much impaired, that I cared
little to employ it any more about conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable

And this corruption of
the Magnetical vertue,
which may in tract of time be made in a
Loadſtone it ſelf, may in a trice be made
by the help of that Stone in an excited
Needle. For 'tis obſerv'd by Magnetical
Writers, and my own Trials purpoſely
made have aſſured me of it, that a well
pois'd Needle, being by the touch of a
good Loadſtone, excited and brought to
turn one of its ends to the North and the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60281:275"/>
other to the South, it may be a contrary
touch of the ſame Loadſtone be deprived
of the faculty it had of directing its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
extreams to determinate Poles.
Nay, by another touch (or the ſame, and
even without immediate Contact, if the
Magnet be vigorous enough) the Needle
may preſently have its direction ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
that the end, which formerly poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the North pole, ſhall now regard
the South, and the other end ſhall inſtead
of the Southern, reſpect the Northen pole.</p>

that the change of the Magnetiſm

                  <p>THat 'tis not neceſſary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Electrical Attraction
(which you know is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
liſted among Occult Qualities)
to be the effect of a naked and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Quality flowing immediately
from a Subſtantial Form; but that it
may rather be the effect of a Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Effluvium, iſſuing from, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to, the Electrical Body (and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60281:278"/>
perhaps in ſome caſes aſſiſted in its
Operation by the external air) ſeems
agreable to divers things that may
be obſerv'd in ſuch Bodies and their
manner of acting.</p>
                  <p>There are differing <hi>Hypotheſes</hi>
(and all of them Mechanical, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by the Moderns) to ſolve the
Phaenomena of Electrical Attraction.
Of theſe Opinions the Firſt is that
of the learned Jeſuite <hi>Cabaeus,</hi> who,
though a Peripatetick and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator
on <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> thinks the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of light Bodies by Jet, Amber,
&amp;c. may be accounted for, by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
that the ſteams that iſſue, or, if
I may ſo ſpeak, ſally, out of Amber,
when heated by rubbing, diſcuſs and
expell the neighbouring air; which
after it has deen driven off a little
way, makes as it were a ſmall whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,
becauſe of the reſiſtance it
finds from the remoter air, which
has not been wrought on by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectrical
Steams; and that theſe,
ſhrinking back ſwiftly enough to the
Amber, do in their returns bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60281:278"/>
with them ſuch light bodies as
they meet with in their way. On
occaſion of which <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> I ſhall
offer it to be conſider'd, Whether
by the gravity of the Atmoſpheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Air, ſurmounting the Specifick
Gravity of the little and rarifi'd At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere,
made about the Amber by
its emiſſions, and compriſing the
light Body faſten'd on by them, the
Attraction may not in divers caſes be
either cauſed or promoted.</p>
                  <p>Another <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is that propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by that Ingenious Gentleman Sir
<hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> and embraced by the
very Learned Dr. <hi>Browne,</hi> (who
ſeems to make our <hi>Gilbert</hi> himſelf to
have been of it) and divers other
ſagacious men. And according to
this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> the Amber, or other
Electrick, being chaf'd or heated,
is made to emit certain Rayes or
Files of unctuous Steams, which,
when they come to be a little cool'd
by the external air, are ſomewhat
condens'd, and having loſt of their
former agitation, ſhrink back to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60281:279"/>
body whence they ſallied out, and
carry with them thoſe light bodies,
that their further ends happen to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to, at the time of their Retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
As when a drop of Oyl or
Syrup hangs from the end of a ſmall
ſtick, if that be dextrouſly and
cautiouſly ſtruck, the viſcous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
will, by that impulſe, be
ſtretch'd out, and preſently retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
will bring along with it the duſt
or other light bodies that chanced
to ſtick to the remoter parts of
it.</p>
                  <p>And this way of explaining Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrical
Attractions is employ'd alſo
by the Learned <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> who
addes to it, that theſe Electrical Rays
(if they may be ſo call'd) being
emitted ſeveral ways, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
croſſing one another, get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the pores of the Straw, or other
light body to be attracted, and by
means of their Decuſſation take the
faſter hold of it, and have the greater
force to carry it along with them,
when they ſhrink back to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60281:279"/>
whence they were emitted.</p>
                  <p>A third <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> there is, which
was deviſed by the Acute <hi>Carteſius,</hi>
who diſlikes the Explications of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
chiefly becauſe he thinks them
not applicable to Glaſs, which he
ſuppoſes unfit to ſend forth <hi>Effluvia,</hi>
and which is yet an Electrical body;
and therefore attempts to account
for Electrical Attractions by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention
of certain particles,
ſhap'd almoſt like ſmall pieces of
Ribbond, which he ſuppoſes to be
form'd of this ſubtile matter har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
in the pores or creviſes of
Glaſs. But this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> though
ingenious in it ſelf, yet depending
upon the knowledge of divers of
his peculiar Principles, I cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly
propoſe it in few words,
and therefore ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
you to himſelf for
an account of it:<note place="margin">Princip. part 4. Art. 184.</note> which
I the leſs ſcruple to do, becauſe
though it be not unworthy of the
wonted Acuteneſs of the Authour,
yet he ſeems himſelf to doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60281:280"/>
it will reach all Electrical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and it ſeems to me, that the
reaſon why he rejects the way of
explicating Attraction by the Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the finer parts of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahent
(to which <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> if it
be rightly propoſed, I confeſs my
ſelf very inclinable) is grounded
upon a miſtake, which, though a
Philoſopher may, for want of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in that Particular, without
diſparagement fall into, is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
a miſtake. For whereas our
excellent Author ſays, that <hi>Electrical
Effluvia,</hi> ſuch as are ſuppoſed to be
emitted by Amber, Wax, &amp;c. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be imagin'd to proceed from
Glaſs, I grant the Suppoſition to
be plauſible, but cannot allow it to
be true. For as ſolid a body as Glaſs
is, yet if you but dextrouſly rub for
two or three minutes a couple of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Glaſs againſt one another, you
will find that Glaſs is not onely capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of emitting <hi>Effluvia,</hi> but ſuch
ones as to be odorous, and ſometimes
to be rankly ſtinking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60281:280"/>
But it is not neceſſary, that in this
Paper, where I pretend not to write
Diſcourſes but Notes, I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
all that has been, or I think
may be, ſaid for and againſt each of
the above-mentioned <hi>Hypotheſes;</hi>
ſince they all agree in what is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for my preſent purpoſe, namely,
that Electrical Attractions are not
the Effects of a meer Quality, but
of a Subſtantial Emanation from
the attracting Body: And 'tis plain,
that they all endeavour to ſolve the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> in a Mechanical way,
without recurring to Subſtantial
Forms, and inexplicable Qualities,
or ſo much as taking notice of the
Hypoſtatical Principles of the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.
Wherefore it may ſuffice in
this place, that I mention-ſome <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
that in general make it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that Amber, &amp;c. draws ſuch
light Bodies, as pieces of Straw, Hair,
and the like, by vertue of ſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
Affections either of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
or of the attracted Bodies,
or of both the one and the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60281:281"/>
1. The firſt and moſt general Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
is, That Electrical Bodies
draw not unleſs they be warm'd;
which Rule though I have now and
then found to admit of an Exception,
(whereof I elſewhere offer an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,)
yet, as to the generality of
common Electricks, it holds well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to give much countenance to
our Doctrine, which teaches the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Electrical Bodies to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by Corporeal Emanations.
For 'tis known, that Heat, by agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
the parts of a fit Body, ſolicites
it as it were to ſend forth its <hi>Effluvia,</hi>
as is obvious in odoriferous Gums
and Perfumes, which, being heated,
ſend forth their fragrant ſteams, both
further and more copiouſly than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
they would.</p>
                  <p>2. Next, it has been obſerv'd, that
Amber, &amp;c. warm'd by the fire, does
not attract ſo vigorouſly, as if it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
an equal degree of heat by
being chaf'd or rub'd: So that the
modification of motion in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
parts, and in the Emanations of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60281:281"/>
the Amber, may, as well as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of it, contribute to the Attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And my particular Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
incline me to adde, that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
may oftentimes be much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted,
by employing both theſe
ways ſucceſſively; as I thought I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
found when I firſt warm'd
the Amber at the fire, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after chaf'd it a little upon a piece
of cloth. For then a very few rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings
ſeem'd to excite it more than
many more would otherwiſe have
done: As if the heat of the fire
had put the parts into a general, but
confus'd, agitation; to which 'twas
eaſie for the ſubſequent Attrition
(or Reciprocation of Preſſure) to
give a convenient modification in a
Body whoſe Texture diſpoſes it to
become vigorouſly Electrical.</p>
                  <p>3. Another Obſervation that is
made about theſe Bodies, is, That
they require Terſion as well as At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition;
and though I doubt whether
the Rule be infallible, yet I deny
not but that weaker Electricks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60281:282"/>
to be as well wip'd as chaf'd;
and even good ones will have their
Operation promoted by the ſame
means. And this is very agreeable
to our Doctrine, ſince Terſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that it is, as I have ſometimes
manifeſtly known it, a kind or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Attrition, frees the Surface
from thoſe adherences that might
choak the pores of the Amber, or
at leaſt hinder the emanation of the
ſteams to be ſo free and copious as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
it would be.</p>
                  <p>4. 'Tis likewiſe obſerv'd, That
whereas the Magnetical Steams are
ſo ſubtile, that they penetrate and
perform their Operation through
all kind of Mediums hitherto known
to us; Electrical Steams are like
thoſe of ſome odoriferous Bodies,
eaſily check'd in their progreſs, ſince
'tis affirm'd by Learned Writers, who
ſay they ſpeak upon particular Trial,

                     </gap> Operation of excited
Amber upon a Straw or Feather
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60281:282"/>
plac'd never ſo little beyond it.</p>
                  <p>5. It has been alſo obſerved, that
the effects of Electrical Attraction
are weaken'd if the air be thick and
cloudy; and eſpecially if the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind
blows: And that Electricks diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
their vertue more faintly by
night than by day, and more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
in clear weather, and when
the winds are Northerly. All which
the Learned <hi>Kircherus</hi> aſſerts himſelf
to have found true by experience;
inſomuch that thoſe bodies that are
but faintly drawn when the weather
is clear, will not, when 'tis thick
and cloudy, be at all moved.</p>
                  <p>6. We have alſo obſerved, That
divers Concretes, that are notably
Electrical, do abound in an effluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
matter (if I may ſo call it)
which is capable of being manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evaporated by heat and rubbing.
Thus we ſee, that moſt Reſinous
Gums, that draw light bodies, do
alſo, being moderately ſolicited by
heat, (whether this be excited by
the fire, or by Attrition or Contuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60281:283"/>
emit ſteams. And in pieces of
<hi>Sulphur</hi> conveniently ſhaped, I found
upon due Attrition a Sulphureous
ſtink. And that piece of Amber
which I moſt employ, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
large and very well poliſh'd,
will, being rub'd upon a piece of
woollen cloth, emit ſteams, which
the noſtrils themſelves may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
and they ſometimes ſeem to
me not unlike thoſe that I took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, when I kept in my mouth a
drop or two of the diluted Tincture
(or Solution of the finer parts) of
Amber made with Spirit of Wine,
or of Sal Armoniac.</p>
                  <p>7. It agrees very well with what
has been ſaid of the corporeal Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of Amber, that its attractive
power will continue ſome time after
it has been once excited. For the
Attrition having caus'd an inteſtine
commotion in the parts of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete,
the heat or warmth that is
thereby excited ought not to ceaſe,
as ſoon as ever the rubbing is over,
but to continue capable of emitting
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60281:283"/>
                     <hi>Effluvia</hi> for ſome time afterwards,
which will be longer or ſhorter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the goodneſs of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectric,
and the degree of the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
commotion: which joyn'd
together may ſometimes make the
effect conſiderable, inſomuch that
in a warm day, about noon, I did
with a certain body, not much, if at
all, bigger than a Pea, but very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
attractive, move to and fro
a Steel Needle freely poyſed, about
three minutes (or the twentieth
part of an hour) after I had left off
rubbing the Attrahent.</p>
                  <p>8. That it may not ſeem impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that Electrical <hi>Effluvia</hi> ſhould be
able to inſinuate themſelves into the
pores of many other bodies, I ſhall
adde, that I found them ſubtile e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to attract not onely Spirit of
Wine, but that fluid aggregate of
Corpuſcles we call Smoak. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
well lighted a Wax-taper, which
I preferr'd to a common Candle to
avoid the ſtink of the ſnuff, I blew
out the flame; and, when the ſmoak
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60281:284"/>
aſcended in a ſlender ſtream, held, at
a convenient diſtance from it, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
piece of Amber or a chafed
Diamond, which would manifeſtly
make the aſcending ſmoak deviate
from its former line, and turn aſide,
to beat, as it were, againſt the
Electric, which, if it were vigorous,
would act at a conſiderable diſtance,
and ſeemed to ſmoak for a pretty
while together.</p>
                  <p>9. That 'tis not in any peculiar
Sympathy between an Electric and
a body whereon it operates, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectrical
Attraction depends, ſeems
the more probale, becauſe Amber,
for inſtance, does not attract onely
one determinate ſort of bodies, as
the Loadſtone does Iron, and thoſe
bodies wherein it abounds; but as far
as I have yet tried, it draws indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
all bodies whatſoever, being
plac'd within a due diſtance from it,
(as my choiceſt piece of Amber
draws not onely Sand and Mineral
Powders, but Filings of Steel and
Copper, and beaten Gold it ſelf)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60281:284"/>
provided they be minute or light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
except perhaps it be fire:
I employ the word <hi>perhaps,</hi> becauſe
I am not yet ſo clear in this point.
For having applied a ſtrong Electric
at a convenient diſtance to ſmall
fragments of ignited matter, they
were readily enough attracted, and
ſhin'd, whilſt they were ſticking to
the body that had drawn them: But
when I look'd attentively upon
them, I found the ſhining ſparks to
be, as it were, cloath'd with light
aſhes, which, in ſpite of my dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
had been already form'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the attracted Corpuſcles, upon
the expiring of a good part of the
fire; ſo that it remain'd ſomewhat
doubtful to me, whether the ignited
Corpuſcles, whilſt they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
ſuch, were attracted; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the immediate objects of the
Attraction were not the new form'd
aſhes, which carried up with them
thoſe yet unextinguiſhed parts of
fire, that chanc'd to be lodg'd in them.
But, as for flame, our Countreyman
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60281:285"/>
                     <hi>Gilbert</hi> delivers as his Experiment,
That an Electric, though duly exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and applied, will not move the
flame of the ſlendereſt Candle.
Which ſome will think not ſo eaſie
to be well tried with common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectricks,
as Amber, hard Wax, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
and the like unctuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes,
that very eaſily take fire:
Therefore I choſe to make my Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
with a rough Diamond extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
attractive, which I could,
without injuring it, hold as near as
I pleas'd to the flame of a Candle or
Taper; and though I was not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
that it did either attract the flame,
as it viſibly did the ſmoak, or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
agitate it; yet granting that
<hi>Gilbert</hi>'s Aſſertion will conſtantly
hold true, and ſo, that flame is to be
excepted from the general Rule, yet
this exception may well comport
with the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> hitherto counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd,
ſince it may be ſaid, as 'tis,
if I miſtake not, by <hi>Kirkerus,</hi> that
the heat of the flame diſſipates the
<hi>Effluvia,</hi> by whoſe means the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60281:285"/>
ſhould be perform'd. To
which I ſhall adde, that poſſibly the
Celerity of the motion of the Flame
upwards, may render it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
for the Electrical Emanations
to divert the Flame from its Courſe.</p>
                  <p>10. We have found by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That a vigorous and well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
piece of Amber will draw, not
onely the powder of Amber, but
leſs minute fragments of it. And as
in many caſes one contrary directs to
another, ſo this Trial ſuggeſted a
further, which, in caſe of good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
would probably argue, that in
Electrical Attraction not onely <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
are emitted by the Electrical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but theſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> faſten upon
the body to be drawn, and that in
ſuch a way, that the intervening viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous
ſtrings, which may be ſuppoſed
to be made up of thoſe cohering <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia,</hi>
are, when their agitation cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
contracted or made to ſhrink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
towards both ends, almoſt as a
highly ſtretch'd Lute-ſtring does
when 'tis permitted to retreat into
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60281:286"/>
ſhorter Dimenſions. But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
it ſelf was much more eaſie
to be made than the Experiment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to examine it. For we found
it no eaſie matter to ſuſpend an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectric,
great and vigorous enough, in
ſuch a manner, that it might, whilſt
ſuſpended, be excited, and be ſo
nicely poiſed, that ſo faint a force as
that wherewith it attracts light bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
ſhould be able to procure a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Motion to the whole Body it ſelf.
But after ſome fruitleſs attempts
with other Electricks, I had recourſe
to the very vigorous piece of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
Amber, formerly mention'd,
and when we had with the help of a
little Wax ſuſpended it by a ſilken
thread, we chafed very well one of
the blunt edges of it upon a kind of
large Pin-cuſhion cover'd with a
courſe and black woollen ſtuff, and
then brought the Electric, as ſoon as
we could, to ſettle notwithſtanding
its hanging freely at the bottom of
the ſtring. This courſe of rubbing
on the edge of the Amber we pitch'd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60281:286"/>
upon for more than one reaſon; for
if we had chafed the flat ſide, the
Amber could not have approached
the body it had been rub'd on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making a change of place in the
whole Electric, and, which is worſe,
without making it move (contrary
to the nature of heavy bodies)
ſomewhat upwards; whereas the
Amber having, by reaſon of its ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion,
its parts counterpoiſed by
one another; to make the excited
edge approach to another body, that
edge needed not at all aſcend, but
onely be moved horizontally, to
which way of moving the gravity of
the Electric (which the ſtring kept
from moving downwards) could be
but little or no hinderance. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably
to this we found, that if, as
ſoon as the ſuſpended and well
rubb'd Electric was brought to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
freely, we applied to the chafed
edge, but without touching it, the
lately mention'd Cuſhion, which, by
reaſon of its rough <hi>Superficies</hi> and
poroſity, was fit for the Electrical
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60281:287"/>
                     <hi>Effluvia</hi> to faſten upon, the edge
would manifeſtly be drawn aſide by
the Cuſhion ſteadily held, and if
this were ſlowly removed, would
follow it a good way; and when
this body no longer detain'd it,
would return to the poſture wherein
it had ſettled before. And this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of approaching the Cuſhion by
vertue of the operation of its own
ſteams, was ſo durable in our vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
piece of Amber, that by once
chafing it, I was able to make it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Cuſhion no leſs than ten or
eleven times. Whether from ſuch
Experiments one may argue, that 'tis
but, as 'twere, by accident that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
attracts another body, and not
this the Amber; and whether theſe
ought to make us queſtion, if Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctricks
may with ſo much propriety,
as has been hitherto generally ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
be ſaid to <hi>Attract,</hi> are doubts
that my Deſign does not here oblige
me to examine.</p>

apply themſelves to it, as Hair is
wont to do to Amber or Jet exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by rubbing. Of this I had a
Proof in ſuch Locks worn by two
very Fair Ladies that you know.
For at ſome times I obſerved, that
they could not keep their Locks
from flying to their Cheeks, and
(though neither of them made any
uſe, or had any need of Painting)
from ſticking there. When one of
theſe Beauties firſt ſhew'd me this
Experiment, I turn'd it into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental
Raillery, as ſuſpecting
there might be ſome trick in it,
though I after ſaw the ſame thing
happen to the others Locks too. But
as ſhe is no ordinary <hi>Virtuoſa,</hi> ſhe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60281:291"/>
ingeniouſly remov'd my ſuſpicions,
and (as I requeſted) gave me leave to
ſatisfie my ſelf further, by deſiring her
to hold her warm hand at a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
diſtance from one of thoſe Locks
taken off and held in the air. For as
ſoon as ſhe did this, the lower end
of the Lock, which was free, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it ſelf preſently to her hand:

ſo great a multitude of Hair
would not have been eaſily attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by an ordinary Electrical Body,
that had not been conſiderably

This repeated Obſervation put me
upon inquiring among ſome other

about the Production of <hi>Electrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
having a deſire to try, whether in the
Attractions made by Amber, the motions
excited by the air had a conſiderable Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
or whether the Effect were not due
rather to the Emiſſion and Retraction of
Effluvia, which being of a viſcous nature
may conſiſt of Particles either branch'd or

Coheſion, and capable of being ſtretch'd,
and of ſhrinking again, as Leather Thongs
are: To examine this, I ſay, I thought
the fitteſt way, if 'twere practicable,
would be, to try, whether Amber would
draw a light Body in a Glaſs whence the
air was pumpt out. And <hi>though</hi> the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of this ſeem'd very difficult to make,
and we were ſomewhat diſcouraged by
our firſt attempt, wherein the weight
of the ambient air broke our Receiver,
which chanced to prove too weak, when
the internal air had been with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
diligence pumpt out; <hi>yet</hi> having a
vigorous piece of Amber, which I had
caus'd to be purpoſely turn'd and poliſh'd
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60281:292"/>
for Electrical Experiments, I afterwards
repeated the Trial, and found, that in
warm Weather it would retain a manifeſt
power of attracting for ſeveral minutes
(for it ſtirred a pois'd Needle after above
1/4 of an hour) after we had done rubbing
it. Upon which encouragement we ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
it, being firſt well chafed, in a
Glaſs Receiver that was not great, juſt over
a light Body; and making haſte with our

came very near the Straw or Feather, and
perceived, as we expected, that in ſome

                     <p>I Took then a large and vigorous
piece of Amber conveniently ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for my purpoſe, and a downy
feather, ſuch as grows upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
not Wings or Tails of a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
large Chicken: Then having
moderately excited the Electrick, I
held the Amber ſo near it, that the
neighbouring part of the feather was
drawn by it and ſtuck faſt to it; but
the remoter parts continued in their
former poſture. This done, I apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my fore-finger to theſe erected
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60281:293"/>
downy feathers, and immediately, as
I expected, they left their preceeding
poſture, and applied themſelves to it
as if it had been an Electrical Body.
And whether I offered to them my
nail, or the pulpy part of my finger,
or held my finger towards the right
hand or the left, or directly over, theſe
downy feathers that were near the
little Quill did nimbly, and, for ought
appear'd, equally turn themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it, and faſten themſelves to it.
And to ſhew that the ſtreams that iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
out of ſo warm a Body as my
finger were not neceſſary to attract
(as men ſpeak) the abovementioned
feathers, inſtead of my finger, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to them, after the ſame manner,
a little Cylindrical Inſtrument of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
to which they bowed and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened
themſelves as they had done
to my finger, though the tip of this
Inſtrument were preſented to them
in ſeveral poſtures. The like ſucceſs
I had with the end of an Iron Key,
and the like alſo with a cold piece of
poliſh'd black Marble; and ſometimes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60281:293"/>
the feathers did ſo readily and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
faſten themſelves to theſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
and unexcited Bodies, that I
have been able (though not eaſily)
to make one of them draw the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>But it is diligently to be obſerv'd,
that this unuſual attraction happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
onely whilſt the electrical opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the excited Amber continued
ſtrong enough to ſuſtain the feathers.
For afterwards, neither the approach
of my finger, nor that of the other
bodies, would make the downy fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
change their poſture. Yet as
ſoon as ever the Amber was by a
light affriction excited again, the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would be diſpoſed to apply it
ſelf again to the abovementioned
Bodies.</p>
                     <p>And leſt there ſhould be any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity

I ſhall add, that I found uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
enough in the ſucceſs, when,
in the place of Amber, I ſubſtituted
another Electrick, and particularly a
ſmooth maſs of melted Brimſtone.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> I thought
fit to mention at preſent of this unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
way of drawing light bodies, and
with this Experiment I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
my Notes about Electricity, but
that I think it will not be amiſs before
I take leave of this Subject, to give
this Advertiſement, That the event
of Electrical Experiments is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſo certain as that of many others,
being ſometimes much varied by
ſeemingly ſlight circumſtances, and
now and then by ſome that are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
over-look'd. This Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may receive credit from ſome of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60281:294"/>
the particulars above recited (eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the intereſt of the weather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in
Electrical <hi>Phaenomena.</hi>) But now I ſhall add,
that, not onely there may happen ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations
in the ſucceſs of Trials made with
Electrical Bodies, but that it is not ſo
certain as many think, whether ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Bodies be or be not Electrical. For
the inquiſitive <hi>Kircherus</hi> reckons Cryſtall
among thoſe Gems to whom Nature has
denyed the attractive power we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of; and yet I remember not, that, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all the trials I have made with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Cryſtall, I have found any that was
deſtitute of the power he refuſes them.
Alſo a late moſt learned Writer reciting
the Electricks, reckon'd up by our indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Countryman <hi>Gilbert,</hi> and increaſing
their number by ſome obſerved by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
(to which I ſhall now add, beſides
white Saphyrs, and white Engliſh Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyſts,
the almoſt Diaphanous ſpar of Lead
Ore) denies Electricity to a couple of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent
Gems, the Cornelion and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald.
And I do the leſs wonder he ſhould
do ſo to the former, becauſe I have my ſelf
in vain tried to make any attraction with
a piece of Cornelion ſo large and fair, that
'twas kept for a rarity; and yet with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other fine Cornelions I have been able
to attract ſome light bodies very manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60281:295"/>
if not briskly; and I uſually wear a
Cornelian Ring, that is richly enough en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with Electricity. But as for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds,
as I thought it ſtrange that Nature
ſhould have denied them a Quality ſhe
has granted to ſo many other Diaphanous
Gems, and even to Cryſtal, ſo I thought
the aſſertion deſerved an <hi>Examen,</hi> upon
which I concluded, that at leaſt it does
not univerſally and conſtantly hold true.
I had indeed ſeen in a Ring a Stone of
price and great luſtre, which, though
green, I found to be, (as I gueſs'd it would
prove) vigorouſly enough Electrical. But
this Experiment, though ſeemingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive,
I did not look upon as a fair trial,
becauſe the Stone was not a true Emrald,
but, which is rare, a green Saphir. And
I learned by inquiry of the skillful Jewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
that cut it, that it was ſo far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the ſoftneſs of an Emrald, that he
found it harder than blew Saphyrs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which yet are Gems of great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and by ſome reputed ſecond to none,
but Diamonds. Without therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
any thing from this Experiment,
ſave that, if the aſſertion I was to examin
were true, the want of an Electrical fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
might be thought a Concomitant ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the peculiar Texture of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald
than of its green colour, I proceeded
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60281:295"/>
to make trial with three or four Emralds,
whoſe being true was not doubted, and
found them all ſomewhat, though not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually,
endow'd with Electricity, which I
found to be yet more conſiderable in an
Emrald of my own, whoſe colour was ſo
excellent, that by skilful perſons 'twas
look'd on as a rarity. And though, by this
ſucceſs of my inquiry, I perceived I could
not, as elſe I might have done, ſhew the
Curious a new way of judging of true and
falſe Emralds, yet the like way may be,
though not always certain, yet oftentimes
of uſe, in the eſtimating whether Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds
be true or counterfeit, eſpecially,
if, being ſet in Rings, the ſureſt way of
trying them cannot conveniently be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.
For whereas Glaſs, though it
have ſome Electricity, ſeems, as far as I
have obſerved, to have but a faint one,
there are often found Diamonds that have
a very vigorous one. And I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I met with any Electrick of the
ſame bulk, that was more vigorous than
a rough Diamond I have, which is the
ſame that I formerly mentioned to have
moved a Needle above three minutes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had ceaſed to chafe it. And this
brings into my mind, that it has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that Diamonds draw better whilſt
rough, than they do after they are cut and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60281:296"/>
poliſh'd; which ſeeming to contradict
what has been obſerved by others and by
us alſo, that Amber, for inſtance, attracts
more vigorouſly if the ſurface be made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſmooth than otherwiſe, it induces me
to conjecture, that, if this Obſervation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Diamonds be true, as ſome of my
trials have now and then inclined me to
think it, and if it do not in ſome caſes
conſiderably depend upon the loſs of the
(Electrical) Subſtance of the Stone, by its
being cut and ground, the Reaſon may
poſſibly be, that the great rapidneſs with
which the Wheels that ſerve to cut and
poliſh Diamonds muſt be mov'd, does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
a great degree of heat, (which the
ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may eaſily diſcover) in the Stone,
and by that and the ſtrong concuſſion it
makes of its parts, may force it to ſpend
its effluviable matter, if I may ſo call it,
ſo plentifully, that the Stone may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh'd,
and perhaps alſo, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of ſome little change in its Texture,
be rendred leſſe diſpoſed to emit thoſe
<hi>effluvia</hi> that are Inſtruments of Electrical
Attraction. But as I willingly leave the
matter of Fact to further Trial, ſo I do
the Cauſe of it, in caſe it prove true, to
farther Inquiry.</p>
