         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Authors, as the declaration of Christ to the
World was progressive, so is the illumination
of the spirit, not only in particular Mens
Soules, but in the whole Church, which must
have her growth as well as particular Men,
and what if somebody in after times may stand

be gloryfied, though he make the feete of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity

brought M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

and that thereupon stirred up your spirit to
doe something against the fresh forces that
should come in now of late, to fight against the
<hi>Sabbath.</hi> God did not tell you his Errand when
he sent the Booke to you, but the event is the
finger that points to Gods providence, as
Time is the Mid wife of Truth. God found out
you who being vacant from other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

intend any thing of that kind to the Presse.
Commit it to Gods patronage, for he is the
fittest Patron it can have. My Prayer shall
be that your spirit may be such as may procure
a blessing on the Booke, by giving it to God
first, and then his Church, in a spirit of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

all which Prerogatiues was the Ceremoniall law
crowned withall, for that it was as a vanishing shadow
sutable only to the Hemispheare of those times. But
the decalogue being the very Law of Nature explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and redelivered, must as well now as ever have
for its substance a generall ayme at all men; though
in some circumstances it may bee more peculiar to
the Iewes then others, by reason of the time, place,
and people, to whom it was renewed; Like as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all other Scripture is for substance common and
for circumstances proper, because they were most an
end written occasionaly. Put case then that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
was given onely to the Iewes (as you
affirme) and so were abrogatiue; yet may the Law
of Nature bee well presupposed and included in it;
(as you your selfe afterwards acknowledge, it is in
your 8. Chapter in the answer you give there to the
fifth opinion) for who knowes not that in those
ten words much more is meant then manifested, So
that if so it be granted that the Law of Nature and
this Law bee not the same in all points yet are they not
two divers lawes but the same in substance And thus
much in effect Master <hi>Breerewood</hi> affirmes in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Tract: pag.</hi> 3. Morall (saith he) is that which
pertaineth to manners; 1. Either by the instinct of
Nature as belonging to the inward Law written in
our hearts: or Secondly, by the instruction of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
as being of the outward Law pronounced of
God, as that of observing the seventh Day: so that
it may beetermed Naturall, as being, not of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Nature; but of the disciplining of Nature:
Not of Nature as it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rst ordained of God, but as
after informed by him. For indeed this fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
both as it was at first instituted in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
and now revived on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> is but the
law of Nature explained and enlarged according to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55806:9"/>
the will of God in this particular for reasons and uses,
whereof created nature was not capable but by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
And what though the Law of nature bee the
generality, as well to the precepts of the Iewish holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
as of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> this shewes the superexcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> above them therefore, and its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
with nature seeing God makes use of it so espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
to exhibite the commandement of nature by,
amongst the Lawes thereof.</p>
               <p>But now in that opinion, wherein you and Master
<hi>Breerewood</hi> jumpe, I must differ from you both, to
wit, that now onely the generall Law of nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
(which is that some time is to bee sanctified to
Gods worship) and that this fourth commandement,
which you call Gods speciall commandement, is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
abrogated. For as for the Law of nature which
consisteth onely in an indefinite sequestring of some
time to the service of God, it comes infinitely short
of that compleatnes and solemnity of time which our
necessity requireth, and which God deserveth at our
hands, and which (if hee may bee his owne spokes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
hee commandeth also. Indeed to set apart some
time as perhaps an houre in a Day, or some such like
time for prayer or meditation, it may bee nature or
conscience would affirme it requisite; but to set a
part so much time, and in so solemne manner as (it
seemes) God lookes for, and our state requires, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature nor conscience will so prompt us, either
now, or (as I thinke) in innocency. And therefore as
I may well conclude that, that first institution of
God concerning the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> was rather a supply
to nature then any Law in nature (which our <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabbatarians</hi>
unnecessarily labour to disprove)<note n="*" place="margin">Though I must say of some argum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nts of some former Writers of this subject of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> (who not then finding opposition which hath beene an ordinary meanes in the course of Gods providence, for the more diligent inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after the truth of God and happy disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thereof) as <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> saith of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

                     </gap>verse persons.</note> and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded
of God after created nature by immediate
and speciall revelation; So I have just cause to beleeve
that this was for many speciall and perpetuall respects.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55806:9"/>
For left God his solemne and publicke worship to
have beene arbitrarily ordered by nature, and not
have by himselfe determined a speciall time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it would have falne out very crosse to Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,
either being slenderly and seldomely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
or at least very confusedly and disjoyntedly,
seeing that so many men have so many mindes, and
so many severall and various occasions, which by man
would never have beene determined at once (to have
kept so solemne and compleat a portion of time as
it seemes God expected, especially seeing nature
never suggested it) if God by an over-ruling mandat
had not put it past <hi>posse</hi> and <hi>velle:</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">As he did the eating of the Passeover though a man were in a journey or were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, by a law made, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.</note> which hee who
is not the God of confusion wisely foresaw and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.
So that though some time even by nature is
taught to bee set apart for Gods worship (which I
deny not) yet I say, that this is more private and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall,
not so solemne and publicke as God would
have it, and therefore may bee arbitrary without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
and distraction, which the other cannot if left
to mans free-will, and therefore is purposely revealed
of God, and is no law innate in nature because of
the reason aforesaid; for nature doth not discerne of
numbers: or why God should chose to be worshipped
on the seventh day rather then on the eight or ninth:
but a commandement on the by, of equall force, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and perpetuity with nature, prescribed as a rule
coincident with nature for the Church of God in all ages
to imitate. And to this purpose speakes <hi>Marius;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marius in Gen. 2.</note>
Since (saith hee) it is the Law of nature that some
time bee peculiarly insinuated for the worship of
God, it was meete that that should bee determined
by a positive Law.</p>
               <p>But against this, it will be objected: Why might
not time as well as place, bee left to the disposition
and authority of Man to appoint? seeing, that time
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55806:10"/>
and place bee alike necessary in nature to all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> time and place are in nature alike ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to all actions <hi>in genere,</hi> but so is not this or that
particuler time or place; save where by positive Law
it is made so: God did appoint the seaventh day for
solemne worship and left all places at liberty, till
it pleased him to designe one onely place for Sacrifice-worship
under the Law, the necessity whereof being
now abrogated by the Gospell, the place is left to
choyce. One time may agree to all the world for
worship, but so cannot one place.</p>
               <p>Againe it will be objected,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> that Bishop <hi>White, pag.</hi>

yet if it were onely a positive morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
the obligation hereof ceased under the Gospell.

comming the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was abrogated, this distinction
must bee taken to. What appertaineth to the ordering
of humane life, and what peculiarly agreeth to the
old signes. That the <hi>Sabbath</hi> figured the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55806:11"/>
of the flesh (I say) was temporall, but that from
the beginning it was commanded men that they
should exercise themselves in the worship of God
it ought deservedly to endure even to the end of the
World. And besides this, hee that observeth what
followes upon 'his instance of the ancients in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
shall find that there hee saith how that
though they say true, yet they touch but halfe the
matter. And therefore doth hee largely discusse it
afterwards, wherein hee sheweth his opinion to bee
thus much, that the institution of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> for the
better and more solemne performance of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and refreshment of his creature, was with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
intent, because of necessary use to all men in all
times,<note n="*" place="margin">Sect. 32.</note> but in regard it was againe given to the Iewes
it had somewhat peculiar in it, which by Christ is
abrogated, and yet the force, use and reason of the
commandement in regard of its substance, as it was
given both at the first, and as it was repeated doth still
remaine. So that hee confesseth that there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
peculiar to the Iewes which hung at it, but that
withall there is a substance in the commandement it
selfe which it is sacriledge to violate, the use thereof
being universall both to persons and times, so that in
alledging him you bring in, <hi>testem sine testimonio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And put case there was some what, that was more
proper to those people and those times, then to these
in this fourth commandement as well as in the first
and fifth (for as I have said, almost all scripture had
some circumstantiall peculiarity and propriety to those
people and those times to whom it was immediately
given, which yet nothing hindered the universality
of the substance) yet as the reasons in those comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
evangelically construed are of present force
and being, even in these our times, though the letter
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55806:12"/>
strictly construed bee not: so this commandement,
or the <hi>Sabbath</hi> may have somewhat more proper
to them in it (for so is that manner of expression the
stranger within they gates) or at least belonging to
it (such as was their not preparing <hi>Mannah,</hi> and
kindling of fires) which yet is so farre from extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
the whole commandement,<note n="*" place="margin">For it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement may bee of force to mee, though every circumstance of it doe not concerne mee.</note> as that the very
type it selfe is of lively use to us under the Gospell,
and of present force and being also (although not
therefore of a like religious nature to us as it was to
them) but in an Evangelicall sense, that is in respect of
the inward and spirituall holines thereof, not properly
of the outward and literall. For though the outward
Sanction<note n="*" place="margin">By this word (san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) I meane posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive holines which was in their carnall &amp; externall worship.</note> of that rest being admitted to bee typicall
may bee extinct, because that the typicalnes of things
are not properly parts but accidents, and conducing
helps to our profession and worship that live under
the Gospell: which if true and reall is spirituall,
<hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.<note n="*" place="margin">See Master <hi>Hildersham lect.</hi> 39. 40 upon the place where he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Spirit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with wee are to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God in our times, to the Ceremoniall worship which was in the time of the Iewes, in respect it was an externall and carnall worship see also, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6.</note> Yet is not the holy use of this rest extinct,
either as it is conducing or necessary to the present
sanctifying of the Lords day, or as it is significative,
pointing us to, and minding us of our heavenly <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will say, how can we reject the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall
holines and yet retaine the sense?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We refuse the whole Law as a covenant, and
yet wee retaine it as a rule, for the perfection of that
Church respectively to the foregoing times (which
is called the time of nature) belongs to us; but the
imperfection of it respectively with our Church,
ended with it selfe, and belongs not to us.</p>
               <p>2. If the <hi>Sabbath</hi> had had its originall after a
Iewish manner, to have beene instituted upon the
fall, and so to relate to Christ, then wee could have
retained it no more then the rest, but wee derive
this from the primitive institution in paradice princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55806:12"/>
and from the Iewes onely by way of enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or conveyance, as wee doe water first from the
fountaine and then from the pipe. And though this
rest had in it a typicall signification at first, yet never
a typicall sanction, but onely by accident of the
Iewish discipline then, when types were in fashion;
(as I may so speake) like a fresh River which running
through a peece of the Sea is made brinish, but
being quit of it, it re-assumes its owne nature.</p>
               <p>So that then the commandement is not abrogated
as a speciall commandement, but the speciality<note n="*" place="margin">I meane not such a speciality as Master Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

belonged to the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or to this generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
is rather ended, which did consist of those
occasionall interventions of <hi>Mannah,</hi> kindling fires,
and double sacrifices, and (if you will) of the foresaid
sanction of the very rest it selfe (which as I have
said being significative, happily had in their times an
holines belonging to it) which did peculiarly belong
unto the Iewes, and which were no parts of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this commandement, which in that respect
is as well common to us as to them, the reason an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
being of like and equall force to all from the
creation. For the annexing of extrinsecall and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious
circumstances, doth not any whit harme
the nature, and morality of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> no more then
<hi>Pauls</hi> circumcising of <hi>Timothy</hi> (which in respect of
the season was needfull) did annull, or doe injury
to baptisme: nor then a signe of an <hi>Inne</hi> or shoppe
being pulled downe, annulles or impaires an
house.</p>
               <p>So that their rest is common to us but in a riper
sense, for the grouth and stature of our times so much
overtopping theirs, the Lord lookes that wee should
answer his expectation, as well as obey his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
in sanctifying a more excellent and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
<hi>Sabbath</hi> to him, then ever they were able to doe.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55806:13"/>
The Church of the new Testament (saith Master
<hi>Perkins</hi>) hath more knowledge and more grace then
the people of the old Testament had, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
ought to have more zeale and greater alacrity
in the worship of God then they had, that it may
exceed the Iewes according to the measure of grace<note n="*" place="margin">Greater mercies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter duties.</note>
received. The Arguments of love being not so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
to prompt obedience, in the time of the Iewes,
as in ours, they being under the old covenant, and
the Spirit not so stirring then, as now, the obedience
was rather performed to the commandement then
to the commander; For God in their time passed
under the name of a Lord, implying them to bee ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and their obedience to bee serviceable obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
but now in our times hee passeth under the
name of a Father, implying us to bee sons and our
obedience to bee filiall and spirituall. And yet as
spirituall obedience was, even then, due to God, and
expected by him, though not with that eminency of
expectation, as of us: So the types and Sacramentall
umbrages which now are of use to us (being perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in conscience to Gods commandement) have
their holines suteable and respective to our times;
but not in that degree, not in that kind of positive and
intrinsecall holines as in the times of the Iewish non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
Like as in the spring time while the sappe is
weake and but comming, all that wee expect from
trees is flowers, but when a riper seasoninsueth, then
wee looke for riper fruit; so that then the prime and
beauty of these flowers ceaseth, though their vertue
remaine. And by the punishment that God so severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
annexed to the not performing the rites of the two
Sacraments, wee may see the extraordinary nature
of things of that kind then, in the time of their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogie;
for he that was uncircumcised and that eate
leavened bread in the passeover, was to be cut off.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55806:13"/>And therefore did God intend their rest (as may
well bee gathered) to bee a positive part of their
sanctification, because of the typicall use thereof, which
yet hee doth; not doe to us, and yet hee accounts our
not resting a prophanation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and all
imployments which hinder his worship and conduce
not to the sanctifying of that day to bee sinnes. Like
as Christ who, whilest hee was upon the earth, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
small things at his Apostles hands, but after hee
was ascended and had given gifts unto men hee
looked for other services: or as a <hi>Pater-familias</hi> that
having a boy and a man to waite at his table, the boy
if hee can fill a cup of beere, and shift a trencher, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his non-age, hee is willing to take it as a good
part of his service, but to his man hee gives better
wages, and therefore expects better service at his
hands, hee lookes that hee should bee able to furnish
and disfurnish the table with grace to his Master, and
yet not to neglect those lesser things. Or (which bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
expresseth my meaning) as of children wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a bodily service in saying their prayers and
graces and catechisme, and though they have little, or
no understanding and sense of that they say, yet wee
take it in good part till they attaine to more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and ripenes of yeares, and then wee looke for
sutable performance thereto. Even so the Lord hee
expects from us an high degree of sanctifying his
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> even a ravishment of Spirit, which service
wee can never performe if wee doe not rest. A <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
and <hi>Evangelicall</hi> use therefore of this <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi>
rest is still in force to us, though the Iewish
sanction may bee determined, for their precise resting
was with respect to the formall holines in the rest;
but wee are to rest with respect to its finall holines
of furthering Gods more substantiall worship, and
the spiritualizing our owne mindes by it, and thus doth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55806:14"/>
the whole commandement for substance and use re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

notwithstanding were of afarre different nature and

fall and occasioned by it, and in themselves tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,

yet it doth not to us, and yet so as the primary force

Thirdly, in respect also of the reason whereupon

that the reason Drawne from the example of God
who rested upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> namely, when the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was finished, endured onely till the time of the
new creation, in which all things were made new by
Christ, at which time it ceased, or at least, a second

place, the former both reason and day (become now
old) are passed away; And behold all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
new. For this worke of redemption or new
creation being the greater may deservedly take
place of the other; and as the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the deliverance, that God would vouchsafe
his people from the <hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity, saith: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

so may wee say of the day appointed for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
that the day wherein hee finished the worke of

wherein our Lord Christ, by his resurrection from

               </p>
               <p>And how ever in other things the constitution
of the Iewish Church and ours differ, yet in this they
are united, the <hi>Sabbath</hi> being first ordained, before
there was distinction made, or wall of partition built,
for an ever-lasting signe betweene God and his Church
for his sanctifying it, and a perpetuall rule of duty
and practise chalked out to his Church, for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of his more solemne worship. Like as was
his marrying of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in innocency, both
a perpetuall type of that union which is betweene
God and his Church, as also a perpetuall rule for the
ordering of that affaire amongst mankind ever after:
both which were alike given in innocency, and were
alike both perpetuall rules and perpetuall types unto
his Church.</p>

as well as others abrogation: wherefore the
Apostles were to preach onely the abrogative types
and ceremonies to bee abrogated (of which sort I
prove the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to bee none) and according to
the nature of the new creation to alter the other, of
which sort the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was, and therefore suffered
subordination not abrogation: And therefore hath

                  </gap>gnificant opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the old antiquated last day of the weeke.
I will conclude this Answer with Master <hi>Hookers</hi>
authority (who was a confident maintainer of the
morality of the fourth commandement as you may
see in his <hi>Eccles. Pol. pag.</hi> 377.) who speaking
upon this place of the <hi>Galath.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hooker.</note> saith: That for as much
as the Law of the Iewes by the comming of <hi>Christ</hi>
was changed, and wee thereunto no way bound,
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> although it were not his purpose to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
invectives against the speciall sanctification of
dayes and times to the service of God, and to the
honour of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> doth notwithstanding bend
his forces against that opinion, which imposed
on the Gentiles the yoake of Iewish legall obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
as if the whole World ought for ever, and
that upon paine of condemnation to keepe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them, such as in this perswasion hallowed the
Iewish <hi>Sabbaths</hi> the Apostle sharply reproveth
saying, <hi>yee observe dayes and monthes and times
and yeares,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus you see how Master <hi>Hookers</hi> opinion was
concerning this text of <hi>Paul,</hi> onely to cry downe
those obsolete Iewish observations, and nothing
lesse then to impeach the authority of the fourth
commandement or the Lords day, as you may plainely
discerne by turning over leafe to <hi>pag.</hi> 378. where
hee layeth downe three sorts of holy times, thus,
saith hee:<note place="margin">Hooker.</note> It pleased God heretofore to exact some
part of time by way of perpetuall homage never to
bee dispenced withall, nor remitted, againe to require
some other parts of time with as strict exaction but
for lesse continuance, and of the rest which were left
arbitrary to accept what the Church should in due
consideration consecrate voluntarily unto religious
uses. Of the first kind amongst the Iewes was the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55806:17"/>
                  <hi>Sabbath-day.</hi> Of the second those feastes which
were appointed by the Law of <hi>Mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s;</hi> The Feast
of Dedication invented by the Church standeth in
the number of the last kind. The morall Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
therefore a seaventh part throughout the
age of the World to bee that way imployed, although
with us the day bee changed in regard of a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
begun by our Saviour Christ, yet the same
proportion of time continueth which was before,
because of reference to the benefit of creation, and
now much more of renovation thereunto added by
him which was Prince of the World to come, wee
are bound to account the sanctification of one day
in seaven a duty which Gods immutable Law doth
exact for ever. Thus you have Master <hi>Hookers</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
both of this text of the <hi>Gal.</hi> The morality
of the fourth commandement, the perpetuity of
the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the authority of the Lords-day.</p>

               <p>Your admiration is worthy commendation, for
it is the part of every honest man to preserve the

being removed, opens a gappe to all licentiousnes,
and that being once let in, which is so much thirsted

all Religion.</p>
               <p>For as Doctor <hi>Denison</hi> notes upon the 13.
<hi>Neh.</hi> 2. That where the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is not sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
there is neither sound Religion nor a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

               <p>And therefore what you weakely endeavour

               <head>Answer.</head>
               <p>It is no doubt but the seaventh day was the day
that God onely rested on, and sanctified to a different
use from the rest of the dayes, for having imployed
these in creating things necessary for mans corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
good, hee designes him this day for his spirituall
benefit, and his owne speciall glory, (whereas it is
alleadged by some, Bishop <hi>White pag.</hi> 42. Doctor <hi>Heylyn
pag.</hi> 10. That God imposed no other Law on <hi>Adam</hi>
then that of the forbidden fruit of the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
To this I answer:</p>
               <p>1. That there was another Law imposed upon
him even in innocency as appeares <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 24. to
wit, the Law of having but one wife and loving
her.</p>
               <p>2. That this Law of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was a Law not
of the nature of the other where on his estate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended,
but a Law of indulgence, whereto hee both
should and would readily have confented (because
of the blessing and benefit which should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded
to him thereby) had hee continued in
in innocency and not lost himselfe and it before.)</p>
               <p>And questionlesse there was no other reason why
hee, that could have made all the World in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
should yet contrive and spin out the worke of
creation into sixe dayes space, but onely to this end,
that hee might give an example to mankind (which
was then in <hi>Adam</hi>) for ever to set a part the seaventh
day to his more speciall and solemne worship. And
the reason (of Gods resting from the creation) why
it is annexed as a reason of the commandement is,
because at that time there was no better thing, nor
greater commodity, no nor any greater worke for
God to rest from, or thing wherein God was more
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55806:20"/>
seene then in the creation. And therefore was the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> appointed on that day (having the honour
to conclude the creation) in memory of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to man, and upon occasion of his refreshment
therein, till a greater good should befall him, and a
worke wherein God should bee more glorified,
and then that reason to bee subordinated not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled
(because the creation still remaineth as a lesse
good even unto us under the Gospell) but as the Law
is to the Gospell, or the old Testament to the new,
or as the Prophets were to the Apostles and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
not in the sense as the ceremonies were to Christ,
to receive an absolute expiration the one by the
other; for it was of no such shadowish nature; and
yet not so unchangeable, but that it is as well sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to subordination upon occasion, as the Iewes
deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was to their after delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> For man was more happy,
and God (as I may say) more refreshed in ceasing from
the worke of our redemption then of our creation.</p>
               <p>And therefore is <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> worthily changed
into <hi>Anno Domini:</hi> And the name of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
into the Lords-day; For <hi>denominatio omnis fit a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jori.</hi>
And for this cause although in relation to our
redemption wee celebrate the first day of the weeke
for order, yet it is the creation that makes this first
day to bee the seaventh in number, and good reason.
For seeing God in the creation divided time into
the revolution of seaven, how can or dare any that
knowes the creation breake the order of time by
God established, and thinke of another division as
of. 6. or 8. &amp;c. seeing from the beginning it was
not so, especially seeing it was purposely done of
God for the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> sake, who els could have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the creation in the twinckling of an eye
(which solemne contrivement sure was not to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55806:20"/>
create a Iewish abrogative type) and therefore is
accordingly observed under the Gospell, onely <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis
mutandis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to come to that which you would inferre,
which is, that onely the last day of the seaven is to
bee kept <hi>Sabbath:</hi> I answer:</p>
               <p>First, that in respect of the point of time, I thinke
I need not bee large to prove the variation of it:
For I thinke it will be granted upon this one instance:
10. <hi>Ios.</hi> 13. how that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was not alwayes
observed answerable to the first institution in respect
of the point of time; for that by the Suns standing
still the weeke was lengthened beyond its due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Heylin pag.</hi> 48. alleadgeth, that a man
travailing the World Westward may lose a whole
day; now what shall that man doe at his returne,
saith hee, if to sanctify one day in seaven bee morall.</p>
               <p>I answer first, Let him tell mee what a Iew should
have done in that case when the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
obligatory; and so should that man doe
now.</p>
               <p>Secondly I answer, that though things that are
morall by nature, because they bind alwayes, and in
all places alike, are ever the same: Yet things that
are morall onely by Discipline admit variety through
exigency of time and occasion.</p>
               <p>Thus it was lawfull for <hi>Adams</hi> immediate po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
to conjugate with their consanguinity, which
now (the exigency of those times being over) is
utterly unlawfull by disciplinary morality: (Nay
nature her selfe being disciplined from the alteration
of time and variety of choyce, now abhorres it as
utterly undecent) so the man that having in his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
calling of merchandizing lost a day, and had
during his travell in his particuler practise rent from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55806:21"/>
the Church (in her computation of time) without a
schisme, being lawfully necessitated thereunto by the
course of nature, may as lawfully at his returne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
himselfe againe unto the conformity and practise
of the Church to avoid a wilfull rent and disorder;
like as they that were in a journey were to keepe
the Passeover on a different time by themselves
from the Church of the Iewes, but at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
they were to returne to the Churches observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, but in regard of the order which I thinke
you labour to maintaine, to wit, that the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
ought to bee the last, and not the first day of the
weeke, or else not to bee at all. To that I answer,
that some reasons and circumstances even in the
morall Law are occasionall and so changeable, and
yet the substance of the commandement is perpetuall
and immutable:<note n="*" place="margin">And as one well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves. Diverse positive lawes which are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall &amp; perpetuall and bind all men in their generations, though they bee firme and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable in themselves and in their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet because the duties of obedience which they impose upon men and the men upon whom the duties are imposed are in their state and condition mutable and changeable, and the changes and alterations of things commanded in times places and other relations and respects doe not at all change the Law, nor prove it ceremoniall and changeable. As for instance, the Law of beleeving in Christ, is firme and unchangeable from the first promise that was made of him, and yet the duty which hee requires is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable, and is changed now under the Gospell from that it was under the Law, in circumstance, for they were to beleeve in Christ to come, but we as come; for the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the day now since Christ does not make v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>id, but establish the Law of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
                  </note> As in the first commandement,
where <hi>Israels</hi> corporeall deliverance is now changed
into <hi>Israels</hi> ghostly deliverance; So in the fifth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> is properly the land
meant which had that promise belonging to it:
But now it is enlarged to all that in the feare of God
obey that commandement throughout the World.
So this commandement had the reason of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
from the creation occasionally affixed unto it,
because that then the creation was Gods greatest
and eminentest worke, and being occasionall and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55806:21"/>
appointed for commemoration, was therefore chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable
whensoever he should rest from a greater
worke, that better deserved commemoration then that;
And yet the substance of the commandement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
unalterable, which substance or unalterable
part of the commandement consisteth in the number,
as seaven is opposed to all oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r numbers, and not in
the order.</p>
               <p>But may some say,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> those allegations out of the
first and fift commandements hold not paralel with
this reason of the fourth commandement, because
they were onely given in the time of the Iewes,
but this was from the beginning.</p>
               <p>I answer both the one and the other was given
for the Churches sake,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> and therefore alterable accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Gods good pleasure and the state of the
Church.</p>
               <p>But you will further object: When doe you find
any thing altered, that was as this is from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</p>
               <p>I answer, I find the curse which was annexed to
the fall of man to bee taken away and brought under
by the death and resurrection of Christ: And well
then may the reason of the then <hi>Sabbath</hi> bee altered
by it, when the curse is annulled, it being the Churches
type or ceremony, and that thing changed wherein
the ceremony consisted, to wit, the order from last to
first according to the different state of the Church.
Like as it may bee supposed of the Iewes when they
came to bee a sedentary Church, they altered their
gesture from standing to sitting, but still retained the
Passeover; So wee still retaine the substance of the
fourth commandement, though wee have altered
the ceremony, which was grounded upon Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
And now God having given us another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of another rest upon another day, wee imitate
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55806:22"/>
his example, and still keepe his commandement, by
observing the number but altering the order. For
indeed as by Gods ordination and disposition, the
Law and <hi>Sabbath</hi> goe together, so they fare alike;
for the Law was to continue in the nature of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
till Christ came, and so the <hi>Sabbath</hi> on the
last day, who b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> fulfilling the righteousnes of the one,
did inherite the rest of the other, being annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
and entailed thereupon (whereof man failed
by his fall) and thereupon changed the natures of both,
subordinating the Law to the Gospell; making it,
in stead of a cause procuring life, to bee a rule, and an
effect of life and grace received; and so the last day
<hi>Sabbath</hi> to the first, changing rest by workes, into
working by rest; A happy change (if wee make
not our selves unhappy by allowing a rest to the Law
but none to the Gospell) for whereas before wee
held by a tenure of feare, our happines being all in
the future, for wee were, all our life long, to doe this,
and then to live, now wee hold by the tenure of faith,
and our happines is in present, for saith the Apostle
<hi>Hebr. 4. 3. wee which have beleeved doe enter into
rest;</hi> according to <hi>Iohn. 17. 3. This is life eternall
to know thee,</hi> &amp;c. shewing that the life of grace
in a man is called eternall life, because it hath
its beginning from that life which shall never
cease, but increase to ever-lasting perfection.</p>
               <p>So that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is unalterable in regard of
the individuall number, but not in regard of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall
day. The number being kept, the day upon
occasion might bee altered. And of the truth of this
wee have good reason to perswade us, for the issue
proveth it by the divine authority of the Apostles.
For this fourth commandement, being no Iewish
ceremony, but a commandement in the Decalogue,
and equall with the Law of nature, ought for the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55806:22"/>
substance of it to bee esteemed perpetuall, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
seeing that now, in one of these senses, to wit,
in the number, wee see it preserved inviolable by
the example of the Apostles, and the practise of the
Church ever since; and yet in respect of the order,
by the selfe-same examples, altered from last to
first; And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which alteration is very agreeable to the
time of the Gospell, <hi>where many that are first shall
bee last, and last shall bee first.</hi> Even as <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi>
who being the last of the Prophets, was therefore
the greatest, because nearest unto Christ: yet hee
that is least in the Kingdome of Heaven (that is,
in the time of the Gospell) is greater then hee: So
this seaventh day, though the last in order and greatest
in dignity, during the supereminency of the old crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
because of Gods example; yet now, is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
retained, and the order exchanged from the last
to the first of the weeke, in honour of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the new Heaven and new Earth, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
was prophecied, and promised to ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
out the old, in the 65. of <hi>Isa. 17. I will</hi> (saith God
there) <hi>create a new Heaven and a new Earth, and
the former shall not bee remembred</hi> (that is the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of it shall cease, and shall give place to the
new, for els remember it wee both doe and must doe,
for the memory of both may consist together, and the
one confirme the other, in regard that our redemption
restores us to a lawfull Dominion (once forfeited)
over the whole worke of creation. And why must
there bee this change? Why, because of the greater
excellency of the second creation, which shall bee
solemnized in stead of the first under the time of the
Gospell, when Christ shall bee come, and shall have
finished the worke of my Mercy, which shall bee
greater then was the worke of my goodnes in the
creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:55806:23"/>Each creation must have its <hi>Sabbath</hi> of comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration,
for els should God magnify his lesser worke
of creation before his greater worke of redemption.
And therefore this is the day which wee now cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate,
which the Lord hath made for us to rejoyce in
now, like as that was then.</p>
               <p>And thus wee see it in all points now fulfilled.
But you will object, that this new Heaven and new
Earth is meant of the differing state of the Church
under the Gospell, to that it was under the Law:
<hi>Ans.</hi> I grant it, whereof the solemnizing of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
(which principally; nay I may say onely,
made the change) in stead of our old and first creation
(unto which wee lost all right, but that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
by, and therefore worthily changed into, the
second) is a principall part; And therefore hath the
holy Ghost expressed this change in those tearmes
of old and new creation, rather then any other. And
as in the 2. of <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 13. there, at the perfection
of the Kingdome of Heaven, hee prophecies of a
reall change of the old Heaven and old Earth by an
absolute dissolution of them, by reason of the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a better condition to the people and Church
of God: So here in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> at the inchoation of the
Kingdome of Heaven (I meane the time of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell)
hee prophecies of a proportionable reall
change (leading unto the other) of the old Heaven
and old Earth, by way of mitigation, by reason of a
more excellent benefit that redoundeth to the
Church and children of God. For those words (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his promise) in the aforesaid text of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
have reference to this of <hi>Isaiah;</hi> By the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ison
of which texts it is evident, that there is
as well a literall as a mysticall sense in these words,
which was to bee fulfilled gradatim, in the Kingdome
under the Gospell (which was the time of the adequate
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55806:23"/>
accomplishment of their prophecies) as well, as in
the Kingdome of Heaven hereafter, which is the time
of accomplishing our prophecies, or theirs, as they
are transferred over to us.</p>
               <p>So that if you grant it requisite to sanctifie a
seaventh day, or the seaventh day in respect of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
I say with you; but now to sanctifie the last day
in the weeke, were to memorize our creation above
our redemption; our being, above our wel-being, and
to contradict promise and prophecy, example and
reason; For in commemorations the lesser gives way
to, and is enwrapped in the greater. Now then
Christs resting, on the first day from a greater worke,
then that of the creation was just cause to adjourne
the great duty of commemoration, to that day
which finished the greater and more beneficiall
action.</p>
               <p>But on the other hand to keepe no seaventh day,
were likewise to goe against the example of the
Apostles, and to blot out one of the tenne comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
and so to make a morall Law Iewishly
ceremoniall: For there is no reason why the Apostles
should weekely celebrate the day of Christs resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
if it were not in reference to the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement;
seeing that if they had meant it as a bare
institution of the Church, they might have done by
the day of Christs resurrection as wee doe by the
day of his birth, that is, have kept it yearely.</p>
               <p>And lastly, it were to crosse this prophecy of <hi>Isa.</hi>
65. 17. for what reason have wee to thinke, that
God would simply have the remembrance of the
creation lessened; nothing lesse; but onely respectively;
no more then hee would have the <hi>Egyptian</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
forgotten, because hee would have the
<hi>Babylonish</hi> deliverance remembred, but onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively.
For hee would have us, that are under
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55806:24"/>
the Gospell, to celebrate the worke of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
above the worke of our creation, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
the day of the consummation thereof,
to bee the day which <hi>David</hi> speakes of, <hi>Psalme</hi> 118.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which the Lord hath made, wherein
wee will rejoyce and bee glad. In which words
(as one saith) I see not how the making of the day
can bee intended for the common regulation of the
dayes in the creation, but it appeareth to bee some
dedication to an holy use of joy and gladnes (sutable
to the description of a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which is called a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light)
for our unspeakeable deliverance.</p>
               <p>And not as Bishop <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ite</hi> would perswade <hi>pag.</hi>
191. that the day of Christs passion, was every
way as blessed a day in respect of mans redemption,
as the day of resurrection. For the Apostle saith,
<hi>that if Christ bee not risen wee are yet in our sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so againe whereas hee saith; <hi>pag.</hi> 298. This
great worke of humane redemption was not effected
by the resurrection of Christ, but by his obedience
and sacrifice on the crosse; and it was fully wrought
and finished upon the passion friday, after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
had said <hi>consummatum est.</hi> I aske, how
wee had beene redeemed from, and how hee
had conquered, our last enemy death, if hee had not
risen, And againe, put case it were so, so was the
worke of creation fully finished on the sixth day, and
yet God sanctified the seaventh day, and on that day.
2. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. it is said, <hi>Hee ended his worke which hee
had made,</hi> because that day gave manifest declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his compleating the works of creation, and
so did the day of Christs resurrection manifest the
compleating of the worke of our redemption.</p>
               <p>And this day, thus prophetically extolled by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
was answerably honoured by Christ himselfe,
and kept by his Apostles. So that in answer to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55806:24"/>
                  <hi>White pag.</hi> 302<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was at least an implicite,
vertuall, and interpretative command in the act of
Christs resurrection; For why should not wee thinke,
that Christ had a significant meaning in prolonging
his resurrection to the third day, which was the first
of the weeke, as well as God had, in spinning out
his creation to the seaventh day, which was the last
of the weeke, seeing Christ could have raised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
out of the grave so soone as hee was in it, like
as God could have created all things in the twinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of an eye.</p>
               <p>So that then, seeing God by this his resting from
the worke of our redemption, hath given us a new
reason (in respect of eminency) of a new day, and
by the example of his Apostles preserving still the
number, wee in doing the like obey his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and his Law, which is not destroyed by the
comming of Christ (for not one tittle of it shall
passe away, till Heaven and Earth passe, which is
the time of the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> period) but fulfilled and
explained by him, according to the will of God, and
his purpose, though not according to our carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings
and opinions. For thus is all kept whole.
The reason of the commandement hereby standing
still good but not in cheife: For Gods resting from
his worke is now the occasion of our <hi>Sabbath,</hi> not
from the worke of his creation, but from the worke
of his redemption, wherein hee was most remonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and even redoubled in the manifestation of all
his attributes to our view, and therefore worthy
of a select day, which yet altereth nothing of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

               <p>And therefore whereas Bishop <hi>White</hi> saith <hi>pag.</hi>

of both is morall and perpetuall, as considered in

the order, but occasionall and changeable, (as the
event hath shewne) and that each of both is morall
and perpetuall, as considered in their number being
unchangeable to any other number, and therefore
still so continueth by vertue of the morality of the
Law of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and re-given in
the fourth commandement.</p>
               <p>Now whereas you urge the appointed day of the
Passeover to bee unalterable, in paralel to the day
of Gods rest from the creation; wee clearely see the
contrary: for upon occasion the precise individuall
day of the Passeover was altered, as in the 9. of
<hi>Numb.</hi> where hee that was uncleane, or in a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was not to eate it till the fourteenth day of the

(whereof God was ever curious) but the day
is changed; even thus upon occasion is the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
altered, the number of seaven being kept entire in
this, as in the other the number of fourteene, and
yet a change made, and so both the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and
Passeover for substance preserved, notwithstanding
the circumstantiall alteration upon occasion. Yea

               <p>You say its probable, God pronounced the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
sanctified at the end thereof, when hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
which for my part I assent unto, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o in the

<hi>Moses</hi> his manner of expression in that verse, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the like in the first chapter, doe much
perswade it: for you shall find there, that when hee
hath related Gods five and sixe dayes workes as fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
and compleated by him, then followeth the
blessing upon them, so in this second chapter he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
makes the blessing to follow upon his resting as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon his working. But what you would gather
hence I doe not well perceive, yet two things in my
opinion follow very naturally.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:55806:26"/>1. That hereby God would give to <hi>Adam</hi> as
well a president as a precept to regulate and invite
his subsequent duty in the particular of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
That seeing God had chosen the seaventh day to
finish his creation in, and to rest there from, and had
thus made it knowne to <hi>Adam;</hi> with a promise
of a blessing thereunto for after-time upon due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance.
That therefore <hi>Adam</hi> and his posterity
should bee moved thereby, to dedicate the seaventh
day from the sublunary imployments of the other
sixe to bee a perpetuall <hi>Sabbath</hi> unto the Lord, not
by a bare rest (for what honour hath God by that)
but by a sanctified rest.</p>
               <p>2. That it was not meant that <hi>Adam</hi> should keepe
the seaventh day <hi>Sabbath</hi> which God rested on,
for though it was Gods seaventh day, yet it was
<hi>Adams</hi> second day, which is another reason to prove
your probability, for it is likely that God himselfe
did first rest the seaventh day, that so hee might by
his example (being revealed to that end) give man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
a patterne for ever after to doe the like, which
is very apparant, and more confirmed by the Law
concerning the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as it was afterwards renewed
upon mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> where wee are
commanded after sixe dayes labour to dedicate a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
to holines, &amp; to that end to rest from our worke
on the seaventh day, as God did from his; that so by
following his example wee might the better obey
his commandement; not that wee were to rest the
selfe-same day that hee did, but onely in similitude
and imitation, that is, to employ sixe dayes in our
necessary labour and the seaventh to rest according
to his example, that so wee might sanctifie it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

of Gods creation give place to the day of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption

            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <head>Answer.</head>
               <p>You say, it is not said in Scripture that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
commanded <hi>Adam</hi> to sanctifie the seaventh
day, and that it is one thing for God to sanctifie a
day, and another thing for him to command man to
sanctifie it: To which I answer. That God here at
the institution of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> did, as Christ by his
Apostles did at the institution of the Lords-day, that
is, by a declaratory example appoint it as a duty unto
the Church for ever after, teaching them to set aside
the seaventh day (which was then the last, and is now
the first day in the weeke) from all secular commerce
and imployment wholly to trade with God in giving
and receiving spirituall commodities. Nor is there
any difference in this case, betweene Gods sanctifying
it and his commanding it to bee sanctified by man.
For besides that, to sanctifie, ever signified to set apart
to an holy use, wee see it to bee the very voyce of
of the Scripture, how that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was made
for man; that is, for his good and benefit. For man
was to learne from it, that all his happines consisted
not in his owne labour but also in Gods blessing;
so that, though hee laboured sixe dayes together, yet
the seaventh day well observed, might doe him more
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55806:28"/>
availe then all his sixe dayes labour; And therefore,
by Gods blessing that day, is implied a reciprocall
respect both of our blessing him, and his blessing us;
and by his sanctifying is intended, his setting apart
that day, for a more speciall communion betweene
him and us, by his more speciall blessing of us, and
our more solemne worshipping of him: For surely
you will not say hee sanctified it, and blessed it, that
wee should superstitiously thinke any inherent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
or blessednes to bee in the very day it selfe;
And if not, what followes then? but that it must
needs bee meant, that wee should ever after use the
seaventh day to a blessed and holy end, and expect
a blessing from God thereon in so doing; for els to
what use was it that God did thus reveale himselfe,
and his resting, and not rather conceale it, if hee had
meant it onely for a bare narration; But it is evident
by the second giving of the Law, what, and how hee
meant it, at the first thus Master <hi>Breerewood</hi> in his
second <hi>tract. pag.</hi> 9. The <hi>Sabbath</hi> (saith hee) is
called holy, not formally, for any peculiar inherent
holines it hath above other dayes, but finally, because
it was ordained and consecrated to holy exercises in
the service of God: which gives answer to Bishop
<hi>White pag.</hi> 40<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who saith, that the second <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
expresseth not the manner how the Lord sanctified
this day, whether by imparting any speciall vertue
to it above other dayes, or by dedicating the same
to any religious service to bee performed by <hi>Adam</hi>
in the state of innocency &amp;c. You onely affirme that
it is one thing for God to sanctifie a day, and another
to command man to sanctifie it, but shew not the
difference. But you would imply, as if the sencible
refreshment of that day (in a grosse sence) were the
cause that made God, fall so farre in love with it,
where as both you and every man knowes that there
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55806:28"/>
are no passions of wearisomnes and refreshment in
God, that they should bee meant by his resting; but
that it is spoken <hi>ad captum vulgi</hi> for our better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
               <p>1. To exemplarize unto us how that spirituall
and heavenly employments should bee a refreshing
unto us in comparison of earthly imployments; and
so farre wee were capable of wearisomnes, even in
innocency, at to have found other manner of refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in divine and spirituall things then in worldly
affaires.</p>
               <p>2. To signifie the sensible refreshment and happy
alteration, that wee should have had in our heavenly
rest, from the state and condition that wee were in here
on Earth.</p>
               <p>But perchance you are of opinion with some,
that thinke <hi>Adam</hi> should not have beene translated,
but have lived immortally upon Earth had hee not
falne: But to this I answer, that by the curse
which was annexed to the tree of knowledge, wee
may know <hi>è contrario,</hi> what manner of blessing
was promised and intended by the tree of life, now
the curse involued both the first and second death,
here and in hell, so &amp;c.<note n="*" place="margin">For a further argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I wish them to consider and compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23. with <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  </note> And they indeed that are
of this opinion must prove the <hi>Sabbath</hi> not to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
our rest in heaven, nor to bee given in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
               <p>As for your criticisme in the Margin it is not worth
the weighing: The substance of Gods institution in
those words being thus much: Hee blessed the

the Lord blessed that day, that is, appointed it to bee

to <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall, but it was of force
after his Fall, excepting such things from which he
was expresly debarred by manifest voyce of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55806:30"/>
(by the curse and fiery sword) whereof the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
is none.</p>
               <p>Againe I say if this Institution were proper only to
the state of Innocency, how comes it to be renewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Israelites?</hi> and that upon the primitive reason.
Which indeed shewes it to be a thing given unto his
Church for speciall use, and to be coequall with the
Law of Nature: for wee see that so soone as God had
chosen out of the world a remarkeable and established
Church, to which he renewed the Law of Nature; he
also, as coincident there with, reneweth the Law of the
<hi>Sabbath;</hi> including and determining, in this positive
Commandement of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the Law of Nature:
like as other Commandements in the Law directly
forbid the actions of sinnes, inclusively the habits. 2.
<hi>Exconcessis.</hi> Putting the case the <hi>Sabbath</hi> never was
kept by the <hi>Patriarchs.</hi> I answer to it two things.</p>
               <p>First that neither did they keepe for the most part
the Law of Marriage, for generally they lived in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligamy,</hi>
and yet was that Law of force even in their
times, for one man to marry but one Woman. And
therfore when the <hi>Pharises</hi> alledged <hi>Moses</hi> his Law
of Divorcement for the priviledging them to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their Wives (which might better authorize their
practice therein, then the Patriarchs omission can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
our neglect of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>) but how did Christ
answer them? saith he, how was it from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
as who say, tell not mee of <hi>Moses</hi> his Law,
which you plead only to maintaine your licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and which was only a concessary Law granted
for the hardnes of your hearts; but looke beyond <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
at God, what he did in the state of Innocency,
for that must be the rule of your practice. So say I,
looke not at the errours of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> to do what
they did, when wee have Gods example to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55806:31"/>
Secondly that to draw an argument, <hi>de facto,</hi> from
mans not keeping the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> against the right and
institution of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is improper:<note n="*" place="margin">For by the same reason you may as well argue against the second exhibition of it, because of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption which for any thing wee find, it received in the time of the <hi>Babilonish</hi> Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, as against the first, because it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares not that the Patriarchs observed it in their time.</note> Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if wee consider man falne, whereby the very Law
of nature suffered, but doubtlesse the <hi>Sabbath</hi> being
grounded upon the covenant of works, and having
by the fall lost its vertue, being thereby made void, its
Law was blotted out and quite raced, by the speciall
hand and permission of God, and noe wonder, seeing
that even in innocency, nay and after his Fall too, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his abode in <hi>Paradise he remembred not to eate
of the Tree of Life, where by he should have lived for
ever, Gen:</hi> 3. 22. by a like secret but just worke of
God, (the cause wee shall further see anon) being no
Law of Nature, but a necessary improvement and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the Law of Nature in that particuler,
for the better accomodating Man for the publicke and
more solemne service and worship of his Creatour,
(and therefore was renewed when Gods Church
came to be publicke and nationall:)<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Damascen: de fide Orthod: lib. 4. cap.</hi> 24. sayth, that when there was no Law nor Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that then there was no <hi>Sabbath</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but when the Law was given by <hi>Moses,</hi> then was the <hi>Sabbath</hi> set a part for Gods publicke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note> as M. <hi>Breerwood</hi>
implyes from his observation upon the word <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
annexed: either (saith he) it is because it is not
meerely morall, and a Law of Nature as the others
are, and therefore being not so effectually imprinted
by Nature in the heart of man, needed a speciall admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
for the observance, least it should slip out of
mind &amp;c. as it seemeth it had done of a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and therefore was renewed with a <hi>Memento,</hi> as
who say, doe thou remember to keepe holy the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Day, which thy Fore-fathers have so long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.
Indeed it is evident that it was lost, and <hi>Adam</hi>
despoiled of it by his Fall, because it was written in
<hi>Moses</hi> his first Tables, which were broken and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by a Fall, to shew the fruit of <hi>Adams</hi> fall; and
renewed together with the rest of the Law in <hi>Moses</hi>
his second Tables, to shew that it suffered as well as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55806:31"/>
the rest, they in the Conscience, it in the memory at
the first ordeyning them, and therefore is renewed
together with the rest in the second, with a <hi>Memento</hi>
prefixed, for this <hi>Memonto</hi> imports more then a bare
<hi>Memorandum,</hi> even a different quality of this Law
from the rest, els it was as requisite to have beene
prefixed to the second as to the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
considering the <hi>Israelites</hi> were as inclinable to
Idolatry as they were averse from the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> see
<hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 16. And as touching Circumcision and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
and the other Commandements, of the breach
and punishment whereof, you say wee read: I answer,
that they were either the very Lawes of Nature, or
els Lawes given since the Fall and upon that occasion
(for so was Circumcision and Sacrifices) neither of
which is the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Not the Law of Nature (as
I have said) for that is only to sanctify some indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
time to the service of God, as it is likely all those
did in that time of nature betweene <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi>
(where by the way take notice of the necessarines of
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to be in the nature of a Law, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
performance of Gods solemne worship, and not
to be left at mans liberty) nor is it a Law instituted
since the Fall, for its roote groweth in <hi>Paradice;</hi> and
therefore not of force with either in that time of little
light; but lay dormant all that while, till it pleased
God againe to reveale his more solemne worship to
his more solemne Church:<note n="*" place="margin">Nehem: 9. 13. 14.</note> And not without good
reason too; for besides that our rest was lost by our
Fall till our deliverer (tipified in <hi>Moses</hi>) renewed it
unto us the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was significative in its manner
of exhibition, for during the time of the Covenant of
workes, wee see how it was appointed in order after
them, following the workes foregoing, both in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
institution from Gods owne example, and also
in the second exhibition of it to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55806:32"/>
and imply our Heavenly <hi>Sabbatisme,</hi> then to be
as well the reward of workes, as cessation from
workes; and now the Covenant of Grace is come,
it is made to precede the working Dayes, being cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
now on the first Day of the Weeke, as before
on the last, to signify that now Heaven is no longer,

betweene the Fall and <hi>Moses,</hi> which was a time
when the World (as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith) was
without the Law, that is, without the Covenant of
the Law openly revealed to them, as afterwards it
was to <hi>Israel:</hi> so in the same sence, I may say too, it
was without the Gospell, that is, without the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace openly revealed to them, as not it
is to us; because therein it had beene clouded and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significative.
Which signification Bishop <hi>White</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pag: 120, 121.</note> doth
even now commend to us from the fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement:
for (saith he) it is not now a Cypher, but the
letter of the commandement figureth, representeth,
and consequently teacheth, the leading of an holy and
religious life, that wee may at last enter the Rest of
Heaven <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 11. &amp;c. Againe I would aske you,
where you find the breach of Wedlocke found fault
withall for their multiplicity of Wives, or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
executed therfore; which being no Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but a positive Law appointed in Innocency by
God, as also was the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> not by instinct but by
revelation, therefore in those times of darknes were
they alike winked at by God, for herein they sinned
not against any knowne commandement, (after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
transgression) but of simple ignorance. And
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55806:32"/>
therfore as the Apostle speaketh, Sinne was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
when there was no Law. Here by the way
let mee take in a passage of Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> pag. 123. hee
sayth, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> thought the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to be no
part of the Morall Law, because they brake it by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
as thinking Circumcision to be the older
Ceremony, and therfore gave precedency to it (not
because it was of <hi>Moses</hi> but of the Fathers) Nay
(saith he) the <hi>Iewes</hi> so farre prized the one above the
other, that by this breaking of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> they were
perswaded verily they kept the Law.</p>
               <p>These things he observes out of that text, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 7.
22. <hi>Moses</hi> (saith <hi>Christ</hi>) gave unto you Circumcision
(not because it was of <hi>Moses</hi> but of the Fathers) and
you on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day Circumcise a man, that the
Law of <hi>Moses</hi> should not be broken. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
1. That from this text it cannot be gathered
that the <hi>Iewes</hi> thought the <hi>Sabbath</hi> no morall Law
(no more then that they can be said to thinke <hi>Christs</hi>
charitable a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of healing the Sick man, to be no morall
action because they persecuted him for it) or if they
did, it was their wilfull blindnes. For <hi>Christ</hi> makes
it plaine (that howsoever Circumcision might, and
ought (as a part of Gods service) bee done no doubt
on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day, when it fell out to be the eighth
Day according to the Law) that it was their errour,
so to overvalew Circumcision out of their superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
respect of <hi>Moses,</hi> who they made the Author of
it to them above other Lawes which are both in their
Natures higher then that, and which also <hi>Moses</hi> gave
them as well as that, as wee see in the 19 verse of that
Chapter: saith <hi>Christ</hi> there, <hi>Did not Moses give you
a Law, and yet none of you keepeth the Law,</hi> by which
is meant the Morall Law which commandeth Charity
and Mercy, which is above Circumcision, and yet you
quarrell with mee for observing this Law of <hi>Moses</hi> or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55806:33"/>
rather of God: and yet for all that are your selves so
nice in observing the performance of Circumcision
for <hi>Moses</hi> his sake which is so farre inferiour. So in
the 24 verse he exhorts them to consider it better;
that if they might and ought to observe the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
Law, on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> by doing the workes
thereof, much more ought he to doe the workes of
charity thereon, which are the duties of the Morall
Law. 2 By the same rule he affirmes the <hi>Iewes</hi> not
to beleeve the Weekely <hi>Sabbath</hi> to be a part of the
Morall Law; he may affirme them not to beleeve the
<hi>Sabbaths</hi> of Yeares to bee any commandement of
God at all; for a man may say of them in that case, as
he saith in this, that surely had they beleeved them to
be the Commandements of God, that could not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
affirmed of them which hee saith <hi>Pag:</hi> 143. to wit,
that they were long neglected, and almost forgotten
if observed at all. 3. Neither did they prize Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
as the ancienter Ceremony, because it was of
the Fathers by any thing that can be gathered from
that text, for it meanes no such thing but the quite
contrary. For <hi>Christ</hi> brings these words (not because
it was of <hi>Moses</hi> but of the Fathers) in the way of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis
in the 22 verse, to shew them their errour
in setting so high a price upon Circumcision for <hi>Moses</hi>
his sake, seeing <hi>Moses</hi> was not the first founder of it,
but received it by derivation from the Fathers. So that
the <hi>Iewes</hi> blind conceit of Circumcision in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> (were it so as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Heylin</hi> allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth)
detracts no more from the morality of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
being a meere misprision, then it did from
<hi>Christs</hi> act of Charity from being a morall action,
which may serve a caution, not to make the <hi>Iewes</hi>
superstitious practises and blind conceits a rule and
argument to regulate our doctrine and manners by,
in this particuler of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> which is too much
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55806:33"/>
leaned upon by some, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Heylin</hi> for one, who in the
beginning of his booke layeth downe this Maxime,
that wee can have no better Schoolemaster in the
things of God, then the continuall and most constant
practice of those famous men that have gone before.
Amongst which famous men hee brings in the <hi>Iewe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
in their ignorant and superstitious practices, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
Gods cleare precepts, and either shut out the
light of the word, to wrest it to his owne and other
misguidance, as he doth the text aforesaid; which may
yet bee further seene in the third mistake which hee
makes in the interpretation of those words of <hi>Christ</hi>
in the 23 verse (because I have made a man every
whit whole on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day) which pag: 121.
he makes to be spoken by <hi>Christ,</hi> in his owne defence,
in reference to the healing circumstances that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
their worke of Circumcision, that if they might
breake the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in healing the party hurt by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion,
so might he: whereas it is spoken by <hi>Christ</hi>
in opposition to the greevous and hurtfull nature of
their action; for having formerly magnified his worke
above theirs from the cause, in that his worke was an
act of obedience to the Morall Law, and theirs but to
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eremoniall, here he magnifieth it also from the
effect, in that his was an action of Mercy restoring to
perfect health, and easing of greevous paine a man
that was wofully bedrid; and theirs an action of bloud
procuring torment: (For where in all the Scriptue do
you find the healing part of Circumcision) I meane
carnally (meant or spoken of) I will conclude, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to such Expositors, both as touching their opinion
of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and expounding Scripture, as <hi>Christ</hi>
did to the <hi>Iewes</hi> concerning this matter, in the 24
verse, <hi>Iudge not according to appearance but Iudge
righteous Iudgement.</hi> Now whereas, you say that this
Commandement of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was first given to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55806:34"/>
the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when they were delivered out of <hi>Egypt</hi>
by the hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> intimating hereby as if it should
be a <hi>Iewish</hi> Type and Ceremony, and as if it should
have reference to <hi>Christ</hi> after the manner of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abrogative Ceremonies. To this I answer. That
all the rest of the Morall Law was given them upon
their deliverance as well as the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> And I doe
thinke indeed, that God did purposely take that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
the better to signifie their spirituall deliverance
by the concurrence of those things, both by bringing
them out of their <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkenes, and at the same
time making the Sun-shine of his Law (which had
been so ecclypsed ever since the fall) afresh to rise upon
them.</p>
               <p>But that the Law of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> received then a
new Institution is no way probable, but only a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
one, as did the rest of the Morall Law into
which it is incorporated, and with which it was a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the breach that <hi>Adam</hi> made,<note n="*" place="margin">And so was coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall or contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with it in the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> And as may also

which for substance is nothing else but the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
largely repeated, only being better explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the understandings, and suted to the condition
of those people.</p>
               <p>Nor againe is the <hi>Sabbath</hi> a <hi>Iewish</hi> Type, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
from the difference of their significations, for
the Typs of the <hi>Iewes</hi> primarily and principally had
relation to the State of the Church on Earth under the
time of the Gospell,<note n="*" place="margin">Their Types were promises which have their impletion with us, being shadowes of good things to come in the dayes of the Gospell.</note> and secondarily or remotely to

               </p>
               <p>I answer. They do signifie the same rest but in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent

the Rest which wee here enjoyed on Earth through

properly signifieth the rest that God rested in Heaven
from his worldly workes, and which now by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
wee shall rest with him there, and improperly

relates to <hi>Beatitudo viae,</hi> by vertue of our exchanged
condition; for what the Law could not give, that is,
any present Rest but all in future, that Faith as a
Gospell-priviledge procures us. So that wee which
doe beleeve doe enter into Rest, even this Heavenly
Rest inchoatively. The summe of the Apostles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
there being thus much, that <hi>Israel</hi> (according to
to the letter) not knowing the way of the Lord, chap.
3. ver. 10. but cleaving to the Law (which was the
ministration of death, graven in stones, that is a weake
and dead letter, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. and the ministration of
condemnation ver: 9.) forsaking the way of faith, and
the Gospell (which is the ministration of the spirit of
Power, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. and of righteousnes ver: 9.)
they therefore lost through unbeleife, both the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Rest on Earth, typified by the temporall rest of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> which is the rest and tranquility of the Soule
entred into by faith, justifying us, and procuring us
Peace with God, which should have redounded to
them by the Preaching of the Gospell (see the 2 and
6 of this 4. <hi>Heb.</hi>) and also the Rest and <hi>Sabbath</hi> in
in Heaven which God himselfe rested, and signified
on the seaventh Day after his worldly workes were
finished, which should have ensued and followed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55806:35"/>
thereupon (see the later part of the 3. and 4. verses)
whereof wee, that are Gods spirituall <hi>Israel,</hi> that
doe beleeve, are possessed already; both vertually,
in our high Priest <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> vers. 14. and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in our selves, by being partakers of this Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
through faith on Earth, which essentially condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or relates to the <hi>Sabbath-rest</hi> in Heaven (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the beginning and the ending of the 3. verse.)
Like as 5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. they are said for present
to bee <hi>blessed that but hunger and thirst after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,</hi>
and whats the reason, why, saith Christ <hi>they
shall bee filled:</hi> Christ meanes they are entred into
such an estate, as doth give them right, and will bring
them to full blessednes; They are therefore for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
truly blessed because they shall bee fully blessed:
So here in this 4. <hi>Hebr.</hi> this Gospel-rest and <hi>Sabbath-rest</hi>
are interwouen, being continuous and of the same
nature, relating one to another as true and perfect
doe. So that, I say, the Apostle meanes, that God
sware, that for their unbeleefes sake, <hi>they should not
tast nor partake, neither his rest on Earth in the Land
of Canaan flowing with milke and hony, and where
with reioycing hearts, they should liberally have eaten
the good things of the Land; (idest</hi>) the rest of the
Gospell, making their soules flow with the milke
and hony of peace of conscience and joy in the holy
Ghost, and wherein are bid to come, and eate that
which is good, and to drinke the wine on the lees,
and to fill themselves with marrow and fat things
the spirituall <hi>Israel</hi> of God: Neither that rest, by which
God himselfe rested from his works of creation verse
4. and which they also should have rested with him
in Heaven, when all things were or should bee fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by consummation, verse 3. as once they were by

inward rest and peace here, and shut out from the

               <p>And here note by the way from those words (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the workes were finished from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World in the third verse) how the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
keeps and is expressed in its supereminency
(which it had before, in its preferment to a place
among the 10. commandements, and precedency of
rest in the wildernes) for what doe they signifie, but
that they should not partake of his last and greatest
rest hereafter with himselfe in heaven, no more
then of his lesse and present rest of <hi>Canaan</hi> and the
Gospell.</p>

                  </gap>o bee no Iewish type,
from the different relations they had to Christ:
For the Iewish types did relate to him properly as
the shadow to the body being created for his sake,
but the <hi>Sabbath</hi> (as the Law) accidentally to bee
fulfilled and accomplished by him, because they had
miscarried by us. And in this doth the supereminency
of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> appeare, in that Christ for himselfe
as well as for us is a sharer in this types signification;
For in respect of this rest, is hee said to sit now at
Gods right hand, by which gesture signifying rest,
is intimated, as well his resting from the labours
and paines hee underwent here, as any other thing,
for whereas hee had the evill and wee the good of
other types, of this hee tasteth the sweet as well as
wee. And therefore hee saith to his Disciples, <hi>If
yee loved me, yee would rejoyce because I goe to my
Father.</hi> Indeed Christ onely inherited the last day
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> according to the first covenant, and hath
left the first day <hi>Sabbath</hi> for us to inherite by the
second covenant.</p>
               <p>But you will say,<note place="margin">Obi.</note> surely there cannot chuse but
bee somewhat in it, that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was instituted
by <hi>Moses</hi> upon the occasion of <hi>Mannah,</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
in the 16. of <hi>Exod.</hi> before God gave the
morall Law on mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I acknowledge,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> though the <hi>Sabbath</hi> bee of a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
nature to the other types, yet as all other
things so also the <hi>Sabbath</hi> hath reference to Christ,
in regard of the state of the Church since the fall:
For as now the whole morall Law is fulfilled by
Christ for us, and therefore was given upon their
deliverance out of their <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage: so also
is the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in its celestiall signification, made
good to us now by a new accomplishment, to wit,
onely by Christ: Hee it is now that doth onely make
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55806:36"/>
us righteous in the sight of God, and hee also it is that
now alone maketh us partakers of the rest of God;
For as they were to enjoy and feed upon <hi>Mannah</hi>
in Heaven with rest; so they were to have this rest
by <hi>Mannah (id est</hi>) Christ.</p>
               <p>And therefore I confesse that there is very much
matter in it; that thus the <hi>Sabbath</hi> doth precede the
giving of the Law<note n="*" place="margin">There was almost nothing that befell the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the time of their being in the wildernes, but it was typicall.</note> (like as there was in Gods gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the promise to <hi>Abraham</hi> before circumcision
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11.<note n="*" place="margin">And indeed they should have made that use of this order of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> being instituted upon <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> before the giving of the Law: That the law which was to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low did not frustrate the promise of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and life, which long before was made in Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. and therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as conducing to it which went before, but that the same rest or eternall <hi>Sabbatisme,</hi> which should have beene by the Law is now to bee had by Christ.</note>) and doth also follow so immediatly
the gathering of <hi>Mannah</hi> (and that a double portion
of <hi>Mannah</hi>) for hereby is signified, how that now
our heavenly rest is not procured by our owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
of the Law (though once it was annexed
to it) but that hee onely, who by faith doth gather,
and lay up a large proportion of Christ, shall certainely
have this <hi>Sabbatisme</hi> of everlasting rest in Heaven
succeed unto him, <hi>See. Rom.</hi> 5. 17. (and for the very
selfe same cause it is, that now our <hi>Sabbath</hi> is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
after the day of Christs resurrection) See also
Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> in his Christ revealed <hi>pag.</hi> 268. where
hee saith, that <hi>Mannah</hi> fell on the evening of the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> in a double quantity, signifying the double
diligence that wee must use to get Christ while
wee are in this life, which is as the even of our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<hi>Sabbath.</hi> And that upon condition of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and care here below, wee shall have supply
enough of all grace without labour and gathering,
when Christ shall bee all in all to all <hi>Israel</hi> gathered
unto him.</p>
               <p>So that, I say, the duty of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> followed
as a Law, together with the Law, for us alwayes to
observe, and that the signification of it went before,
to signifie that our claime to this heavenly <hi>Sabbatisme</hi>
is now onely by Christ.</p>
               <p>And thus you may see, how you have laid your
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55806:37"/>
foundation upon a false ground or principle, by
mistaking the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> signification, and in what
manner it referreth to Christ.</p>
               <p>And thus by consequence your whole building
falleth to the ground, although it bee granted that
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is both typicall, and (<hi>rebus sic stantibus</hi>)
hath relation to Christ also.</p>

               <p>By the first of these duties you seeme to mee to
insinuate a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> intimating by it that either the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> is meerely Iewish, or else that in all respects
both of the duty and strictnes of rest it belongeth to
us as to them. Which strictnes you prove by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
it with the other <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> which had onely
servile worke forbidden in them. The proofe I
graunt, and the thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>roved. But that the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
is therefore onely Iewish, or that wee are bound
so to observe it, I deny upon these grounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:55806:38"/>1. I deny that therefore the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is onely
Iewish. 1. Because that though this strict rest was
typicall, yet not properly Iewish, because not of the
same nature with Iewish types: For that those which
were properly types in a Iewish sence, had relation to
Christs and the constitution of his Church, as conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
properly and primarily upon Earth in its militant
being, in the time of grace during Christs regiment:
<note n="*" place="margin">For though <hi>Aarons</hi> bearing the names of the Tribes on his shoulders and breast, signified Christ doing the same (for his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) in Heaven, yet it is his elect still on Earth, not for his elect when they shall bee triumphant in Heaven <hi>&amp; sic de caeteris.</hi>
                  </note> but the signification typified in this rest was of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
nature, for propetly it signified the Church
triumphant in Heaven it selfe; which typicall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
may easily appeare, onely by comparing this
<hi>Sabbath</hi> with the other <hi>Sabbaths</hi> as shall bee seene
anon; And secondly, because that this strict rest was
no part of the substance of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but onely an
occasionall circumstance proper for the season of their
prer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>grination; For so sooone as <hi>Mannah</hi> failed that
strict rest failed, so that you never after knew them
condemned for providing their necessary food on
the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> although you find them often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
on for other breaches.</p>
               <p>2. And although that thus I deny this strict rest to be
properly Iewish, yet I deny it not to bee proper one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Iewes, but affirme it, both in respect of the
duty<note n="*" place="margin">I meane here by (duty) sanction or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive holines, else to rest is our duty as well as theirs.</note> of this rest, as also in respect of the precisenes
of it. 1. For the duty of this rest, I say that, that was
proper to the Iewes, and not to us now; Because that
types in the time of their Discipline<note n="*" place="margin">Which was the time that the letter bare sway, and (compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) not the Spirit.</note> carried with
them a positive holines, being (for its continuance)
ordinances and not accidents: But now that externall
religion which consisted in types, is properly no part
of our worship (although the thing it selfe (in this
particuler being a perpetuall type) remaineth in the
use and signification of it, but as I say not in its tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
holines or occasionall precisenes (for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven now consists in righteousnes, peace
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55806:38"/>
and joy in the holy Ghost, and not in typicall sanctions.</p>
               <p>For wee must understand that the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in it
selfe considered without accidents was of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
typicall meaning, intending the absolute rest
that should bee to the Church of God in Heaven, as
is notoriously evident in the fourth of <hi>Hebr.</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the 4. verse with the 9. and 10. For which
cause it may well bee conceived to bee holy, even
with an externall holines, as other types were, in the
minority of those typicall times, in respect of the
bare rest therein commanded; which yet in that sense
is no part of our sanctification (for our sanctification,
in respect of this rest, properly consisteth in the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
thereof spiritualized in our hearts, and in the
privative sense thereof; because our resting from
worldly affaires is a necessary privative meanes to
our sanctifying the <hi>Sabbath</hi>) Like as (in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type)
our rest in Heaven it selfe from Worldly works
will bee then no part of our positive happines, but
onely a privative helpe to our absolute glorifying
God there, as it is to our better sanctifying of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
here.</p>
               <p>And yet for all this (as I have said before) not to
rest on that day, but to imploy our selves worldlily,
in inward or outward works of mind or body, in
thought word or deed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill prove our sinne,<note n="*" place="margin">To prove that the Lords day is to bee observed with the like strictnes of us, as the ancient <hi>Sabbath</hi> was among the Iewes, a neighbour Minister brings this argument.

hereby wee both falsifie our present duty which
wee owe to the commandement, which injoyneth
it us as a significant privative meanes for sanctifying the

of the typicall sense, which consisteth in our resting
from all Worldly affaires, that wee may the more

such as are praising God, meditating of the

if they intermixed themselves with the heathen it
was a prophanation and sin unto them: So a cessation
or separation of the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> from Worldly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
is no positive part of our sanctifying
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> (though it might bee in the time of
the Iewes) for that our sanctification consisteth
in Spirit and truth, not in the literall and outward
performance of rest, and yet must wee of necessity
and duty cease that wee may sanctifie it. For
it is with the Lords-day as with all other things,
that if it bee sanctified to the end, then it is sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to the meanes: And as the Scripture saith, <hi>a man
cannot serve God and Mammon especially on this
Day,</hi> but wee should utterly forsake the one, that wee
may more compleatly cleave to the other: By Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

               </p>
               <p>2. For the precisenes of the rest which you here
speake of, I also affirme that that was proper onely
to the Iewes (as also to that time of their preregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in the wildernes) and not to us, for because it
was no part of the substance of the commandement
or <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but onely an adventitious or temporary
circumstance (for illustration sake) begun and ended
in the wildernes.</p>
               <p>For the Iewes being a people in their time under
a typicall discipline, God chose that time and this
occasion of feeding them with <hi>Mannah</hi> in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes
(which the Scripture calleth Angels food be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it came so immediatly from Heaven) the more
clearely to exemplifie the lively signification of the
<hi>Sabbaths</hi> rest, which being alwayes typicall, should
bee much more so in their time; For they having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Sabbaths</hi> commanded them with strict rest, this
must bee imposed upon them with stricter rest; else
they should not learne its proper meaning and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
And for this cause did hee command it with
so much strictnes at that time, even to their not gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
nor preparing <hi>Mannah</hi> (when as yet their other
<hi>Sabbaths</hi> were commanded them with liberty to
make ready what they should eate) the better to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the different nature, and eminent signification of
that <hi>Sabbath</hi> above the other; For the rest of the
Iewish <hi>Sabbaths</hi> were not so absolute, because they
were onely appointed to signifie the rest which every
beleever, and the whole Church hath here by Christ
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55806:40"/>
on Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, a rest but an interrupted rest, like to
their rest in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> not absolute, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
and of a mixt nature, in regard of such things
which are necessary to befall us in this life; whereas
the weekely <hi>Sabbath</hi> signified the rest which the
company of beleevers should have in Heaven (as
it is in the fourth of <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. There remaineth a rest
therefore to the people of God) which is absolute
and without any mixture, because that in Heaven
wee shall bee at Gods immediate finding, as they
were th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

never after.</p>
               <p>And therefore did so much of that rest, as wherein
it surpassed the other <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> cease for after time
both to them and us, because that God ceased to raine
<hi>Mannah,</hi> which gave life to that circumstance of
strict rest, commanded them at that time. (So that
Doctor <hi>Heylins</hi> observation <hi>pag.</hi> 145. How that
after their returne from the <hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity,
in their redresse of their <hi>Sabbath</hi> sins, they had no
lesse care of the annuall <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and <hi>Sabbaths</hi> of
yeares, then of the weekely; and the markets were
no more restrained on the weekely <hi>Sabbath</hi> then on
the annuall, might have beene spared, as making no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for his purpose.)</p>
               <p>And therefore so to rest now in our dayes, as not
to provide our necessary food,<note n="*" place="margin">And we have Christs example to warrant it in the 14. <hi>Luke</hi> by comparing the 8. 12. 13. verses.</note> seeing God ceaseth
to raine <hi>Mannah</hi> were to create types to our selves,
and to cloud that light with a vaile of our owne
making: For the extraordinary strict rest was by
God then onely commanded, when by him they were
extraordinarily accommodated to observe it, which
shall bee fulfilled onely in Heaven, when againe
wee shall onely bee at Gods immediate finding, and
shall againe eat Angel food as they did in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes.

               <p>So that in the meane time wee are not forbidden

that wee were more charitable to the soules of our
servants, then many of us are, and not on that day so
to pamper our bodies, as to starve their soules that
are under our charge, and for whom we must give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
especially if wee consider that other meaning
which God had, in prohibiting the gathering and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<hi>Mannah</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated
by divines, to wit, that it is not earthly but
heavenly <hi>Mannah,</hi> that is, the food and welfare of
our soules, which on that day our appetite ought
chiefely to stand to, as wee see by the example of
Christs Disciples, <hi>Matth</hi> 12. 1.</p>
               <p>And that this strict rest was onely proper to that
season, and not to us, I further prove it by two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts</p>
               <p>The first is out of the 16. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. compared
with the 27. where when the people went to gather
<hi>Mannah</hi> contrary to Gods commandements, <hi>Moses</hi>
rebuked them saying: <hi>Behold how the Lord hath
given you the Sabbath, therefore hee giveth you bread
for two dayes, tarry therefore every man in his place,
let no man goe out of his place</hi> (to wit, to gather <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>)
on the seaventh day; where wee see the reason
of that extraordinary rest was because of Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
provision,<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Tunius</hi> his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in his comment upon the 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verse of this <hi>chap.</hi>
                  </note> so that when the one ceased
the other which depended on it ceased also.</p>
               <p>The second place is <hi>Numb.</hi>

                  </gap>5. 32. where it is
said, that (whilest the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were in the

upon the <hi>Sabbath-day;</hi> marke the phrase (whilest
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55806:41"/>
they were in the wildernes) how it seemes to restraine
that strict kind of rest to that place and that time, for
many worse breaches were made after they were
out of the wildernes, and yet noe such punishment
inflicted.</p>
               <p>Besides it is a rule, that every morall duty may
bee performed of all men, but under the <hi>North-Pole</hi>
they cannot bee one day without fire, and they

and so not generall to all, nor perpetuall to bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

               <p>Whereas some interpret, that Law of the <hi>Israelites</hi>

bee the meaning for these reasons.</p>
               <p>1. Because of the example of the man aforesaid,
that was stoned for gathering stickes, it is probable,
to that end.</p>
               <p>2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55806:42"/>
                  <hi>Sabbath</hi> and their other <hi>Sabbaths</hi> would bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
whereas they were distinctly in expresse
termes allowed to make ready what they should eate.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, because it would have clouded the
significancy of their gathering and preparing a large
proportion of Christ, to assure them of the <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme</hi>
to come.</p>
               <p>And fourthly, because when the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day came
<hi>Moses</hi> in the 25. verse of 16. <hi>Chap.</hi> said not as before

               <p>And fifthly, Those words <hi>bake what yee will bake

good; and lay up the rest raw; but it respects the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
of their cooking it, intimating that they
might either bake it and seeth it, or bake it or seeth

without putrifying: Though it having the formerly

first (which among so many it is like was reserved of
all sorts, some raw, some baked, some boyled all which
yet purified alike) it was then indeed a wonder, that
it did not the like the second time when they kept it
lawfully; which sheweth that it was of God, and not
of the nature of the thing, both that it putrified the
first time, and that it putrified not the second time
that it was kept. But to put this upstart exposition
utterly out of question, besides the reasons aforesaid:
Let them compare the 23. verse with the 5. verse
whither <hi>Moses</hi> relates, and there they shall find God
commanding them to prepare that which they bring
in on the 6. day; and what was that? why it followeth,
twice so much as they gather daily. So that they
were to prepare all they brought in, and they brought
in all they gathered, and they gathered twice as much
as they gathered on the other dayes. So that in summe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it is euident that on the sixth day they were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare,
that is to cooke, or make ready by seething or
baking the whole double proportion which they had
gathered on that day.</p>
               <p>Nor is it without ground (as you affirme) to say,
of this mans gathering stickes, that his manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it did aggravate his offence, for there are these
grounds to induce it.</p>
               <p>1. Because, if it had beene necessary, it had not
beene unlawfull, no more then <hi>Davids</hi> eating the
<hi>Shew-bread,</hi> for Christ sayth in this very case of the
<hi>Sabbath, That God will have mercy and not Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is more then probable by the context, that
his Sinne was out of Presumption; for in the verses
immediatly foregoing it is said, <hi>Hee that doth ought
presumptuously shall bee cut off from his people,</hi> and
then followeth the instance of this mans fact, as it
were an example of this fault and this punishment,
which wee never read afterwards to be inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:55806:43"/>3. Wee find no excuse he made for his fact, so that
it either was not necessary; or if necessary, yet occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
by his wilfull and carelesse neglect of making
his <hi>Mannah</hi> ready the day before, according to the
Commandement and so not excusable.</p>
               <p>Now as touching your marginall consideration,
how that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was ordained in memoriall of
Gods resting.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, That wee doe not celebrate on
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> the memory of Gods bare resting, no
more then wee do <hi>Christs</hi> bare rising; but wee cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the consummation of the worke of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in the Creation, and of his Mercy in our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for Gods resting on that Day from the Creation,
was no part of the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> sanctification, but a cause
in him why he appointed the seaventh Day to be a
sanctifyed <hi>Sabbath</hi> unto us; no more then <hi>Christs</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
on the first Day of the Weeke was a part
of the sanctification of that Day, but only the cause
why wee sanctify it, or dedicate it to Rest and Divine
imployment ever since.</p>
               <p>And therefore in vaine doth B. <hi>White</hi> object p. 302.
that <hi>Christs</hi> Resurrection was no Commandement
containing an institution of a new <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in that he
erringly saith (as elsewhere I shew) that it was not
spent in resting but in action; seeing saith he, the ground
of the old <hi>Sabbath</hi> was Rest. But wee doe not simply
celebrate Gods rest; but his Rest or accomplishment
of our Creation, as it hath relation to us, not as that rest
simply respecteth God, for so it is, meant only as a
patterne, and serves as an occasion to beget this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as wee may see by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of expression that is used to set forth the <hi>Sabbaths</hi>
first institution, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2. 3. where Gods rest is not
only mentioned to be on the seaventh Day, but also
his compleating the worke of Creation verse. 2.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55806:43"/>
upon both which joyntly, followeth the institution of
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> verse. 3. and as wee may also see by the
prophecy in <hi>Isai.</hi> 65. 17. where the commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the benefit of one Creation shall eate out the
other.</p>
               <p>Indeed Gods resting the seaventh Day was of two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
use. The one of illustration, for thereby was sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
the Rest of Gods Church in Heaven, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in the 4 of <hi>Heb.</hi> The other was to give us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of retiring our selves from earthly things on
that Day,<note n="*" place="margin">For so on that Day God (as it were) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, only to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant there for ever after, having (as it were) been absent du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Creation. As it is said <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 22. And he left of talking with him and God went up from <hi>Abram.</hi>
                  </note> that so wee might devote it to his glory:
for this Resting of God was only set as an example
for us to imitate, the better to obey his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
               <p>But more are willing to observe his example, then
to obey his precept, that is, to cease from bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
then to be spiritually imployed in the sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that Day, by making it a Day of holy businesses,
and consequently a day of blessing. Thus using their
Rest either swinishly or superstitiously as the <hi>Iewes</hi>
did theirs<note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>But such ought to know that Gods example in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
was not the summe of his commandement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> nor the proper duty injoyned
therein, but only the occasion of his Commandement,

as B. <hi>White</hi> pag. 140. &amp;c. and Dr. <hi>Heylin.</hi> pag.
113. 114. who sayth, that two things the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
concerning the keeping holy of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
The one in relation to the people which was to rest,
and the other in reference to the Priests which was to
offer sacrifice, but of any <hi>Sabbath</hi> duties which were
to be performed betweene them joyntly (saith he)
wee find not. And againe (saith he) of any reading of
the Law, or exposition of the same unto the people, or
publike forme of prayers to be presented to the Lord
in the Congregation, wee find no footestep till <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiahs</hi>
dayes, after their returne out of the <hi>Babilonish</hi>
captivity. And againe though resting from work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
were a thing commanded, yet (sayth he) the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Rest to particuler purposes, either of
contemplation or devotion, that is not declared unto
us in the word of God, but left at large to the liberty
of the people. So also Bishop <hi>White</hi> pag: 144. saith.
That there should bee any publicke or solemne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or expounding of the Law, every Weekely
<hi>Sabbath</hi> Day, is not expresly required and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> And againe he sayth Pag:
146. After the captivity the <hi>Iewes</hi> frequented their
<hi>Synagogues</hi> upon the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Dayes, and <hi>Moses</hi>
was read: but (saith he) this was not commanded in
the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> or by any expresse sentence or Mandat
of <hi>Moses</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>Answer. These <hi>Antisabbatarians</hi> discover a strange
partiality, for where as they jeere others, for their too
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55806:44"/>
precisely calling for a <hi>Scriptum est</hi> for the proofe of
every circumstance; yet now when the point comes
in issue for themselves, they fly to the same way of
argumentation, <hi>Non invenimus, non scriptum est.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">So Bishop <hi>White</hi> pag: 41. cannot find the will of God in the 2. <hi>Gen:</hi> touching the sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And yet in the practice of our Church, there are
some things for which not having expresse Scripture,
wee lawfully build them upon proper deductions;
as for Baptizing of Children; we find in Scripture that
the Apostles Baptized whole Families, amongst which
say wee, its most likely there were some Children.</p>
               <p>But in this matter of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> no consequences
must be allowed by our <hi>Antisabbatarians.</hi> There
must be nothing but a bare rest commanded by God
to the People, no private contemplation nor publicke
devotion; although (as M. <hi>Broad</hi> sayth) God required
as a speciall Duty on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to have an holy
Convocation (and so it is expresly called <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.
3.) for it was not enough, sayth he, to worship God
privately, but they must goe to the Assemblies and
praise him in the Congregation: Idlenes being unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
at all times. And indeed if God may be suffered
to tell his owne meaning, wee find it plaine enough
what he meant (which sure must be his command,
else the <hi>Iewes</hi> erred not in seeking salvation and life by
the right cousnes of the Law, though God meant it as a

which sheweth us the meaning of those words of the
Commandement, <hi>Remember that thou keepe holy the
Sabbath Day,</hi> and the end of that Rest which in the
following words of the Commandement is enjoyned,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55806:45"/>
which (as the other Commandements) implyed more
then is expressed. And Bishop <hi>White</hi> saith pag. 146.
That some other religious actions were intended by
God as the end of the precept, notwithstanding that
no other, but Rest, was formally commanded. If
then religious actions were the end of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
surely then rest must be properly enjoyned as
the subordinate meanes usefully and significantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
to fulfill that end. And what a perversencs

                  </gap>s in matter of
fact among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> when Gods purpose (which
ought to give meaning to his Lawes, and to sway our
judgements) is both knowne and acknowledged.</p>
               <p>Which place of <hi>Isaiah</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> pag: 174 will
have to signifie a spirituall <hi>Sabbath</hi> in abstaining from
doing evill, which in the Page foregoing he sayth was
figured unto us in the fourth Commandement. But
it is apparant that the workes and pleasures there
prohibited are so our owne, as that wee have intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a liberty to use them at another time which is our
owne, though not at this time which is so especially
and extraordinarily Gods, so as the imployment of
that time ought to be Gods in like manner (like as the
workes mentioned in the fourth Commandement, are
such as may be done on the sixe Dayes though not on
the seventh) but the imployments and pleasures of
Sinne wee have no liberty to owne and use as ours.</p>
               <p>And had he consulted, Bishop <hi>Hall in locum,</hi> he
might have beene better informed of the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this text, who thus sences it. If thou shalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine
thy foote from walking (farre or servdely) on
the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and refraine thy selfe from doing thine
owne workes, or taking thine owne carnall pleasures
on my holy day, and shalt contrarily take delight in a
conscionable sanctifying of that Day of the Lord, as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55806:45"/>
that which is by thee accounted a Day of consecration
to the Lord, and worthy of great reverence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
&amp;c. Wherein he gives Bishop <hi>White</hi> the shocke
Pag: 232. who sayth, That honest and moderate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations
were not forbidden either in the Law, or in
the Prophets in literall and expresse termes (for no
other will be allowed) as also Pag: 237, sayth he, I
find no formall or expresse prohibition either in the
text of the fourth Commandement, or in any other
sentence of <hi>Moses</hi> Law simply restraining the <hi>Iewes</hi>
and <hi>Israelites</hi> from the use of honest recreations upon
their Weekly <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day.</p>
               <p>Besides, wee find the <hi>Levites</hi> were dispersed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
throughout all the <hi>Tribes,</hi> and so were many of
the Priests among the People, whose office it was to
teach the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> the difference betweene
cleane and uncleane things, and all the Statutes which
the Lord had spoken by the hand of <hi>Moses. Levit.</hi> 10.
11. So that it was their office to teach the People
(whether with the booke of the Law or without it
I will not dispute) but as it was their office to teach,
so it was the Peoples duty to learne,<note n="*" place="margin">Both which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicd <hi>Esi.</hi> 30. 20. in those words. Yet shall not thy teachers be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into a corner any more, but thine eies shall see thy tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note> which was the
fittest to be performed, on both parts, on holy times
(appointed to that end by God for holy Convocations)
and accordingly we find the practices of the religious
<hi>Shunamite</hi> to be, who (it seemes by her Husbands que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion)
was wont to make the new <hi>Moone</hi> and <hi>Sabbath</hi>
Day the ordinary times of her repairing to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
for the due celebration of them. And though it
fall out for her to be named alone, yet it is like it was
the practice of others also that feared God (though
perchance through corruption of manners among the
<hi>Iewes</hi> there was no order taken for solemne mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings)
to repaire and meete together, for the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those times, according as they could most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
accommodate themselves for that purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:55806:46"/>And to mend the matter D. <hi>Heylin</hi> Pag: 141
bringeth the authority of <hi>Gaudentius Brixianus</hi> and
<hi>Cyrill</hi> against himselfe making them speake thus. The
<hi>Iewes</hi> (sayth <hi>Gaudentius</hi>) neglecting those spirituall
Duties which God commanded on that Day, abused
the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> rest unto ease and Luxury. For whereas
(sayth <hi>Cyrill</hi>) they being free from temporall cares
ought to have imployed that Day to spirituall uses,
and to have spent the same in modesty and temperance
and in repetition and commemoration of Gods holy
word, they on the other side did the contrary wasting
the Day in Gluttony and Drunkennes and idle deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies.</p>
               <p>Moreover by his Rule wee should thinke the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
sanctifyed no <hi>Sabbath,</hi> neither the Priests that
were scattered among the People. 1. Because wee
find nothing thereof recorded. 2. By this rule of
separation of Priest and People, they should indeed
have nothing to doe towards it, for they did not offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
in the duty of sacrificing, nor were they <hi>Laicke</hi>
People to whom rest was commanded. Neither
should wee beleeve that Prophecy of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi>
(I will divide them in <hi>Iacob</hi> and scatter them in <hi>Israel</hi>)
to be performed as concerning <hi>Simeon,</hi> because wee
find not to our understandings how he was scattered,
as wee do of <hi>Levi.</hi> But it is enough for sober minds to
know, that now wee are ignorant of many things in
circumstance that were cleare to them that lived in
those times.</p>
               <p>But sayth D. <hi>Heylin</hi> Pag: 148. &amp;c. They had no
Synagogues therefore they had no Congregations
before <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, That <hi>Godwins</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In his <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ron</hi> pag: 86.</note> opinion is, that
they had Synagogues before, even so soone as the
<hi>Tribes</hi> were setled in the promised Land: but that
they were in <hi>Davids</hi> time (saith he) appeareth <hi>Psal:</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:55806:46"/>
74. 8. where it is said <hi>That they burnt up all the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues
of God in the Land,</hi> which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Heylin</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
Pag: 149. and saith. This was but a Prophecy
or prediction of <hi>David</hi> touching the future State of
the Church under <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I rejoyne. That it is true, that this is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically
spoken by <hi>David,</hi> but it is likely that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
(as other Prophets were wont to doe) tooke his
hint from things in present being to expresse future
events and things by: like as one saith of Similies, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,
and Examples, that have beene alledged by
the wise, to represent the truth, that they have beene
derived from the custome and nature of things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the knowne truth in that Time an Place.
But put case they had no Congregations before the
Captivity, nor did not celebrate the <hi>Sabbath</hi> spiritually
in holy imployments, but carnally in meere Rest,
what doth this advantage D. <hi>Heylin</hi> and his party or
damnify the <hi>Sabbath?</hi> seeing that D. <hi>Heylin</hi> himself
Pag: 143. confesseth that the breach of the Weekly
<hi>Sabbath</hi> was one cause of their Captivity, and proves
it also <hi>Neh:</hi> 13. 18. who also (he confesseth) were a
people so averse to the due observation of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
as that when God had brought them againe out
of Captivity into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and hereupon
they had bound themselves by Covenant to a due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> yet notwithstanding when
<hi>Nehemiahs</hi> back was turned they brake promise with
God Pag: 145. an unfit People to make a president:
who also (by his owne confession) were as regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
of annuall <hi>Sabbaths</hi> and <hi>Sabbaths</hi> of <hi>yeares.</hi> Pag:
143. as of <hi>Weekely Sabbaths.</hi> And againe seeing
that after their returne from their Captivity, the truly
religious seeing these Sabbath-sinnes reformed them
(which is the time that wee are to take notice of
them,<note n="*" place="margin">As wee are in like manner to take notice and of those times and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ges of the Church since Christ, which being better setled, and freed from Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilisme and heresies, gave best improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Lords Day, and not of those which either through distraction or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance give us not so faire a president.</note> for the better and not for the worse,)
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55806:47"/>
and then wee see all these imaginary arguments
confuted by their practice: for then when they
saw their errour and had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>marted for it, they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
over a new leafe, then they made them plenty of
Synagogues, and holy convocations, and the Law read
and expounded, and the Statutes of the Lord taught
them accordingly as it was the Priests and Levites
duty; all which shewes what they should have done
before they were led captive, and therfore if they did
it not at all, or if but a few of them were disposed
after this manner to keepe the <hi>Sabbath</hi> before the
Captivity, the greater was their Sinne, and the more
they deserved to be punished of God as they were,
and the lesse to be regarded of us, who ought to be
followers of men and esteemers of men as they are
followers of God.</p>
               <p>Hereunto I will annexe and abstract of Mr. <hi>Hilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shams</hi>
upon this point of sanctifying the <hi>Sabbath</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in his Lectures upon 51. <hi>Psal. Lect.</hi> 135.<note place="margin">Hildersham.</note> which
though long yet not tedious to a Godly reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
profitable. It is (sayth he) a singular good thing
to be strict in the observation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and such
a thing as God is highly pleased with, and hath beene
wont to reward wheresoever he finds it. To keepe a
bodily rest upon that Day from all our owne workes,
is but one particuler that is required of us in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> nay that is (as I may say) but
the outside of the Commandement, and concerneth
only the outward man, the outward and bodily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of it. Of the fourth Commandement, (as
well as of the rest) that may be truly said which the
Apostle speakes <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14 of the whole Law. Wee
know (saith hee) that the Law is spirituall. The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
observation of it by the inward man when wee
call the <hi>Sabbath</hi> a delight, the Holy of the Lord, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
as the Prophet speaketh <hi>Isaiah</hi> 58. 13. That
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55806:47"/>
is when wee can joy in that Day, as in the Lords own
Holy Day, and esteeme it in our Hearts a farre greater
and more honourable Day then any other Day, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the rest and performing the Duties of the Day
cheerefully, reverently, conscionably, spiritually. This
spirituall observation of it I say by the inward man
is the chiefe thing that God requireth of us in the
fourth Commandement, the outward and bodily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of it (which may be performed by a man
that hath no truth of Grace in him at all) is nothing in
Gods account in comparison of this. And yet of this
bodily observation of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> by the outward
man, the resting from our owne workes is but the
least part. The exercising of our selves upon that Day
in doing of the Lords worke, and spending of it in
such holy duties both publicke and private, as may
breed and increase grace and sanctification in us is a
greater matter and more pleasing to God a great deale
then that is. No man may thinke he hath kept the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> well because he resteth from all his Labours
of his calling upon that Day. So farre forth the brute
beast thy Oxe and thy Horse keepeth the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
as well as thou. For so is the expresse Commandement
<hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 14. Neither thine Oxe nor thine Asse nor
any of thy Cattle shall do any worke upon that Day.
Of thee that art a man and a Christian man God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
more then so, he will have thee not only to
rest from thine owne Labours, but to spend the Day
(so farre as thy bodily necessities will permit) in such
religious duties as may make thee a more holy and a
better man. The Hebrew word <hi>Sabbat</hi> (from whence
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day receiveth his name) signifieth not
such a rest as wherein one sitteth still and doth nothing
(as the word <hi>Noach</hi> doth) but only a resting &amp; ceasing
from that which he did before. So God is said <hi>Gen.</hi>
2. 2. to have rested the seaventh Day, not that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55806:48"/>
from all workes, for my Father worketh hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
and I worke, saith our Saviour <hi>Iohn,</hi> 5. 17. but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he rested from all the workes that he had made
as <hi>Moses</hi> saith there. As if he had said he rested from
Creating any thing more. And so wee likewise are
expresly commanded to rest upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> not
from all workes, but from such workes as wee did
and might do upon the sixe Dayes. God never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
us any Day to spend in Idlenes, and doing of
nothing especially not that Day. But he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us workes and duties for that Day, which hee
would have us as carefully to goe about them, as wee
are upon other Dayes to goe about the workes of our
calling, and when wee are at them to performe them
with every whit as much diligence, and care to doe
them well as wee doe any worke wee take in hand
upon the sixe Dayes.</p>
               <p>Let no man say, what would you have us to doe if
we doe no busines upon the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day? would you
have us spend the time in sleeping or talking, or sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at our doores or walking abroad? How will you
have us passe the time for the whole Day? To such
I answer. Thou hast so much worke to doe, as if thou
wert as thou shouldest bee, thou wouldest complaine
that thou wantest time to doe it. And yet this worke,
that God hath injoyned us to spend this Day in, hath
such interchange and variety in it, as no good heart
hath cause with these carnall professors <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 13.
to snuffe at it, and to cry behold what a wearines it is,
how tedious and toylesome a thing it is to keepe the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> as these men would have us to doe. But the
true Christian findeth just cause to call the <hi>Sabbath</hi> a
delight (as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> speakes 58. 13.) for
all this worke and labour that God hath injoyned us
in it. Wee have publicke duties to performe on that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55806:48"/>
Day in Gods House. And both the family duties, and
secret duties which wee are bound to performe every
Day (by the equity of that Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18, 9. 10.) to
be doubled upon the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day, that wee might
the better attend upon the profit by these holy workes,
these duties of Piety and Religion, which are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
workes of that Day. For that is the chiefe end that
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was ordained for. Remember the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
Day to keepe it holy (saith the Lord in the fourth
Commandement) Keepe the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it. I gave them my <hi>Sabbaths</hi> (saith the Lord, <hi>Ez:</hi>
20 12.) to be a signe betwixt mee and them that they
may know that I am the Lord that sanctify them. As
if he had said. He remembreth not nor keepeth the
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> he regardeth it not nor careth for it (how
strict soever he be in resting from his owne labours)
that keepeth it not holy, that spendeth it not in such
religious duties as wherein he may know and feele
by experience, that it is the Lord who (by his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances)
doth sanctifie him, who both doth begin and
increase grace in the Soule &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And pag. 704. saith he, and if it so well please God
to see men rest from their owne workes on that Day
(which yet as I told you is but the least thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the right observation of it) you may bee
sure he is much more pleased to see men spend that
Day in doing of his worke in exercising themselves
in those duties of Piety and Mercy which hee hath
appointed to be done upon that day, especially in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them keepe his <hi>Sabbaths</hi> spiritually and conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably.
Certainely they that doe so shall be sure to be
blessed and rewarded of God for it. To this purpose
it is worth the observing that as our Saviour sayth,
<hi>Marke.</hi> 2. 27. That the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was at the first made
for man, for the great benefit and behoofe of man.
Man could not (no not <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency) have
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55806:49"/>
beene without it, but with great danger and losse unto
him. So the Holy Ghost sayth there twice of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
Gen.</hi> 2. 3. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 11. that he never said of
any other Day. That the Lord blessed that Day, that
is, appointed it to be a meane of a greater blessing to
man (if hee kept it as God had commanded him to
doe) then any other Day, or any of the ordinary
workes of any other Day can possibly be.</p>
               <p>Two sorts of blessings there be which the conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
observer of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> shall be sure to receive
by it.</p>
               <p>1. The first are spirituall, and they indeed are the
chiefe blessings of all, because they are durable and
lasting, and because they concerne the Soule which
is the chiefe and most pretious part of man. And for
these was the <hi>Sabbath</hi> chiefely ordained, that God
might by it in the use of his Ordinances enrich our
Soules with spirituall blessings in Heavenly things.
So the Lord saith, <hi>Ez:</hi> 20. 12. that he gave his <hi>Sabbaths</hi>
to his People to that end that they might know that
he was the Lord that sanctified them. Wee shall find
and know that the Lord will sanctifie us, both begin
and increase saving grace in our Hearts, if wee keepe
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> conscionably. Yea the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
<hi>Isaiah</hi> 56. 6. 7. to every one that keepeth
his <hi>Sabbath</hi> from polluting, that he will make them
joyfull in his House of Prayer. And <hi>Isaiah</hi> 58. 13,
14. That if a man shall keepe the <hi>Sabbath</hi> heartily
and spiritually, then he shall delight himselfe in the
Lord. By these two places it appeareth that God hath
bound himselfe by promise to them that keepe his <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
(not only to worke sanctification, increase of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
and power over their corruptions which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
in that former place of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> was the very
end he gave his <hi>Sabbaths</hi> for, but also) by his spirit of
adoption to encrease in their hearts a lively sence of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55806:49"/>
his favour, assurance that he heareth and accepteth
their Prayers, Peace of Conscience, Ioy in the Holy
Ghost which are blessings the Christian Soule pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth
above all things in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Why (may you say) may not a man receive
increase of grace and spirituall comfort in the use of
Gods ordinances on any other Day, but only on the
<hi>Sabbath?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes verily, but these promises may give
him assurance to receive them more richly and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
upon the <hi>Sabbath</hi> then on any other Day.</p>
               <p>2 The second sorts of blessings that the conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
observers of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> receive by it are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
for concerning them also wee have a promise,
<hi>Isaiah 58. 4. Gen.</hi> 18. 13: 48. 4. Psa: 1. 19. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this point with the authority and judgment of
a learned Bishop now living Bishop <hi>Hall: Decad:</hi> 6.
<hi>Epis:</hi> 1. Gods Day (sayth he) calleth for another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
then doe common Dayes. The same Sunne ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
on this Day and enlightens it, yet because the Sun
of righteousnes arose upon it, &amp; gave a new life unto
the World in it, and drew the strength of Gods mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

the Psalmist, <hi>This is the Day which the Lord hath
made.</hi> Now I forget the World and in a sort my
selfe, and deale with my wonted thoughts as great

Hearing, Preaching, Singing, good conferences
are the businesses of this Day, which I dare not bestow
on any worke or pleasure but Heavenly. I hate su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition

                  </p>
                  <p>Ans: 1. If by one Sinne then by another and then
every man profaned the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Any Day in the Weeke was as well defiled by

                  <p>The punishment for prophaning the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was

                  <p>Now although the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was defiled by worke
and whosoever wilfully or carefully did any worke

            <div type="answer">
               <head>Answer.</head>
               <p>Herein you go about to prove' that the' <hi>Sabbath</hi> was
either only or chiefely sanctified by resting from
Worke.</p>
               <p>First, by your owne <hi>Analys</hi> of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
wherein you would make God to put
the chiefest part of the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> sanctification in Rest.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by your proofe out of <hi>Ier:</hi> 17. 24.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by proving the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to be prophaned
by workes, which againe you prove by shewing how
he that gathered Stickes on that Day was more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
punished, then many a one that other wayes see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
more to prophane it.</p>
               <p>1. For your proposition it selfe, which is that the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> was sanctified by resting from worke.</p>
               <p>To this I answer. I wish the <hi>Geneva</hi> note upon
the title of the 92 <hi>Psal:</hi> which is a Psalme or Song for
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day, that this teacheth that the use of
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> standeth in praising God and not only in
ceasing from Worke. Whereunto I adde Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>
upon the 2. of <hi>Gen:</hi> saith he, God did not simply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
man to keepe the seaventh Day holy as if he
were delighted with rest, but to the end he being free
from all other businesses might more willingly and
quietly apply his mind to the Creator of the World.
Furthermore saith he it is an holy rest which delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
Men from the impediments of the World, that
they may wholy bend themselves to the service of
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:55806:51"/>Secondly, I answer that it was neither only nor
principally sanctified by resting, for then any labour
even about the worship and service of God had beene
unlawfull, and by this doctrine the best way for them
to have sanctified it, had beene to have laine all Day
in their Beds,<note n="*" place="margin">But as one observes upon Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Adam</hi> to worke in Innocency, that Idlenes was never Mans happines, much lesse his holines.</note> and they had sanctified it better in the
Night then in the Day, and every man in his owne
House then in publicke Congregations, which but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
now you your selfe contradict.</p>
               <p>Which Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> would have us beleeve it is,
whilest every where he would perswade us. That
holy labours and necessary were breaches of it among
the <hi>Iewes,</hi> such as were Circumcision offering sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and fight or flight in time of danger &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Whereas hee ought to know that rest from our
owne workes is only enjoyned (<hi>Isai:</hi> 58. 13.) that
so wee may be imployed in Gods.<note n="*" place="margin">And therefore <hi>Exod:</hi> 35. 2. It is called a <hi>Sabbath</hi> of rest to the Lord, that is, to the Lords use, like as the same phrase in the 5 verse shewes, where they are bid to take from among them an offring to the Lord.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore was not the worke of Circumcision
unlawfull though a painefull one, nor the worke of
offering Sacrifices though a toylesome one, much lesse
workes of mercy and Charity. For <hi>Christ</hi> sayth,
<hi>Math:</hi> 12. 12. That it is lawfull to doe well on the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> Day. No worke was a breach of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
which was either in it selfe (as were religious
actions) or upon occasion lawfull to be done upon the
<hi>Sabbath.</hi> And therefore in the beginning of that
chapter he makes the Disciples rubbing the Eares of
Corne for hunger (occasioned in his service on the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> Day) to be equall with the Priests sacrificing
in the service of the Temple, which was in it selfe no
prophanation of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> (though in the 5 verse
<hi>Christ</hi> said, Have yee not read in the Law how that on
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day the Priests in the Temple prophane
the <hi>Sabbath</hi>) for wee read no such thing in the Law,
that they prophaned the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he meanes they did that on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55806:52"/>
the <hi>Pharisees</hi> might, through their superstitious mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison,
as well call a prophanation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
and count unlawfull as that action of his Disciples.
I deny not, but Rest from worldly workes was a
positive part of the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> sanctification in the time
of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> because of the holines which did then
accompany it being a Type (and that transcendent to
all the rest) as I have often said.</p>
               <p>But that it was ever meant to be either the whole
or principall part of the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> sanctification I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
deny: although they abusiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly made it so, even
to the neglect of acts of mercy (for which they were
blamed by <hi>Christ</hi> the Lord of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> as you
say) by a superstitious misinterpretation of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
(agreeing with selfe-love and sensuality)
as you doe by falsifying the true sence of the word
<hi>Sanctifie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. To come to your <hi>Analys</hi> whereby you would
prove your position to it I answer. That in it you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the end and the meanes by making the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
it selfe which consisteth in the first and
last words to be expounded by the middle part, as if
sanctification which alwayes signifieth to set apart to
an holy use should be properly interpreted by resting
from worke: as if God would put up with negative
service only; or as if that which is negative could be
the principall matter of a precept affirmative. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the rest which you would make to be the only
interpretation, is chiefely and properly of a subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
nature, serving as a significant accomodation to
the maine duty of holines commanded as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
               <p>First, by the Rest which was commanded them on
their other <hi>Sabbaths</hi> was it not chiefely <hi>removendo
prohibens,</hi> by removing an impediment the better to
devote them to services which was then enjoyned
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55806:52"/>
them, of feasting and sacrificing and humbling their
Soules, and doth not the same hold good to us in our
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> which is to be sanctified by all these at once
in a spirituall sence. That it was so to them is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the 23. <hi>Levit:</hi> 27. 28. 29. 30. Where God
having instituted the day of attonement, telleth them
how they were to sanctifie it in the 27 verse, to wit,
it shall be an holy convocation to you, and yee shall
afflict your Soules, and offer an offering to the Lord:
and then in the 28 and 29 verses he bids them, yee
shall doe no worke in that same Day, and what's the
reasons why, it followes, for it is a Day of atonement
to make an atonement for you before the Lord. For
whatsoever Soule it is that shall not be afflicted in
that same Day hee shall bee cut off from among the
people. As who say, yee have other matters in hand
(then worldly busines) on that Day, which yee must
wholy intend, and therefore surcease such things and
such imployments as may take you of from such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or hinder the fitnes of your hearts in them (which
is a thing too well knowne to them that worship God
in spirit, how that a small carnall imployment is found
oft times an hurtfull distraction to their spirit) and
therefore it followes in the 30 verse whatsoever Soule
it bee that doth any worke on that same Day &amp;c.
Which is a lively demonstration of the nature of the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> Rest in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s first and chiefe respect. And ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
by the way, how here at large, as in the fourth
Commandement in briefe (though in other places of
Scripture it also is manifested at large) God first layeth
downe the maine sanctification of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> before
he prescribe the meanes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in that this rest is so farre approved of
God as it conduceth to spirituall labour, and againe
spirituall labour is no where condemned though it
bee a breach of rest. For rest (take it as it was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55806:53"/>
intended in its first institution, without the

part of prayer, and yet omitted is an impeachement
to it, because joyntly considered it is an ordinance,
and of necessary) and seasonable use at that time:
And as in fasting wee must not onely fast from things
nourishing (reall necessity ever excepted) but much
more from things pleasing; so in keeping the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
wee ought not to rest onely from profitable labours,
but more especially from distracting bodily recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
because the <hi>Sabbath</hi> should bee both our full
delights and full imployment as Heaven shall be
hereafter: For the commandements being <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochicall,</hi>
as therefore in the commandements touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
adultery and murder the thoughts and words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
thereunto are forbidden: So in this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
touching the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as works are forbidden
so worldly thoughts whence worldly works issue
(as adultery from lust) and the discourse of worldly
things, so likewise <hi>paritate rationis,</hi> pleasure must
needs bee included; For labour being forbidden as an
impediment, consequently therefore whatsoever
proveth an impediment is forbidden. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
as the rest being <hi>Synechdochicall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus <hi>Musculus</hi> least (saith hee) God should
seeme to speake of some prophane idlenes, hee saith
not remember that thou keepe the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> but
that thou hallow the <hi>Sabbath-day.</hi> Now to hallow
(saith hee) that day is to make the rest of it devout,
holy, and imployed to godly exercises, whereby the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55806:53"/>
mind may bee instructed, exercised, and grounded in
things concerning godlines. And <hi>Cyrill</hi> (quoted by
Doctor <hi>Heylyn pag.</hi> 141.) in <hi>Amos</hi> 8. and <hi>Gauden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
Brixianus</hi> speake to the selfe same purpose.</p>
               <p>The Iewes (saith <hi>Gaudentius</hi>) neglecting those spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
duties which God commanded on that day
abused the <hi>Sabbath</hi> rest unto ease and luxury. For
whereas being free from temporall cares (saith <hi>Cyrill</hi>)
they ought to have imployed that day to spirituall
uses, and to have spent the same in modesty and
temperance, and in the repetition and commenmora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods holy Word, they on the other side did
the contrary wasting the day in Gluttony and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes
and idle delicacies.</p>
               <p>And whereas you would bring the reason which
God alleadgeth from himselfe in the commandement
to make it good: That to rest on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is the
adequate sanctification, with this I would have you
compare that speech of Christ (who by your owne
acknowledgement was Lord of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>) I will
have mercy and not sacrifice; where hee blameth the
Iewes, notwithstanding the typicall holines of this
rest in their times, for their not sanctifying the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
with acts of mercy, through their superstitious
misprison of this rest. Also consider how that God
intended his spirituall service and worship in the
very commandements of the second Table, much
more then in those of the first. Againe I oppose
hereunto the reason which God giveth from his owne
example, in the fourth of <hi>Deut.</hi> to wit, his not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to them in any likeness, to cry downe their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Images to worship them, which yet is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to prove that their not making of Images
(though hee was to bee obeyed and imitated therein)
was his proper worship or any part thereof, but onely
in a negative sense, which doth exclude some thing
but conclude nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:55806:54"/>And therefore that which <hi>Zanchy</hi> saith of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
rest is proper to the busines in hand. <hi>Isti jube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur
non simpliciter quiescere, sed quiescere ut ipsi
suo modo Sabbatum sanctificare possent.</hi>

of people, for the strangers that knew not the
true worship had their <hi>suo modo,</hi> nay and the Cattle
theirs, and so the Iewes that knew it under types and
figures had also their <hi>suo modo,</hi> and so have wee now
ours.</p>
               <p>And indeed if that rest was principally respected;
why was not other cattle and creatures commanded
to bee kept from labouring as well as the Oxe and
the Asse: Why were they not as well to stoppe up
the Bee-hives on the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> to keepe them
from working like as they doe in Winter, to preserve
them from destroying; But wee see that onely the
labours of those beasts are forbidden, which might
bee a distraction to mans better imployments and
sanctified rest; which appeareth in that for the better
accommodating us to holy duties (as for the hearing
of a Sermon) wee may interrupt the rest of our Cattle
(though other wayes commanded) and use their
labour on that day; as in the example of the Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4 22. 23.</p>
               <p>Lastly I would aske you wherein wee shall san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
our everlasting <hi>Sabbath</hi> in Heaven, whether
by a bare resting from our works or by positive
worship. Surely you will say by positive worship;
And yet I deny not, but our rest will bee an happy
meanes thereunto; And so much is signified now by
our <hi>Sabbaths</hi> rest: For such as is the Antitype, such
is the type.</p>
               <p>Thirdly touching your proofe cut of <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 24.
I answer.</p>
               <p>1. That the reason of Gods taxing them with this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55806:54"/>
was, because it was a fault most obvious (as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in that amongst other workes, hee instanceth
most their bearing of burthens as the thing most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and abusive) so doth hee complaine of their
prophaning the <hi>Sabbath</hi> by working in it, because
that being a fault most obvious they would bee the
soonest convinced thereby; For man can naturally
better conceive of his outward grosse and sensitive
errours, then of his spirituall ones, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
was implyed therein. Like as at the day
of judgement hee will judge us by our works, and
yet therein wee shall answer for our infidelity, for
in the one hee involues the other.</p>
               <p>God tooke the same order with the Iewes under
the Law that Christ did under the Gospell, that is,
still to blame them for those faults which were either
most apparant or most proper to those times and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
knowing that if they failed in those they must
needs faile in the more materiall; But when they
were diligent to doe the outward duty, and neglected
the inward then God blameth them in that respect
also: As wee may see by that which hee telleth them
touching their sacrifices, how that hee that sacrificed
a sheepe, was as if hee cut of a dogs necke: whereas
had they neglected to have sacrificed hee would first
have called on them for his outward service; because
without that the inward could not bee performed:
So of the <hi>Sabbath-rest;</hi> hee must first bring them
from prophaning the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> before hee could
bring them to a due sanctifying of it: For except they
made good their bodily rest, according to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
they could never meditate rightly their rest
in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Againe in the second place, I say, that though God
in this 17. Ier: did thus sharpely reprove their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> by working, yet hee never meant
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55806:55"/>
that in resting consisted its chiefest sanctification, as
may appeare by the 58. of <hi>Isa.</hi> 13. Which Master
<hi>Calvin</hi> in his institutions upon the fourth comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
bringeth to prove that we were to rest from
our works that day, that God might worke his works
in us, and that the Prophets did call backe the Iewes
from thinking themselves discharged by their carnall
rest.</p>
               <p>In the third place I answer, that this rest being a
transcendent type, and of speciall sanctitie in those
times, could not bee neglected, no not in the letter of
it, without grosse prophanation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the injury done to the usefull signification of it;
because that then it was a part of the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
I meane, of its very positive sanctification:
And therefore had God just cause to complaine his
<hi>Sabbaths</hi> were not sanctified, when they were so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
prophaned.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, now I come to speake to your third
proofe touching the prophanation of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi>
which is say you by working, to which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
               <p>First, that a man by working (if it bee seasonable)
sanctifieth the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and againe by resting, if it bee
carnall and unfruitfull, he may prophane it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to argue from the prophaning to the
sanctifying is no good argument, as because works
prophane it, therefore rest onely sanctifieth it. It
may as well bee argued from the second commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that hee that doth not make Images to bow
to them, is consequently a true worshipper of God.
For though it bee most true, that every one, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
not from worldly imployments on the seaventh
day, doth prophane the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and breake the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.
Yet on the contrary, every one that doth
rest cannot bee said to sanctifie it, no more then every
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55806:55"/>
one, that doth not make Images to bow to them,
may bee said to worship God aright, and yet every
one that doth make Images to bow to them, doth
prophane the true worship of God. So Master <hi>His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersham,</hi>
to keepe a bodily rest on that day from all
our owne works is but the outside of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
and concerneth onely the outward man, and
the outward and bodily observation of the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
(which, as the whole Law, is spirituall)
and may bee performed by a man which hath no
truth of Grace in him at all. Thus also <hi>Musoulus</hi>
on the fourth commandement after hee hath shewne
how those words of the commandement (<hi>Thou shalt
in it doe no manner of worke</hi>) doe forbid all manner
of lets which may hinder the sanctifying of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
because (saith hee) that is to bee done not with
a patched mind, but with all our indeavour, and with
a whole mind. In his conclusion, speaking against
such as prophane the <hi>Sabbath</hi> by licentiousnes, the
very cattle (saith hee) doe use the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then wee, which though they doe nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the sanctifying of it, yet their rest is so farre
forth to bee preferred, that they doe nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the holy rest is prophaned and defiled, and the eyes
of Gods Majesty offended.</p>
               <p>As concerning the proofe you bring to backe this
last argument withall, to wit, the example of Gods
severe punishing worke though but a small one, when
yet sins and other things which might seeme more
to prophane it were passed over, I answer:</p>
               <p>First, that God was curious in maintaining in violate
their discipline in their dayes, which was then both
his owne ordinance and the proper meanes of their
instruction (for shadowes were then substances) so
that if they were remisse in observing to doe the type,
such as was this rest, they sinned both against God
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55806:56"/>
and their owne soules, and under went a double guilt
of punishment and losse, like as wee, under the Gospell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
doe sin more in not beleeving in Christ, then in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the whole Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I say, that God was the severer in mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and punishing this, because else they would have
beeue apter to thwart it, judging of it rather by mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of fact, then by matter of duty or command, which
I thinke was a notable aggravation of his sin that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
stickes, judging the offence by the thing; As
its like <hi>Adam</hi> did (and as you doe afterward) when
hee ate the apple, which happily God fore seeing
imposed the greater judgement to over-awe
him.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>Sabbath-rest</hi> (as that of eating the apple)
not being a Law written in the conscience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they not having their conscience so lively in
that as in other sins, had need of the stronger barre
to keepe them of from breaking it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this instance you give was whilest they
were in the wildernes (as the Scripture phraseth it
<hi>Num.</hi> 15. 32.) when the type was more lively and
significative, and they better in abled to observe it,
and therefore was the sin so much the more offensive
and presumptuous, and consequently worthy of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
punishment.<note n="*" place="margin">Hee himselfe typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that the neglect of Gods rest brings certaine and unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable ruine.</note> Which you never read of, to
bee executed after they came out of the wildernes,
and yet were their prophanations in regard of their
works farre greater.</p>
               <p>As for the mans carrying of his bed, I answer to
it two things.</p>
               <p>First, that it was no breach of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but a
manifestation of the miracle by a lawfull action (I
meane lawfull though Christ had not commanded
it) being necessary, because happily hee had never a one
else (being a poore man) to ly on at night: Or els in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55806:56"/>
his absence his bed might have beene wronged or
stolne.<note n="*" place="margin">See pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>alell to this <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 6.</note> And put case hee had left it and in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
it had beene stolne, and hee meeting the theife,
the theife threw it downe and runne away, might
not hee in your opinion have then taken it up and
carried it home? And why then might not hee law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
carry it home before to prevent stealing, as after
it was stolne: And wee have reason to beleeve it to
bee commanded by Christ to one of these ends: For
it is like hee was poore or had no body to watch it,
nor yet to carry it for him; for then hee might have
had some man to have put him into the Poole when
the water was troubled, but hee had none. In like
case I appeale to your opinion whether you thinke
it a breach of the <hi>Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for a Iew in his <hi>Sabbath-dayes</hi>
journey finding a cloake-bagge or a bagge of
money, to take it up and carry it away least if hee
leave it there till the next day, to avoide carriage on
the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> another that hath as little right to it as
hee, find it and carry it for him.</p>
               <p>Secondly I answer, that Christ neither could nor
did command him to breake the <hi>Sabbath</hi> or prophane
it. First, I say hee could not, for that tye which the
Law hath upon us, by the condition of our nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wee are borne under it; it had upon Christ by
the condition of his office and voluntary susception
because hee was made under it: So that it behoved
him to fulfill all righteousnes: And therefore hee is
said in that respect to have beene obedient to his
parents, though hee were not onely the Son of Mary
but the Lord of Mary: Therefore when Scripture
denieth all sin to have beene in him, it implieth that
hee was exactly conformable to the Law, in doing
all that it requires, and in leaving undone all that it
forbids. Secondly, I say hee did not, upon that reason
which you alleage, to wit, as being Lord of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:55806:57"/>
For 1. Though indeed hee was Lord of the
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> yet in his humane nature, wherein hee
was under the Law, hee was not to shew his fove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
authority to the breach of any part of it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
morall or ceremoniall, for so it behoved him
to fulfill all righteousnes. Secondly, that place of
Scripture whence you borrow your reason is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
by you; For those words, the Son of man is
Lord even of the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> doe not intend that
Christ is Lord of it as you meane, for him to keepe
or breake it at pleasure; But Son of man signifieth
mankind, as is evident. 1. by comparing the 27. and
28. verses of the second of <hi>Mar.</hi> The 27. verse saith,
<hi>The Sabbath was made for Man, and not Man for
the Sabbath,</hi> and then in the 28. verse it followeth
with this word of coherence, therefore the Son of
Man is Lord &amp;c. where the one and the other doe
intend man in genere and for Christ if you will se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
because that in that action it was not Christ
himselfe that Lorded it over the <hi>Sabbaths-rest,</hi> but
his Disciples, for though it was done in his service
yet not by his commands as you reason, but of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for the releife of their necessity.</p>
               <p>But to conclude I see not then by these arguments
how your first<note n="*" place="margin">To wit in the sense.</note> proposition can be made good. For
if so bee rest sanctifieth the <hi>Sabbath</hi> then doth man
and beast sanctifie it alike, then is there no difference
betweene the stranger and the <hi>Israelite,</hi> nor betweene
the <hi>Israelite</hi> and his oxe.</p>
               <p>If you had said that not resting in the prophaning
of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as bowing to Images is the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Gods worship wee had easily agreed: But
that by the sense of the fourth commandement it is
properly or principally<note n="*" place="margin">Though occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and by accident I acknowledge it to be a part of the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> sanctification in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </note> the sanctifying of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
I can no more yeild you, then that not bowing
to Images is properly or principally the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55806:57"/>
of God by the sense of the second commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ohi.</hi> But you will say, is not Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
kept in both these, when they doe not bow
to Images, and when they doe not labour but
rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer that the things, which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
properly and principally strike at are not
observed thereby; For these are rather preventions
of Gods dis-worship then any parts of his worship;
And hee that knoweth these commandements aright,
knoweth they intend doing as well as not doing:
And therefore hee that out of a good conscience for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth
to doe the one (wherein indeed he negatively
keepeth the commandement) will by vertue of the
same conscience set you the other. For otherwise hee
should give but a poore account to his Master at the
last day, who when hee asketh him what hee hath
done, answereth him with what hee hath not done,
and when hee asketh him an account how hee hath
imployed his <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and what glory and worship
hee hath done him in them, hee answereth him,
I never prophaned thy <hi>Sabbaths</hi> with bodily labour
but alwayes rested on that day, neither did I ever
bow to an Image, surely his wayes shall bee as his
that hid the talent in a napkin, for hee hath reason to
looke for no better, thinking of God as hee did, that
hee was hard in his commandements and therefore
hee kept them as hardly in the negative and not in
the affirmative.<note n="*" place="margin">Whereas Bishop <hi>Lake</hi> in his Sermons <hi>pag.</hi> 213. saith, that nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are but to attend affirmatives and God doth not reward the ferbearance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

forbeare the sins of the second commandement, and
yet bee a damnable breaker of that commandement:
for God commands not onely to turne from dumbe

               <p>And for authority sake take notice what <hi>Thomas

of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> saith hee two things are to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,

                  </gap>d in that
which hee saith (remember that thou sanctifie the
<hi>Sabbath.</hi>) for those are said to bee sanctified in the
Law which are applied to divine worship; But the
other is the cessation of works signified when it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <p>6. By some mens Doctrine the legall <hi>Sabbath</hi>

<hi>Sabbath</hi> is the onely <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the judgement
of <hi>Augustine, Tertullian, Chrysotome &amp;c.</hi> which
Christians ought to keepe.</p>
               <p>7. The legall <hi>Sabbath</hi> was a type of the heavenly
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> it was a shadow of the blessed rest to come,
of which matter in the next <hi>Chap.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <head>Answer.</head>
               <p>To the first of these I answer:</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Israelites</hi> were a people contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the outward part, not savouring the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55806:59"/>
and spirituall strength of things (which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
the fault of all men till they bee better taught
of God) and for this reason God ever and anon made
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to follow as a Counter-checke to their
carnall zeale.</p>
               <p>And therefore when the making of the Tabernacle
was commanded, the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was even then exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from its very worke, to shew them, that it was
other worship that hee expected, and that they were
not to repose their happines and confidence in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things, but in God: And as therefore in the
time of <hi>Mannah</hi> hee commanded his <hi>Sabbath,</hi> to
shew them, how that it was hee, and not that, which
nourished them: So likewise when the Tabernacle
was commanded the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was urged upon them
in this 31. <hi>Exod.</hi> to shew them, how that it was
God and not it that sanctified them: And therefore
did the one give place to the other.</p>
               <p>So that the end of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> as it is expressed in
this portion of Scripture betweene the 12. and 18.
verses seemeth rather to consist in these words of
the 13. verse, <hi>for it is a signe betweene mee and the
children of Israel, for ever that yee may know, that
I the Lord do sanctifie you</hi> (Those words which in
the 17 verse make mention of the Worlds crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Gods rest, being rather added as a reason in
this place to enforce this end) For here it is not the
meaning of the holy Ghost to discourse of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
simply, but onely occasionally, as appeareth by the
coherence of the 11. 12. and 13. verses, where the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> is urged with a verily or a notwithstanding
as it is in the <hi>Geneva,</hi> that though hee had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the making of the Tabernacle; yet hee would
not have them repose their Religion or content
in this outward Tabernacle or Temple (for God
dwelleth not in things made with hands) but that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55806:60"/>
they should looke to the spirituall part the Temple
of their hearts, that they should bee more carefull
to build up and keepe that in repaire, which did more
properly distinguish them to bee the sanctified <hi>Israel</hi>
of God. Whosoever therefore is an <hi>Israelite</hi> indeed
let him looke to make good this signe of his sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
the sanctifying of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> by spirituall
worship and service, which doth excellently approve
it to his conscience that God hath sanctified him, that
is chosen him to bee his, and thus it is made holy to
him (as it is phrased in the 14. verse) that is, a day of
blessing and sanctification, for therein God bestoweth
the best of his blessings, because on that day wee are
or ought to bee wholly imployed in the best of his
ordinances, such as belong to our soules and not to
our bodies. Therefore ought not this day to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
with bodily imployments (by such as are the
<hi>Israel</hi> of God) but to bee dedicated, from earthly
labour to an heavenly rest, after the example of God:
For when the hands cease from one imployment,
the heart is fittest for another. And as one well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth.
The <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> signified that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were the Lords, and therefore they abstained
from their owne works to doe the Lords.</p>
               <p>To the second end gathered out of the 5. of <hi>Deut.
That they might remember their deliverance out of
Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, that this is an Argument to incite them
to the better observance of this duty of sanctifying
the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and their more willing allowance of it
in their servants; For the 15. verse is thus much, <hi>That
whereas when thou wast a servant in the Land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
thou couldst not have sanctified a</hi> Sabbath <hi>unto
mee, having no rest for thy selfe, because of thine into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
pressures, which I who am the Lord thy God
have set thee free from, and therefore command no more
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55806:60"/>
then I have enabled thee to fulfill, therefore doe I now
expect that according to my commandement, and for
my mercies sake shewne to thee in working thy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
thou shouldest observe the Sabbath to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Gods mercie thus preached unto them must
needs conduce much to the gaining backe from them
both mercy and obedience. And for this cause it is
that this their deliverance is made the Preface to the
whole Law, sutable to that in the Gospell, that wee
being delivered from the hands of our enemies might
serve him without feare.</p>
               <p>And both this (which was a signification of our
redemption) and that other example of Gods resting
from the creation, are propounded as fit Theames for
them to improve and exercise their minds upon, to
the glorifying of him, and bettering themselves on
that day; both which were much to one purpose to
shew forth the wonderfull loving kindnes of God
to his people and Church, in that hee made all things
for them, even for them whom hee had delivered out
of <hi>Egyptian</hi> thraldome: which admirable mercies of
his, hee would have them take speciall notice of, and
turne to praisefull <hi>Haleluiahs</hi> on that day, (which
hee hath sanctified to himselfe) without wearisomnes,
cheerefully and with delight, as the Angels and Saints
in Heaven keepe their <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this typicall and corporall deliverance of the
Iewes bee such a perswasive reason of their sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> shall not our deliverance much
more stirre us up to doe the like?</p>
               <p>The substance of your marginall consideration
hath beene handled before, onely I adde this, that a
commandement is not made speciall by every motive,
but that it may bee in force to mee, though every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
brought to enforce it, properly concerne not my
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55806:61"/>
particular. Else a man may oppresse a stranger that hath
not beene himselfe stranger in the Land of <hi>Egypt:</hi>
Though this motive bee onely proper to them in the
letter, yet common to us in the spirituall and better
sense, and therefore enforceth the commandement
upon us, as well as on them.</p>
               <p>Touching your third end deduced from <hi>Exod.</hi>
23. 12. where God commanded the <hi>Iewes</hi> to rest
from their sixe dayes worke on the seaventh day, that
so their Cattle, Servants, and Strangers might bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, that this commandement doth
neither imply that a bare rest doth sanctifie the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
nor that they were to use the <hi>Sabbath</hi> as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis
betweene two weekes the better to passe
from labour to labour, but the intent of it was.</p>
               <p>1. The better to set forth the heavenly rest which
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> signified, for it being thus absolutely and
universally commanded both to them and every
thing that was properly theirs, it sheweth the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and universall rest which every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to God shall bee possessed of in Heaven,
as well as God himselfe. For as God rested from
his works so shall they from theirs, to enjoy an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and perpetuall refreshment with him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>2. That to the practices of piety (which they were
to performe towards God on this day) they should
adjoyne the practices of charity humanity to man
and beast, (not that mercy was the proper end of the
<hi>Sabbatical-rest,</hi> for so you confound the two Tables,
the first whereof immediatly respects God, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Man.) And in this respect was God curious of
the due observance of his <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> because the
right keeping of them did involue the whole Law of
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:55806:61"/>Your fourth end drawne from the 23. <hi>Levit.</hi> doth
refute your position of the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> being sanctified
by rest. For if so bee this rest of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> served
properly as a meanes to further the holy duties of
that day, how can the holines of that day bee proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or principally said to bee included in the rest it selfe?
which if it bee not an holy rest, that is, used to an holy
end and purpose, it neither fulfilleth the duty of the
commandement (which commandeth us as well to
sanctifie the <hi>Sabbath</hi> as to forbeare worke) nor the
signification of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> it selfe; For in Heaven
when there shall bee the convocation of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
Church of God, the perpetuall <hi>Sabbath</hi> shall
thenbee sanctified not in that wee shall rest, but in
that wee shall holyly rest.</p>
               <p>Your fifth end fell out to bee discoursed of in
your first, which shall suffice concerning it, onely thus
much further, that I suppose, it cannot bee proved,
that all signes of covenants were abolished by Christs
comming. For the Rainebow was given for a signe
of Gods covenant with <hi>Noah.</hi> The <hi>Sabbath</hi> for a
signe of Gods covenant with <hi>Israel,</hi> from which I
inferre that this cannot therefore bee judged abolished
because a signe, because the other signe as wee see is
yet remaining. <hi>Catonus pag. 45. De iride autem

               <p>And to give further light to that same place of
Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 3. I will here insert the discourse
of a divine of prime note upon the word (<hi>remember</hi>)
shewing the reasons wherefore it is prefixt to the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55806:62"/>
fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rth commandement, wherein he handles the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
text.</p>
               <p>This word <hi>remember</hi> (saith hee) is prefixed to
the fourth commandement rather then to the rest for
2. reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Because wee are apter to forget it then any
of the rest, for marke it in Scripture and where any
duty is charged by God with Remember, it argues a
pronenes to forget it, as that, <hi>Remember thy Creator
in the daies of thy youth,</hi> when many lusts are ready to
draw us of. And the reasons why wee are so apt to
forget this Commandement, and why there is need of
a Memento are foure.</p>
               <p>1. Because the rest of the Commandements are
written in our Hearts by light of Nature, but this only
was given by outward ordinance of divine instruction,
&amp; we are apter to forget instructions then inclinations.</p>
               <p>2. Because this more restraineth the naturall liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then all the rest, they restraining only sinfull things,
this lawfull things, yea our very words and thoughts
about them.</p>
               <p>3. Because of the multitude of our sixe daies busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
which had need bee remembred to bee seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
finisht, else they will breed distractions.</p>
               <p>4. Because the Devill prompts us to forget it, so to
quench the Memory of the Creation and the Creator,
and so to bring in the Eternity of the World, as he did
amongst the Heathen and there with <hi>Athisme:</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
which wee are bid to remember to keepe this
Commandement as a meanes to preserve the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of God and to keepe a foote his worship.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Because it is of most weight to bee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
and that for three reasons.</p>
               <p>1. Is taken from the dependancy of the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the rest of the Commandements on this,
for in keeping of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> the Lord is wont to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie

his People to the keeping of all the rest of the
Commandements, so that keeping this wee keepe
all, and neglecting this wee neglect all, hence God
saith <hi>Exod: 31. 3. Verily my</hi> Sabbaths <hi>you shall keepe
for it is a signe betweene mee and you throughout all
your Generations that you may know that I am the
Lord that doth sanctifie you;</hi> moreover saith God
<hi>Exod: 20. 12. I gave them my</hi> Sabbaths <hi>to bee a signe

conversion of sinners and you shall see where one hath
beene converted on the Weeke Daies 7 have beene
on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> 7 to one nay 10 to one if not a 100 to
one. God doth delight most to dispence his grace on
that Day, so that keepe that Day and you keepe an
oportunity where God doth bestow his graces on the
Sonnes of men, but neglect it and you neglect an
oportunity of getting grace of God. Heathen Princes
are wont on their coronation Day to shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to their People in all their rioalty and cast about
Silver and Gold, so doth God sometimes in these his
solemne Daies shew himselfe to be present with us
in holy duties, he scatters abroad his holy graces and
delights so to do, wee are not to appoint God the time
when to come downe and speake to his People, but
they must waite the time he hath appointed, now
God doth delight to sanctifie Men on this Day of all
the rest, therefore the text saith, <hi>He blessed it and hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
it,</hi> that is, <hi>he did blesse it to be a meanes to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie

and they to him, by whom he will be found sooner
on this Day then any of the rest, and if wee get grace
any Day its a thousand to one it is on this Day, or else
something added to it. <hi>Esa:</hi> 36. 4. The way to lay hold

               </p>
               <p>2. Reason why this cómandement is of most weight
to be remembred, is taken from the efficacy of it, in it
wee are made most spirituall and heavenly minded,
it frames our spirits to be fit for every good busines,
by keeping the <hi>Sabbath</hi> wee are kept from idle
thoughts, and by this meanes are moulded up into a
Heavenly frame, wee are not even of this World,
there is nothing of it doth hang about us. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
a Rest to the People, <hi>Heb:</hi> 4 9. implying that
the Saints in Heaven keepe a <hi>Sabbath</hi> rest, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
divine things, learning from <hi>Christ,</hi> Singing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and are in a spirituall manner wrapt up in all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
busines and minding Heavenly things. And
wee by keeping it are wrapt up from all incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
otherwaies lawfull, but now not fitting our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>3. Reason is taken from the memory of those
things are kept in memory by it, for by keeping in
mind the <hi>Sabbath</hi> wee keepe in mind Gods chiefest
benefits to us, as our Creation and our Redemption by
its translation from the seaventh to the eight Day,
and <hi>Ezech:</hi> 20. 12. that it is a signe that God doth san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55806:63"/>
us implying thus much, that whereas there are
three Persons who shew themselves in three Works
tending to our Salvation. This <hi>Sabbath</hi> is sanctified to us
to put us in remembrance of them, and their works, as
of the Father that Created us, of <hi>Christ</hi> that Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
us, of the Holy Ghost that Sanctifies us.</p>
               <p>Thus are our chiefest blessings remembred by our
keeping of this fourth Commandement and therefore
it is of most weight to be remembred.</p>
               <p>The legall <hi>Sabbath</hi> as you call it, and which you
speake of in your sixth end, was more then to put them
in mind of the spirituall <hi>Sabbath,</hi> for it was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perst
meanes of bringing it about to cause them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to keepe a spirituall <hi>Sabbath,</hi> for when as they
were not to do any of their owne works nor to thinke
any of their owne thoughts, what could they construe
hence but that they were to doe Gods, and thinke
Gods<note n="*" place="margin">Like as the Apostle collects <hi>Heb:</hi> 11. 14. from our Fathers say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they were stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Pilgrims on the Earth, that they that say such things, declare plainly that they seeke a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note>? And therefore doth not that 58. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 13.
intend only the negative part (for so God should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

which is ever to be in motion) but also the spirituall
part, which also is expressed there: but if it had not,
it being delivered in the Negative, they both ought

Logitian, that only mentioneth the Major and the
Minor of a Syllogisme, and leaveth the Conclusion
to be gathered, as a thing so easy because so necessary,
as none but Fooles and Dunces can be ignorant of,
and thus doth <hi>Christ</hi> deale with us also under the
Gospell, he giveth generall Rules for us thence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
particular Conclusions.</p>
               <p>To your last End I answer. That it is most true that
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was a Type of the Heavenly <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:55806:64"/>
and a shadow of that blessed Rest to come; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
transcendent to those Types which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>lewish</hi> and of a Temporary nature; whereas
this <hi>Sabbath</hi> had its beginning with time, and shall
receive its ending with time, when the workes are
finished from the foundation of the World. When
as the Church of God is possessed of the Antitype,
then shall this universall Type vanish by the second

the <hi>Iewes Sabbath,</hi> how it is credible that <hi>S. Paul</hi>

that with <hi>Sabbaths</hi> are adjoyned Meates and Drinkes,

               <p>1. However there may be another word used to
signifie Festivall Dayes, yet you cannot deny, but it is
frequent to name their festivalls, <hi>Sabbaths:</hi> Because
of the Rest and analogy which they had common
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55806:65"/>
with the Weekly <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Like as Magistrates are called Gods, though there be other words to signify them.</note> And such is the sence of
this Text, as may probably appeare by these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reasons which you so slightly evade.</p>
               <p>1. Because it is <hi>Sabbaths</hi> in the plurall number,
for the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> where it signifieth the
Weekely <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and not the Weeke it selfe, is for
most part either expressed in the singular number, or
if in the plurall, then it is joyned with a word singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and after this manner it
is also every where translated both in English and
Latine, but in this 2. <hi>Coloss:</hi> 16. there are none of
all these.</p>
               <p>2. Because <hi>Sabbaths</hi> are adjoyned with such
things (in this place of the <hi>Coloss:</hi>) which are indispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
abrogative and meerly <hi>Iewish,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Such as are termed in the 14 verse the handwriting of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and in the 17 verse are termed the shadowes of such things to come, whose body is of Christ, that is, which are fulfilled in Christ, and whose significations end when hee commeth. But we know the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification (as you your selfe confesse out of 4. <hi>Heb:</hi>) of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths</hi> Rest is Heaven, our Rest there which remaineth unfulfilled yet to the People of God as the same 4. <hi>Heb:</hi> sheweth.</note> and therefore are
these the likelier to be such. For as Dr. <hi>Andrewes</hi> saith
of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> how that it had beene folly to have
put a ceremoniall Law amongst the Morall; so say
I in this case, that it were strange if God, who is the
God of order and not of confusion, should by his
Apostle in this place mixe one of the ten Morall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
with the hand writing of Ordinances,
things meerely ceremoniall and abrogated.</p>
               <p>To which two Reasons I adde these which follow.</p>
               <p>1. The Apostle himselfe did condescend to keepe
the Weekely <hi>Sabbath</hi> with the <hi>Iewes</hi> (not only for
a time, as he did some of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Holy-dayes as
also their other rites, but at all times and in all places
as occasion offered) as being a thing of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from their <hi>Sabbaths</hi> which he taught.</p>
               <p>2. These three Holy-dayes, New-moones and
<hi>Sabbaths</hi> are but (as I may so say) Synonimies in sence
signifying as it were one and the same thing, in the
intention of the Apostle by divers expressions: for
were not New moones Holy-dayes, and Holy-daies
<hi>Sabbaths,</hi> so that if you disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e from a seeming Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tology
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55806:65"/>
you may as well argue against New-moones
as <hi>Sabbaths.</hi> And I would know why Holy-daies
and <hi>Sabbaths</hi> may not be as well one and the same
in this place of the <hi>Coloss:</hi> as in the 58. <hi>Isa:</hi> 13. both
of them in the one place signifying the Weekely
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> and in the other place the <hi>Iewish Sabbaths.</hi>
Which Synominy doth the rather appeare from that
4. <hi>Gal:</hi> 16 (which is the same in effect with this of
the <hi>Coloss:</hi>) where the Apostle by Dayes, Moneths,
Times and Yeares, meaneth things of the same nature
and Ordination, to wit, the <hi>Iewish</hi> abrogated Types
and Ceremonies such as begun with Mans Fall (or
rather with <hi>Moses</hi>) and ended with <hi>Christs</hi> Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
(unto which the converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> did too
much adhere) not such as began in <hi>Paradice,</hi> and shall
end in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whereas it may bee objected: that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
had not the Apostle intended all <hi>Sabbaths</hi> in the
word plurall, he would have made some particular
exception of the Weekely <hi>Sabbath,</hi> considering how
considerable it was so to do, if he would have had the
Weekely <hi>Sabbath</hi> to bee understood to bee still of
force.</p>
               <p>To this I answer. That the first Day of the Weeke
or Lords Day having taken footing among the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<hi>Gentiles</hi> to whom the Apostle wrote, he might
with lesse scruple use the word <hi>Sabbaths</hi> absolutely
without exception; considering that all <hi>Sabbaths
(eo nomine</hi>) were outlawed. Though now as the
case stands we in these times are forced to re-assume
the name <hi>Sabbath</hi> (not thereby to shoulder out the
more worthy name of Lords Day, but) to vindicate
the authority of the fourth Commandement, and to
testify our judgements touching the new <hi>Sabbath;</hi>
like as the primitive times are reported to take up
the wearing of the Crosse to testifie their profession
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55806:66"/>
and Confession of a Crucified <hi>Christ</hi> against their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers.</p>
               <p>2. To your second Reason I answer. That our
warrant to worke on the <hi>Iewes</hi> seaventh Day is the
fourth Commandement, which proportioneth us out
sixe Dayes for our worldly affaires, and the seaventh
for an holy rest, which is the totall and morall sence
and summe of that Commandement, and which wee
still observe, the order being occasionall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,
but the number morall and perpetuall, as I have
proved before. And therefore the Apostles did imply
a nullity of the one by the bringing in of the other,
according to the nature of the Commandement and
the Prophecy of <hi>Isaiah</hi> 65. 16.</p>
               <p>So that if you thinke it meet to retaine the Lords
Day in our Church (as you do in your premonition)
then must you grant the order to be changed. For it
was never the Apostles meaning nor in their power,
when God by a perpetuall Law from the beginning
had given us sixe Dayes for labour and destined the
seaventh to an holy Rest, to have turned it into five
Dayes labour and two Dayes Rest. For amongst
the <hi>Iewes,</hi> when Holy-dayes were so frequent, there
was never any weekely Holy day ordayned, to go
cheeke by jole with the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but either Moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or Yearely. So that as <hi>Moses</hi> his Serpent eate up
the Sorcerers, so hath our seaventh Day eaten up
theirs.<note n="*" place="margin">As the Apostle sayth in another case, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 3. 10. Even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth.</note> 
                  <hi>Generatio unius est corruptio alterius.</hi> Our
new Heaven and new Earth have given us a new
<hi>Sabbath</hi> and new Rest. <hi>For old things are passed
away, and all things are become new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. To your third reason I answer. That <hi>Paul</hi> in
like case speaketh in divers places of Ministers main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and yet saith never a word to cleare the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
of Tythes, whether they bee or bee not
<hi>Iure divino,</hi> but he preacheth the substance, to wit,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55806:66"/>
a meet maintenance to be necessary. So in <hi>Pauls</hi>
discourse of times and Dayes (as also of other things)
although he satisfy not our Fancies, who cannot see
af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rre of, yet doth he answer the will of the Holy
Ghost, who for reasons whereof wee are uncapable
spareth to doe what wee expect. And indeed the
reason of <hi>Pauls</hi> not Preaching the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might be because it was neither safe nor conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.
For it must needes have given great offence to
the <hi>Iewes,</hi> (seeing it had a place amongst the morall
Commandements) who were so precise in the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctisioes
of times, as that they would have beene of your
opinion, that either their seaventh Day or none was
morall: and so would have taken advantage to vilifie
his doctrine, as if he had gone about to overthrow as
well the Morall as Ceremoniall Law; the sun shine
of the Gospell being too bright for their weake Eyes
to behold all at once. And therefore the Aposile, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending

the Lords Day t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Therefore I conclude that this Scripture is nothing
concerning the Weekely <hi>Sabbath</hi> (whereof he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
nothing at all directly for the reasons aforesaid)
but of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Ceremoniall <hi>Sabbaths</hi> which hee
must needs cry downe, if he set up <hi>Christ.</hi> The sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
must vanish, when the substance comes in place.
And of this the converted <hi>Iewes</hi> were mostly as well
perswaded without offence as the converted <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
But of this sort was not the Weekely <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
as I have proved elsewhere, and as further is evident
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55806:67"/>
from the 92. <hi>Psal:</hi> which is dedicated to the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
Day, but none of the rest of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> to any of
the legall Ceremonies, from which I may thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>That seeing the Booke of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> was ordained
for the consolation of the militant Church unto the
Worlds end, (as may appeare by the Apostles exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation)
it seemeth not consonant to reason, that a
part of Gods perpetuall worship should be dedicated
to a temporary Ceremony.</p>
               <p>To your fourth and fifth I answer, that how the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> is said to be shadowish, wee have shewne
before, and shall have more occasion hereafter to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
it.</p>
               <p>Amongst those two or three which justifie the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> I would have you take in D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

               <head type="sub">2. The Sabbath was a shadow from the beginning.</head>
               <p>FOr Gods very Resting was Typicall as appeareth
<hi>Heb:</hi> 4. 4. observe that the Apostle there speaketh
os the seaventh Day as rested upon by God, and not
as sanctified by him or enjoyned to be sanctified by
Man, so that the seaventh Day then became a Type
when God rested therein, the seaventh Day in order
if not in time before it was sanctified was Gods rest,
and Consequently a shadow of the Rest remaining
to the People of God. Consider further that it doth
not appeare by the Scripture when the <hi>Sabbath</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a shadow; and which was the first <hi>Sabbath</hi> that
was such if the first of all were not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:55806:67"/>Againe that all other shadowes and Types were
such from their first institution.</p>
               <p>If any thinke there was no shadow or Ceremony
of <hi>Christ</hi> before Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans:</hi> Suppose that before there had beene no
shadow or Type at all, yet might the <hi>Sabbath</hi> bee a
shadow or Type from the beginning thereof, for it
is very profitable that <hi>Adam</hi> fell the Day before.
Againe though there were no Ceremony of <hi>Christ</hi>
before Sinne, yet might there be a shadow of things
to come, that now shall be exhibited by <hi>Christ,</hi> which
had not <hi>Adam</hi> sinned God would have exhibited by
himselfe.</p>
               <p>There were it seemes three Types or shadowes in
the beginning, Paradice, the Tree of Life, and the
seaventh Day Gods Rest, of the comfort of all which
<hi>Adam</hi> for his Sinne was deprived. But afterwards
God being mercifull to the posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> they
had the same <hi>Sabbath, Mannah</hi> for the Tree of Life,
and the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for Paradice, which was as
it were another Paradice, and a figure also of the
Kingdome of Heaven.</p>

               <p>In the 4. of <hi>Hebrewes</hi> it is beyond the Apostles
scope to treate upon the sanctification of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
for that there he only disputeth upon the typicall use

so you take it not in a <hi>Iewish</hi> sence as abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative

then came to destroy the ceremoniall Law, yet came

were capable of without him, although that now our
capacity and interest in that Rest being lost, and only
recovered in and through <hi>Christ,</hi> it may by accident
referre to Christ (as the Tree of Life is made to doe.)
because he is become our Intermedium to that Rest
which yet at first it signified without him, and thus is
Marriage made a Type of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Church,
which in Innocency was properly a Type of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Vnity betweene God and his Church imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

they not as other Types occasionally taken up and

before <hi>Christ,</hi> and shall end after him, that is, when

of his Father, to whom the Creation being appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
this Type of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> being grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,

that by reason of <hi>Christs</hi> intervention, and the new
Creation which he hath made, it is (by accident) of
use also towards him; because that in and by him

Rest and Marriage unto him by Fayth, then are wee
inchoatively possessed of our everlasting Rest and

in Heaven, * whereof these two Institutions in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency

               <p>Touching the time of <hi>Adams</hi> Fall for my part I
cannot thinke it was before Gods seaventh Day, and
my reason is from <hi>Moses</hi> his method for he putteth
it after, and yet I doe beleeve hee never kept Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
in Innocency, but fell before his owne seaventh
Day.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>Adams</hi> deprivation I answer. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be evident by Scripture and the fiery Sword,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55806:68"/>
that <hi>Adam</hi> was deprived of Paradice, and the Tree of
Life, as being properly annexed to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning the Tree of Good and Evill: yet
doth not the same appeare concerning the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
for that it did partake as well of duty as of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
and was a coadjutor to the Law of nature: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
we see it renewed in its proper kind, and upon
its primitive reason: which the other are not, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
by a fery Sword; also wee see the Scripture
saith, the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was made for Man, which indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
signifieth all Mankind, though properly the
People of God. For God having still a People he
hath for them a Rest in Heaven, towards which the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> is as helpfull as the Sacrament of the Lords
supper is to our Faith in <hi>Christ.</hi> For as one sayth. Even
now in this marveilous light of the Gospell, wee have

The Rests or <hi>Sabbaths</hi> mentioned in that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>You may well imagine of what things to come
<hi>Paul</hi> meaneth in that 2. <hi>Coloss:</hi> if you consider the
context, for after he had handled Circumcision both
in its Type and Antitype, then he concludeth of other
things of that nature in these words, let no man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
condemne you in Meat or Drinke &amp;c. As if he
had said; like as Circumcision, so all things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and institution, are extinguished through <hi>Christ,</hi>
the substance of these shadowes, and the end of these
Ceremonies. Amongst whichby an Argument <hi>ex non
concessis,</hi> you would draw in the Weekly <hi>Sabbath</hi> to
bee one, (as if the <hi>Iewes</hi> had not other <hi>Sabbaths</hi> which
more properly are to bee reckoned in that number)
and yet confesse it to signifie our Rest in Heaven, and
to have none other signification but that: which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
is still in force also, as wee see in the 4. of
<hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Shadowes. Which signification I say is still in force
and consequently the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> for how should it
be other, seeing that they are <hi>Christs</hi> owne words,
<hi>Math: 5. 18. That till Heaven and Earth passe one
jot or one tittle shall in no wise passe from the Law
till all bee fulfilled.</hi> Now how can the <hi>Sabbath</hi> be
abrogated, seeing by your owne confession it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
our Rest in Heaven, which is not yet fulfilled
nor will not be till the second comming of <hi>Christ.</hi>
whereas the <hi>Iewish</hi> Types therefore vanished at the

for that he hath fulfilled the righteousnes therof for us;
and yet we know that to us under the Gospell the Law

<hi>Sabbath,</hi> though not the last of seaven as expecting
Rest by workes, yet the first day of seaven as having
and expecting Rest by <hi>Christ</hi> for still the Law and

                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:55806:70"/>But by the way I must in this place the better to
cleare the truth take in two objections that are made
against our acceptation of this 4. <hi>Heb:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, they object that Gods Rest (there spoken
of) on the seaventh Day is not meant as typifying
our Rest in Heaven, but only is mentioned in way
of similitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>Ans:</hi> 1. If the <hi>Sabbath</hi> be at all a Type it must
bee so from the beginning: for as M. <hi>Broad</hi> observeth
it appeares not else, by Scripture, when the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
became a shadow, and which was the first <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
that was such, if the first of all was not. And againe,
that all other shadowes and Types were such from
their first institution.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If the <hi>Sabbath</hi> be no Type, why is it disputed to
be no Morall Commandement, but abrogated?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That it is the Churches Type appeares two wayes.</p>
               <p>1 From the olteration and change which it hath
undergone since <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 By the inference which is made, in way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
from Gods resting unto his Peoples resting,
in the connexion of the 9 and 10 verses of this 4 chap.
<hi>Heb:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The <hi>Sabbath</hi> its said was made for Man, that is, for
his benefit and here to signify his happines hereafter:
so <hi>Mayer in locum</hi> saith, that in Gods being said to rest,
there must needs be an alluding to a most joyfull Rest
to be had by Man, seeing he was never weary neither
had he need of Rest: so <hi>Anselm.</hi> to prove the rest of
the seaventh Day, and that it prefigured a further rest
to come, hee aleadgeth the words (saith hee) of the
history in <hi>Genesis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (The seaventh Day God rested
from all his Workes</hi>) for in that immediately after the
making of Man these words were added, it is plaine,
that the resting of man who was last made was meant
hereby. For as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, God was not weary
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55806:70"/>
so that he had need to rest in regard of his great labour,
but in those words he hath promised Rest to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring,
or because he made all things very good and
then it is said, he rested, thou maist understand also
that after thy good workes thou shalt rest, and rest
without end.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they object, that by Rest there is not
meant our Rest in Heaven, but our Rest from Sinne
here upon Earth, or our Gospell rest.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, It cannot properly beare that
sence; for,</p>
               <p>1. It must bee such a Rest as God rested, which
was not from Sinne, but an everlasting Rest in Heaven
from the Works of Creation.</p>
               <p>2. It must be such a Rest as is spoken of in the
fourth Commandement, which is not properly a Rest
from Sinne, but a Rest from workes.</p>
               <p>3. As <hi>Mayer</hi> observeth it is there called <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismus</hi>
which signifieth a time of everlasting joy and
festivity which cannot bee expressed, which is only
proper to Heaven.</p>
               <p>4. To put all out of doubt in the 14 verse of this
4 chap. <hi>Heb:</hi> it is expresly called Heaven, and <hi>Christ</hi>
himselfe is implyed to rest it when he ascended into
Heaven. Nor doth the Apostles speaking in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
tense in the third verse of this chap: saying, (<hi>Wee
which have beleeved doe enter into Rest</hi>) afford any
Argument against it, for that is only a speech of fayth,
implying the certainty thereof, as also intimating the
inchoation or entrance which the People of God make
into this Heavenly Rest or everlasting Life even in
this Life. For the Apostles dispute there sheweth that
God hath a Rest of everlasting Happines for his
People, as for himselfe, and which now wee are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
capable of only by the promise of the Gospell
through Faith, by reason of <hi>Christ</hi> our high Priest,

appearing to <hi>Abram.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:55806:71"/>2. Supposing that the number of seaven bee mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
it followeth that wee are freed from it, and not
from the seaventh day onely, for what have wee to
doe with the <hi>Iewish</hi> darke mysteries, in this cleare
Sun-shine of the Gospell. The weeke by this Doctrine
should rather bee a mystery or shadow then the
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> for the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was but one day of the
seaven, as the first was or any other. Indeed the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
was the last of the seaven but what of that?
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tearming the <hi>Sabbath</hi> a shadow joyneth it
with the Holy-dayes and new Moones, if now they
will have the <hi>Sabbath</hi> be a shadow in regard it was the
last of the weeke, the New-moone (maysome say)
was a shadow in regard it was the first of the Month,
and the holy-dayes in regard they fell at other times.</p>
               <p>3. If the number of seaven or last of seaven bee
mysticall, must it not bee so from the beginning.
And thus must the <hi>Sabbath</hi> bee a mystery or shadow
from the first institution, as all other shadowes were.
Secondly, in respect of their strict rest, but I know
nothing of any moment,<note place="margin">God himselfe rested strictly, for hee rested from all his works <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2. unlesse Gods example teacheth us to rest strictly, it teacheth us nothing.</note> which they bring for proofe
hereof, and why of the strict rest and not of the
whole? Certainely wee shall rest wholly in Heaven.
And if the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was ceremoniall in respect of
the strict rest, then it seemeth hee that laboured all
day or a good part thereof brake the morall part and
so sinned. Moreover the holy-dayes (joyned with
the <hi>Sabbath Col.</hi> 2.) may seeme to want the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
seeing no such strict rest was in joyned in them
as was shewed before <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 3. in respect of the
sacrifices offered therein. <hi>Ans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, If sacrifices offered on such a day made the
day a shadow, then every day of the weeke was a
shadow as well as the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> for sacrifices were
by the Law to bee offered every day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Then shall wee have three Sacraments
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55806:72"/>
for the administration of the Lords supper is as well
a part of sanctifying the Lords day, as the offering
of sacrifices was a part of sanctifying the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
If then the sacrifices made the <hi>Sabbath</hi> a ceremony
like to themselves, the Lords supper maketh the
Lords day a Sacrament like to it selfe also.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If a ceremoniall duty enjoyned on the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> made it partly ceremoniall, a morall duty
enjoyned on the holy-dayes made them partly morall.
And thus should the feast of Passeover bee partly
morall as well as the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>

               <head>Answer.</head>
               <p>I grant you, that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was a shadow or sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the blessed rest to come, and that not as
it was a seaventh day,<note n="*" place="margin">In respect of any mystery contained therein.</note> but as the seaventh day was
a <hi>Sabbath.</hi> But hence you would deduce a wrong
conclusion, that therefore it is as was the Iewish sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
abrogative in the comming of Christ, and that
wee are not bound to darke mysteries (say you) in
this cleare sun-shine. <hi>Ans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee are not bound indeed to any mystery, but
to the duty contained in the number of seaven. Yet
to the signification of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> wee are bound,
which is not darke but cleare for so the Scripture hath
made it to bee in the fourth <hi>Hebr.</hi> And although
this <hi>Sabbath</hi> was shadowish, yet was it neither of
like nature with their other <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> nor yet with
other things whose signification reached to Heaven
as well as it.</p>
               <p>First I say, it differed from other <hi>Sabbaths</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it properly signified our rest in Heaven (as wee
see in the fourth <hi>Hebr.</hi> where it alone is mentioned)
and they properly our rest on earth by Christ; and
therefore were they so many (and it but one and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55806:72"/>
the same from the beginning) to signifie that our rest
here was to bee with manifold intermissions and in
great variety.</p>
               <p>Secondly I say, it also differed from other things
whose signification reached to Heaven as well as it:
For mostly they had a double signification, the one
proper and proximate, as <hi>Iewish</hi> types, signifying the
rest and flourishing prosperity, that the Church should
have in the time of the Gospell; the other Analogicall
and remote, intimating that in the end, Heaven should
bee the accomplishment of our Gospell graces and
benefits, like as in the mid way they were the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of their types and shadowes.<note n="*" place="margin">For all the <hi>Iewish</hi> types being ordained for Christ, must bee fulfilled in and by Christ in the time of grace, which is his time of regiment, by admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring grace as now hee doth being our high Priest entered into the holy of holies with blood to make intercession for us, and by compleating grace which hee shall doe hereafter, when as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hee shall come in glory to set us at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from all our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in that great Iubilee, when the day of refreshing shall come from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord: and then after that wee have done our part and Christ his, wee shall (a compleate <hi>Adam</hi> in soule and body and cloathed with perfect innocency) enter into our Masters everlasting rest and joy.</note> But the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> had precedency of these having for its sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
properly and adequately one rest in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the other abrogative <hi>Sabbaths</hi> subservient
to it for the abrogative part (as appeares by the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
difference of rest that was imposed upon
them in the wildernes, as I have else where observed
more at large) it being Catholicall and (the) Churches
inheritance beginning with it and ending with it;
and they being (that) Churches inheritance in like
manner receiving their beginning and ending with
it.</p>
               <p>If it bee objected, that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is as much ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
on earth as many other <hi>Iewish</hi> types, for many
of them have not their perfect signification accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
here but in Heaven, (as the <hi>Iewish</hi> circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
shall not bee perfected till wee bee in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven) and our everlasting rest hath its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choation
here in the soules of Gods elect, what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The difference consisteth in the immediate
object which the types primarily and principally
eyed. For the <hi>Iewish</hi> types primarily eyed the happy
estate of the Church on Earth under the time of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55806:73"/>
Gospell, thereby to invite and bring their soules into
a Gospell state by beleeving (so that though they are
perfectly fulfilled in Heaven, yet they are properly
fulfilled on earth) and secondarily or remotely its
perfection in Heaven; For the time of the Gospell
was (as I may say) properly their Heaven as it may
appeare in that it is said, the Prophets and righteous
men have desired to see (to wit looking through
their types and shadowes) the things that you see &amp;c.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 17 these being their primary and proper
object, and as may appeare in the second place by the
faultines of their covenant <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8. 7. and the fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnes
of the Gospell covenant. But this type of the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> contrarywise primarily and principally eyed
the happy estate of the Church in Heaven <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.
whereby their minds were to bee elevated above the
<hi>Mannah,</hi> that they should partake of on earth, which
they must enjoy with paines taking, even to the
<hi>Mannah</hi> which they should feed on in Heaven with
rest from all labour, and so is not yet fulfilled neither
properly nor perfectly. For wee must note that the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> signified properly Gods rest, or our rest
with God, not first Christs rest and then Gods, though
by reason of the admixtion of the Gospell in that
time of the Law, it signified Gods rest to bee by Christ
(as in its succession to <hi>Mannah</hi> hath beene shewne)
I say that properly it signified not Christs rest; neither
literally, in respect of the time of the new covenant
under the Gospell, wherein we are set free from the
burden which neither we nor our Fathers were able
to beare, nor spiritually, in the soules of the regenerate
freed from the Law (for this their other <hi>Sabbaths</hi> did
in regard this weekely <hi>Sabbath</hi> could not properly
doe it, at that time) though now under the Gospell,
the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> that attended the Law being done
away, this weekely <hi>Sabbath</hi> now supplieth the place
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55806:73"/>
of all their <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and now it selfe alone signifies
our already entrance into our eternall rest inchoatively,
by being possessed of our soules spirituall rest in
Christ, a thing which whilest the Law was afoote it
could not properly imply; Because the Law gave
no present rest but all future, though in the time of the
Law (as aforesaid) it was signified to bee made good
to us by Christ. Yet it never properly signified the
rest of Christ in the soule, for then it had signified a
present rest which was contrary to the Law, and is
now our priviledge under the Gospell; The <hi>Sabbath-day</hi>
being changed for that end from last to first.
For 4. <hi>Heb. 3. Wee which have beleved doe enter
into rest,</hi> where this rest of God is spoken of in a
double respect, to wit, as denied to carnall <hi>Israel</hi> that
sought to possesse themselves of it by works, but gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Gods spirituall <hi>Israel</hi> that seeke it of Grace
through faith, who shall not onely have it here after,
but even for present are possessed of it in their soules,
which happines the Law or first covenant never could
afford.</p>
               <p>So that although the <hi>Sabbath</hi> bee shadowish, yet
is it not the <hi>Iewes</hi> proper freehold but common with
them and us, being theirs onely, as they were the elect
Church and people of God to whom it universally
belongeth, and therefore was instituted even to <hi>Adam</hi>
in innocency. For the Church of God in the clearest
state of it never was nor never shall bee upon earth,
without shadowish Sacraments and <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> being
her proper inheritance, which were even in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
where our eyes were clearer then they are
now.</p>
               <p>And seeing that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is not properly <hi>Iewish</hi>
it cannot bee said to bee abrogated, because the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is yet not come, which is Heaven it selfe; or
our absolute rest and inablement to serve God there;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55806:74"/>
As was signified by that strict rest commanded to the
<hi>Iewes</hi> on this <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the time of <hi>Mannah,</hi> above
other rests and other <hi>Sabbaths;</hi> but onely changed,
to prove to us that the Gospell estates us in that rest
(and that presently) which the Law should, but could
not.</p>
               <p>And now in our dayes the stricter that wee rest
from worldly distractions, and the more sanctifiedly
that wee keepe the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the nearer wee imitate
Gods example,<note n="*" place="margin">Who yet on the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, ceased not to cherish and maintaine, all things that hee had made, by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and in necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and mercifull provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence wee are to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate God on that day as well as in resting.</note> and fulfill his intention in the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the better wee performe
our duty in glorifying God (as the <hi>Iewes</hi> did in
doubling their sacrifices on that day) and the more
comfort wee reape to our selves, in lively moralizing
thence our heavenly rest which we shall have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
free from all corruptions, interruptions, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<note n="*" place="margin">Doing God double service in Heaven, to that wee doe him here.</note> For in proportion all that belong unto the

               <p>A pitifull shift that these <hi>Antisabbatarians</hi> and
the <hi>Papists</hi> are driven to for the maintenance of their
opinions, even to the downe right adventuring to
blot out that which God himselfe hath written
with his owne hand; (a greater boldnes then King
<hi>Belshazzar</hi> durst attempt touching the writing on
the wall) witnes Master <hi>Broad</hi> here, and <hi>Vasquez</hi>
the <hi>Iesuite</hi> else-where, who being driven to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
(by comparing the words of the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
with the fourth of <hi>Deut.</hi>) that the
Scripture doth forbid the adoration of the true God
himselfe in an Image, and confessing with all that hee
and his fellow Catholicks doe other wayes, what
saith hee then to the commandement? why, because
it will not bee obeyed it must bee repealed, and not
admitted to have any place amongst the morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of God, it was (saith hee) a positive and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
Law, and therefore ought to cease in the
time of the Gospell, thus making the commandemen
of God of none effect to keepe their owne traditions
<hi>Gab. Vasquez. lib. 2. disput. 4. cap. 4. sect.</hi> 84. But
the <hi>Iesuites</hi> come short of the subtilties of our age,
for they bluntly explode the second commandement,
whereas they might have let it stand still with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction:
Like as some of our <hi>Antisabbatarians</hi> (For
they cannot all agree upon the point) doe, let the
fourth commandement stand though not for its owne
sake, or as a Law (though wee must pray, Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
our hearts to keepe this Law, as wee doe to the
rest) but onely for some other causes and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
dictated by our <hi>Antisabbatarians,</hi> some one,
some another; to keepe the ten commandements
from a blancke. I wonder what one man of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55806:75"/>
hath wont to pray that prayer after the reading
of the fourth commandement in their sense; which
if they will have passe for Doctrine, they must either
alter the frame of the commandement or else explode
it as Master <hi>Broad</hi> doth.</p>
               <p>But Doctor <hi>Heylyn part. 2. pag.</hi> 241. objects,
that if this ejaculation bee to bee understood in a
literall sense, according as the words are laid downe
<hi>in terminis,</hi> it then must bee the meaning of it, that
wee should pray unto the Lord to keepe the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> even the seaventh day precisely from
the Worlds creation and keepe it in the selfe same
manner that the <hi>Iewes</hi> once did.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, that our praying that prayer
in a literall sense now in our times doth force no
such conclusions. Not to keepe the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the
<hi>Iewes:</hi> For though the commandement expresse a
seaventh day for number yet it doth not <hi>in terminis</hi>
expresse the order saying, <hi>Thou shalt keepe the last
day in the weeke, or of seaven,</hi> and not the first, &amp;c.
(though I acknowledge from other reasons proper
to these times the commandement had then that
meaning onely) so that now the letter of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
is intended in our prayer onely with a
circumstantiall variation according to the practice of
the Church (derived from the Apostles) which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
it to the meanest: Againe, not the seaventh
day precisely from the Worlds creation, for that hath
suffered many variations, nor did <hi>Adam</hi> keepe it, but he
meanes the seaventh day from the first gathering of
<hi>Mannah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor yet in the selfe same manner, that the <hi>Iewes</hi>
once did, If by (once) hee meane in the strict time
of the wildernes for reasons aforesaid. So that by
the letter of the commandement wee now may pray
the Lord to encline our hearts to keepe holy a <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:55806:75"/>
and not the <hi>Iewes,</hi> a seaventh day and not the
last of seaven (For the Law in the letter respecteth
properly and principally the number implying onely
the order occasionally, for the season sake, because the
creation was then the greatest good; which number
it still retaines in the same letter, and upon a new
season implies a new order, the reason whereon the
order was built being circumstantiall, as I have proved
before) nor the day that God rested on after the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor the extraordinary rest in the wildernes. I say,
wee may ejaculate this prayer in a literall sense to the
fourth commandement as well as to the fifth, where
weepray, <hi>Lord encline our hearts to honour our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
that according to thy promise, the dayes may
bee long in the Land which thou givest us:</hi> Now wee
all knew that by Land there and then is implicitely
meant the promised Land, or Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Yet
the manner of expression which God useth in the
penning of that Law (as of that of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
a latitude (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 2. 3.) not appropriating
the promise to the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> onely (by saying,
<hi>that thy dayes may be long in that Land of Canaan which
the Lord thy God giveth thee</hi>) so that the Tribe and
the halfe which planted on this side <hi>Iordan</hi> might
have prayed this prayer at the reading of the fifth
commandement, as well as they with in the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> by vertue of the letter of that Law; and so
in like manner may wee now: So excellent is the
wisedome of the Lawgiver. That though in some
temporary implicite circumstantiall sense, his Lawes
might more properly belong to those people to
whom they were immediately given then to us and
our times; yet hee hath so ordered it that the Law is
still usefull and binding for the substance of it, even
in the letter. And therefore they that pray this eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
with understanding hearts, doe not pray,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55806:76"/>
                  <hi>Lord encline our hearts to keepe a Sabbath which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
no Sabbath, but Lord encline our hearts to keep a
Christian Sabbath, a Christian seaventh day, and a
Christian rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the conclusion Doctor <hi>Heylyn</hi> saith, wee
may thus expound this prayer. <hi>viz. to pray unto the
Lord to encline our hearts to keepe that Law as farre
as it containeth the Law of Nature, &amp;c.</hi> (which yet
Master <hi>Broad</hi> his partizan will not allow) a pitifull
shift to keepe all whole: And such is Bishop <hi>Whites
pag.</hi> 159. 160. The generality of whose conclusion
there upon this ejaculation (saving his private expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition)
may well serve to set forth the use of it now;
For (saith hee) our prayer to God, prescribed in the
<hi>Liturgy,</hi> is not to beseeth him to encline our hearts to
keepe the Law according to the speciall forme and
circumstance of time commanded in the old Law,
(which say I is the last day of seaven in memory of
our creation) but in such a manner as is agreeable to
the state of the Gospell and time of Grace, which say
I is the first day of seaven in memory of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and not as hee interprets it, to wit, according to
the equity and mistery of the fourth commandement,
and according to the rule of Christian liberty, which
hath freed Gods people under the Gospell from the
observation of dayes, months, times and yeares (saith
hee) upon legall and ceremoniall principles; true,
if hee meane judaicall ones, and then hee cannot meane
the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> For to bee freed from it is no part of
Christian liberty, because not yet fulfilled by Christ,
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 9. 10.</p>
               <p>But to returne to Master <hi>Broad,</hi> by your Marginall
note it seemes you could allow the <hi>Sabbath</hi> (not in
respect of the <hi>Iewes</hi> weakenes, but of its owne worth
and greatnes) to bee of longer continuance then the
holy-dayes but not perpetuall; wherein you exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55806:76"/>
wrong your cause: for if of longer continuance
why not perpetuall? and if not perpetuall, why of
longer continuance? the Holy-dayes and <hi>Iewish Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi>
say you, expired in Christ, and if this common
<hi>Sabbath</hi> be no other then a <hi>Iewish</hi> Holy-day, why
doth not it expire with the rest? and if you can allow
it beyond <hi>Christ,</hi> I pray you, what should hinder it
for being perpetuall? neither is it incredible to thinke
that the common <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and <hi>Iewish</hi> Holy-dayes
bee of different natures; when as they had different
institutions, different significations, different locations
and different extensions.</p>

               <p>In answer to your Argument, I say, that the fourth

second or third. For as in the first other things may
be loved, but not unlawfully loved, and as in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55806:77"/>
Images may be made, but not unlawfully made,

fourth Commandement wee may do worke, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

breake this no more then the other, if so be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
worke, but such as agreeth with the sence of
the Lawgiver, and may bee gathered by comparing
places of Scripture, which wee find to bee such as
may promote Piety, Mercy and Charity. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is that following Objection of moment. For in
all Lawes the meaning of the Lawgiver, and sence of
the Law it selfe is principally to be respected, not the
Letter: for that thing may be contradictory to the
Letter of the Law, which yet is no breach of the
meaning of the Law, if so bee it bee agreeable to the
rules of Right, Reason and Piety.<note n="*" place="margin">For it is supposed that all Lawes ought to bee such, and if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes then they cannot in a right sense be said to bind, and so consequently not to bee broken.</note> As where wee are
comanded not to Sweare at all, you might well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
what would follow thence, if this doctrine of
yours might take place, that therefore to Sweare at
all is to breake this Commandement, and so in this
fourth Commandement where wee are bid to doe no
manner of Worke, if you will cleave to the Letter,
you may soone find your errour to your cost. But
God giveth his Lawes and Commandements to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Creatures, who should therefore be able to
judge of them according to the Rules of Truth and
Reason. A London Marchant chargeth his Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

That therefore which one affirmes of mens writings

as may appeare.</p>
               <p>1. In that they themselves were not so ill instructed

<hi>Pharises</hi> would have replyed upon <hi>Christs</hi> argument,
that necessity made it not lawfull to them, in regard
that that necessity was begot by their improvidence,
in not preparing and making ready their viands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
on the Day before, according as that Law
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55806:79"/>
enjoyned: for so it is likely through the improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the man that gathered Stickes on the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
Day (probably for to seeth or bake some <hi>Mannah</hi>
unprovided the Day before) his action became neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and yet he was stoned for it.</p>
               <p>But here it will be said that if this action of <hi>Christs</hi>
Disciples was a breach of Rest,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> and so judged to bee
unlawfull, then in like manner it is unlawfull for us
going through a Corne Field on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day to
do the like.</p>
               <p>It is as well unlawfull to us as to them needlesly
and cursorily performed,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> but with a distinction of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnes
for it was literally unlawfull to them, but it
is spiritually unlawfull to us: For it was of a positive
holines to them in their times, but to us it is only of a
relative holines: so that such an action is unlawfull to
us, not properly as a breach of Rest, but as it is a distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or a fruit and effect of empty carnall and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
minds on that Heavenly Day: for else in case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
(for mercy sake) it is lawfull, or as an helpe
and furtherance of the spiritualizing or sanctifying of
that Day it is also lawfull: as if a man for the helpe of
his mind in meditation, or to deduce some point of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
do pluck an Eare of Corne, and anatomize
it by rubbing it in his hand, the better to see the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and power of the Creator in it. For thus even
in the time of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Temple sanctified workes
to it owne service, even on the Day of Rest: as Christ
sheweth after in this 12. <hi>Math:</hi> intimating that the
principall end of the instituting the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> rest from
carnall workes, was for the service and helpe of the
Temple of our minds and Hearts in the workes and
wayes of God <hi>Isaiah 58. 13. Levit.</hi> 23. 27. 28 &amp;c.
And therefore did the godly-wise among the <hi>Iewes</hi>
make no scruple of working on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day to
this end, as the Priests in the Temple, nor to travell
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55806:79"/>
further then a <hi>Sabbath</hi> Dayes journey for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as wee see by the godly <hi>Shunamite</hi> her going
to the Prophet a <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 22. 23. For spirituall and
holy ends make spirituall and holy actions, so that the
action bee not unlawfull but indifferent. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
its worth our observation to consider how that
the building of the Tabernacle (and Temple) gave
place to the rest of the <hi>Sabbath, Exod.</hi> 31. intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that distracting bodily labours, or the carnall
part or imployment of or about even holy things,
their <hi>opus operatum</hi> must give place to the spirituall
rest of heavenly mindednes, and spirituall worship or
worshipping of God in Spirit: And againe on the
contrary the <hi>Sabbath-rest</hi> gave place to the servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
works of the Temple (and Tabernacle) implying
that our carnall rest must give place to his spirituall
worship and service. And hereupon let mee in an
holy <hi>Iealousy</hi> annexe an exhortation to some of the
Ministers of this Land (for blessed bee God it needs
not to all) that they would carefully provide, and
looke that they doe not build the Tabernacle on that
day, I meane that they rest not in the <hi>opus operatum</hi>
of their holy imployments, and busying themselves
about the carnall part of holy things, in putting off
the studying of their Sermons, or getting them by
heart (except it bee to worke them upon the heart,
and not barely to commit them to memory) till that
day, and so though they take care to build the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
of Gods Church, yet they in the meane time
neglect the Temple of their owne hearts, in serving
God in the Spirit and not in the letter or outward
performance onely. But it were well if they would
gather and prepare their <hi>Mannah,</hi> seeth it and bake
it the day before, that when the <hi>Sabbath</hi> came, they
might have nothing to doe, but to chew and conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ct
it into their owne Spirits,<note n="*" place="margin">Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> in his expe-Christ revealed <hi>pag.</hi> 148. The Minister must not onely set the Word and Sacraments before others, but himselfe must feed on on them as the Priests did on the Shew-bread all the weeke and yeare long, least it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him, as that Prince which saw plenty of food with his eyes but tasted not of it, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 20.</note> and so spiritually in the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55806:80"/>
experience of their owne hearts (not heads) dish it
out to their hearers; which would bee an happy
meanes to make them see better fruits of their labours:
For commonly that which is notionally delivered is
notionally received, and that which is spiritually and
powerfully delivered in the evidence of the Spirit,
is spiritually and savingly received (though I know
to the pure all things are pure; a good stomacke can
digest good meat, though the cooke perhaps never
licke his owne fingers, how ever it bee cooked or
dished: it may bee as the yolke of an egge to the hearer,
when it is as the white to the speaker without tast
or life) for Spirit begets Spirit, as fire begets fire;
And as a worthy Writer of this Church saith to this
purpose, that it can hardly sinke into an hearers heart,
that never went further then the speakers head. This
fault in part is to bee suspected in some Ministers by
their absenting themselves<note n="*" place="margin">In the vestry or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</note> from the publicke prayers
of the congregation, not comming in till the Psalme
bee almost at an end (of ill president, the congregation
losing the Doctrine of their example and the assistance
of their Spirit) not but that some men at some times
may bee justly and really straitned and necessitated
to study or get by heart their Sermons on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day,</hi>
others also may bee of weake memories
and must bring it fresh: To such I speake not, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make them their afflictions, and to watch and
pray against them; but to them to whom God gives
<hi>Mannah</hi> for gathering and preparing, that they doe
not put up with the worse, and neglect the better part
of the duty, satisfying themselves with this that they
are in their Divine calling, conversant about holy
things, and so gather <hi>Mannah</hi> when they should eat
it. It is an easie thing to take great paines in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
part or performance of holy things, which oft
proves a snare, causing the neglect of the Spirit of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55806:80"/>
the inner man: For many are great labourers in the
worke of the Lord, that are starvelings in the Spirit
of the Lord, satisfying themselves with a Popish peace
of conscience in the deed doing, in stead of joy in
the holy Ghost, bringing indeed meat to their nests,
but through hast or lazines eating none themselves;
or like Taylors make cloathes for other men to
weare, so they never assaying their owne points how
they fit or may fit their owne Spirits, but thinke it is
their duties to teach, and other mens duties to doe.
And let mee also admonish the People that they take
not scandall or offence by carping or misprision at
the Ministers absence in time of publicke prayer, as
the <hi>Pharises</hi> did here at Christs Disciples, but rather
judge them necessitated to it.</p>
               <p>But it will bee said,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> that it is beyond flesh and
blood, thus to spend a whole day in heavenly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dednes.</p>
               <p>It is indeed hard to flesh and blood,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> but where the
Spirit is there is liberty: A Gentleman that handles
a flale for novelty sake thinks it an hard thing to
thresh an houre together, but the Country <hi>Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
that is called to it, and by frequent use hath
made it another nature, to him thinks it no hard thing
to thresh a whole day together. So flesh and blood
wanting the skill to handle spirituall tooles, and
feeding on spirituall things with a forced and not a
naturall palate, digesting divine truths but as other
truths of other arts, onely into a notionall medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to improve his understanding or outward pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
a little, to such a man it must needs bee hard:
But hee that is begotten of God, and hath a new
nature put into him, hee is skilled in the way of
the Lord, and findeth such sweetnes in digesting
divine truths into his Spirit, and in renewing and
maintaining his spirituall acquaintance with God
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55806:81"/>
in giving and receiving, and in the variety of Gods
spirituall ordinances as that it is not hard to him; for
when flesh and blood knowes it shall have no liberty
it will looke for none and then the Spirit easily beareth
rule. I wish by the way that such men as talke

meaning whilest withall they say, to spend a whole
day in heavenly mindednes and spirituall imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
is an heavy yoke; and implyingly make it part
of our <hi>Christian</hi> liberty to bee redeemed unto earthly
mindednes and not unto heavenly, whereas it is both
the best and cheifest part of our <hi>Christian</hi> liberty, to
bee redeemed and inabled unto heavenly mindednes,
and to a willing, powerfull, spirituall performance
of holy things, in this time of the ministration of the
Spirit, being delivered from the ministration of the
dead letter, which embondaged them to the outward
and carnall part, and unwilling weake performance
of them through the weakenes of the flesh: For the
Spirit is therefore a free Spirit, not because hee freeth
us from the Law, but because hee sets us free to the
performance of it: Thus <hi>David</hi> looked to bee a free
man and set at liberty, not from obeying but to obeying
and doing the commandements <hi>Psalme</hi> 119. 32.
I will run the wayes of thy commandements when
thou hast enlarged my heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I wish wee were lesse
guilty of this <hi>Iudaisme</hi> in our dayes <hi>viz.</hi> making our
holines consist rather in rest, then in resting to bee
holy. Sure I am those that walke the most exactly
and strictly in this way of heavenly mindednes on
that day, find the benefit and sweet thereof to their
soules, and good reason: For that promise <hi>Isaiah</hi> 58.
14. Then shalt thou delight thy selfe in the Lord is
not onely made to, but also to bee fulfilled by the
performances of the duties injoyned us in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55806:81"/>
verse, of not doing our owne wayes, not finding
our owne pleasure, not speaking our owne words,
the Spirit of God working this unspeakable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and comfort in the soules of them that so
walke.</p>
               <p>Now I come to speake to your answer to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
objection, and therein to shew you when wee
are said to breake the morall part of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
which is, when wee either doe our owne works,
or Gods worke to our owne ends. For had rest beene
properly or onely the morall part of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
then had the superstitious <hi>Iewes</hi> kept it, none better.
But a man may rest and not keepe the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and
a man may worke and not breake the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> And
indeed that man that both resteth and worketh to
wit, from his owne works to doe the works of God,
is the onely true <hi>Sabbath</hi> keeper: And therefore as
wee are advised in another case, that whether wee
eate or drinke &amp;c. So in this case, say I, whether wee
rest or worke let it bee done to the glory of God,
else our rest is but the rest of brute beasts, and our
works the works of prophane Men and Hypocrites.
So that on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> our rest must give place to
all Gods good works, and on the contrary all our
works must give place to Gods rest: For whether
wee rest or worke, it must be unto God, and not unto
our selves, for so onely wee fulfill the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification.</p>
               <p>Lastly, for answer to that which you say in proofe
hereof, how that those Lawes are onely to bee
tearmed morall &amp;c. I aske you what prayer or
Almes &amp;c. is there commanded in the third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
<hi>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord
thy God in vaine,</hi> and yet this you cannot deny to

no more then in the fourth commandement where
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55806:82"/>
wee are to keepe holy the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or to sanctifie it
with an holy rest: by which is not meant a bare rest,
no more then by an holy convocation is meant a bare
meeting together, but it is meant in regard of the
holy duties that were to bee done thereon of praying,
praysing God, reading <hi>Moses</hi> Law, sacrificing &amp;c.
And why is not, <hi>remember that thou keepe holy the
Sabbath-day</hi> as well morall also, as, <hi>thou shalt not
make to thy selfe any graven Image,</hi> in the sense in
hand. And whereas you say, that time and place are
circumstantiall (implying them thereby to bee indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
things) I answer, that in themselves they are
so, but if God please to alter their natures, hee may;
Thus hee disposed of the Temple for a time, and the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> for ever to bee his proper ordinances. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how inconsistent you make it, for resting to bee
the sanctifying of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and yet the Law of

in the delivery and exhibition of this Decalogue

(this rejoyneth upon your following answer to the

as a Law both for <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> and
hath set it downe, though not altogether in words and
letters, yet in sense and substance fitting both sorts:
So that the Law may still bee truly said to remaine,
although Christs comming and the state of the Church
differing, may vary some circumstances; as by changing
the <hi>Egyptian</hi> deliverance into the antitype thereof,
to wit, our spirituall; and the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> meant
in the fift commandement, into <hi>England</hi> where wee
dwell; and so likewise the memory of our creation
into the memory of our redemption; and their gates

Here by sanctifying is meant separating from other
Nations to bee a peculiar people to himselfe. In this
sense <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons are said to bee sanctified.
<hi>Exod. 29. 44. Aaron</hi> and his Sons were sanctified and
severed from the other <hi>Levites</hi> to bee the Lords Priests,
and the <hi>Israelites</hi> were sanctified and severed from
other Nations to bee the Lords people, of which san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was a signe, in as much as it was
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55806:84"/>
a day sanctified and seperated from other dayes of the

               <p>Now if God gave the <hi>Sabbath</hi> for a signe to the

was circumcision. <hi>Abraham</hi> received the signe of
circumcision, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> received the signe of the
<hi>Sabbath.</hi> Hence I thus argue, such as is the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
such is the precept thereof, The <hi>Sabbath</hi> is a signe,
therefore the precept thereof is significative or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
and is abrogated. Here consider, that if <hi>Noah</hi>

his Sons by <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Keturah, Isaack</hi> his son <hi>Esau,</hi>

the <hi>Sabbath</hi> could have beene no signe to the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>

               <p>For though it be true, that as a signe it was proper

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55806:85"/>
doth hee say <hi>Psalme</hi> 147. 19, 20. Hee hath shewne

the whole Law are alike significative, and indeed
have somewhat of signification in them in this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
exhibition: For as the Church it selfe was then
typicall, signifying the Church of Gods elect; So
was the Law, as given to them, as may appeare in
that it was twice written; to shew the double
writing of it, by nature and grace in the hearts of the
elect.</p>
               <p>So that both the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the rest of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue,
as they are morall Lawes, are forever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to the universall Church of God; being not
onely bare signes, but of a double nature. For the
same thing may bee both proper and common in
diverse respects: As the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as it was the Land of promise,
and yet it was common to many Nations in the use
thereof, to wit, as it was a place of commerce and
habitation, and so is to this day. And so the whole
Decalogue wee know was common, as it was the
Law of nature, to all Nations and People, even in
those times of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but yet is it in the fourth
Chap. of <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. verse, appropriated to the
<hi>Iewes;</hi> because it was given, in a speciall manner,
as a Covenant betweene God and them, and in
that respect it is opposed to things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all People, in the 19. verse of that <hi>Chapter,</hi>
as the thing, wherefore and whereby God will
bee especially worshipped, even for that very
cause, because (as hee himselfe layeth downe the

               <p>Againe I argue against you out of your owne
place. 31. <hi>Exod.</hi> That if God menat it as a bare
signe peculiar to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> why then doth hee fly
backe to the primitive institution of it; in the seaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
verse, re inforcing the commandement there,
upon that reason which is common to all mankind.
The words are these: <hi>It is a signe betweene mee and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55806:86"/>
the children of Israel for ever;</hi> For in sixe dayes
the Lord made Heaven and Earth, and in the seaventh
day hee rested.</p>
               <p>Now wee know, it was never the property of
the <hi>Iewish</hi> types to looke backward to the state of
innocency, but forward.</p>
               <p>But you will say, that the first institution of
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was but a prophecy or fore-runner of
the second.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, That it is very ill likely, that
any thing that was proper to the <hi>Iewes</hi> as a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and not common to the whole Church of
God (for whose sake the World was made) was
prophecyed or fore-ordained in innocency; For
all the things that are made use of in Scripture
from the state of innocency, are spoken of as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to the whole Church of God, and not
proper to any one People or time: And so is the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> made use of in the fourth <hi>Hebr.</hi> to signifie
an everlasting rest, to whom? but to the People of
God.</p>
               <p>But you will aske mee, how I know that this Law
of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was given in innocency, and not after
the fall?</p>
               <p>I answer, that this one reason may serve for all;
Because that whatsoever <hi>Moses</hi> maketh mention
of before the fall, wee have good reason to thinke
it to bee done in innocency, and to allow as well
his <hi>Method</hi> as his matter in that particuler. But
hee placeth the Law of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> before the
fall: <hi>Ergo &amp;c.</hi> Besides your owne <hi>Hypothesis</hi> stoppeth
this objection.</p>
               <p>For if <hi>Adam</hi> should have kept the <hi>Sabbath</hi> had he

                     <hi>ADam</hi> was commanded to sanctifie the seventh day in the

                  <p>1. <hi>Adam</hi> was commanded to sanctifie the seventh

such a Command, why should it not be recorded? He
that will have us believe more then is set downe,
must alledge some Scripture or some reason why it was
not set down.</p>
                  <p>It will be said unlesse <hi>Adam</hi> was commanded to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
the seventh day, wherfore did God sanctifie it in the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Because thou a man knowest not a reason of

Gods doings, this is not a sufficient reason or warrant for
thee to affirme that he did more then thou findest that
he did in the Scriptures. And consider that others may
know some reason hereof, though thou and I do not.</p>
                  <p>This that followeth, whether they be reasons or not I
leave it to thy consideration, I dare not say so, I was not
with God when he laid the foundations of the earth.</p>
                  <p>1. It appeareth by <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. (as is said before) that
Gods Resting the seventh day wherein God rested and
which he sanctified, was a Type of the Rest that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the people of God.</p>
                  <p>2. God might sanctifie the seventh day in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for a purpose not present but to come, namely that
the Israelites should sanctifie the same when they came
into the land of Canaan, another Paradise as it were, and
a Type also of the kingdome of heaven; A blessed time
and a blessed place, an holy day and an holy land sort well
together.</p>
                  <p>When a man shall stand before Christs judgement seat
and being demanded, wherefore didst thou say, that God
commanded <hi>Adam</hi> to sanctifie the seventh day when the

            <div type="answer">
               <head>Answer.</head>
               <p>To your answer I rejoyne, That this example of God,
thus declared by himself, was in the nature of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
as appeareth plainly by the paralel case. We see
Gods creating Man male and female was a law justly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
thence, obligatory enough to binde one man to
marry but one woman at once, and to love her and live
with her as appeareth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23, 24. compared with
<hi>Marke</hi> 10. 6, 7. where there is concluded, from this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55806:89"/>
action of God, a perpetuall binding dutie to all
mankinde, without any expresse Commandement to that
purpose.</p>
               <p>But Gods blessing and hallowing the seventh day
must needs enforce a Command, if we consider, that (as
Christ saith) the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was made for man, that is saith
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hilder sham</hi> for the great benefit and behoofe of man;
so that man could not (no not in Innocency) have been
without it.</p>
               <p>And if this of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> were of no obligatory
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orce, I pray you then, why doe you (as before) say that
<hi>Adam,</hi> if he had continued in Innocency, should have
kept it? Me thinks he should rather then have kept eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day <hi>Sabbath</hi> then we now; and yet you say, It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he should have wrought sixe dayes and sanctified the
seventh. Therefore as Christ saith in the case of separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it was not so from the beginning; So say I in this
case of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> that it was so from the beginning,
on Gods part actually, and on mans part it both should and
would have been so, had he continued upright.</p>
               <p>And therefor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as well in this of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as in that
of Marriage, ought it to be so now. Nor did mans fall
abrogate the <hi>Sabbath</hi> (any more then it did the rest of
the morall Law<note n="*" place="margin">Know that all the Commandements given in Innocency were morall, either by a naturall or posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive moralitie.</note> as you would seeme to perswade in
your first Chapter. For God used the self same authoritie
to reinforce it when he gave the Law the second time, to
wit, his own example and the Creation, both which he
used in his first institution.</p>
               <p>And therefore however we may think of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
in our corrupt reasonings, or by other mens examples, as
the lewes might doe of Marriage from the example of
the Patriarchs polygamy, or the toleration of <hi>Moses,</hi> y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
it was other wayes from the beginning, and let God be
true though men be lyers.</p>
               <p>As touching your marginall note, God (as I may so
speake) had no reason to goe so farre of for an inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55806:90"/>
as to <hi>Adam,</hi> (especially it having been so long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted)
when he might have it fresh and neerer
hand; which he the rather chose to use, for that this
iteration of the Law was more peculiar, and a greater
Demonstration of his speciall love to them in way of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and so more pressing and remarkable.</p>
               <p>And yet doth he not utterly omit to make use of the
first institution, for he useth the same Arguments to
them, as to <hi>Adam,</hi> for the observing it, to wit, his own
example, and the memory of the Creation: which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that it was to be understood as a Commandement
laid then upon <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as now upon the Israelites.
And by this rule you may say, The promise and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace was not given to <hi>Adam,</hi> because <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17.
The Apostle draweth his Argument of refutation from
that Covenant which God confirmed with <hi>Abraham</hi>
430 yeeres before the Law was given, and not from the
Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> at the first. Touching the
latter part of your marginall note I have answered it a
little before, from <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>It may well be said, (as a Rejoynder to your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
answer) that unlesse the sanctifying of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
was instituted as an Ordinance for <hi>Adam</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
wherefore did God sanctifie it? for Christ saith,
The <hi>Sabbath</hi> was made (that is appointed or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the beginning) for man; And if God had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
and secret intent in this, why was it revealed
(especially when the thing was done and past) seeing
things revealed belong to us and to our children? And
from your own reason, That the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was a Type of
the Rest that remaines to the people of God, a man may
justly argue the use of it to the Church, and consequently
the necessitie and universalitie of it. For by the people
of God is not meant any visible particular, but the whole
Catholike Church.</p>
               <p>And why God, who (instrict sense) rested no more on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55806:90"/>
that day then on others, did yet so declare himself to have
done, <hi>ad captum vulgi,</hi> and did also spin out the creation
into six dayes, which else he could have done in a trice, if
it were not for example sake, I leave to any indifferent
judgement.</p>
               <p>And as touching your second reason, why God should
thus antedate the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and have such a speciall eye to
Israel, in the time of Innocency, when there was no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
wall built up, I see no reason, nor could the ancient
Iewes ever dreame of such an interpretation, neither
can you produce the like example in any thing else, from
all the Scripture, to give some colour of probability to
your conceit.</p>
               <p>But some there are, who screw their wits further then
you to foyle this Doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ob.</note> and for want
of other objections stick not to say that those words, <hi>Gen.
2. ver.</hi> 3. were not at all delivered by God in Innocency, but
are onely by <hi>Moses,</hi> speaking there of Gods rest, aptly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
in way of Anticipation, declaring what God did
then the better to give authority to the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> that was
instituted in his time.</p>
               <p>To which I answer three things as followeth:<note place="margin">Ans.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. That they may as well (and better) affirme the
the foure and twentieth verse of that Chapter to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
drawn and inserted (<hi>orbiter</hi>) by <hi>Moses.</hi> Had these
objectors lived in the time of the Iewes, before this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 5. was written, they would doubtlesse
readily have sided for the maintenance of <hi>Moses</hi> his bill
of divorce, and have invented tricks against the law of
marriage mentioned, <hi>Gen. 2. vers.</hi> 24. as now they doe
against the law of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> mentioned <hi>vers.</hi> 3. In both
which <hi>Moses</hi> doth alike couple the example and duty,
whereas had it not been then preceptive, why should
<hi>Moses</hi> pussle our faith, and transgresse the rules of method,
not contenting himselfe with the relation of the history
alone as it is penned, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. especially seeing he needed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55806:91"/>
not have begged any credit to the duty of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> by
inserting it into that place: For God had sufficiently war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
it under his owne hand in the Tables of stone from
mount Sinai. I say they have farre lesse reason to make this
a <hi>Prolepsis</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> his inserting, then that of 24. <hi>vers.</hi>
of this second of <hi>Genesis,</hi> which rather seemes to be an
inference of <hi>Moses</hi> his owne collecting from <hi>Adams</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
words in the verse foregoing, then this a <hi>Prol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>psis</hi> of
his inserting from Gods resting on the seventh day; And
the reason likewise is the same, for whereas it was done
(saith D. <hi>Heylyn, pag.</hi> 10.) by <hi>Moses,</hi> because of the Iewes
adversenesse to observe that day, and therefore they are
minded of it by an intimation of the equity and reason of
it, even in the entrance of Gods book, derived from Gods
first resting on that day after all his works: So in like
manner, they may alleadge this to be a minding of them
of their duty in this, from the equity and reason of Gods
making them male and female at first, because of the
aversenesse of the Iewes to this conjugall law; seeing that
<hi>Moses</hi> was faine to grant them a bill of divorce for the
hardnesse of their hearts, besides the Polygamy that even
the Patriarchs gave example of. But I know no man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
this later, and if any doe let them compare this
24. <hi>verse</hi> with <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 4, 5. and their mouthes will soon
be stopped; and as little reason have they to affirme the
former, but to grant this its being from the beginning, as
well as that.</p>
               <p>2. I answer, That if these words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. were onely
inserted of <hi>Moses,</hi> and were not institutive, but that
Gods giving the law of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to the Iewes, was the
first institution of it, then these words of the fourth
Commandement mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 11. would have
run in the present tense, thus; therfore the Lord blesseth,
or doth now blesse the seventh day, and halloweth it, and
not in the preter tense, thus; therefore the Lord blessed the
seventh day and hallowed it, for this hath a reference with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55806:91"/>
it, implying it to have been done aforetime of God, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was (like of those last words of the third verse of
the second of <hi>Gen.</hi> (which God had created and made)
imply a precedent Creation, in Innocency, not referring
to its institution upon the fall of Mannah, as some object,
for then there was no mention made of blessing and hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>3. I answer, That this appeares plainly to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (though opposed by our
late Doctors) which in the Bible allowed by Canon (Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
80.) in the contents prefixed to the second chapter of
<hi>Gen.</hi> calleth it peremptorily, the first <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Bish. <hi>White</hi> brings in this objection, <hi>p.</hi> 42. That the
Law of the fourth Commandement was not agreeable to
the state of Innocency. 1. For that in that happy estate,
there was no toylesome labour, &amp;c. Sweat of face entred
into the world after the fall, and before the fall mans la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
was matter of delight and pleasure. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:</p>
               <p>1. That this is a good argument with those that grant
him, rest to be either the onely or principall sanctification
of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That there was labour enjoyned <hi>Adam,</hi> which
though it was not toylesome, yet (as we have elsewhere
observed) it must necessarily take him off from immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
contemplation and more solemne service and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and that he was so farre capable of wearisomnesse,
even in Innocency, as to have found other manner refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in divine and spirituall things, then in worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</p>
               <p>3. No more was Gods labour in the worke of creation
toilesome, but delightfull, and yet he saith of himselfe that
he rested the seventh day.</p>
               <p>Secondly he objects, That <hi>Adam</hi> being a free man,
might have intermitted labour at any time, when himself
pleased. To which I answer:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55806:92"/>1. So no doubt might God in his worke of Creation.</p>
               <p>2. And so <hi>Adam</hi> by voluntary worship in keeping
every day <hi>Sabbath</hi> and not this, should have lost an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and significant ordinance (as I have proved the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
to be.) Iust as they would now have an every day
<hi>Sabbath</hi> under the Gospell, to blow up the weekly. <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;</hi>
As if because that under the Gospell God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
that he will teach us,<note n="*" place="margin">Or as if because it is promised that now under the time of the Gospell, wee shall have the Law written in our hearts in opposition to it, as it was graven in stone, and so given to the Isra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lites. We should turne Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Law in a sutable sense to our times (<hi>viz.</hi> as a rule of obedience, and a repaire to decayed nature) to belong to us.</note> 
                  <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 31, 34. therefore we
might cast away the use of meanes, whereby we are to
get knowledge. But as the best way to be taught of God
is to use the meanes whereby he workes knowledge: So
the best way to keep this every day <hi>Sabbath,</hi> is to sanctifie
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the Lord, that so the Lord of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
may sanctifie us as he hath promised: And those that most
truly and conscionably desire to keep an every day <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
to the Lord, finde most need of a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> being built
up sensibly thereby the better to performe that duty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he objecteth, There was no necessity of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
one set day in every weeke for performing religious
offices, for man lived in Paradise in a fruition of God. To
which I answer:</p>
               <p>1. By the same rule seconded by their position. The
Church need appoint no <hi>Holy-dayes</hi> now under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<note n="*" place="margin">Which theile hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeeld to.</note> for say they, we are to keep every day <hi>Sabbath</hi> or
<hi>Holy-day</hi> to the Lord, which surely we cannot doe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
spirituall fruition of God.</p>
               <p>2. That though Gods children enjoy now a constant
fruition of God as a friend, yet is this fruition much main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
increased, and inlarged by their sanctifying the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:</hi>
And so doubtlesse should <hi>Adams,</hi> it representing to
him and us the perfection of our happinesse and his.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he objecteth, All Gods creatures were as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
books to preach to man the majesty and bounty of
the Creator.</p>
               <p>To which I answer. We account it not a needlesse acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in God when he had made his creatures which we
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55806:92"/>
knew and saw well enough, so solemnly notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to overlook them, as is recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 31. Neither
is there any cause why <hi>Adam</hi> should not have a solemne
day of contemplation and service appointed him, because
of the time and meanes he had of serving God on other
dayes: seeing the <hi>Sabbath</hi> intimated most doctrinally,
what we ought to God, to wit, our whole selves, and
what service we should doe him in heaven, to wit, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
without any interruption, the better to enamourus
of our change.</p>
               <p>To conclude, it is evident that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was a Law
in Commandment in time of Innocency, else it could
not have suffered losse and detriment by <hi>Adams</hi> fall,
which it did, as is evident in that. First, It was one of
the Lawes written in <hi>Moses</hi> his first Tables, which were
broken and spoyled to signifie as much. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there were renewed in the second Tables the very
self same lawes which were at first, whereof the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
was one. For the <hi>Sabbath</hi> waites as an handmaid on
the morall Law, in which respect chiefly it was made for
man (that is, given to mankinde) to be helpfull to his
obedience: So that seeing, as a Law, the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant
with the Law in the second exhibition of it,
consequently it was so at first, especially seeing it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that God writ the same things in the second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
as he did in the first; which signifyeth Gods twice
giving the Law once in <hi>Adam</hi> which was defaced, and
so the <hi>Sabbath</hi> as well as the rest, which he repaired as
before.</p>
               <p>And again work was commanded in Innocencie and
consequently the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that an Holy land and an Holy day suite well
together, but an Holy Church and an Holy <hi>Sabbath</hi> suite
better, and you shall finde this Holy Church keeping the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> in the wildernesse, before they came into the
Holy land, and more strictly too.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:55806:93"/>When God (lastly) asketh me that reason why I
thought the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to be a Commandement. I think it

God could not be said to be refreshed on the seventh day,

in Gods intention were proper to that state, and were not
to be renewed by Christ after the fall, of which sort this
of the forbidden Tree was one, and therefore was <hi>Adam</hi>
thrust out upon his fall by God, from having to doe with
any thing that is peculiar to that state.</p>
               <p>But other Commandements there were, which were
intended to remaine as common to man falling or stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
by meanes of Christ, and of this sort was the created
Law of nature in the mind of man, the ordinance of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and then why not this of the <hi>Sabbath?</hi> For this is
most true, that whatsoever God giveth as a law after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
we have no reason to thinke that to be utterly
abolished by the fall, for from all such things we are kept
by the fiery sword, never to have commerce with them
againe: For thus we are utterly deprived of something,
which in Innocency signified Heaven, to shew us our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
and Gods justice; And something againe is renewed
unto us, which likewise did and doth signifie Heaven, to
manifest our hope and his mercy through Christ. So that
then if the <hi>Sabbath</hi> be not abolished by the fall, neither is
it abrogated as a Type, because not yet fulfilled: For the

That I deny not but there may be found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
a mixture of morall and ceremoniall Lawes, without
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55806:96"/>
danger of confounding their natures after they had been
once formally instituted. But that the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which God himselfe both spake and gave, after
such an extraordinary manner, with such majesty and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and in regard of the place for all the world to take
notice of it, and which he calleth his Covenant, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in a speciall manner recordeth them to be ten in
number, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. and with his owne finger wrote them
twice in Tables of stone (signifying as well their lasting
nature as any other thing) and commanded them to be
put into the Holy of Holies in the Arke under the Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seate,
and which were all of them institute in Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
either by created Nature or immediate Revelation,
whereas all other Ordinances were delivered by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of <hi>Moses</hi> a mortall man, but that immediately
by the immortall God, as witnesseth <hi>Iosephus</hi> in his
Iewish antiquities: <hi>Moses</hi> (saith hee) received the ten
Commandements from the high and unexcessible moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Sinai, with thundrings, but other Lawes he received
in the Iewish Tabernacle, ascending no more the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
Now that one of these should be temporary, and the
other nine perpetuall, is doubtlesse in any reasonable mans
opinion very ill likely. I am sure Bishop <hi>Andrewes</hi> in his
Chatechisticall doctrine saith, That it were not wise to set
a Ceremony (he meanes a Iewish abrogative Ceremony)
in the midst of morall precepts. And one saith, Certainly
God did intend something extraordinary by this great
odds of conveyance, and what more proper then that
these were mortall and dependant upon those, those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
and independant, especially if we weigh the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how <hi>Moses</hi> concludeth his repetition of the ten
Commandements with these words. God added no
more but wrote them in Tables of stone, to shew that
these words be valued of a greater rate, then those which
should be added by the hands of <hi>Moses,</hi> which were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be explanations of these, or shadowes of Christ:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55806:96"/>
And as God did not adde, so man may not diminish from
these words, and so consequently there is no reason
without sacriledge to suspect the morality of the fourth
Commandement.</p>

Scripture without expresse mention of Prayer, as in <hi>Ester</hi>
4. 16. Where when <hi>Ester</hi> gave <hi>Mordecai</hi> in charge to
assemble the Iewes, and to fast for her three daies and

               <p>As for your Arguments drawn from the Covenant,
which because it consisted both of Morall and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall

many Morall precepts in the Tables of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
<hi>Answ.</hi> Nay rather it is good reason that both
the Lawes should be written together in the Booke
of the Covenant, as indeed they were, in regard that
the two Tables were to be laid up in the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi>
and so not to be come by, but the copies of that Book
were of continuall use. And again seeing the Covenant
of the Iews consisted of both, it is the more reason that
they should be carefully distinguished (as likewise they
were) then confounded, seeing you cannot deny but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55806:97"/>
that which was Morall was to appertain to after ages, and
if they had then been undistinctly mixed, how could

why now it should only be preferred to be the Master of

               <p>It is true that these 17. and 18. <hi>verses</hi> of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Matt.</hi>
doe intend as well the Ceremoniall as the Morall Lawes,
for Christ going about to bring himself into liking with
the Iewes by removing the impediment of their Law,
shewing that he made for and not against it. First con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Ceremoniall, whereas they thought Christ
had meant to have made those Laws to be no laws, but to
have brought in a new way of Righteousnesse and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into the world, he telleth them, his coming was not
to disparage or annihilate those lawes, but rather to ratifie
them by fulfilling them, not so much to take away their
being as to give them a better being.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:55806:100"/>Secondly, concerning the morall Law, whereas they
trusted to it to their own destruction, and misinterpreted
it in favour to their carnall and corrupt mindes, he came
to shew them the true sence and meaning of God in it,
to wit, that they were not to be saved by their own but
by his fulfilling it, and that God will as well be served in
spirit as in letter: So that he was so farre from abolishing
this Morall law, as that he did more enforce it, and gave
life to that which they had made to be but a dead letter.
And thus this text maketh for the perpetuitie of the
fourth Commandement, for that Christ fulfilled both the
Lawes, the one by adding the substance to the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
the other by delivering men from the curse of it
through grace, and confirming it (by a new exposition
<note n="*" place="margin">New I meane to them</note> and a manifestation of the spirituall part of it) as a rule of
manners for all ages; which is evinced out of the 19.
<hi>verse,</hi> where notwithstanding he had formerly said how
that he had fulfilled the Law, yet doth he there presse
them to obedience, which must needs be of the Morall
Law.</p>
               <p>Moreover as Christ meant not to destroy the law, so
neither did he meane to confound the natures of lawes
perpetuall and temporary (which was a way to destroy
them) and consequently not to annihilate the use and
being of any thing, save only such as did help to build the
partition wall, and were ordained for the state and time
of the Iewish Church before Christs coming: Much
lesse the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which sprung out of Paradise, before
any promise of Christ was made, and which now in our
State or Church is every whit as usefull and proper as
ever, serving to cherish the Morall law, and to help us to
heavenly mindednesse by its signification.</p>
               <p>Nor doe we say as you would force upon us in your
Margine, that every tittle in the Decalogue is perpetuall,
to wit stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tly (for that the Law like other Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
occasionally written, in the strictnesse of the Letter,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55806:100"/>
did partake of those times, and of the state of the Church
to which it was then given) but Evangelically, and in a
sutable sence to our times it is perpetuall.</p>

               <p>Some of late restraining Christs words to the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

               <p>I will not much dispute what <hi>Sabbath</hi> was meant by
Christ in these words of his, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 20. For admitting
the conclusion, how that Christ gave this counsell for the
better avoiding of bodily harmes and calamities, and the
increase of those troubles, which (at the least) was such as
was not from the beginning of the world to this time,
nor ever should be. For that they were to typifie the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
that should befall the wicked and unbeleevers at
the last day; I confesse this exposition of yours to be in my
conceit very genuine, and yet it may for that very reason
intend the weekly <hi>Sabbaths</hi> as well as any of their festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals:
For as by the one the Iewes should be multiplyed
at Ierusalem at that time, and so should their misery be
increased: So againe by the other might their consciences
be so straitned in regard of their superstitious resting,
which they used upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as that they would
rather endure to dye then fly, especially considering the
Religion they put in that tradition of a <hi>Sabbath</hi> daies
journey, which was but two miles as they accounted it;
So that had they fled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut two miles further then their
stint, they would have thought themselves more to have
violated the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> then if they had spent the whole day
in contentions and seditions within the City: For of such
force is zeale, when it is not according to knowledge of
Scripture, as that, through our corrupt nature, it bindeth
the conscience more straight then any command of God
rightly understood; As we may see by those souldiers,
who when they were besieged, rather then they would
drinke of the well into which a dog was throwne, they
would starve or render the City<note n="*" place="margin">Turkish History.</note>. And so doubtlesse
would many of the Iewes chuse to dye before they would
fly further then their superstitious tradition gave them
leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:55806:102"/>But as I have given truth its due in commending your

that the fourth Commandement should bind to sanctifie

                  <p>There are who teaching that the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
bindeth to sanctifie the Lords-day, will have it thus
to come about. They say that those words in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
Remember to sanctifie the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> are for substance
the whole fourth Commandement, that which followeth
being only an explication and a reason, and here they take
the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> in a generall sense, so that this (with
them) is a more generall Commandement, then if God
had said, Remember to sanctifie the seventh day.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I acknowledge that these words are for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
the whole fourth Commandement as you teach,
but whereas you put a difference betweene <hi>Sabbath</hi> and
seventh day,<note place="margin">Consider further. 1. That once onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, mention is made of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and that <hi>Sabbath</hi> was the seventh day. 2.

                  <p>1. Because then the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> should be taken in
one sense in the beginning of the Commandement, and in
another towards the end; for towards the end by <hi>Sabbath</hi>
must needs be meant the seventh day onely. <hi>And rested
the seventh day, wherfore the Lord blessed the Sabbath
and sanctified it.</hi> Here Gods resting on the seventh day is
the reason why he sanctified the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and can it be a
reason of sanctifying another day besides the seventh day,
especially seeing he laboured on all the other. Suppose
that we had the like speech in the new Testament, as
thus. He rose again on the first day, wherefore he blessed the
day of resurrection, and sanctified it; Who would not
take the day of resurrection here for the first day on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</p>

Friday by Statute. I answer, That indeed it were strange
to turn Friday into Saturday by vertue of the letter of the
same law, <hi>Rebus sic stantibus,</hi> but put case we had some
extraordinary Deliverance fell out on Friday (as the Gun-powder
Treason) and were to keepe it weekely as we
are the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> then if either the Parliament <hi>sedente cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>

should alter the law, or the King by a <hi>non obstante</hi>
should for this cause publish an alteration, or by his and
the Courts example should change the day from Friday
to Saturday, in memory of that Deliverance, Friday be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made thereby rather a Day of Feasting then Fasting,
I thinke no wise man will say that the law was repealed
or suffered any detriment by this: So &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Christ came not to give new lawes but to renew the
old upon a new condition, and in this sense was it a new

Lords Day a renewed <hi>Sabbath,</hi> not given as a new law,
but altered by example. For ours is a new <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as the
Covenant is said to be a new Covenant, which is only in
exhibition, not in substance: For there was nothing but
by the coming of Christ it was ground under one of these

to qualifie and renew the old upon Evangelicall tearmes.</p>

               <p>By this first opinion, though the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
bindeth to keep the <hi>Sabbath</hi> yet not the seventh
Day, but others teach that it bindeth to keep the seventh

               <p>It is not needfull to prove the Lords-day to be the last
day of the weeke; It is enough to hold correspondencie
with the Commandement, if we prove it to be the
seventh day, not in order, but in number: For though the
Commandement bindeth perpetually to the number, it
was and is the present condition of the Church, in regard
of our benefit from God and Gods Covenant to us, which
bindeth us to the order first or last. In which adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we, as is requisite, retain and observe the scope and
equitie of the Commandement, since God hath afforded
us sixe dayes for the dispatch of our own businesses, that
we should willingly dedicate the seventh to his worship:
For the altering of the circumstance of time doth not
abolish the substance of the Commandement. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55806:104"/>
is evident and usuall in other matters, as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
It was one thing to have the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Councell
translated to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> and the ending of it was another
thing: So there is a difference between the adjourning
of the last to the first, and the dissolution of the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
day. And although the <hi>Sabbath</hi> be now the first day of
the weeke in one respect, to wit, according to order,
yet it remaines still the last in another respect, to wit, as
they are seven in number: And that it was thus, even in
the Christians account, the last as well as the first, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. where <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth them, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
first day of the weeke every one should contribute as
God had prospered him, to wit, in the sixe fore-going
work-dayes.</p>
               <p>And as touching your reason I answer, that every
thing must have a time of institution and beginning.
Had God made <hi>Adam</hi> the first day, then had he kept
Gods seventh day <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but God making him the
sixth day, and he being first to spend sixe dayes in one
kinde of imployment, and the seventh in another, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it is more then likely he was to keepe the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
day from the first day of the Creation as his first
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> and not the fourteenth day as his second<note n="*" place="margin">Had <hi>Adam</hi> kept Gods seventh day <hi>Sabbath,</hi> then had he kept a <hi>Sabbath</hi> in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, for it was instituted before his fall</note>.</p>
               <p>Againe, if to be God did raine <hi>Mannah,</hi> on the first
day according to the computation of the Creation, then
they kept that seventh day <hi>Sabbath;</hi> But if he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to raine <hi>Mannah</hi> on that day, but on some other in
the weeke, then was that computation broken, and yet
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> rightly kept.</p>
               <p>So, had Christ risen on the last day of the weeke, (but
then had not <hi>Isaiah</hi> his prophecie been fulfilled 65. 17.)
then had we observed that day; but the Sonne of man
(as you say) being Lord of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> its fit the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
should waite on him, and not he on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
and therefore as he chose the first day to rise on, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the morning and not the evening to rise in; so have
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55806:105"/>
we done well, after Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, in imitating him as
he imitated Christ, in keeping the Lords-day <hi>Sabbath</hi>
ever since: which, as I have noted before, was not dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prefigured in the keeping the first and seventh day in
the time of the Passeover: As like wise to being the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
in the morning and not in the evening (which yet
cannot be done without some losse of time, being that
the Iewes <hi>Sabbath</hi> ended at the evening) for if we
change the day because of Christs resurrection, and by
<hi>Pauls</hi> example; why not then the terminations of the
day, according to the time of Christs resurrection, and
example of <hi>Paul</hi> in his practice at <hi>Tro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s.</hi> I speake this
as an argument against some, that are of opinion the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> still beginneth at evening, as in the time of the
Iewes, and first Creation, when indeed evening and
morning made the day, and darknesse was to goe before
light.</p>
               <p>As for the disorder which you say this innovation must
needs produce, let it lye upon the Apostles who can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it well enough; and so may we building on the
foundation of the Prophets and Apostles: In the meane
time <hi>Pauls</hi> example, which is not in vaine set downe in
the 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 6, 7. (where no day of the seven, but only
the last, which was the first day of the weeke, is thus
disposed of) is a sufficient warrant for us hence forwards
to observe it, from the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Phil.</hi> 9. The things which you
have seen in me, doe, and the God of peace shall be with
you.</p>
               <p>And as for that in your margin, where you say that
the number seven hath reference to other going before;
I answer you in this figure 7000007: where you see,
the first as well as the last in some respect may be the
seventh, to wit in number, though not in place and
order.</p>

               <p>But let it be imagined (although I can scarce see how it
can be imagined only) that our day is become the seventh
and last of the weeke, what would follow hereupon? That
God might well be said to have rested on our day, and to
have enjoyned one day on Mount Sinai; But then it might
not be said, that Christ rose upon one day. He that saith
both God rested and Christ rose upon one day, may as wel

            <div type="answer">
               <head>Answer.</head>
               <p>This opinion, of the seventh day to intend one of seven,
is doubtlesse most true, and is therefore spoken in the
Commandement exclusively, implying thus much, That
thou art not to keep the sixth day, or one of six, or the eight
day or one of eight, but the seventh day or one of seven.</p>
               <p>For the substance of the Commandement hath respect
unto the number, for it opposeth seven to sixe; as if it had
said, six daies shall be for labour, and the seventh for Rest:
although I deny not, but the example of God in respect of
order, was then significa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly binding during the inforceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of the reasonof the creation: I would not be mistaken; and
be thought (when I say one of seven) to meane any one,
but as <hi>Ames.</hi> in that place being rightly understood, and
set downe, <hi>dies septimus vel unus è septem,</hi> that is, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day, or one of seven, not of six or eight. For I know
the Iewes were to celebrate the seventh day, the last in
order both for example and signification sake, during the
Covenant of works: For the order both was and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
usefull in respect of its signification, and helpeth
much to the fulfilling the duty of sanctifying the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi>
And therefore hath God been ever carefull, not only
to give the generall Commandement to his Church, for
the observation of the seventh day; But he hath likewise
prescribed them a <hi>terminus a quo,</hi> a day or an occasion
whence and whereby they were to number their seven
daies (which yet was not alwaies one &amp; thesame seventh
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55806:106"/>
day) As unto <hi>Adam</hi> he gave the first day of his being crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to number from, and therefore was he carefull to give
him this Commandement in due time, to wit, the second
day of his Creation, so soone as he had given an example,
that so he might remember it against the seventh day
came: So likewise to the Iewes he appointed by <hi>Moses</hi>
the first day of Mannah for them to reckon upon: And so
to us by his owne and the Apostles examples he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

4. Opinion.</head>
               <p>Some of late tell us of the substance and circumstances
of the fourth Commandement,<note place="margin">Give way to this new doctrine of the substance and circumstance of a divine law, and open a wide gap to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold errors, we shall now have seeking after the substance, as there was after the Allegory heretofore.</note> by the substance they
meane the sanctifying of one day in the weeke, by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
the keeping of the seventh day, and strict re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.
<hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That the sanctifying of one day in the
weeke is the substance of the fourth Commandement
you have not learned from the words thereof, for they
speake only of sanctifying the seventh day. 2. No Prophet
nor Apostle (nor Father I beleeve) hath thus interpreted
the Commandement either in cleere or darke termes.
3. No other Commandement of God is to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after such a manner. 4. Then had not a Iew broken
the Commandement though hee had laboured on the
seventh day, so that before he had sanctified one of the six
daies.</p>
               <p>If God had said, Remember to sanctifie one day of the
week six daies thou shalt labour, and the seventh thou shalt
sanctifie, ye had some colour for your doctrine, although
this had bin nothing in very deed. For God said, thou shalt
keep a Feast to me,<note place="margin">Neither was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of the land one yeare in seven the substance of that Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 10. 11.</note> thrice in the yeare thou shalt keep
the Feast, &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 14, 15, 16. and yet the keeping of
the Feast thrice in the yeare was not the substance of that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55806:107"/>
Law who ever so imagined? But onely God there first
telleth the Israelites in generall what hee would have
done, and afterwards acquainteth them with his minde
particularly and fully. You your selves I am sure will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that the keeping of a feast thrice a yeare is as
well the substance of the foresaid Law, as the keeping of
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> once in a weeke is the substance of the fourth
Commandement; and the worshipping of God was one
end of the feast, as well as of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Yet Christ hath
blotted out that whole Law. The like may be said of that
Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>By this opinion not the substance, but only the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the fourth Commandement are mentioned in
the Decalogue, which circumstances also are not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <head>Answer.</head>
               <p>That in the fourth Commandement is both substance
and circumstance is evident: By substance, I understand
the sanctifying the seventh day, not as it is last in order, but
as it is opposed to all other numbers, by circumstance I
understand the order and the reason<note n="*" place="margin">For the reason did as well bind to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the order, as to establish the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement it selfe, til I there was a new reason of a new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but never of a new commandement</note>: Which two (that
I may use your phrase in the conclusion of your seuenth
Chapter) have been manifested to have been circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
by the event.</p>
               <p>I say the very reason of the Commandement as it did
bind the order was circumstantiall and changable. Wee
see how it received an addition, in that their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of their deliverance out of Egypt (which was a
Type of our spirituall deliverance) was made a reason
of this fourth Commandement as well as the Creation;
And so is now our redemption it selfe by Christ, and yet
nothing of the substance abolished or altered, but the
maine duty of sanctifying the seventh day is still obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
And the reason (as I conceive) why this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55806:107"/>
was more circumstantiall then others, was because
it was preter-ordained to the Law of Nature for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
use of the Church in all states and conditions: And
therefore was it to be brought to the state, and made su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the condition of the Church<note n="*" place="margin">In regard of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiall parts of it, the morall part fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all states as an help of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note>; and not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Church to be brought to it, as were also the
Sacraments, and yet so as that God hath himselfe ever or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
these changable circumstances in it, either by the
doctrine or example of his Prophets or Apostles, notvery
darkly.</p>
               <p>Indeed as touching the seventh day to be any other
then the last in the time of the Prophets, is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
because then that order was in force, but now in
the Apostles time, the event doth cleerly manifest the
contrary in the practice of the Apostles, which giveth
sufficient authority for ours<note n="*" place="margin">It is altogether an unlikely thing, that the Church without a pregnant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement (which there is none in scripture) would take upon them to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement (enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a duty upon an universall and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall benefit) and yet of their owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity bring up a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome equivalent</note>.

of the Israelites deliverance prefixed to the

Deliverance, and the precise meaning of this promise
in the fifth Commandement, and their alterations into a
more spirituall &amp; proper meaning for the present Church,
yet do the Commandements themselves for their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
remaine to this day the same: For the change of
significant circumstances may be upon good grounds
without impeachment to the being of the law: as the
Israelites supposed changing the gesture from standing to
sitting, when they were a Sedentary Church did no whit
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55806:108"/>
abolish the Passeover. And thus did <hi>David</hi> change the
order that God had appointed among the Levites (how
that till thirtie yeeres old they were not to officiate)
when the reason of it failed, and the Arke had rest, then
without prejudice to the Ordinance, he ordained that
they should officate at twentie, as is 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. As a
man may alter his temperament and yet continue a man
still, so long as for substance he remaineth the same in soul
and body. So if so be the <hi>Sabbath</hi> had been changed, from
being kept every seventh day, to every sixth, then the
whole frame of the fourth Commandement had suffered
shipwrack: But in the change of one seventh day to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
upon such a ground and reason the substance suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not.</p>
               <p>For as Bishop <hi>White</hi> observes, <hi>pag.</hi> 136. (against <hi>T. B.</hi>
who affirmes that in all Divine lawes whensoever any
part is taken away the whole is abolished) That if by
part he understand such a part as is substantiall and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent
his position is granted, but if he understand a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiall
or accidentall part the position is false; For
(saith he) the Law of Prayer or Divine worship is still
in force, as it was in <hi>Davids</hi> and in <hi>Daniels</hi> time, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of substantiall actions, but many circumstances of
time, place and gesture, are abolished in the time of the
Gospel: as <hi>Daniels</hi> praying with windows open toward
Ierusalem, &amp;c. And therefore, a little to vary the words
and sence of his conclusion against <hi>T. B.</hi> the substance
of the fourth Commandement may be continued and yet
the Circumstance altered.</p>
               <p>As touching your following instance of the three feasts
a yeere, I see not that it holds good Analogie with the
<hi>Sabbath:</hi> But your marginal instance of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arths seventh
yeere <hi>Sabbath</hi> is proper. In which Commandement (I
say) there is both circumstance and substance. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is the Law it selfe of resting the seventh yeere in
opposition to the other sixe: But the precise order is added
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55806:108"/>
by the God of order, for the better execution of this Law
without confusion, which must needs follow if it were
left arbitrary. Like as in the Law of Tythes, God chose to
himselfe one in ten, which for orders sake, and that they
might have a rule to walke by, he appointed to be every
tenth as it passed under the rod. And so of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
wherein for order sake God did not only appoint the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day to be the last, but also gave a computation from
Mannah, that so they might also know which should be
that last, and so avoid confusion: Which yet doth nothing
hinder, but that the same God may upon occasion, appoint
another order by his Apostles, as he did that by <hi>Moses,</hi> and
not harme the Law it selfe, or the substance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
in so doing. Nay I thinke, if the case were put
to you of a man in a farre countrey, who by some or other
accident losing that computation of Mannah) should not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
have dedicated every seventh day (which
yet happily might be the first, second, or third of the week
as well as the last) to an holy rest, in obedience to tho
Commandement: (I thinke I say) you would grant this
man to observe the fourth Commandement in substance.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is no Morality of the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as is said before: Indeed I acknowledge the Law of
Nature; here Nature taught the Gentiles, and doth teach
Christians to set apart some times (as places) for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
worship of God: But there is a<note n="*" place="margin">Suppose that God had said to <hi>Sem</hi> thou shalt sanctifie some time, to <hi>Ham</hi> thou shalt sanctifie one day in a week, and to <hi>Iaphet</hi> thou shalt sanctifie the seventh day, had he not given divers Lawes to them there?

               <p>Should God now say to the Iewes, you shall sanctifie
the seventh day, wherein I rested, and to us Christians
you shall sanctifie the first day wherein my Sonne rose.
The Iewes sanctifying their <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and we the Lords-day,
should doe that is enjoyned by the Law of Nature in
a generall manner, but as they should not doe that were
enjoined by our particular Law, so then neither should we
doe that were enjoined by their particular Law.</p>

               <p>That there were some intervening Ceremonies befell
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the Iewish Church, you (I thinke) will not
(I am sure cannot justly) deny, which now like an old suit

and pure. For as the <hi>Sabbath</hi> it selfe was a super-addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or handmaid to the Law of Nature, that is of necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
use and service to preserve our obedience to the will
of God revealed in it (and especially to the first Table (as
I have observed in the beginning of this Tract: So had
it selfe also many additions, which were proper to the
state of the Iewish Church (in which time it was reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced)

were some of them Ceremonies, some meere occasionall

some changable, according to the severall natures, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares

Church of ours. In the Commandement it selfe, as it is
laid downe in the Decalogue, I know nothing properly
Ceremoniall in a Iewish sence, and to bee abrogated
properly by Christ; For whatsoever was abrogated by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55806:109"/>
Christ, was ordained by reason of Christ since the fall,
which the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was not.<note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> Yet is it no other then a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
(and for this cause it is so changable in diverse
particulars upon occasion) but of that nature and so annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Church, as the shadow to the body, inseparable,
though alterable, according to the condition of the party
and degree of the Sunne.</p>
               <p>Touching your first marginall note, with which I will
couple your conclusion of the fourth Opinion, You say,
That by these two opinions, Not substance, but either cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
or ceremony, are only mentioned in the fourth
Commandement, and hath as it were a peece of <hi>Moses</hi>
his vayle when it is read in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In the order there is included the substance<note n="*" place="margin">In the first Table it is ordinary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the greater in the lesse, the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the negative; like as in the second Table the lesse is mostly included in the greater.</note>;
For the seventh day cannot be commanded, but one of
seven must necessarily and principally be intended, as
when God commanded the Tenth, surely any man will
thinke he hath more respect to the number then to the
order.</p>
               <p>Neither can the fourth Commandement be said any
more, nay not so much (for the one was common and the
other proper, to have a peece of <hi>Moses</hi> his vayle over it,
for the seventh day being a Ceremony, then all the Law
hath by its preface of the Egyptian deliverance. I wish
you had considered what a vayle you cast upon the fourth
Commandement, when it is read with the Prayer.</p>
               <p>As concerning your seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d marginal note, I have formerly
shewne in what relation the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
stand. And as touching the difference of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
of one day in a weeke, and the seventh day I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That in substance they are the same, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is only in manner of exhibition. For <hi>Ham</hi> hath only
the substance it selfe mentioned and commanded him,
and the order left arbitrary, which if he of his own accord
should designe to be every seventh or last day, then I pray
you what difference for substance: But <hi>Iaphet</hi> hath both
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55806:110"/>
the substance and order assigned him of God, so that the
difference lyeth only in manner of exhibition. Like as the
Covenant of Grace was both one to the Iewes and us in
substance, onely as it was given to them, it was cloathed
with many circumstances and ceremonies (though they
were Lawes they were no better) but to us naked: All
which circumstances (I grant) did bind during their signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy,
and though now the Ceremonies be annulled, and
the Sacraments changed, which were Appendices to the
Covenant, yet is the substance of the Covenant the same,
and distinct from its circumstances: So though the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
admit an annulling of some additaments, and a
change of some circumstances or ceremonies, yet may
and doth the fourth Commandement in substance remain
the same distinct and unconfounded. Nay this very change
doth discover to us the substance from the circumstances
and ceremonies, as well of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
if we had not understood them before.</p>
               <p>And though the Morality and Ceremonies of the
fourth Commandement relish not with you, yet your
<hi>Partizans</hi> of later Edition passe it in <hi>Verbo Magistrî.</hi>
That it is abrogated in the speciality of it, because it was
ceremonious, and so serve their turnes to pull downe the
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> and yet affirme it stands good in the morality or
equity of it, to keep unraced the ejaculation annexed to it
in our Liturgy. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dow, pag.</hi> 9. saith in absolute
tearmes. They more fully expresse the nature of this
Commandement who say, It is partly Morall, and partly
Ceremoniall.</p>

one part for the rest, but when no part is put for the rest,
what manner of Trope may that be? For this thou shalt

God spake from Sinai.</p>

               <p>Although the fourth Commandement be a Law still in
force, yet (as I said) it bindeth us not to keep <hi>Sabbath</hi> the
last day of the weeke, though the seventh. For the order
was foretold to be altered in the 65. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 17. where it
is prophecyed, that Gods creating new heavens and a
new earth shall make the old to be forgotten, that is, there
shall be a wonderfull alteration, and that which now men
make most account of, to wit, the Creation, then they
shall account it the least, sanctifying the memory of my
resting from their Redemption in stead of my resting
from their Creation. And thus you wilfully slander us
when you say, that, <hi>Thou shalt sanctifie the seventh day
wherein I rested,</hi> is no part of Gods Law in these dayes,
for we grant it but with an Orthodox distinction of Rest.
For the Commandement it self looketh with a double

much illustrate the perpetuitie of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and yet
prophecie the change both in one, which also (if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the nature of those times) doth well prove the thing:
For though Christ speaketh plainly to us now, yet to
them he spake and prophecyed (as I may so say) in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
which rightly understood are no lesse proofes then
ours, And thus is the substance of the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
preserved, that is, the dedicating of the seventh day
to duties of Pietie and Mercy, and sixe dayes to our other
affaires, as also prophecie fulfilled, and the Apostles imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated.</p>
               <p>But may some say,<note place="margin">Object.</note> Our Redemption was not finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on that day, for that it still remaineth in acting by
Christs intercession, which is Bishop <hi>Whites</hi> objection,

               <p>Christs intercession after his dying and rising, is as
Gods providence was,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> and is, after his sixe dayes Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
And as (notwithstanding his continuall providence)
his Creation was finished on the last day of the week: So
Now (notwithstanding Christs intercession at Gods right
hand) our Redemption was finished on the first day of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55806:111"/>
the weeke by his Resurrection. And whereas Bishop
<hi>White</hi> further objecteth, <hi>pag.</hi> 299. That the day of Christs
resurrection cannot properly be called a <hi>Sabbath</hi> or day of
Rest, because our Saviour was in action on that day about
the necessary works of perfecting mans Redemption, by
applying, teaching, inspiring, authorizing his Disciples. I
answer. They were all <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> works, and so was
the seventh day a working day to God in many such like
respects sutable to the first Creation, and yet it was his
<hi>Sabbath</hi> for this reason, because he rested and ceased from
that which he did before, (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hildersham</hi> noteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Sabbat</hi> in his 135. <hi>Lect.</hi> on the 51.
<hi>Psalme</hi>) which holds in respect of Christ. Furthermore
<hi>page</hi> 300. Bishop <hi>White</hi> saith, That the Primitive Church
devoted the first day of the weeke to the honour and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Christ, not because of Christs cessation from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptive
actions, but because it was <hi>primus dies laetitiae,</hi>
The first day of joy and gladnesse for the resurrection of
the Lord: True; But the cause of this joy was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of our Redemption and Deliverance, which we
celebrate with a congratulatory commemoration on the
first day, like as we were to doe the perfection of our
Creation on the last day of the weeke. And <hi>pag.</hi> 303. h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
saith, That Christ rested upon his resurrection day, no
more then he did upon every day after untill his ascension,
and since his ascension untill the worlds end. <hi>Answ.</hi> So
he may say that God rested no more from his worke of
Creation on the seventh day, then he hath done ever since,
where by the way take notice, That it is the consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Creation and Redemption, which is meant
by their Resting, and which we celebrate, for else if Rest
should respect barely their cessation, then all the after
time should be of equall estimation with the last day in
respect of the Creation, and with the first day in respect
of the Redemption.</p>
               <p>And now indeed I wonder why the Egyptian delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

our deliverance out of spirituall Egypt in its Type,
as the reason of it, concludeth upon it mandatorily a duty
(not a libertie) imposed upon us therefore, in these
words, <hi>Therefore</hi> the Lord thy God commanded thee to
keepe the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day. A place of Scripture if soberly
consulted (especially considering withall the preterition
of the Creation in that place, whereby this becomes not

by our <hi>Antisabbatarians.</hi> For as one saith well, In the 5.
<hi>Deut.</hi> The reason of the Redemption from Egypt is put
as a cause of sanctifying the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> so that there begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
a translation, though not of the day it self, yet of the
use and sanctification of the day, as to be kept in an holy
and thankfull memory of the Redemption from Egypt,
which was but a Type and figure of our spirituall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
by Christ: which their Redemption from
Egypt, if taken only literally, was not to be compared to
the worke of Creation, that it should challenge to it selfe
a right in the <hi>Sabbath</hi> before the Creation, but only as it
typified and prefigured that glorious worke of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now if the Redemption from Egypt, which was
but a Type, were so glorious a worke, as that the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
day should be kept rather in memory of that, then of the
Creation, then what shall we say of the worke of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
it selfe, which doth so farre exceed in glory
that from Egypt, as the Sunne doth the shadow? If
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55806:112"/>
therefore Gods ancient people were to keep the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
day in memory of their Rest from Egypt, how much
more (when a greater Rest from a greater worke of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
even the true and eternall Rest is come in, and
we in Christ doe enter into it as <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 3.) ought that
day of the weeke be kept holy, wherein the Lord rested
from his most glorious and gracious worke. And this
may serve to answer your unanswerable conclusion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,

that fight so much against it, it is like never felt the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of it (as for your self, I will passe no censure of you,
for I know you not) but some I am able to produce, that
are of this licentious opinion concerning the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and
are as little strict in other things which are uncontrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably
naught, to the scandall of the Ministery, and to the
palpable arguing, that because they entertaine not the
truth in the love of it, God hath either given them over to
beleeve a lie, or else that they take up this opinion more to
countenance their corruptions, then to maintaine Truth.
For non-residency, a formall and lazy ministery, and such
like follow as naturally upon this, as falling away doth
upon free-will. Your manner of instancing is naught thus
to goe about to lessen the Commandement it self, and our
obedience to it, by a sleightie expression of the things
commanded. Had <hi>Adam</hi> thus excused himself to God,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55806:113"/>
when he accused him of rebellion, and told him, why, it
was but a mouth-full of an apple, &amp;c. the aggravation
had been worse then the fault, a few sticks, a little oyle,
&amp;c. is it the fewnesse of the sticks, the littlenesse of the
oyle; that give <hi>ens</hi> and <hi>non-ens</hi> to the Sin? He that hath
his eyes anoynted, though but with a little of Gods eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salve,
knoweth that the thing commanded is to be judged
by the commandement, and not the commandement by
the thing commanded.</p>
               <p>Me thinks that <hi>Memento</hi> or watchword set at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Commandement (and so usefully expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by M. <hi>Dod</hi> and M. <hi>Cleaver</hi>) to quicken our circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in providing for the sanctifying of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> by
prevention and foresight, should have answered this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
in the hatching, especially in these petty things
you speake of, considering that the lesse the temptation
the greater the sin.</p>
               <p>But to your instances themselves I answer. That in all
things whatsoever a lawfull necessity granteth a lawfull
liberty on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as for gathering of Mannah I have
formerly shewed you, why it did bind and for what time.
And therefore, instead of further answer, I will insert for
a conclusion, the positive truth of such workes as may be
done on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, as you shall find it in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Richard
Byfeild, pag.</hi> 95, 96. There are (saith he) foure sorts of
works lawfull on the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> 1. Works of holinesse.
2. Works of mercy. 3. Works that are in their nature ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,
yet doe directly respect the present worship of God,
as our travell to the places of Gods worship, for these
works become now holy workes, and are not ours but
Gods workes. 4. Works of common honesty, that is,
works that make to the comely decent and orderly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of Gods worship, and our carriage and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
therein. Such are the tolling of a bell for the calling of
the assembly, the comely and modest dresse of the body
provided that it be not vaine, curious, nor aske much time,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55806:114"/>
but be thrust into the narrowest roome that may be: The
spreading of our table, so that state be not taken up, and all
things be prepared before, as much as may, with the like.
By works of mercy, I meane not onely necessary labours
in the help of the sicke, and of women in travell, and of
beasts out of a pit with the like: But also all those which
are called works of necessity, which I rather call workes
of mercy, because they are therefore necessary, as they
tend to the preservation of things, not from feared or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
but from eminent and imminent and present
danger, and the worke it selfe must be done in mercy, not
in covetousnesse or other respects. Now of this sort are
these workes, labour in provision of convenient food, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of cattell, fight for defence of our countrey being
assailed, riding of posts on the affaires of the state in causes
of present and imminent danger. In all these the Master
hath power to command, and so hath the superiour ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
him that is under his charge, and the servant is bound to
obey. The Master may command him the workes of
mercy, and the works servile, which directly looke to the
worship of God, or to goe with him to the Sermon,
though many miles off (if it cannot be had neerer hand)
and as his Master may take his horse and ride thither, his
servant going on foot, so may he command his servant for
this purpose to saddle his horse, as in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 22, 23. the
question of the <hi>Shunamites</hi> husband sheweth, who to his
wife desiring one of the Asses to be made ready, and a
servant to be sent her that she might goe to the man of
God, saith on this wise, wherefore wilt thou goe to him
to day? It is neither <hi>new Moone</hi> nor <hi>Sabbath.</hi> It was
then their custome so to doe on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>new
Moone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner the Master may enjoyne the servant
such works as tend to necessary provision of food, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of children in the family, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yet here againe some things seeme to fight with the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55806:114"/>
sanctification of the day. First, if the Master shall strictly
stand upon his state and distance, for if the family-neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
in respect of young children should necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the presence of some constantly at home, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
may not hereby keep his servant constantly from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
worship, but rather sometimes change turnes with
him. Much lesse may he desire such unnecessary superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as may cause absence from the Assemblies, for this is
to feed the carkasse on the life-blood of the soules of thy
servants. Deale in all plainnesse of heart, and know that
thou hast to deale with God. The servant must be sure the
worke is unlawfull before he offer to withdraw his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
but thou mayest sin in that in which thy servant
sinneth not, because thou art bound to search more into
the nature of thy necessities. Secondly, if the Master set
not his businesse in so wise and discreet an order, that
without all unnecessary hinderances, he and all his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
may sanctifie the day and keep it holy. Thirdly, if the
Master remember not that he is a God, and that both by
communication of name and power, to provide for, and
see to the servants and his housholds rest, and therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the mercy which God would have shewne to his
servants, yea to cattle on that day.</p>

Church<note n="*" place="margin">Homily of the place and time of prayer, <hi>part. 1. pag.</hi> 125.</note> By this Commandement (speaking of the
fourth) we ought to have a time, as one day in the weeke
wherein we ought to rest, yea from all lawfull and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
works: For like as it appeareth by this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that no man in the six dayes ought to be slothfull or
idle, but diligently to labour in that estate wherein God
hath set him, even so God hath given expresse charge to
all men that upon the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> which is now our
<hi>Sunday,</hi> they should cease from all weekly and work-day
labour, to the intent that like as God himselfe wrought six
dayes and rested the seventh, and blessed and sanctified
it, and consecrated it to quietnesse and rest from labour:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55806:117"/>
Even so Gods obedient children should use the <hi>Sunday</hi>
holily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rest from their common and daily businesses,
and also give themselves wholly to heavenly exercises of
Gods true Religion and service. So that God doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
command the observation of this Holy-day, but also by
his owne example doth stirre and provoke us to the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
keeping of the same Good naturall children will not
onely become obedient to the Commandements of their
parents, but also have a diligent eye to their doings, and
gladly follow the same. So if we will be the children of
our heavenily Father, we must be carefull to keep the
Christian <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> which is the <hi>Sunday,</hi> not onely for
that it is Gods expresse Commandement, but also to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

               <p>Happily this is true which you say, concerning the
Church of the Gentiles also, That for a long time they
used no such <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but assembled as they could conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently;
But what doth this argue, against the Lords-day
being the <hi>Sabbath?</hi> no more then that of the Iews afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.
For we are not to judge of the Church of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
in their worst, but in their better estate. This new
Creation had at first its <hi>Chaos,</hi> as well as the old, without
forme, till things were perfected by degrees, now a little
and then a little: It was no little while before they were
perswaded that fornication was a deadly sinne.</p>
               <p>The Lords-day received its Institution at the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of this new Creation, as the <hi>Sabbath</hi> did at the
consummation of the old; though perhaps this, by reason
of the Churches non age had its intermission, like as that
had, being also set a foot in its season, as that was.</p>
               <p>But let us not pitch either upon the rudenesse of the
Iews, or the rawnesse of the Gentiles to take example
by, but see the disposing providence, and directing hand
of God in the Apostles them selves in those times, who
were ordered by the speciall instinct of the spirit, and we
shall see that in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> where in the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verse</hi>
it is said, that the same day at night which was the first
day of the weeke, and when the doores was shut, where
the Disciples were assembled for feare of the Iews, came
<hi>Iesus &amp;c.</hi> and so again in the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verse:</hi> it is said, <hi>That
eight dayes after,</hi> againe the Disciples were within and

Gods speciall hand in assembling them on the day of

                  <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but it is reckoned in the Text as the rest, (<hi>eight

first day of the weeke, which you say we neither finde
where, nor by whom it began. I have even now shewed

on the day of Christs resurrection by the Apostles, and the
day fennight after. Had they only met the day of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urrection,
we might have thought it had been only acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall,
and not of speciall providence; or if it had been
recorded, that they had met any other day besides, it
might somewhat have weakened the force of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But meeting twice, and it being recorded to be
on the same day (together with the effects thereof) it
doth wonderfully prove the thing to be of purposed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
both on Gods part in assembling them then, and
on Christs part in appearing to them, thereby to give ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
to this Ordinance, which accordingly hath been so
observed ever since. And therefore it is not likely that
the Apostles tooke it up by approbation from inferiour
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55806:121"/>
Christians (nor yet that Christ honoured it only by way
of approbation but also of institution, for we see what
honour he gave to it a <hi>principio,</hi> by his often appearings
thereon, and the gift of the <hi>Holy Ghost, Iohn</hi> 20. 22. on
this day, which you so <hi>Sophister</hi> like passe over, and only
instance in that which seemeth to serve your turne) but
that it was taken up from them.</p>
               <p>Though this confessed approbation of Christs, granteth
it to be of the same authoritie with Baptisme, which was
brought in by <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> and ratified by Christ. And if
the people of the Iews held the Baptisme of <hi>Iohn</hi> to be
from heaven and not of men, though they had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
command for it but only his practice (and though
the chiefe Priests and Elders beleeved him not) only for
this reason, because they held <hi>Iohn</hi> as a Prophet, <hi>Matth.</hi>
21. 25, 26. and this their beliefe of <hi>Iohn</hi> and his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
producing sutable fruits of grace and holinesse in
them, was approved of Christ, <hi>vers.</hi> 32. I wonder how
any dare deny the <hi>Lords-day</hi> to be of divine institution,
and affirme it humane, that know and acknowledge <hi>Paul</hi>
to be an Apostle (the least whereof was greater then
<hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>) and the thing of such great consequence
and benefit to the Church, and otherwayes so backed:
But let us labour to imitate these contemned Publicanes
and harlots in beleeving this point of the <hi>Lords-day</hi> to be

the Lords-day is in some sort <hi>de iure divino,</hi> in
some sort, namely not by personall but by delegate autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that is, not prescribed personally and immediatly by
God himselfe, but onely by vertue of that authority
which by God was committed to the Apostles, for the
ordering and governing of his Church, but being taken
for divine Ordinance or Commandement it is not <hi>de iure
divine.</hi> And further he saith, To entitle a Commandement
divine is required. 1. That the authority be divine wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is ordained. 2. That the Author himselfe that ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
be so also, that is, that both the power whereby, and
the person that doth immediatly establish it, be divine.
Which divine authority is confessed to be in the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
constitutions, but the immediate Authors are deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be divine.</p>
               <p>Now as all other events and actions receive their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
from their immediate not remote causes: so
the constitutions of the Apostles, although they proceed
originally from the instinct and aspiration of the Holy
Ghost, Gods spirit yet proceeding immediatly from the
institutions of the Apostles themselves, which delivered
them unto the Church in forme of Commandements,
they are to be tearmed humane constitutions, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
divine. Thus you have M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Breerewoods</hi> opinion of
the divine authority of the Lords-day, much more Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
then yours, only in answer to this later part, where he
saith that Apostolicall actions are to be tearmed humane,
from that principle, That all actions are to receive their
denominations from their immediate not remote causes.
He might have considered how that all the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is called the word of God from the remote Cause
the Spirit of God, which inspired it, though the Apostles
and Evangelists writ it (which were men) and that by no
expresse Commandement that we finde.</p>
               <p>Bishop <hi>White</hi> averreth against <hi>T. B. pag.</hi> 91. That our
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55806:122"/>
weekly observation of the Lords-day in the time of the
Gospell is an holy and godly practise, for it is warranted
by the example of the Apostles, and those Primitive
Churches which were planted by the Apostles, and
which received their Ecclesiasticall precepts and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
by tradition from the Apostles, so that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
first founded it, as he further affirmes, <hi>pag.</hi> 97. saith he,
It is an ignorant speech to tearme it a popish tradition,
for popish traditions had not their beginnings from the
Apostles. So also <hi>pag.</hi> 189. We beleeve saith he, that the
holy Apostles ordained the <hi>Sunday</hi> to be a weekly Holy-day,
because the Primitive Fathers, who lived some of
them in the Apostles dayes, and others of them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
after, and who succeedeth them in Apostolicall
Churches did universally maintaine the religious observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this day. So againe, <hi>pag.</hi> 192. It is probable that in
the Churches at <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> the Lords-day was
made a weekly Holy-day by the Apostles (for they princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
governed those Churches at this time) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.
1, 2. (And yet Doctor <hi>Heylyn</hi> laboureth to prove this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galathians</hi> to be upon a <hi>Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
and not upon the <hi>Lords-day.</hi>) And againe, <hi>pag.</hi> 192.
It could not possibly have come to passe that all and every
Apostolicall Church throughout the universall world
should so early, and in the beginning of their plantation,
have consented together to make the <hi>Sunday</hi> a weekly
Service-day, unlesse they had been thus directed by their

               <p>Lastly, it is a true that a long time after Christs Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
was the name of <hi>Lords-day</hi> given to the first

sennight, of Christs Resurrection, and answerably practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
after by <hi>Paul,</hi> is doubtlesse of binding authority, and to
an exemplary use and end: And how-ever it be, that
Christ did or did not, teach them by word of mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death, questionlesse in that thing, at that time, they
were especially taught of God, the instinct and secret gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the Spirit being in stead of a Commandement
to them (though perhaps for present they were ignorant
of their owne practice, as <hi>Mary</hi> was, when she powred
the boxe of oyntment upon Christs head, that she did it
for his burying) and doing the same thing that day sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night;
We have just cause to thinke that Christ had an
hand in it, though it be not expressed in the word, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
appeared to them the day before, and the same effect
ensuing upon the same occasion, to wit, his appearing to
them being met againe.</p>
               <p>And therefore what though the Puritanes (as Bishop
<hi>White</hi> stiles them, from <hi>T. B. pag.</hi> 185.) cannot shew the
Lords-day to be made a <hi>Sabbath</hi> by any written Law (he
meanes no doubt in the new Testament) may not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
spirit of the Apostles suffice us, seeing that himselfe
saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 119. The inspiration of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od is of as great effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and authority as his writing, wherewith the Apostles
doubtlesse were directed in the instituting of an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
perpetuall observation to the Church.</p>
               <p>And whereas (I say) the instinct of the Spirit was as
a Law or Commandement to the Apostles, in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
of instituting the Lords-day upon Christs Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
I would to this purpose commend the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Moses</hi> his instituting the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> upon the fall and
gathering of a double portion of Mannah in 16. <hi>Exod.</hi>
which yet we doe not finde in termes to be taught him
of God then, when that Law of Mannah was commanded,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55806:125"/>
                  <hi>ver. 5. Fulke</hi> upon the 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> is peremptory and saith,
That for the prescription of the Lords-day before any
other of the seven, they had without doubt either the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
Commandement of Christ before his ascension
when he gave them precepts concerning the kingdome
of God, and the ordering and government of his Church,
<hi>Acts</hi> 1. 2. or else the certaine direction of his Spirit, that
it was his will and pleasure it should be so, and that also
according to the Scriptures, seeing that there is the same
reason of sanctifying that day in which our Saviour
Christ accomplished out Redemption, and the restitution
of the world by his Resurrection from death, that was of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anctifying the day, in which the Lord rested from the
Creation of the world. Nor can it be denyed (I thinke) but
that the Apostles had many things taught them privately
by Christ, which afterwards upon occasion they publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
some by precept, and some by example<note n="*" place="margin">Matt 10. 27.</note>. And wee
may be the rather induced that <hi>Paul</hi> had received it from
Christ, if so be we consider how ingenuous he is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
what he had not received in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 25.
As concerning virgins (saith he) I have no Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord, but I give you mine advice. And
<hi>Zanchy</hi> observes that he taught them not so much by
words, as by the efficacy of the Spirit, which being
their unerrable guide in all things concerning the
Church, we may well allow to be ours in this matter of
the Lords-day by vertue of their exemplary Ordinance.
Their practice and example, I doubt not you will say, had
been enough without precept (and I remember none
they have in any expresse tearmes from Christ) for the
ordaining Pastors and Ministers, nor doe I think you will
deny them to be <hi>iure divino.</hi> But granting this is not
commanded by Christ, yet are you no gainer by it. For I
doe the rather thinke that because no expresse mention is
made of it in the new Testament by way of Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it should seeme the rather to be the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Thus

any such Commandement in holy writ, as for instance in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55806:126"/>
the sacrificing that was before the Law, where finde you
any Commandement to sacrifice, before you finde <hi>Abel</hi>
sacrificing? And yet (I beleeve) you doubt not but there
was a command or something equivalent. Neither can
you other-wayes thinke, but when <hi>Noah</hi> at his going into
the Arke, tooke with him beasts both cleane and unclean,
he was instructed from heaven, which was which, though
no such instruction appeare.</p>
               <p>Againe did not Christ, in the instituting of the new
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> imitate his father in his manner of instituting
the old in the old Creation: For what Commandement
did God give at first? Was it any other then a declaration
of his owne practice to <hi>Adam,</hi> whom he had then extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily
made, that he by his practice should teach it to
his posterity? So doth not Christ the like? For because
he rested by rising on the first day of the weeke from the
worke of our Redemption and re-creation, therefore
did he blesse and hallow it, by his example to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
whom he had extraordinarily called (that they by
their example should doe the like to others) with those
many manifestations of himselfe, and admirable blessings,
which he then bestowed on them. Which practice of
Christ doth wonderfully make good both the Morality of
the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and justifieth the alteration of it also to the
first day of the weeke. For whereas God at the first bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it, that is, appointed it to be a day wherein he would
especially confer spirituall blessings. We see Christ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
doth still on this day blesse and enlighten his
Apostles, by appearing to them being together glorifying
God.</p>
               <p>Now if you will say that <hi>Adams</hi> posterity (whom in
your first Chapter you say, it is probable, had they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Innocency, should alwayes have followed Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

Christ and his Apostles should be so silent herein, as never

nor to reprove any for the prophaning of either of them.
We see how often <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets called upon

their calling was from heaven. And though divers others

besides these have had the Spirit of Prophecy bestowed
on them, that yet nothing detracts from Gods sealing the
ordination of this Councell or <hi>Sanedrin</hi> by the Seventies
prophecying. So though Christ appeared to his Disciples
on other dayes, besides the first day of the weeke, yet it
detracteth not from his instituting and authorizing that
day by his remarkable apparitions and operations thereon,

               <p>Againe at the instituting of the Leviticall priesthood

how extraordinarily the Spirit came down in likenesse of

the Time as well as the things themselves, As, That
Christ appeared to them on the first day of the weeke, and
the first day of the weeke they had the gifts of the Holy
Ghost given them, and on the <hi>Lords day</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was
ravished in the Spirit (not any other day in the weeke ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the honour to be denominated the day of his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in all the New Testament, though no doubt he did
appeare to them on other dayes of the weeke, besides
the first, in those other times of his appearances) And why
is all this? But to give the better authority and estimate
to that day: Which we may the rather judge, because that
since then God hath shewne extraordinary judgements
upon the breakers and prophaners of it, which being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

them to the Martyr-booke, Practice of Piety, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard

<hi>Galathians,</hi> till <hi>Paul</hi> (a man of spirit) put them in minde,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. And observe it as a maine argument in this way
of experience, That at the first beginning of mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,
when God enlighteneth and convinceth the

on, is the mispending the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the first duty

is commonly the better sanctifying and keeping the
<hi>Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as touching the baptizing of Infants, there is
neither an expresse precept for it, nor yet an example of
expresse practise delivered in Scripture; and yet the
grounds, causes and reasons of the necessity of that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and the benefit or good that followeth on it, are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
contained in the Scripture, and for this respect it is
named a tradition: But yet the grounds of it being in
Scripture (as <hi>Feild</hi> in the fore-quoted place observes) it is
not therefore a bare tradition, but is therefore of Divine
authority, and unalterable in the Church of God. The
same in all respects holdeth good concerning the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
and with some advantage, for that there is the expresse
practice of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in this point mentioned in
the Scripture, which is not so in the baptizing of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
And this is apparant, that those things which had
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55806:131"/>
their grounds and reasons in Scripture, the Apostles were
not curious or exact in commanding them expressely, nor
intreating of them largely, except they were then contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and scrupled at, which (it seemeth) the <hi>Lords-day</hi>
was not, but was currantly received and practised among
the Gentile converts (the Infant Iewes being born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all)
for on that day they ordinarily were wont to celebrate
both the death and resurrection of Christ, the one by the
Sacrament, and the other by the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as appeareth,
<hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. And therefore Saint Paul when he speaketh of
it, still mentioneth it as a thing granted and not doubted
of, although the Ceremoniall or Iewish temporary <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi>
as like wise the Ceremoniall meats were, which
maketh the Apostle so often and so largely handle that
point.</p>

               <p>Had this record of the Apostles being assembled and
Christ appearing at this time been alone recorded, there
might have been some probable conjecture that it might
be but accidentan (although the Text is very exact and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive
concerning the time: for having in the first verse
of the 20. <hi>Iohn,</hi> spoken of the first day of the weeke, the
19. verse reduplicateth that with a significant explanation
(as if the Evangelist would be loth to be mistaken in that
point of Time) saying, The same day then at night
which was the first day of the weeke, &amp;c.) But being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
with the like afterwards, it argueth it to be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by God of a purposed providence, especially if we
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55806:132"/>
take along the event and succeeding practice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Church ever after, which to all sober minds put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it past doubt. And as touching that you say their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
was for feare of the Iewes, happily the privacy of it
was so, but why they should feare the Iewes more on
that day, then on any other I see no reason, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can it be no reason of their then assembling.</p>
               <p>And now concerning Christs appearing to them at the
Evening of the same day, it is so farre from lessening the
authority of this institution, as that, being compared with
Gods institution of the first <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which according to
your own confession was about the end thereof, it giveth
much force thereto.</p>
               <p>And although I meane to be briefe in what followeth,

thereof was actually and immediately prescribed by the
Church, deale ingenuously and shew me where, if in
Scripture then I answer, that it was not immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed

of the institution, but ministers of Christ and pen-men

they all referre us to the Apostles and the Scriptures. This
opinion therefore is so farre from certaine, that it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
false. You say againe, That certainly Christ never
gave his Apostles particular charge of instituting a new
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> either while he conversed with them on earth;
or afterwards by Revelation. How know you this? The
Apostles delivered many things that the <hi>Evangelists</hi> did
not set downe, not themselves expressely say, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them from the Lords mouth, That they concealed
Christs command from the Church, that is, this particular
expression in so many words, that Christ, commanded it,
this maketh to prove that it was given them in charge by
Christ, for else when the Apostles enjoyned it, they would

man truly feareth God (as I hope gentle Reader thou
doest) enough may soone be said to make him spend the
<hi>Lords-day</hi> in the holy exercises of Religion, as, 1. Though
in this time of the Gospell God would not have any part
of his worship consist in the observation of times or
places, neither did Christ or his Apostles command us
Christians to any day whatsoever, yet this generall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
we have.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</note> Let all things be done to edifying
decently and in order, yea and Nature teacheth that there
should be Times and Places set apart for publike mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
as we see the Gentiles had by the very light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
2. This order to assemble on the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> had his
beginning in the time of the Apostles, and was approved
by them, neither is there the least doubt to be made, but
that were Saint <hi>Paul</hi> now alive, he would approve of it
in like manner, onely he would be much more earnest
then I have been, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cleere weeded out of mens minds. After the Apostles
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55806:139"/>
time the succeeding churches observed the same order as
partly appeareth by these sayings of <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> and
others before alleadged, and thus it hath continued ever
since, and no doubt shall so continue to the second coming
of Christ. Some of late have made it a question whether
the Church may change the <hi>Lords-day</hi> into any other day
of the weeke, but in my judgement they might well
have spared their pains therein, for what can be imagined
wherefore any Church should attempt such a matter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be to withdraw some from a superstitious conceit
they have of the day? Let this errour be reformed, and
there is no feare of a change.</p>

That as the order of the last day in the weeke was

Besides the Church hath no liberty to alter any day, the

benefit of the Creation) still remaineth to be remembred.
But it is strange that the Church should either assume
this liberty, or that we should give it to the Church.
1. Seeing the fourth Commandement doth dictate to us,
both the proportion of time which we are to celebrate to
God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the reason of that celebration, the Time is the
seventh day, the reason is Gods resting from or consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
his greatest and beneficiallest worke, which

day, nothing dissenting from the Commandement nor
destroying it, but fulfilling and establishing it upon better
tearmes. 2. Seeing God commandeth to labour six dayes

               <p>2. God sanctified the seventh day, because therein he
had rested and was refreshed, <hi>Gen. 2. Exod.</hi> 31. not because
he had instructed <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> therein, or that they had
called on his holy name.</p>

               <p>5. Were the <hi>Sabbath</hi> sanctified by praying, hearing the

sanctifying the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> then he did praying, preaching,

               <p>6. The <hi>Sabbath</hi> was prophaned onely by working, as

is shewed before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. Wherefore it was sanctified
only by abstaining from worke.</p>
               <p>7. Suppose that <hi>Adam</hi> had continued in the state of

now, how <hi>Adam</hi> sanctified his appointed times, by
preaching, hearing of the word, &amp;c. or not.</p>
               <p>If not, why then did the Israelites? If yea, then why had
he not as well sanctified his appointed places, by the same
holy Duties? I dare affirme that when any goeth on the

he sanctifie the <hi>Sunday,</hi> that thereby he sanctifieth the
Church also. This I will maintaine, though (as I said) I will
not contend about the question, for we have nothing to

whether by being not imployed about prophane uses, or
rather in a relative sense, by being imployed about holy?
Sure you will say, by being imployed in Gods service
about holy uses. So the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was not properly sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by resting from prophane, but by being imployed in
holy businesses. For God hath appointed it to be a day of
blessing, now sure it is not our Resting, but our imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in holy services, and use of the meanes that makes
it so. And so had God appointed it to be to <hi>Adam</hi> in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
for no doubt but <hi>Adam</hi> being enjoyned labour,
which necessarily took him off from immediate contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
his spirituall life should have been upheld by due

               <p>Now as for that, which you urge so strongly, of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Places as well as the Time, I answer, That what
Places God hath ever specially and solemnly appointed
for his speciall and solemne worship, they have been as
well sanctified by that worship as the Time so appointed,
and so was the Temple in Ierusalem. For as it is the use,
unto which Christ hath appointed the bread and wine, in
the Lords Supper, that sanctifieth the bread and wine, so
was it the use unto which God appointed the Temple
that sanctified it. God appointeth one time universally for
all people, not so of Place: Because an appointed Time
may be Catholicke (as is the Church) which an appointed
place cannot. For first it would be of infinite inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for the Catholicke Church to repaire to one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Place, as all Israel did to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and secondly it
would contradict the nature of the Church, and make
that particular which is Catholicke. But I will conclude
