            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>IT is a dead Vacation; yet we see</l>
               <l>(Which glads our souls) a wel-set Company</l>
               <l>Adorn our Benches: We did scarce expect</l>
               <l>So full an Audience in this long neglect</l>
               <l>Of Court and Citie Gentry, that transfer</l>
               <l>In Terme their Visits to our Theater.</l>
               <l>The Countrey Gentlemen come but to Town</l>
               <l>For their own bus'nesse sake, to carry down</l>
               <l>A sad <hi>Sub-poena,</hi> or a fearfull Writ</l>
               <l>For their poor Neighbour, not for love of Wit.</l>
               <l>Their comely Madams too come up to see</l>
               <l>New Fashions, or to buy some Raritie</l>
               <l>For their young Son and Heir, and only stay</l>
               <l>Till by their Sheepshearing they'r call'd away.</l>
               <l>The Courtiers too are absent, who had wont</l>
               <l>To buy your Wares on trust, they'r gone to hunt</l>

               <l>Your Wives trim Churching with a Red-Deer Pie.</l>
               <l>Few Gentlemen are now in Town, but those</l>
               <l>Who in your Books remain uncross'd for Clothes,</l>
               <l>Who, when you aske them money, are so slack</l>

You are our daily and most constant Guests,</l>
               <l>Whom neither Countrey bus'nesse nor the Gests</l>
               <l>Can ravish from the Citie; 'tis your care</l>

               <l>As some <hi>Numidian</hi> Lyon from his Den,</l>
               <l>(Half-starv'd with hunger) to his prey, three men</l>

               <l>The Heavens for pitie; on the Villains went</l>
               <l>Towards the Oak with a most damn'd intent</l>
               <l>To ravish her; the Trees that by her stood</l>
               <l>Began lament; the light Nymphs of the Wood</l>
               <l>Implor'd the chast <hi>Diana</hi> to defend</l>
               <l>Her wretched Votresse; and the Birds did tend</l>

               </l>
               <l>In mourning accents fram'd her voice to tell</l>
               <l>The Vengeance due to Ravishers: the Fite</l>
               <l>That burn'd their entrails, blown by soul desire,</l>

Made their eyes sparkle, yeelding horid sight</l>
               <l>Unto their fact, whose blacknesse did affright</l>
               <l>The blushing Sun, who bid his golden head</l>
               <l>And seem'd to suffer an Eclipse through dread</l>
               <l>Of that dark deed; and now they did begin</l>
               <l>With sacrilegious hands to touch that skin,</l>
               <l>Which soft as <hi>Lydian</hi> Silk, did even intice</l>
               <l>Love there to build his choicest Paradice.</l>

               <l>Ran to her succour; as a Bear, whose young</l>

               <l>The disappointed Letchers; and with cries</l>
               <l>Whose hideous sound lent thunder to the skies,</l>
               <l>They rush'd upon the Shepheards, who prepar'd</l>
               <l>For all incounters, stood upon their guard,</l>
               <l>And with their hooks, which sometimes us'd to catch</l>
               <l>The tender Lambs and bleating Ewes, they watch</l>

               <l>That trickled from them, dim'd their sights, yet stood</l>
               <l>The fight in equall ballance; now the Swaines,</l>
               <l>And then the Wood-men had the odds; their paines</l>
               <l>Seem'd not to make 'em wearie; these did fight</l>
               <l>Spur'd on by lust, and these in justice right.</l>
               <l>Now 'gan they grapple, and with all their force</l>
               <l>Striv'd to oerthrow each other; no remorse</l>
               <l>Of their own harms, could move their angrie minds</l>
