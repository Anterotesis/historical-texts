         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Things unequally indifferent are such, as though they be neither universally good, not absolutely evill, yet even barely considered, sway more, or lesse rather the one way, then the other: And that either unto good, or unto evill. Of the former sort are such outward actions, as being in morall precepts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> commanded, are yet sometimes sinfully and ill done: as, giving an almes, hearing a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, repreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an offender; and the like, which are in themselves good, and so to be accounted, rather then evill; though some unhappy Circumstance or other may make them ill. Of the latter sort are such outward


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115026:14"/>
actions, as being in morall precepts indefinitely prohibited, are yet in some cases lawfull, and may be well done: as, swearing an oath, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling on the Sabbath day, playing for money, and the like: which are in themselves rather evill, then good, because they are ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, unlesse all circumstances concurre to make them good. Now of these actions, though the former sort carry the face of good, the latter of evill; yet in very truth both sorts are indifferent. Understand me aright: I do not meane indifferent, <hi>indifferentiâ contradictionis,</hi> such as may be indifferently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> done, or not done; but indifferent onely <hi>indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ contrarietatis,</hi> such as (suppose the doing) may be indifferently either good, or evill: because so they may be done, as to be good, and so they may be done also, as to be evill; but yet with this difference, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> former, though indifferent, and in some cases evill, are yet of themselves notably and eminently inclined unto good rather then evill; and these latter proportionably unto evill, rather then good.</q>
                  <p>For <hi>answere:</hi> The first sort of actions, such as being in morall precepts indefinitely commanded, are yet sometimes sinfully and ill done, (as, giving an almes, hearing a sermon, reproving an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, and the like,) are not in the language of the Schoolmen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different actions: This I shall make good by an argument out of <hi>Suarez</hi> (brought by him unto another purpose;) He disputing against some, that held all humane actions to be indifferent, proves the contrary; First in <hi>inward,</hi> then in <hi>outward actions;</hi> and his argument <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> outward actions stands thus. If ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall acts be considered according to an objective goodnesse, or illnesse, this cannot be true, because there are many actions in their own nature objectively evill, and prohibited, and there are other also objectively good, and honest; because this goodnesse, and illnesse is not taken by extrinsick Denomination, from the inward act, but from it's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> call agreement with, or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy unto right reason. Those actions which have a <hi>materiall, and objective</hi> goodnesse, are not indifferent actions in the language of the Schooles. But the actions, that the Doctor speaks of, have an objective, and materiall goodnesse, because they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and therefore they are not indifferent. But, saith the Doctor, they are indifferent at least <hi>indifferentiâ Contrarietatis,</hi> 
                     <q>such as (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the doing) may be indifferently either good or evill: because so they may be done, as to be good, and so they may be done also, as to be evill.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115026:14"/>
For <hi>answer:</hi> By this account all outward ordinances of God, all externall acts of worship, and indeed all outward good works whatsoever should be actions indifferent, because they may be done well, or ill: But to say that all these are indifferent would be very strange language: for although they may have evill cast upon them externally by the agent, yet this is no hinderance but that they may be in themselves <hi>objectively</hi> and <hi>materially good,</hi> as being matter of precept.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps there may be some mystery in this clause, <hi>indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely commanded:</hi> They are commanded, but not to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med alwaies, but only <hi>loco, &amp; tempore debitis;</hi> according to the known rule, <hi>Affirmativa praecepta obligant semper, non ad sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>answer:</hi> This will nothing alter the case; for hereby it will follow, that the matter of all affirmative precepts should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different; And whosoever shall say so takes indifferency in a different notion from the usuall acception thereof by both Papists, and Protestants; who jointly make it to be a middle thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that morall goodnesse, and badnesse, which is called <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> or <hi>materiall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>second sort</hi> of Actions, I readily confesse that in some sense they may be said to be unequally indifferent, inclining and swaying more to evill, then to good. To cleare which I shall distinguish of a <hi>twofold consideration</hi> of such actions: They may be considered <hi>meerly in regard of their object,</hi> or else also in regard of the <hi>circumstances, which usually are annexed with them:</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their <hi>object</hi> they are equally indifferent; But yet in regard of <hi>Circumstances</hi> may be said to be more notably and eminently inclined unto evill then unto good; because the circumstances, which generally, and commonly are connexed with them, are evill.</p>
                  <p>But as for the reason, which the Doctor bringeth to prove them to be unequally indifferent, rather evill, then good, is to me very unsatisfying. His words are, <hi>which are in themselves rather evill, then good, because they are over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that <hi>Durand,</hi> a Popish Schoolman, held it to be unlawfull, not by the law of nature, but only by the positive law of God: <hi>Quod autem dicunt quidam, quod simplex fornicatio est peccatum mortale de se, exclusâ omni lege positivâ, divinâ &amp; humanâ, non benè intelligo, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>dist.</hi> 33. <hi>quaest.</hi> 2.

                     </hi> approve of the Idolatrous worship and service of them; But now the Apostle alloweth a private use of things offered to idols, If they were not eaten under a religious notion, but considered onely and <hi>materially</hi> as meat, matter of food, and as the good creatures of God. <hi>Two cases</hi> he instanceth in, wherein they might be thus eaten; <hi>First,</hi> they might buy them in the shambles, and eat them in their own houses, <hi>vers.</hi> 25. And <hi>secondly,</hi> they might eat them at the tables of their unbelieving neighbours, that invited them: This latter part of the Determination of the question he confirmes, and limiteth, by putting in an exception in the case of scandall: And unto all this he prefixeth the extension of our Christian liberty, unto all indifferent things in the generall, together with two restrictions, that we are to put upon it in <hi>the use</hi> and exercise: Even indifferent things are to be forborne, <hi>when</hi> they are not profitable, and conducing unto the ends, which a<note place="margin">Ubi nota, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctenus egit Paulus de ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lothytis, qua talibus, sicque veruit ea come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere.

                  <p>The <hi>Protestants</hi> generally thus argue: The nature of things indifferent (as the <hi>Learned Hooker</hi> determineth) is neither to be commanded nor forbidden, but left free and arbitrary: But now there are divers humane and voluntary actions, that are in the generall neither commanded, nor forbidden (as to eat, drink, goe a journey, walke into the field:) Therefore there are diverse hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and voluntary actions, that are in the generall, and for the kind indifferent. This argument the Papists dislike because they think, that there are <hi>matters of Counsell,</hi> which containe the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree of morall goodnesse, and perfection: And yet thinke they are uncommanded, and no man will say that they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. The Argument of the Schoolmen therefore generally runs thus: Actions, that are neither agreeable, nor disagreeable unto right reason are indifferent: But there are divers humane and voluntary actions, that in their generall nature, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration carry, neither conformity, nor repugnancy unto right reason: And therefore there are divers humane and voluntary actions, that are indifferent.

Concerning which there is in the reason of man no more recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or irrectitude and obliquity in the affirmation, then in the negation in it's dictating either the practice, or in its dictating the forbearance thereof.

                  <p n="2">A <hi>second</hi> reason is, Because for the weake to condemne the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different actions of the strong for sinne, of which they cannot prove them guilty, <hi>is a grosse and presumptuous vsurpation of Gods preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, for which we have no Authority: who art thou that judgest another mans servant?</hi> Thou art but a fellow servant at the most: And God only is the master of the family, the Church: and therefore the unlawfulnesse of what is done in it is to be determined by Gods precepts, and not by thy humour, or fancy, thy ungrounded surmises: If God hath permitted a thing, how darest thou interdict it? <hi>To his own master he standeth, or falleth.</hi> The words are to be understood in a law-sense, and their meaning is that God alone acquits or condemnes the actions of his servants, and none else: They are to be tryed by his word and will, and not by thy jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and suspicions. Others expound the words thus: If a man eat and drink temperately with outward prayer and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, who but God can discerne, whether he eat or drink unto the glory of God, or no? It followeth <hi>he shall be holden up:</hi> that is, he shall be justified. This fact of his, his eating of meats forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Leviticall Law, shall be abetted and maintained: <hi>For God is able to make him stand:</hi> though thou load him with censures, God is able to acquit, and cleare him.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From the nature of things indifferent:</hi> and here, the <hi>first argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is Rom. 14. 17. <hi>the kingdome of God is not meate and drinke:</hi> It doth not stand in indifferent things; for they are neither the way to the kingdome of Glory, nor our duty under the kingdome of grace: They are no part of Gods worship, and service, no matter of Religion: the weale and safety of Gods people is in no wise wrapt up in them; nay, many times a rigid pressing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable practice of them is a great disturbance unto the peace, and a great hinderance unto the edification of the Church, the kingdome of Christ.</p>

the soule of a Brother <hi>with sorrow,</hi> is a breach of charity; <hi>If thy Brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably,</hi> Rom. 14. 15. And hence we may reason in a way of comparison <hi>à minori ad majus,</hi> that to wound the soule of a Brother <hi>with sinne,</hi> violates Christian love in a farre higher measure; for the wound of the least sinne is in its own nature mortall; and therefore scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall is not onely of a wounding, but of a killing and destroying nature; it is a soule murder, <hi>Destroy not him with thy meat,</hi> Rom. 14. 15.

                  <p>If the Prelates would have seriously laid to heart that golden saying of <hi>Paul</hi> (1 Cor. 8. 13. <hi>If meate make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh, while the world <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

He thought it unlawfull to do a thing otherwise indifferent, to eat flesh in the care <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

of the flesh for borne by <hi>Paul</hi> unto his health, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his life; then the profit of the controverted ceremonies can be unto the worship and service of God: And besides, the indifferency of eating flesh was a thing cleare, and evident unto all, that were well instructed in the Doctrine of Christian liberty; whereas the indifferency of our ceremonies will at least be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very doubtfull matter, and that by very indifferent men, who shall thoroughly ponder the Arguments of <hi>Didoclave, Parker, Ames</hi> and others against them, which to this day remaine unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. The Prelates will not pretend unto such an ample au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Church of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> had: But though they be farre inferiour unto him in point of Authority, they are not yet so humble, as to imitate him in the condescention of his charity. <hi>Pauls</hi> peremptorie resolve was to forbeare a thing indifferent, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it scandalized. <hi>If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But what a wide difference, nay contrariety was there betwixt this charitable resolution of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the rigid practise of the Prelates. For they were obstinately bent to presse the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, with all severity, without any care, or Conscience of the scandals ensuing: nay their endeavour was daily to adde unto the heape of former ceremonies, though they knew that thereby the scandals would be increased: They spake a language quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of <hi>Paul:</hi> we will enjoyne (say they) the surplice, crosse, kneeling in the sacrament of the Lords supper, while the world standeth, as long as we have any power, and authority in the Church of God, Let who will be offended: This their rigour brings unto my mind a cruel command of <note n="(l)" place="margin">Cum <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> coenaret apud Vedium Pollionem.

                  <p>A <hi>second limitation</hi> of the conclusion is that it is not <hi>to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto every comparative consideration of humane actions and their circumstances:</hi> I know, that not onely actions indifferent, but also those that are commanded become sometime to be sinfull by <hi>comparison;</hi> when they are preferred to better actions. God dislikes those recreations, that otherwise he alloweth, when they justle out duties: nay he abhorreth sacrifice, when it is inconsistent with mercy: but notwithstanding this, when there is an equality, if not of actions themselves, yet of their morall motives as to <hi>hic,</hi> and <hi>nunc</hi> this present time and place, Then curiously to compare and ballance such actions, were needlesse: for in such a case, the prelation of one before the other, would be a thing meerly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary; neither good nor bad: Reading, prayer, meditation are things commanded: but many times that I set apart such an houre for reading principally may be a thing indifferent: that I make choice of one Recreation before another, of bowling before Chesse, draughts, &amp;c. that I choose to walke in the forenoon, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

then in the afternoon, may be of no morall consideration, and so neither good, nor evill, but a matter of indifferency. Looke as an Image carver may have no peculiar reason to make this Image, rather then that; yet if he make any Image at all; either he followeth the rules of his art, and then he makes a good Image; or he swarves from those rules, and then he makes a bad image, and doth not worke like an Artist: So many times it may be to a Christian, a matter meerly indifferent to performe this or that action, he may have no obligation to doe either, or at least to doe one rather then the other, but may be left unto his own mind, and pleasure: but yet he is as a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an obliged to regard such circumstances in all his actions, and therefore whatsoever he doth, he doth it either well, or ill; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he observeth these circumstances, and then his action is good, or he neglects them, and then it is bad.</p>

our duty in this; because it would leave no roome, or place for other duties: Thus for an Artist to be alwaies thinking upon the rules of his Art, would be a disturbance unto his worke: for a traveller to have perpetually in his thoughts, the end of his journey would retard his progresse therein.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>third</hi> place therefore, the reference of all our actions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods glory, that is here exhorted to, is onely <hi>virtuall.</hi> And that an action may virtually be referred unto Gods glory <hi>three things</hi> are required. 1.

                  <p>Now such an action is said to be <hi>virtually</hi> referred unto Gods glory, because it is done in the virtue, and sorce of some prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>actuall, and explicite</hi> proposall of Gods glory as a supreame end: for the virtue, and force of the chiefe, and utmost end abideth in all inferiour ends subordinated unto it; so that he, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds unto himselfe those inferiour ends, may be said to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <hi>implicitly,</hi> and <hi>mediately</hi> Gods glory for his uttermost end. Thus those godly persons who have first actually made Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, the maine ayme of their desires, endeavours, and undertakings, may be said afterwards to referre even their eating, and drinking, their recreations unto Gods glory <hi>virtually,</hi> if they ayme at no dishonest end, though their explicit and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate intendment be onely the refreshment of their bodies, by which they are the better fitted, and prepared for the glorisying of God in both their generall, and particular callings.

Now when once such thoughts as these creepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mens heads, it cannot be imagined, unto what excesses, and failings it exposeth them: Adde unto this: that looke as the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the lawfulnesse, and indifferency of actions occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a surprizall many times with hainous sinnes: so also it proves (<hi>by accident</hi>) an obstacle unto repentance for such sinnes: When the Godly fall into grosse, and acknowledged sinnes, either of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,

For it is very seldome, that, either their consciences, or their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, or their Brethren take notice of them; or if they doe, they are apt presently to hold forth the indifferencie, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of such actions in themselves, as a buckler to ward off all accusations of Conscience, all upbraidings of enemies, all repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, of either ministers, or private friends: Those, that are most lavish of their time, and purses, in gaming, will plead; that they follow none, but lawfull sports: A Gentleman, that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the greatest part of his time in hunting, hawking, and the like exercises, and redeems but an inconsiderable portion of it to do God, and his Countrey service, thinks, that he hath enough to stopp the mouth of all reproofe, to say, that the recreations, which he pursueth are things indifferent: such riotous persons, as wast their pretious houres in joviallity, and goodfellowship, usually make this Apology for themselves: that it is not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to drinke with a friend in a Taverne or alehouse. To awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from this licentiousnesse, and to quicken in us a carefull watchfulnesse over our hearts in the use of things indifferent, I shall, for conclusion of this discourse, propound some exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the severity of Gods judgments against the sinnes of mens indifferencies: <hi>Davids</hi> numbering of the people was a thing not evill <hi>in it selfe;</hi> but his curiosity, pride, and carnall confidence in an arme of flesh made it so; And God was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with this thing, <hi>therefore he smote Israel,</hi> 1 Chron. 21. 7. <hi>with a pestilence, that devoured</hi> 70000.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>ur Apostle directs us, in the verse immediately preceding this Text, concerning <hi>Good;</hi> in this Text concerning <hi>Evill.</hi> Towards <hi>Good</hi> he exacts a <hi>prudent warinesse;</hi> towards <hi>Evill</hi> a <hi>scrupulous fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.</hi> Towards <hi>good,</hi> a prudent warinesse, <hi>Prove all things,</hi> and then, <hi>hold fast that which is good.</hi> Nothing, how colourable soever, is to be received hand over head, before triall and examination by the ballance of the Sanctuary: for, <hi>Vitia virtutes mentiuntur</hi> (saith <hi>Gregory</hi>) vice is maskt under the skin of virtue; falshood, disguised under the face of truth: so that one is often mistaken for the other. The grossest enormities have been glast and coloured over with the name, and face of virtues: the most poisonous heresies have often gained the esteeme and applause of Orthodox Tenents, and therefore as we must stedfastly <hi>retaine</hi> that which is truely true and good; so must we prudently <hi>discerne,</hi> and carefully distinguish between that which is so <hi>indeed, and in truth</hi> and that which is so only in shew, and colour; this we must reject, that keep, and hold fast: <hi>Prove all things, hold fast that which is good.</hi> But he requires now towards evill a farre different carriage: there he looks for a <hi>scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous fearfulnesse.</hi> Though we must not hold fast any thing that hath but the appearance of good, yet we must abstaine from but the appearance of evill.</p>

the Words may be rendred indifferently, either way, both rendring being equally consonant to the truth, and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall.</p>
                     <p>In the words our Apostle meets with a cavill, rise among the Libertines of our, and former times, who when their scandalous courses are charged upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, baffle of all with this plea: that they are not intrinsecally sinfull. Could I (will the prosanest Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine say) once see such and such things proved to be unlawfull: why I would make no more words of the matter, but soone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare them. I, but have they the blush, the appearance of evill? that should be motive enough to shun them.</p>

                     <head>Abstaine from all &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>But are we sure this is the Apostles meaning? are not the words capable of another interpretation? First, some mislike our translation of <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>species,</hi> by appearance, and rather think it should be meant logically, for sort, or kind. That it may be so, <hi>Mat. Flac.

But I would faine know upon what ground they are thus singular against the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent both of Ancient and Moderne Expositors. Setting aside this place the word occurres (as I thinke) in the whole new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament but foure times, In <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 22. and 9. 29. <hi>John</hi> 5. 37. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. And in none of these places is it, can it be taken in a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall notion. If not elsewhere, why here? especially seeing such an acception is not inforced by the scope, coherence, any other circumstance of the Text, or any absurdity otherwise unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.</p>
                     <p>But some dreame of a soule absurdity, that would ensue upon translating <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>species,</hi> appearance. If every appearance of evill should be abstained from, then should good things, the best things be eschewed, for they commonly appeare to be evill unto sense, and carnall reason, that discerne not the things of the spirit of God. How easily may an acute wit set false faces upon them and worke a bad conceite of them into either weake or ill appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions.</p>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppose a coherence of the words with the former, must it needs be that which they obtrude? The words may sit under our interpretation, and yet the Analysis of the Context run smoothly, as thus:</p>
                     <p>The Apostle having at <hi>verse</hi> 19. dehorted from quenching the spirit, next adviseth use of meanes tending to the preservation of its gracious and glorious residence in the soule: which meanes are either <hi>negative</hi> or <hi>positive:</hi> he assignes but one <hi>negative</hi> means, viz: a removall of a maine barre and powerfull obstacle unto the presence of the spirit, contempt of preaching, <hi>Despise not prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> vers. 20. of the positive means, <hi>two</hi> concerne good, <hi>one</hi> evill: the <hi>two</hi> concerning good, are <hi>boni diligens examinatio, constans electio: Prove all things, hold fast that which is good.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> suppose the primary scope and intention of the Apostle be limited unto matters of doctrine: yet because the maine reason, for which they themselves conceive appearances of evill, even in matters of doctrine to be interdicted, is avoidance of scandall, the precept of which is <hi>juris naturalis,</hi> and not only doctrines but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so actions are scandalous: justly therefore unto these, as well as those, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>First,</hi> here my censure of the non-conformists to be wilfull, proud, and Pharisaicall was very rash, and uncharitable: all that I can say in excuse for my selfe is: that when I wrote this, I was a very young man, and conformity vnto the Ceremonies established by Law was then generally embraced, without any of the least contradiction, for ought I knew; nay stoutly and zealously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for by men, whom I admired for the generall report that went of their sanctity, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115026:58"/>
great wonder, that I was prejudiced against them: But, about the beginning of the long Parliament, being awakened with the generall complaint of the Godly against the Ceremonies, I began to thinke a new of the controversy, and out of my former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice intended a full vindication of the discipline, and Ceremonies of the then Church of England: and in order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I read all such books of the non-conformist's as I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure: for I knew well by experience, that a controversy can never be well handled, unlesse all dissenting opinions thereabouts be weighed: but upon perusall of the non-conformists I soone found: that their adversaries most disingeniously misrepresented all that they said: that they refused to joine issue with them in the state of the Question: that they came not up to an orderly grapple with their arguments: and that they seldome regularly replyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the solutions, which were given unto their objections: and this quickly produced an alteration in my judgment, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will do so too in all, that will make such an impartiall search into the matter; as I have done.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> to come unto the examination of that aspersion: that the scandals of the malitious, of Pharisaicall, and willfull spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are not to be regarded, so as to sorbear that, by which they are scandalized.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gregory de Valentia:</hi> though he lay downe the affirmative in the generall, yet afterwards he delivers it to be his opinion: that we are to doe what lyeth in us to prevent the scandals of even Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, so it may be done without any great losse, or notable da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage unto our selves. <hi>Existimo etiam, si quis cum nullo suo, vel pene nullo detrimento posset impedire scandalum proximi Pharisaicum, aliquid faciendo vel omittendo, debere ipsum facere. Nam ut tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus suprà in quaest. de correctione fraternâ, etiam is qui ex malitiâ peccaturus alioqui est, est in aliquali necessitate spirituali, ac proinde ut</hi> (<hi>illic vidimus) debet ex charitate corrigi, vel aliter à peccati scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo impediri, quando id sine detrimento proprio fieri potest.</hi> tom. 3. disp. 3. q. 18. punct. 4.</p>
                     <p>For the better stating of this Question, I shall premise some distinctions of scandall: a scandall <hi>is either active</hi> or <hi>passive.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>An active</hi> scandall is in all such words, or deeds, as culpably oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion the fall of another <hi>into</hi> sin: and this is againe by <hi>Gregory

de Valentia</hi> [tom. 3. disp. 3. q. 18. punct. 1.] rightly <hi>subdivided into that which is</hi> per se, <hi>and into that which is</hi> per accidens.</p>
                     <p>An active scandall <hi>per se</hi> is in such publique acts, as either by the expresse intent of the agent, or from their nature, and in themselves, are <hi>inductive</hi> unto sinne: and they are againe <hi>twofold:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> all publick sinnes, or sinnes committed before another:</p>

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> all such publick actions, as carry a reall and manifest appearance of sin.</p>
                     <p>An active scandall <hi>per accidens</hi> is in such things, as are not in themselves, and in their own nature occasions of sin unto another: and this is, either in an <hi>unseasonable performance of positive duties,</hi> commanded by affirmative precepts, which are not necessary <hi>hic &amp; nunc:</hi> or else by an <hi>unseasonable</hi> use <hi>of our liberty in things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>A Passive scandall</hi> is the fall of another into sinne: and this (by the author but now mentioned) is subdivided into <hi>given,</hi> and <hi>taken.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scandalum datum, a passive scandall given, is</hi> that which ariseth truly from the active scandall of another, as from its <hi>morall cause.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scandalum acceptum, a passive scandall</hi> that is onely <hi>taken,</hi> is that which is onely the fault of the party scandalized, and cannot be imputed to any other, as a morall cause: the words or deeds of another may be an <hi>occasion</hi> of it, but not a <hi>culpable occasion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I desire that these distinctions of scandall may be well heeded: for the want of Consideration of them hath occasioned a great deale of confusion in mens discourses about scandall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> many exclude from active scandall all things that scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize <hi>per accidens:</hi> and then, what will become of those scandals <hi>Paul</hi> speaks against? <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ch. 8. ch. 10.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, most confound a passive scandall with <hi>scandalum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum,</hi> a scandall that is onely taken, and make them to be of an equall extent: whereas a passive scandall may de distributed into both given, and taken: if it be culpably both given, and taken: then it is <hi>scandalum datum:</hi> if it be culpably taken, and not culpably gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then it is <hi>scandalum acceptum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well, these distinctions being thus premised: I suppose it will be agreed upon by all sides: that the question is to be understood: <hi>First</hi> of active scandals, our scandalizing of the wicked: or <hi>Secondly,</hi>

(which comes all to one) of such passive scandals of them, as are given by us, as well as taken by them: Not, <hi>thirdly,</hi> of such passive scandals, as are onely taken by them, not given by us: for from the guilt of these we may wash our hands, so that there is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon us to forbeare those things, by which they are in this manner scandalized.</p>
                     <p>My <hi>Conclusion</hi> shall be: that we are to eschew the active scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, and consequently <hi>scandala passiva data,</hi> of the wicked, and malitious, those that are Pharisaicall and willfull spirits: this is apparent: <hi>First</hi> from <hi>

                        <hi>First, from the distribution of an active scandall,</hi> and perusall of the members thereof: An active scandall (as I shewed but now) is distributed into <hi>scandalum per se,</hi> and <hi>per accidens:</hi> now there is no doubt, but that we are carefully to avoid such things as scandalize the wicked, and malicious <hi>per se,</hi> of themselves, and in their own nature, <hi>publick sins, or such words, and deeds as have a reall appearance of sin:</hi> all the question will be concerning such things as scandalize them onely <hi>per accidens, our duties, and our indifferencies:</hi> and by these they are frequently scandalized, and that out of an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinion concerning their unlawfulnesse: in which regard the resolution will be pertinent unto the matter in hand.</p>

                     <p>But to proceed next to the scandall of the wicked by our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencies:</hi> That we are to forbear things indifferent when they scandalize the wicked, and malitious. <hi>Parker</hi> [in his treatise of <hi>the Crosse part.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 57.] proves by many instances: when <hi>the thing was indifferent, doth not our Saviour foregoe his liberty, to please the malicious? as when he paid tribute lest he should offend them? Matth.</hi> 17. 27. They <hi>were malicious at Corinth, and seekers of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion against</hi> Paul, <hi>that were likely to be offended by his taking of wages there: yet the thing, being no necessary duty, he thinketh it his duty to forbeare his power therein,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. The <hi>Heathens are malicious to take offence, when Christians go to Law for their own: yet, because going to law is not a duty necessary, it must be forborne, and Christians rather must loose their own, then give occasion of scandall to them,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. v. 6, 7. Unto these examples let me adde another (quoted by the same authour elsewhere) out of <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 22. <hi>I was ashamed</hi> (saith <hi>Ezra) to require of the King a band of Souldiers and horsemen, to help us against the enemies in the way: because we had spoken unto the King, saying, the hand of our God is upon all them for good, that seeke him, but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him</hi> Here for <hi>Ezra</hi> to have asked of the King of Persia, a Heathen, a band of souldiers, and horsemen for his safe conduct, was a thing lawfull: and yet he forbore it, lest he should scandalize him by begetting in him a suspicion, that that was false, which he had told him concerning Gods power, and justice.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>second</hi> argument is drawn from the <hi>relation</hi> of an active scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall: it is the morall cause of a passive scandall; so that he who scandalizeth another, partaketh of, and is accessary unto the sin of


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115026:60"/>

                     <p>A <hi>third</hi> argument is fetcht from the <hi>effect</hi> of an active scandall: 'tis of a soule destroying nature, &amp; so a kind of spirituall murther: <hi>destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died, Rom.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The <hi>last</hi> argument is taken from the <hi>Opposite</hi> of scandall, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and its act <hi>beneficence:</hi> We are <hi>to love all,</hi> even our most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious, and persecuting enemies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 44. We are to do <hi>good unto all,</hi> though <hi>especially to the houshold of saith, Gal.</hi> 6. 10. We are to exercise <hi>patience, and meeknesse,</hi> towards even those that oppose themselves, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14, 15. And from this it will inevitably follow, that we are to scandalize none.</p>
                     <p>Here we have usually objected the example of our Saviour, who slighted the scandall of the Pharisees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Then came his Disciples and said unto him: knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended</hi> after they heard this saying? but he answered and said &amp;c. let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The objection concernes onely the scandalizing of them in things indifferent; and unto it I shall give an answer in the words of <hi>Parker</hi> part. 2. part. 57. <hi>If this be all the warrant we have, not to forbeare in a thing indifferent for the malicious, then have we no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant at all, because the scandall (there) not cared for, is when the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And when he defendeth his healing on sabbaths, and his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples plucking eares, upon this reason they are duties of necessity and charity, he plainly insinuateth, there is no defence for deeds unnecessary, when the malitious are scandalized.</hi>

                        </gap> any detriment for the prevention of their scandall.</p>
                     <p>The answer unto this may easily be foreseen, for here is nothing but Jesuiticall dictates, that are alltogether proofelesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Pharisees, the wicked, that are scandalized out of malice, are in a greater spirituall necessity, and danger, then those, that are scandalized out of ignorance, or weaknesse: for, they are in the <hi>snare of the divill, taken captive by him at his will.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, <hi>Secondly,</hi> they are more unable to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and prevent their own falling into sin; for their hearts are altogether destitute of any gracious habits: there is not in them the spirit, a renewed principle, to make head, or resistance against the flesh, the sinfull corruption of their natures: there is need then of all help possible to keepe them from falling: and all will be uneffectuall, unlesse God also put in his helping hand.</p>
                     <p>Whereas he talkes: that 'tis an easy matter for a wicked, and malitious man to provide against all danger, and need of his soule, by changing his perverse, and naughty will: this is a very grosse Pelagian conceite: for it ascribes that, unto the power of mans corrupt will, which can be wrought only by the omnipotent grace of God.</p>
                     <p>By this time (I hope) the Reader is sufficiently satisfyed that the active scandals of the most wicked, and malitious are not to be contemned.</p>
                     <p>But yet there remaineth a great difficulty in the point to be cleared; and that is, when an active-scandall is committed towards them, in our duties, and indifferencies?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> we actively scandalize them by our <hi>duties,</hi> when they are not rightly circumstanced, seasonably performed, in due time, and place: when they are not expedient unto those ends, for which God enjoyned them: now when this is, cannot be determined by

any generall rule, but every one must be left to be guided by his spirituall prudence, and wisdome. [But for this hereafter I shall allot a peculiar digression by it selfe.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> we actively scandalize them by our <hi>indifferencies,</hi> when 'tis probable they will occasion their passive scandall, their falling into sin; But now this generall rule is to be limited, and I shall give you <hi>three limitations</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The first limitation:</hi> this rule is to be understood, when the use of our indifferencies is likely to prejudice, and obstruct the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Gospell, and the forbearance of them will in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability conduce unto the advancement of the Credit of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and not otherwise, ordinarily: upon this account, it would have been scandalous in <hi>Paul</hi> to have received maintenance from the Corinthians: but tis now unscandalous in Ministers, to accept, and challenge that maintenance, which is due unto them by the lawes of the land; for a generall forbearance thereof now would soone be followed with the utter ruine of the Gospell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A second limitation:</hi> the sorementioned rule is to be understood, when the forbearance of our indifferencies is likely to win upon the wicked, and malitious, so as to further their conversion, and not otherwise, when it onely exposeth unto their contempt, scorne, and derision, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Though I be free from all men</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> have I made my selfe servant unto all, that I might gain the more. And unto the Jews I became as a few, that I might gain the Jewes: to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gaine them that are under the Law. To them that are without Law, as without Law (being not without Law to God, but under the Law to Christ) that I might gaine them, that are without Law. To the weake became I as weake, that I might gaine the weake: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all meanes save some.</hi> Here tis very remarkable, that <hi>Paul</hi> was made, in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, all things unto all men, only in order to their salvation, to gaine their soules unto Christ; and why should we abridge our selves in the use of our liberty, in things that are of great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency and conveniency unto us, when such a restraint of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, is not a probable means of reaching the said end? what reason can be given, why we should incommodate our selves, by forbearing all such indifferencies, that wicked men are scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115026:62"/>
at, when such forbearance is unprofitable unto their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good, and unlikely to bring them any jot the nearer unto God and Heaven?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A third limitation:</hi> the forementioned rule hath not place, when by the sorbearance of our indifferencies, at which some wicked men are scandalized, there is incurred as great, if not a greater scandall, then that by their use: as when they are hereby confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and hardned in their errour, and sinne; and others are hereby drawn into the like: <hi>prudenter advertendum est</hi> (saith <hi>Bernard) scandalum scandalo non emendari, qualis emendatio <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you see how the rule is to be limited; and without such, or the like limitations, rigidly to presse it, would make against both the <hi>liberty,</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>conscience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First, against the liberty of Conscience:</hi> for it would in great part evacuate, and annull the grand charter of our Christian liberty in things indifferent, it would (as <hi>Peter</hi> saith in another case) <hi>put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our Fathers were, nor we are able to beare,</hi> Acts 15. 10. <hi>All things are lawfull for me</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) But I will not be brought under the power of any,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12.

The reason is, because every one is bound to have a greater care of his own, than others salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and consequently, rather to avoid sin in himselfe, than to prevent it in his brethren. And therefore that precept which is given us for the prevention of sin in others, is but of a <hi>secondary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</hi> Now the precept of eschewing scandall is imposed, onely for the hindring of sin in others, and therefore doth not tie us, when there occurreth any other precept, which is given for the avoiding of sinne in our selves.

Againe, <hi>secondly,</hi> it may be objected: that if the obligation of the naturall precept of eschewing scandall ceaseth upon occurrence of but a positive precept; why, then it seems, this positive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept detracts or derogates from the naturall precept of avoiding scandall: as being of greater force, and validity?

influence in the worship; for the same tolling of bells is, and may be used to convocate the people to a Baron Court to heare a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, to convocate souldiers. This exception, that I have lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downe, is, I conceive, grounded, as upon what the Apostle saith; so also upon the reality, and truth of our Christian liberty in things indifferent, which otherwise would signifie nothing; for if we are to abstaine from all indifferent things, in which another without probable ground imagineth that there is sin; the servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Christians under the Gospell would be farre greater, and more intolerable, then that of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>A <hi>third exception;</hi> which we may gather hence, is, in great part, coincident with the first, and 'tis; that the abstinence unto which we are obliged, in things indifferent, in the case of scandall, is not <hi>universall, and totall,</hi> but limited <hi>ad hic &amp; nunc,</hi> those times, and places in which there is danger, or likelyhood of scandall: the Corinthians were, in their private feasts, to forbeare eating Idolothytes, only in the presence of persons apt to be scandalized, and might elsewhere use <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> liberty without regret of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
                     <p>Unto these exceptions insinuated here by the Apostle we may adde divers others; of which, some may be collected from what we above said touching the scandall of the wicked in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> and by and by I shall adde others; but first I shall examine some restrictions, which I gave in a former edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this booke.</p>

                           <hi>But now, if the action in which this appcarance of evill is supposed to be, be but indifferent, then these two following things must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </hi> upon the text: for the examination of it we must distinguish of humane Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; they are of two sorts, <hi>Circumstantiall,</hi> or <hi>Doctrinall.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, <hi>circumstantiall,</hi> such are the Circumstances of time or place, matters of order, decency, and the like. Now these are necessary in the <hi>generall,</hi> and the <hi>particulars</hi> may be determined by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, or Church-officers v. g. that the publique assemblies be at such a convenient time of the day, in such a place, and that they be convocated by tolling of bells; that the Minister officiate in a grave habit, gowne, cloake, or coate, &amp;c. Now though some of these may be by some causelesly imagined to be evill; yet they are not therefore to be forborne, if they be by lawfull command of the Magistrate, or Church, to be annexed with necessary duties; for necessary duties are not to be omitted for meere circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces connexed with their performance.</p>
                        <p>Thus we are not to forsake, or refraine our publick assemblies, because some think there is some superstition in the places of them, our Churches, and the Convocation of them by bells, upon this ground, that both our Churches and bells have been abused by Papists. Dr <hi>Heylin</hi> [in a former edition of his Geography] relates this following story of <hi>Peter Du Moulin;</hi> that hearing how diverse English Ministers scrupled to officiate in a Surplice, he said, that he would willingly preach at <hi>Paris</hi> in a fooles coate, if leave could not be gotten of the King, upon any other condition. If this great light of France ever dropped such words, he had in them doubtlesse a very good, devout, and zealous meaning; but yet (under correction) I cannot see how his resolution can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded with that rule of the Apostle; <hi>Let all things be done decently;</hi>


                           <pb n="114" facs="tcp:115026:68"/>
for it cannot as yet sink into my foolish head, how that a fooles coat is a decent garment to preach in. But this on the bie.</p>
                        <p>To proceed unto a <hi>second sort</hi> of Ceremonies, which we may call, for distinction sake, <hi>humane, Doctrinall, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap>;</hi> such as men institute, by their morall signification, to teach, v. g. the Crosse, Surplice &amp;c: if these might lawfully, by any humane authority whatsoever, be unavoidably annexed with necessary duties, we should then soon resolve, that we are not then to abstaine from them; but the non-conformists ever held that no mortall wight whatsoever could lawfully urge, or presse the unavoidable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of such Ceremonies with necessary duties; and indeed they have very good reason against the Command of such a connexion; because it would have been against <hi>religion, and against charity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, <hi>against religion:</hi> they never granted them (as is still suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) to be indifferent, but alwaies arraigned them as guilty of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, and will-worship; and so, manifest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> against the second commandement, presumptuous additions unto the word, and ordinances of our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>a setting of mans threshold by Gods threshold, and their posts by Gods posts, Ezek.</hi> 43. 8. and the justice of their accusation will be soon confessed by all learned, and unprejudiced men, that will with patience, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality reade the reenforcement of their arguments by <hi>Parker, Didoclave,</hi> and <hi>Ames</hi> against all answers and replies whatsoever. The Prelates connexing of humane symbolicall ceremonies with duties and ordinances that are necessary, and commanded by the word of God, brings into my mind an artifice of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: <hi>in the market places of Cities, he set up his own image, with the Essigies of the gods of the Heathen pictured round about, to the end, that whosoever should do civill reverence to the Emperours Image, might also seem to worship the gods of the Gentiles: and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they who would not bow to the Gods of the Gentiles, might seeme also to refuse all due <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                              </gap> to the Emperour.</hi> Thus the Prelates, of their own heads, most presumptuously have set up in Gods worship, and service, their own inventions, and have commanded them to be joined with the ordinances of Christ: so that hereby they drave many conscientious Ministers into a great strait, if, out of a lothnesse to loose the exercise of their Ministry, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto their Ceremonies, this they interpreted to be an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115026:68"/>
os them; and, if to avoid their Ceremonies, they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to baptize, to administer the Lords supper &amp;c. then they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused them for neglect, and contempt of Gods Ordinances.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> it was against charity for the Prelates, so rigidly, and peremptorily to presse their paultry Ceremonies, as that unlesse men observed them they would not suffer them, by their good wills, to enjoy the precious Ordinances of Christ Jesus; and this can reasonably be denied by none, who think, that the soules of men may be damnified by the want of such ordinances: But to proceed unto a second restriction in the former edition.</p>

(<hi>Woe to that man by whom the offence cometh,</hi>) reacheth Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, as well as private persons: and we may say the same of the Apostolicall prohibitions of scandall both to the Romans, and the Corinthians, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 13, 15, 20, 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>and chap.</hi> 10. 32.</p>
                        <p>Unto these <hi>prohibitions</hi> adde we <hi>Pauls resolution</hi> to avoid scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall arising from the use of things indifferent: <hi>if meat make my brother to offend</hi> (<hi>saith he) I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13. For</p>
                        <p>From this resolution the unlawfulnesse of the injunction of such ceremonies as ours will undeniably follow.</p>
                        <p>To cleare this I shall <hi>presuppose</hi> that, which cannot (with any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of reason) be denied: to wit, that, that, which <hi>Paul</hi> held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115026:71"/>
for himselfe to practise in his own person upon a generall account belonging to all Christians, could not by him be lawfully imposed upon others by an Ecclesiasticall Canon; but now <hi>Paul</hi> held it unlawfull to eat flesh in case of scandall probably conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and this was upon a generall reason belonging to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: and therefore he thought it utterly unlawsull to impose any such matter upon others when scandall was likely to follow.</p>
                        <p>From this thus premised, I shall hence thus argue <hi>Syllogistically,</hi> against our Prelates imposition of our Ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>If it were unlawfull for <hi>Paul</hi> to impose upon the <hi>Corinthians</hi> such ceremonies as ours, then it was unlawfull for our Prelates to impose such upon us.</p>
                        <p>But it was unlawfull for <hi>Paul</hi> to impose such Ceremonies as ours upon the Corinthians.</p>
                        <p>Therefore it was unlawfull for the Prelates to impose such Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies upon us.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>sequele</hi> of the <hi>major</hi> is evident: because the Prelates could not pretend unto so much authority in matters Ecclesiasticall as <hi>Paul</hi> had: for in each of the Apostles there was a greater <hi>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                              </gap> of jurisdiction</hi> then in any that succeeded them.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Minor</hi> that may be confirmed by this following Syllogisme.</p>
                        <p>If it were unlawfull for <hi>Paul</hi> to impose upon the Corinthians the eating of flesh when scandall was likely to ensue, then it was unlawfull for him to impose upon them the use of such Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as ours.</p>
                        <p>But the former appeareth to be unlawfull by the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the latter was unlawfull also.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing here can be questioned but the <hi>Major,</hi> and that is easily confirmed from a just <hi>comparison</hi> of <hi>flesh with such Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies as ours.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> the eating of flesh was undoubtedly a thing more cleerly indifferent, then the practise of such Ceremonies of ours.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> flesh was necessary unto the maintenance of the life of man by <hi>disjunction:</hi> that is, flesh, or some other meat: but now such Ceremonies as ours are not necessary unto the worship and service of God by <hi>disjunction:</hi> for God may be worshipped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, or any others in their stead: a surplice (saith <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford)

is not necessary by way of disjunction, for neither is surplice ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, nor any other white or red habit, that hath some mysticall sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, like unto Surplice: So kneeling to the elements is neither necessary, nor any the like religious honouring of them by prostration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, or kissing them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But against this accusation of our Ceremonies for scandall there are objected <hi>two Comparisons.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First, of the duties of justice and Charity together:</hi> the duties of justice are more obligatory then the duties of charity, as being not only a <hi>morall, but a legall debt:</hi> Now to hinder the scandall of the weak is a duty of charity, <hi>only a morall debt,</hi> to obey the lawfull command of authority in things indifferent a <hi>duty of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, a legall debt;</hi> and therefore of the greater obligation, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I shall the rather insist on this argument, because it is of late so much stood on by Dr <hi>Sanderson</hi> [in his last Sermons prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 1656. pag. 249.] <hi>where we are not</hi> (saith he) <hi>able to discharge both: debts of justice are to be paid</hi> (saith he) <hi>before bebts of charity. Now the duty of obedience is</hi> debitum justitiae, <hi>and a matter of right: my superiour may challenge it at my hands as his due; and I doe him</hi> wrong, <hi>if I withhold it from him. But the care of not giving offence is but</hi> debitum charitatis, <hi>and a matter of but</hi> courtesie. <hi>I am to performe it to my brother in love, when I see cause: but he cannot chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it from me as his right, nor can justly say I do him wrong, if I neglect it. It is therefore no more lawfull for me to disobey the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full command of a superiour, to prevent thereby the offence of one or a few brethren, then it is lawfull for me to do one man wrong, to do ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man a courtesie withall, or then it is lawfull for me to rob the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer to relieve an Hospitall.</hi>

But it is not to a purpose for the Doctors: for all offices and duties generally, and universally, of what ever kind, which we owe by way of Justice, are not more obligatory, than duties which we owe only by way of charity: as when duties of a positive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

Let us suppose that the King, and Convocation, and Assembly of Priests and Prophets of Israel make a Canon according to Gods word.

But if our Doctors argument st and strong, <hi>David</hi> at the point and hazard of famishing for hunger, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in eating shew-bread, yet Christ acquitteth him of all sinne, and saith <hi>Matth. 12. 5.</hi> he and his followers are <gap reason="foreign">

Now <hi>David</hi> was under a duty by mercy, and love to his own life, and the lives of his followers, to eat shew bread, and he was under the band of Justice, by the Law of the Ancients of Israel, and Gods law, not to eat. Therefore in some cases when our superiours commandements are only positive Lawes, they are not more obligatory, than duties of Charity, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded in the Law of nature. I cleare it further thus, I see my neighbour in danger before my eyes of drowning, and my father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth me to goe and labour, or sow his farme in that time, while I am to preserve the life of my neighbour, in present danger, to loose his life in a great water. By the Doctors maxime, I am under the higher obligatory tie of Justice, to obey my father, who commandeth a thing both lawfull and necessary, by vertue of the higher commandement, to wit the first of the second Table, than I am obliged by the sixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and of charity only, to give present succour and helpe to my dying neighbour, so I must let my neighbour dye in the waters, to give a duty of Justice to my father of farre lesse necessity. I would not commit my Conscience to such Casuists, as are the Doctors of Aberdeen.

                        <p>But to proceed'unto the <hi>second comparison</hi> on which I insisted out of <hi>Bishop Morton</hi> and Dr <hi>Sanderson: a Comparison betwixt a scandall given to a Magistrate, and a scandall given to one, who is only a brother: I demand whether or no the offence given to, or taken by a Magistrate, who is a brother, and withall a Magistrate be not greater, than that which is given to, or taken by one, who is only a brother? an impartiall Judge will soone determine that the double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of brother, and Magistrate weigheth down the single, and naked relation of a brother &amp;c.</hi> ut suprà.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>answer</hi> unto this, distinguish we of a <hi>twofold acception of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, Primary,</hi> and <hi>Secundary.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First, Primary,</hi> and so tis an occasioning culpably the fall of another into sin.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly, Secundary,</hi> and so 'tis only the angring, vexing, displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of another.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>distinction premised;</hi> the comparison may be understood; either of the scandall of a Magistrate in a <hi>secundary</hi> acception, with a scandall of one, who is onely a brother in a <hi>secundary</hi> acception of the word too; or else of the scandall of a Magistrate in a <hi>secundary</hi> acception with the scandall <hi>of a brother in a primary</hi> acception; or 3. of the scandall of a Magistrate in a <hi>primary</hi> acception with

the scandall of a brother in a <hi>primary</hi> acception also.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First;</hi> if the Comparison be on both sides to be understood of scandall taken in a <hi>secondary sense,</hi> there is no doubt, but the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of the Magistrate is more dangerous, than that of one, who is only a brother: for the wrath of the supreame Magistrate is <hi>as the Messengers of death, Prov.</hi> 16. 14. <hi>as the roaring of a Lyon, Prov.</hi> 19. 12. In indifferent things then it will be our safest course to anger a brother, rather then to displease the Magistrate. But this acception of scandall is impertinent unto our purpose, and so much is consessed by Dr <hi>Hammond</hi> in his treatise of scandall <hi>pag:</hi> 23. <hi>To be angry, grieved, troubled, at any action of another, is not (to be offended) in the scripture sense, nor consequently doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that I have done a misse in doing that which another man is angry at, unlesse my action be in it selfe evill.</hi> The scandall we speak of is culpable; but to displease a magistrate is not alwaies a sin: the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake of scandall for the angring of one is taken notice of by <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> also upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13. having affirmed, that some corrupted the doctrine of scandall with foolish glosses, and others with their impious calumnies, he sheweth the originall of both their mistakes touching the meaning of offence in the Apostle. <hi>Utrique errant in verbo offendendi.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if the comparison be to be understood of the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of the Magistrate in a <hi>primary acception</hi> with a scandall of a brother in a <hi>primary acception</hi> too: then I should thinke, that the


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115026:75"/>
scandall of the Magistrate is the greater, and more to be eschewed, it is a greater sin culpably to occasion the fall of the Magistrate into sin, then the fall of a meere brother: because the falls of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates are of a more pernicious example, giving greater counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and encouragement unto sin.</p>
                        <p>But this will no wayes advantage our Sticklers for Ceremonies: for the non-conformists deny, that their forbearance of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies did culpably occasion the fall of the Magistrate into sinne: and the contrary they expect to have proved and not barely dictated.</p>
                        <p>One thing let me observe on the bie, before I passe on: and 'tis: that, if those who make this comparison of the scandall of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate with the scandall of a brother, take scandall on both sides in the primary acception thereof: then they seeme to intimate, that there may be a case wherein a man may be necessitated cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably to occasion the fall, either of a Magistrate, or of a brother into sinne: Of a Magistrate if he forbeare what he commands, of a brother if he practise it: But this is not <hi>casus dabilis,</hi> for God by his providence, can never necessitate a man unto sin: of this <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford</hi> speaks very solidly in his resutation of the Dupliers <hi>pag.</hi> 41, 42. <hi>You shall</hi> (saith he unto them) <hi>be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

thereof, as will be apparent unto any one, that will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to peruse them.</p>
                        <p>There be <hi>two things</hi> more I shall take notice of in my foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned discourse.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> I suppose all along that the Convocation was our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Church of England: but surely she was a step mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto divers of the Godly, using towards them farre more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, then unto such whom profanesse rendered obnoxious unto their Courts: if any indifferent man looke upon their Canons he must needs confesse, that one of their chiefe designes was to crush, and persecute such religious persons, whom they nicknamed Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, to <hi>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </hi> with their Ceremonies such among them for whom Christ died. But I wonder upon what account, I, or any man else, could think it to be the Church of England. If in any sense it can be called the Church of England, it was because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the Ministry of England, and that it did not; because the farre major part of it were <hi>Cathedrall men, Bishops, Deanes, Arch-Deacons,</hi> and such as were chosen by the respective <hi>Chapters</hi> of each Cathedrall: it might then be a representation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Ministers, but not of the ministry of England: and that I shall make good by two <hi>parallels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The first</hi> shall be, betwixt our Convocations, and the Councill of Trent: many sober, and moderate Papists accused this to be a pack'd assembly, a representation, of, not the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> but the <hi>Court of Rome;</hi> because the greatest part of it were of the Popes faction, and depended wholy upon him: So the Major part of our Convocations were of the Bishops faction, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded chiefly the interests of Cathedrals: and therefore were not a representative of all the Ministers in England. I shall exemplifie this by instancing in the <hi>Diocesse</hi> of <hi>Bathe,</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> wherein I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: In this there were members of the lower house of Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, one Deane, three Archdeacons, and one chosen by the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Wells: and to ballance these there were but two Clarkes chosen by the Ministry of the whole <hi>Diocesse:</hi> Now what impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall man, but will determine that these seaven could be no due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of the Ministers of the <hi>Diocesse</hi> of <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> as long as five of them were members of the Cathedrall, in whose election the Ministers of the Diocesse had no hand at all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="131" facs="tcp:115026:76"/>
A <hi>second paralell</hi> shall be betwixt our convocation, and a civill assembly: wherein we will suppose, that the Prince chooseth <hi>three hundred,</hi> who are his Courtiers, or else such as have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, either wholy, or in great part upon him: and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion choose only a <hi>hundred:</hi> you may call this assembly a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or what you will; but surely no rationall man can thinke it to be a representation of the nation: and as irrationall were it to call the Convocation a representation of the Ministers, of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, seeing those chosen by the Ministers were an inconsiderable part of the Convocation.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>unto this we may adde;</hi> that there was seldome a due, and regular choice made of the Clerks of the Convocation: I was present at the last election, that was at Wells: and then <hi>Bishop <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </hi> told us, that it was an unquestionable priviledge due unto his <hi>See</hi> for him to propound unto us the Clerkes that we should chuse, unto which he expected our conformity, tacitly menacing all that dissented.</p>
                        <p>And when yet, by all this violence, he was unlikely to carry it for such as he had nominated; why then, he had another shift, that was (I believe) never heard of before: he enabled the Pluralists, of whom either all, or most were his favorites, to voice it in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall capacities: to give as many double voices, as they had dignities, and benefices: his Son gave at that time eight single voices, two as he was Archdeacon of Bath, two as he was Prebend of Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, two as he was Parson of Bucklan-Mary, two as he was Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of Kingsbury: Now, to say that such an election was regular, and lawfull is as ridiculous, and senselesse, as if a man should say, that in the Choice of Knights of the Shire for Parliament, men may give as many double voices, as they have Farmes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>second thing</hi> I shall take notice of, in the now mentioned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse, is my misinterpretation of the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 32.

from the Church of God, it is plaine, that they were not as yet converted unto the Christian faith, but were as yet enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and consequently strangers unto the Church: And thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving finished my examination of the two limitations that I gave in a former edition of this treatise. I shall goe on to that which followeth.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>suppose</hi> the action in which this appearance of evill is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined to be as indifferent in it felfe, so also not annexed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a necessary duty, and we also left to the use of our liberty, what then?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Two things</hi> are here especially to be considered: <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>quality</hi> of the action expected at; <hi>secondly, the difference of times, and places.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To beginne with <hi>the first,</hi> the action (at which thy brother is scandalized, by his groundlesse imagination, that 'tis evill, or carrieth a reall appearance of evill) <hi>is</hi> either of <hi>none, or great importance to thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If it <hi>be of none importance,</hi> but weightlesse, as affording thee either none, or but small benefit: offend not thy brother by an unseasonable exercise of thy liberty. Know that as <hi>authority,</hi> so <hi>charity</hi> should also restraine it: consider that by this undue use of thy liberty thou sinnest against <hi>thy brother,</hi> and by sinning against him thou <hi>sinnest against Christ.</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 12.</p>
                        <p>But now if it be of some <hi>weight,</hi> and <hi>moment,</hi> as yeelding thee some great profit, why thou must a while forbeare it, untill thy brother may be better informed; and to informe him that the action is lawfull which offends him, thou must take care too, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise thou wilt prejudice the truth, through thy regardlesse silence, and also continue his weaknesse, and foment in him a negative superstition. <hi>Let every one of us,</hi> (saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 2.) <hi>please his neighbour for his good unto edification,</hi> And for a man to humour his neighbour in an erroneous and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious opinion, however it may please him, yet not for his <hi>good</hi> unto <hi>edification:</hi> Upon which ground I take it, that the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> as he refused maintenance at Corinth, to avoid appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a <hi>coveteous intention,</hi> and <hi>mercenary affection</hi> in <hi>preaching:</hi> so also his just title, and unquestionable right thereunto he at large both professeth, and proveth.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115026:80"/>
variation in them, as to make those actions materially good, or sinfull, which are of themselves in their own nature indifferent: yet notwithstanding the publick and ordinary abuse of an action at such a time, or in such a place, may make it then and there, in that place and for that time appeare to be evill; although the same action at another time, and in the same place; or in another place, at the same time, may not be obnoxious to any such censure.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First</hi> then, time may alter this <hi>imaginary appearance</hi> of evill in an action.  Reservation of the brazen serpent, as for other ends and purposes, so for commemoration of that miraculous delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Israelites thereby, from the stings of fiery Serpents, was for a while free from all suspicion, either of Idolatry or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition: but when once it became the generall, ordinary, nay daily occasion, and object of Idolatry that can be, when incense was offered to it: then if the publique Magistrate had not demolished it, he might justly have been thought to favour that Idolatry where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was polluted.  And therefore commednable was <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his zeale in breaking it in peices, 2 <hi>King</hi> 18.4.</p>
                        <p>In the former Edition it was observed out of <hi>Morton</hi> that the same <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did not destroy the high places, which <hi>Solomon</hi> had built for <hi>Astoreth,</hi> the abomination of the Sidonians: and for <hi>Chemosh,</hi> the abomination of the <hi>Moabites</hi>; and for <hi>Milchom,</hi> the abomination of the Children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> and yet was never taxed for countenancing of Idolatry. For in his daies the Idols there erected, were disregarded no man worshipping them, and therefore might safely be suffered to stand: but when afterwards they were generally and usually adored, then the good King <hi>Josiah</hi> justly demolished them: and indeed should he have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them then when the Idolatry wherewith they were defiled, was flagrant at the height, he might justly be suspected to be a favourer of that Idolatry.</p>
                        <p>But unto this observation of <hi>Mortons</hi>; <hi>Ames</hi> thus replyeth. <hi>He propoundeth, as very observable, that Hezekiah did not abolish the Idols, which</hi> Solomon <hi>suffered to be set up, because they were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. But. 1. it may well be thought that those idols were destroyed by</hi> Hezekiah <hi>, and set up again before the time of</hi> Josiah <hi>, as many other




<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115026:80"/>
superstitions were. 2. It cannot be doubted but they should have been destroyed, even though they were for the time neglected: because either</hi> Hezekiah <hi>had as good cause to destroy them as Josiah, or else he might have prevented that cause which</hi> Josiah <hi>had: and to prevent evill, we are as well bound, as to correct it.</hi>

Indeed our Ceremonies, for example, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, Crosse in Baptisme, kneeling at the Lords Supper, may have a materiall semblance with those that in Popery have been abused to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and superstition, and so consequently taken materially, in respect of their materialls, may have an outward shew of Popish Idolatry, or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition; but consider them as imposed by our Church, and generally used by her members, so they are formally differenced from those which Papists have applyed to Idolatrous ends and purposes. For our Church publickly professeth a quite contrary use or application, end, or intention of them. And externall actions have their specification, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently distinction from their end, and intention, from it they take their species, or kind, and accordingly are distinguished. Now since all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish, whether superstitious, or idolatrous abuses of our Ceremonies, are publickly disclaimed, and their right use explained; who can justly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any shew of Popery in them? An Israelite was not to be smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for an Egyptian, because for a while he once sojourned in Egypt, if afterward he had his constant abode in Canaan. The garment spotted with the flesh was no longer to be hated, than spotted: being once washed, it might againe be used. Our Ceremonies were defiled in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, in Popery, with superstitiom, and Idolatrie; but our Church (God be praised) hath washed them from both in her publique, and professed use of them. And therefore now they stand above either calumnie or suspicion.</p>

                           <hi>First,</hi> our non-conformists will tell us, that there was betwixt our Ceremonies, and those of the Papists, even a <hi>formall conformity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115026:83"/>
though our Prelates disavowed many, nay most of those super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious and idolatrous ends, unto which the Papists applyed our Ceremonies, yet they still prosessed one end and intention of the Papists in the use of them, to wit, <hi>mysticall signification;</hi> and this to be a Popish and superstitious end, the non-conformists prove at large in their books.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly, a materiall conformity</hi> in Ceremonies, carrieth many times a reall appearance of evill, and scandalizeth actively. It doth not appeare that the Altar which <hi>Uriah</hi> erected, was formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the same with that <hi>Ahaz</hi> saw at <hi>Damascus,</hi> that it had the same use and intention, the worship of a false God. The text menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth only a <hi>materiall conformity</hi> unto it, and for this reason 'tis condemned, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 10, 11. <hi>Peters</hi> conformity with the Jewes <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. was only <hi>materiall,</hi> not <hi>formall,</hi> for a Jewish end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and yet tis blamed by <hi>Paul</hi> as guilty of an active scandall, <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14. Suppose a timerous Protestant in Spaine or Italy go to Masse, and there bow before their breaden God, not out of any <hi>intent</hi> to honour the Idol, but only for <hi>preservation</hi> of his life; his presence and bowing will only be <hi>materially</hi> the same with that of Papists; but will any man think that this can acquit him from the sin of Idolatry? Indeed <hi>Aelian var. Histor. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. excuseth <hi>Ismenias a Thobane</hi> from adoring the <hi>King of Persia,</hi> because though he stooped downe before him, yet it was not to worship him, but to take up a ring that he had for the nonce let fall at his feet: but no rationall man will admit of this his apology, because this stooping in common use was the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King, and interpreted to be such by the King himselfe, and by the spectators.</p>
                        <p>Some thinke that though a different end and intention from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Iewes, and Hereticks in the use of their Ceremonies, cannot legitimate them and free them from scandall; yet <hi>that profession of such a different end and intention, is</hi> sufficient for such a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. But</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> the primative Church was of a different opinion.<note n="(d)" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ames</hi> dispute about humane Ceremonies <hi>pag.</hi> 127.</note> 
                           <hi>The story of Origen is well knowen, how he delivered Palme to those that offered it to the image of Serapis, with this expression of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: come and receive the boughes, not of the image, but of Christ. Yet was he therefore censured as a worshipper of that Idoll.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="145" facs="tcp:115026:83"/>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> if this were true, then we might lawfully use circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision and the passeover, so we disclaime the Jewish end of them, to signifie Christ to come; and professe that our intention, was by them only to signify, that Christ was allready come in the flesh.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly, a materiall conformity</hi> with Papists in their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, hath nourished in them a hope of our coming up to them, but not inclined them in any degree unto us: for they have still protested that they would not step so much as one foot to meere with us: and if my memory faile me not, there is some such thing in <hi>Franciscus Sancta Clara.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Indeed experience hath alwayes shewed, how uneffectuall a meanes such a complyance hath been for the conversion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. Whom of them hath it ever wonne over unto the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant party, but <hi>Spalato,</hi> and others of the like temper, who (as Mr <hi>Fuller</hi> speaks of some Italians that pretended unto true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version) were neither <hi>good dough, nor good bread, but like Ephraim a Cake not turned?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There was a greater materiall conformity with Popish Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in Cathedrals, then in other Churches; but how thin a harvest of converts can they produce? Nay 'tis observed by some, that neare them, Popery thrived more then in other places. I heard a Knight of the royall party once affirme, in the presence of many persons of worth, that he thought there were more Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists in Wells then in all the County of Somerset besides: and yet of late yeares that Cathedrall outstripped most in England for Ceremoniousnesse. In the times immediately preceding the late troubles, not only the former Ceremonies of the Common-prayer booke were urged with more violence than before, but divers others quite antiquated were revived. But though Popish Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies were encreased, we do not find that the number of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists was hereby any thing diminished. I shall conclude this with that of <hi>Didoclave</hi> pag. 540, 541. <hi>Formalistae se retinere quosdam ritus Pontificiorum, ut eos lucrifacere possent, &amp; reducere in rectam viam.

Christ was certainely free, and so might lawfully have refused to pay it: Yet because the Iewes would have taken offence, and umbrages at such his resusall, and charg'd it with appearance of a profane contempt of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Sanctuary, therefore he voluntarily paid it, and so became a Jew to the Jewes, as under the Law to them that were under the Law: Notwithstanding <hi>lest we should offend,</hi> &amp;c. And if this be the sense of the place, what is said of this one Ceremonie, may be applyed unto all; for one of the reasons, and ends, why Christ observed the whole Ceremoniall Law was, to prevent scandall, to abstaine from all appearance of

evill. In nature (saith <hi>Cameron</hi>) there is, <hi>appetitus quidem unionis,</hi> which causeth things to be moved, and to rest often, besides the proper condition of their particular nature, whence sometimes light things are moved downewards, heavie things upwards. Unto this appetite of union in nature, there is answerable in grace, the desire <hi>to promote Gods glory,</hi> which often inclineth and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Godly beyond and besides the ordinary <hi>obligations, arising out of their particular and personall conditions and relations.</hi> And unto the measure of grace is proportionable the degree of the desire of Gods glory, so that the holier any one is, the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently he desireth the promotion thereof: and if it require any thing to be done of him, why he will do it, although otherwise by vertue of his particular, and personall condition, he be not bound thereunto.

these appearances of evill, to wreak his malice upon us.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>first,</hi> in his temptations of us to sinne, they are, <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>baite</hi> by which he <hi>allures: Secondly,</hi> an <hi>argument</hi> by which he <hi>perswades</hi> us thereunto. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> an <hi>encouragement,</hi> whereby he is heartned to persist in tempting of us.</p>

                           <hi>First</hi> then, the appearances of sinne, are a <hi>baite</hi> whereby Satan allures us unto sin, which if we bite at, our consciences will soone be enlarged to swallow sinne it selfe.

Of this we have a remarkeable instance in <hi>Alipius,</hi> who (as St <hi>Austin</hi> relates <hi>Confess. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 8) being drawn by his friends importunity to accompany <hi>him</hi> unto the Roman Gladiatorie Games, yet resolveth though he were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with his body, to be absent in his heart, and for that purpose to keep his eyes shut, that he might not defile them with so barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a sight: yet at last upon a great shout, that the people gave at the fall of one of the Combatants, his curiosity made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the occasion, and thereupon he presently became an applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive spectator of that bloudy and inhumane spectacle. An Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, as <hi>Holerius</hi> writes, by his often smelling to the hearb <hi>Basile,</hi> had a scorpion ingendred in his head: even so wee by our often dallying, and tampering with things that carry a shew of unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, may have Satan, as I may so speak, even formed in us, for as St <hi>Hierome</hi> saith upon <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> the ninth, <hi>Diabolus serpens est lubricus, cujus si capiti, id est, primae suggestioni non resistitur, totus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, unto the practise of most horrid and gastly crimes.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the appearance of evill is an <hi>argument</hi> by which he perswades us unto what is in its owne nature evill, for if a man have but slipt into such actions as the best minded judge to have a reall appearance of evill, Satan forthwith will suggest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115026:89"/>
him, that he hath by this quite crackt his credit amongst those that are accounted religious: by them (will he say) thou art as much suspected, and as deeply censured for thy seeming evill, as for thy being so: wert thou not better therefore, be as thou seemest, for they cannot think worse of thee then they doe, thy shame, and disgrace, their jealousies, suspicious and censures cannot be greater for sinne it selfe, than it is allready for the shew of it. Now this temptation of Satan, receives great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from our nature, for we naturally are addicted to society, and therefore if we finde that upon the signes and shewes of such and such sinnes in our practise, good men condemne us as guilty of the sinnes themselves, and therefore beginne two reserve and estránge themselves from us, refusing any longer to reach out unto us the right hand of fellowship, why, then we will presently have fellowship with the unfruitfull workes of darkness, and couple in with loose, carnall and formall men, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation will quickly infect us, so that it will not be long e're we runne with them to the same excesse of riot.</p>
                        <p>And thus you see how Satan takes occasion from the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of sinne, to draw us on unto sinne it selfe, which me thinks should be sufficient to disswade us from them. For is Satan so backward in tempting, or is his invention grown so barren, as that our lives and practise must put arguments into his mouth? is the <hi>purchase</hi> of hell and damnation so difficult, as that we must needs furnish the Divell with baits to allure us, with reasons to perswade us unto our everlasting perdition, this were folly and madnesse that would want a name.</p>
                        <p>But in the <hi>third place,</hi> the signes and appearances of sinne are not only a <hi>baite,</hi> by which he <hi>enticeth</hi> us, an <hi>argument</hi> by which he perswades unto sinne, but withall an <hi>encouragement,</hi> by which he is heart'ned to goe on in tempting of us, for they make him ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heart, and hope that we are coming on to sinne it selfe; and this hope will breed diligence, make him a more importunate sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciter, make him to double and strengthen his assaults, to plie us even thick and threefold with temptations: A dog will not runne from a man as long as he throwes bread unto him, and can any man suppose the Divell will flie, so long as he gives place unto him, as long as he throwes himselfe upon temptations, by


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115026:90"/>
practising such things as have a manisest shew of evill? for though in themselves they be never so small, yet will they serve to usher in farther and greater matters: being then preparatives unto sinne, they cannot be (as some have imagined) good sences against sinne: seeming to be evill is not, cannot be a meanes to sheild us from being so, no more then the opening the Gates of a City can be the way to raise the seige of it, or letting go the slu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a river can be the course to stop its current.</p>
                        <p>You have seen arguments from Satans temptations of us to sin: take next one from his temptations of us <hi>to despaire,</hi> or at least <hi>discomfort</hi> for sin, a temptation of so hideous a nature, as that, me thinks, our actions should not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> it the least advantage. His <hi>First</hi> labour is by the appearance of sin to make us offend God, but when he cannot proceed so farre, his <hi>Second</hi> endeavour will be, to make us disquiet our selves: when he cannot wound us by them, he will vex us for them; for he will wrest and miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue all that we have done unto the worst sense, he will swell motes into beames, mole-hils into mountaines, appearances of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill into realities, and thunder unto us that there is not a pinne to choose betwixt those and these; unto which our soules beeing distracted by the violent importunity of this temptation, will be over apt to give credence.

we may soone be led to the realities of sinne, though the occasions of themselves are weake, they working but as <hi>objects,</hi> and the <hi>objective causality</hi> being of all most imperfect, yet Satan is strong, our lusts are strong, these occasions are sutable to our lusts: our soules therefore, by a little helpe from Satan will quickly catch infection from them. For this reason were the Israelites, in the time of the passeover prohibited not onely the eating, but the very having of leavened bread in their houses. For this reason too were the Nazarites forbidden to eat so much as the huskes of the grapes, for if that had been permitted, they would perhaps have soone proceeded to the eating of the grapes, and thence to drinking of the wine it selfe: hence also grew that precise resolution of <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 101. 3. <hi>I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This <hi>Joseph</hi> knew, and therefore when his Mistris sollicited him to that foule act of uncleannesse, he harkned not unto her to lie by her, or so much as to be with her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 10. but fled, and got himselfe out of her presence, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. doubting lest the very sight of her might kindle lust.

                        <p>Surely these men are dropt from Heaven, never borne in sinne, or conceived in iniquity: for they, whose originall is from men, may possibly be drawn away by sinfull objects, and shewes: but these men (forsooth) are above <hi>gun-shot,</hi> beyond the reach of temptation; Their professed hatred of sinne brings me in mind of <hi>Pigmalions</hi> aversenesse from women; he was a profest, almost a sworne enemie to woman kind, yet drawing but the picture of a woman, he fell in love with it, and he hug'd, and kist it so long, till at last by the power of <hi>Venus</hi> (as the Poët fables it) it became a woman: Their case is like; they professe detestation of sinne, and yet delight in some things, that have the appearance, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance thereof: let them take heed they dote not so long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these, as that at length by the power of Satan, and the strength of their own lusts, they be transformed into reall sins.

                     <hi>Scotus</hi> lib. 4. dist. 47. <hi>assigneth foure Congruences why there</hi> should be <hi>a generall</hi> judgment.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>first Congruence</hi> is: because it is meete, that all the bad, and wicked ones should be finally, and everlastingly seperated from all the good: for one purpose, whereto their outward Conjunction and Communion serveth, is for the exercise, and triall of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Now there shall come a time, wherein the godly shall be no longer exercised, tried, or vexed with the unrighteous Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ungodly: therefore there must be a finall seperation between them; and Consequently a generall judgment, that so the generall seperation may appeare to be just, wherein the wheat shall be no longer cumbred with the grouth of tares amongst them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:115026:103"/>
A <hi>second Congruence;</hi> because the justice of Gods secret judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of particular persons is not manifest unto all: therefore it is reasonable, that there should be a generall judgment: wherein the justice of Gods sentence in particular judgments shall be made manifest, and open to all the world.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>third Congruence</hi> is; because as things are from God, as their first efficient, and author; so they are to be reduced, and as it were, brought back, or returned againe, unto God, as their last end. But now, besides the speciall <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> or outgoing of all things from God, in the first Creation of things: therefore (by an argument drawn a <hi>simili,</hi>) besides the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and severall reductions of things unto God, it is Congruors that, of such as belong unto God, there should be one finall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction unto God, as unto their end: and by consequent there should be one finall sentence distinguishing those, who belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by election, from the wicked, who shall never be reduced unto, but for ever severed from Gods glorious presence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> and (saith <hi>Scotus</hi>) the <hi>best Congruence</hi> is, because it is meet, that, besides the private and severall admittances of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar believers into possession of the Kingdome of Heaven, there should be a publique, joint, and generall admittance of all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers into inheritance of the Kingdome, which was prepared for them before the foundation of the world. And, besides the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, particular, and severall condemnations of unbelievers unto the prison of Hell, there should be one publique and generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of all unbelievers unto perpetuall abode in the said prison: that so there may be a sequestration, as it were, of two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, or Cities, the houshold of God and of faith, and the family, or brood of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Unto these Congruences of <hi>Scotus,</hi> I shall adde this one thing more; that, before the last judgment, Gods judgment of man is not <hi>compleat, and consummate;</hi> and this shall be cleared:</p>

The members of their bodies are here instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or weapons of unrighteousnesse; and therfore equitable, that hereafter they be subjects of misery, and unhappinesse: Meet is it, that those eyes should then be full of <hi>anguish,</hi> which now are full <hi>of adultery;</hi> that that tongue should be then full of <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly torments,</hi> which now is full of <hi>deadly poison:</hi> so on the other side fit, that as the bodyes of the Saints are instrumentall unto their soules in <hi>Wel-doing;</hi> so they should share with them in the reward of wel-being, and have as much of their glory, and lustre derived unto them, as they are capable of.

                  <p>First, they contribute, if not unto the <hi>essentiall,</hi> yet unto the accidentall and accessory reward of the Godly, as also <hi>acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and accessory punishment</hi> of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>unto the accidentall and accessory reward</hi> of the Godly; for, unto them, it cannot but afford matter of unspeakable joy, and triumph, to behold the blessed fruits of their exemplary faith, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, obedience, patience, labours for the publique &amp;c. in that by them they have (perhaps) won many a soule unto God, Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med weaklings, Confounded adversaries, furthered any in the way of salvation, in the building up of their soules, in either know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or holinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> they conferre unto the <hi>accidentall and accessory pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> of the wicked; in that, they cannot but be amazed, and confounded, at the view of <hi>the many dismall effects</hi> of their accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sins as in others; so particularly, in the wives of their bosomes, fruits of their loines, their dearest intimates: O! what a cutting consideration will it be unto them, at the day of judgment, that by their sins, as they have damned themselves, so also they have been the guilty occasion of sin, and consequently of damnation unto others, who have been seduced, and perverted by their Fr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and heresies, or misguided, and misled by their evil coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, corrupt discourse, and advice, and scandalized by their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full example?</p>
                  <p>A <hi>second reason</hi> (assigned by <hi>Suarez</hi>) is: <hi>because effects show the naughtinesse, or goodnesse of the works, whence they spring, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all those things, being both propounded, and examined the equity of Gods judgment, may more evidently be manifested, it is very meet, that, after all the actions, and all the effects of the actions of all mankind in this life are once quite consummated, there should be a universall

                  <p>But against this it may be objected: That the mere not lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ is a sin of the heart, and therefore comes not under <hi>Ecclesiastical Cognizance,</hi> and censure.</p>

                     <hi>The</hi> first, <hi>Of the learned and Reverend Doctor Hammond:</hi> that the not loving of Christ is the denying of him in time of trouble, and

signifyeth here him that was taynted with the Error of the Gnosticks, and so would not confesse Christ in time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>second</hi> Is, that the not loving of Christ is the sin against the holy Ghost, <hi>an</hi> opposition of Christ, and his Gospel, out of mere malice and desperate hatred.</p>
                  <p>But to make either of these interpretations good we must fly unto a <hi>Meiosis</hi> (whereby lesse is spoken, and more implyed) and what need we run unto a figure, as long as the words are capable of a faire interpretation in their proper sense: I shall therefore conclude (with <hi>Cornelius Alapide, Dickson</hi> and others) that the words containe only a simple denunciation of an eternall curse, and damnation to be inflicted at the coming of the Lord to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon all that love not the Lord Jesus: for <hi>Anathema</hi> is a Greek word, and signifieth cursing or banning; <hi>Maran-atha</hi> is a Syriack or Caldee word, importing that the Lord cometh: for <hi>Maran</hi> signifies Lord, or our Lord, and <hi>Atha</hi> cometh: the words then may be thus glossed; all impenitent haters of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, all, in whom there shall be found a finall want of the love of the Lord Jesus, shall be accursed by him when he cometh to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Now Christ will then interprete all those to hate him, who, in their love of him, admit of any corrivalty: who love any thing, any creature, any lust, either above him, or but in an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and coordination with him: It is the generall opinion of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors, that the Apostle alludes unto the Prophesie of Enoch, mentioned by <hi>

And first 'twill awaken <hi>our glory, Psal.</hi> 57. 19. that is our tongue, so stiled, because the chiefest instrument of glorifying God, wherein stands man's highest glory. And next it will quicken the hands to act, every member, some way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to expresse the thankfulnesse of our hearts, that so our thanks may absolutely be full, compleate, and entire. Gratitude, as blood in the body, runn's through the whole practise of Christianity, and so hath generall use in, and influence upon, all the duties we performe. Because as speciall Precepts oblige unto the severals of them, so also the freenesse, and fulnesse of God's favours ingage generally to all of them. And answerably the School-men make ingratitude <hi>a generall circumstance of sinne,</hi> not as though it were of the <hi>Notion, and Definition</hi> of sinne in generall, but only because it adheres, and cleaves unto every <hi>sinne, gradually</hi> aggravating the guilt, and demerit thereof. For in all sinnes we commit, there is, as a deviation from the speciall Lawes against them, so also a <hi>virtuall</hi> disregard of God's mercy, a powerfull disswasive from them: and therefore, although ingratitude be <hi>formally</hi> only when there is an expresse and actuall contempt of Benefits; yet there is (saith <note n="(u)" place="margin">21, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

or fixedly observe blessings; their receipt, injoyment, use, continuance, increase; and this indeed is the foundation of all the rest: for unlesse favours be known, or taken notice of, they can never be acknowledg'd, remembred, duely valued, and then small likelihood any thing should be rendred for them: hopes then of our gratitude are even desperate, for notwithstanding the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of mercies, the <hi>showers of blessings</hi> upon us (to phrase it with <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 24. v. 26.) how dull and heavy are we in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of them? Strange, that as <hi>Moses</hi> face shone to all except himselfe; so the lustre, and splendor of our growing happinesse should even dazle neighbouring-nations, and we our selves scarce perceive so much as a glimse thereof. Whom will it not possesse with a degree of just amazement to consider, that we, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed with Gods favour, as with a sheild, hedg'd about with blessings so many, so eminent, as that, unlesse we hoodwinke our selves, impossible they should escape our observation, can yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne none of all this, though sharp-sighted enough in espiall of miseries and losses?</p>
                  <p>But to returne. Our observation will be too short, if it reach no further then Blessings in themselves. Our thoughts therefore must not be fixed, and stay upon them, but be raised <hi>upward</hi> to a view of that bounty, which gave them; unto a sight of God in them: unto an apprehension, not only of his <hi>generall providence,</hi> (for that makes the Sun to rise on the evill, as well as the good, and sendeth raine on the unjust, as well as just:) but of his <hi>speciall love, benevolence,</hi> the light of his Countenance shining through them on us in his Son Christ Jesus.

And therefore temporall blessings are then proportionable unto the soule as spirituall, when we behold Gods name written upon them, as tokens of his love, when God comes along with them to the soule. For then, though they be still <hi>temporall</hi> in regard <hi>of their nature, and beeing;</hi> yet are they in a <hi>sense spirituall,</hi> as <hi>joined with</hi> God, the adequate spirituall good of the soule, as <hi>directed</hi> by a supernaturall providence to worke unto a spirituall end for the increase, exercise, and triall of our graces, for the bringing us to true happinesse; such as spirituall, and supernaturall union and communion with God.</p>

faile me: Some there are amongst us, that are very loud in their complaints against the greatest outward mercies we can enjoy; They exclaime against the blessed worke of reformation, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable innovation; against the plenty of preaching as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable burden: as the Israelites, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 6. repined at their <hi>manna,</hi> saying there is nothing but this <hi>manna</hi> before our eyes, so these men at the bread of life, saying, there is nothing but preaching Sermons &amp;c. As they, loathing <hi>manna,</hi> lusted after the Cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlick which they had in Egypt; so these people, even fursetting on the good word of God, hanker after those husks, I meane Superstitions, and Egyptian Ceremonies, with which they were formerly fed. There are others that, as 'twas said of Israel, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 24. <hi>despise,</hi> or as some read it, <hi>thinke scorne of this pleasant land,</hi> professing a liking rather to live in any barbarous, remote nooke of the world, with cleannesse of teeth, and scarcity of bread, then here, where Gods mercies swarme about us.</p>
                  <p>But some of us have more, though not grace, yet shame, then downrightly to complaine of God's mercies: yet all the best of us doe much lessen their worth. We aggravate our pettiest pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures beyond an Hyperbole; but then on the other side, how do we extenuate, and diminish the worth of our greatest blessings? (y) as the Cities <hi>Solamon gave Hiram pleased him not,</hi> and he said<note place="margin">Dr Sanderson.</note> to <hi>Solamon, What Cities are these thou hast given me?</hi> and he call'd them, <hi>the Land of Cabul,</hi> that is, as you may see by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, displeasing, or dirty, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 12, 13. so Gods richest fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But now our <hi>estimation is not to be bounded and terminated in the mercies of God considered</hi> in themselves, according to their owne worth, and goodnesse, without reference to their ground, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; for so are we apt sometimes to over-rate them, as the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

1. <hi>Proposall</hi> of Gods honour, and Glory as our highest, and utmost aime in all our Actions, all our suffrings. <hi>A virtuall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> of this end is ever requisite: and that the Schoolmen tell us may very well be without an <hi>actuall Advertency, and Consideration of it:</hi> even as in going a journy (saith <hi>Aquinas</hi>) it is not necessary that every step we tread, we should actually thinke, and ponder upon the end of our journy.</p>

                  <p n="3">3ly, Consecration, and dedication of our blessings unto God, imployment of them for promoting of his glory, maintenance of his Cause, comfort of his children, whom he hath pleased to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point receivers of his tribute. All the Benefits we enjoy are, as <hi>Samuels,</hi> obtained of God: and therefore fit we should make them, as <hi>Lemuels,</hi> dedicated unto God. If we have learning, we must write, preach, dispute for his cause; if riches, spend them for his cause. Be we never so meane, so poore, runne, ride, and pray for his cause.</p>

Unto the, former, a sacrificing of our lives, we may never be called: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a sacrifice of the corruptions of our lives, must daily, hourely continually be offered. And in that consists the life of our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.</p>
                  <p>By this time then you see that our thanks must not stay in words and complements, but proceed on to a returne of affections, and actions. It must be <hi>Actio gratiarum,</hi> a doing, a working of thanks. <hi>David</hi> having <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 1. calld for praise, and thanks unto God, makes a stop and begins to correct himselfe, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. as if he had cald for an impossibility — <hi>Who can utter</hi> (saith he) <hi>the mighty acts of the Lord? who can shew forth all his praise?</hi> He maketh the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>Blessed are they that keep Judgment, and he that doth righteousnesse at all times:</hi> as if he should have said: Indeed none can as they should render what praise, and thanks are due unto God, but he that comes neerest to it, is the keeper of judgment,


<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115026:144"/>

None indeed can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this duty of thanksgiving as they ought, none can suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare the marvelous and mercifull works of God: none can, shall I say, render, nay expresse what prayse, and thanks the Lord deserves. However if the performance of this duty be reall, and active, if we keep judgment, and doe righteousnesse, this our performance of it, though weak, and imperfect, shall find acceptance with, and the reward of happinesse from God. Blessed are they &amp;c. We may then say of gratitude as <hi>James</hi> of saith- shew it me by thy works, by thy works of piety, and devotion unto God, of charitie and Justice unto men.

And the reason of it is that which <hi>Tacitus</hi> gave of his dislike of other words of <hi>Tiberius, nec enim ad hanc formam caetera sunt.</hi> His other actions are not of the same stamp, but of a farre differing straine; sounding forth Gods dispraise and dishonour in a lowder accent, then his lips his praise.

                  <p>And thus have I opened the nature of thanksgiving, about which if any thinke I have stood overlong, let them weigh how vast the duty is, how many and large it's parts are, each of which had I not severally, though briefly, saluted, my discourse

But for this perpetuity of the fruites and effects of thanksgiving the Apostle cals not here upon us.

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> whatsoever is matter of thanks, must be matter of joy too; for joy is not only a companion, <hi>but a cause of thanksgiving,</hi> both <hi>producing, and conserving.</hi> Now crosses, afflictions, simply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as such, are not, cannot be matter of joy; for so considered they are of a destructive, malignant nature; therefore neither of thanksgiving; for crosses we must (I confesse) be joyfull, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but not as they fall under the consideration of evills, as they oppresse and burden nature, for them so considered impossible we should; Because evils as evills are undesirable, from them our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and wills cannot but be abhorrent, and that cannot be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our joy, which is undesirable, and if not of our joy, then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our thanksgiving.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The reason</hi> alleadged in the beginning to the contrary, <hi>viz:</hi> that crosses and afflictions worke together for the best to them that love God, is, methinke, of no force. For all this they do not <hi>natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by accident,</hi> by meanes of God's wise, powerfull disposing, and ordering of them: they are in their own nature wholly destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive: 'tis the grace, power, mercy and providence of God that makes them otherwise. He workes good out of evill, light out of darknesse, beauty out of ashes. Now as things in themselves good, cease not therefore to be the object of our prayers, and praises for


<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115026:147"/>
that they are <hi>accidentally</hi> evill; so neither, doe things in themselves evill become to be just matter of thanks, because they prove <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally</hi> good. For the good that by <hi>accident</hi> flowes from crosses, we ought, I confesse, to be thankfull; not so for the crosses them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>Moreover. 1. This reason holds as well for sins, as afflictions; because they also are so ordered by God's over-ruling power, as that by accident they worke the good of his chosen.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The miseries and calamities of the Church by <hi>accident</hi> also turne to the advancement of God's glory, to the bettering, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of his Church. But yet, I thinke, we would count him a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, a prodigy, and curse, who should still rejoyce, and give thanks simply for this, that Zion is afflicted, that the stones of Jerusalem lye still in the dust; that her members are wallowing and tumbling in their own blood.</p>
                  <p>But we are 2ly, to give thanks, though not for crosses them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet for their <hi>fruite, issue, and mitigation.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>For their fruite and issue,</hi> that our soules are better'd, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by them, drayn'd from their humours, sinnes, purg'd from their drosse, winnowed from their chasse.

We may then give thanks unto second causes, as unto the <hi>conveighers, carryers, and messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Gods favours:</hi> But only unto God, as their <hi>Donor</hi> and <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi> for he alone the <hi>principall Author of them,</hi> and in him <hi>his mercy the sole motive to</hi> conferre them.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>He their principall Author,</hi> the Father of lights, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 17. from whom not only every perfect, but every good gift cometh down. The Apostle alludes (think Interpreters) unto the sunne in the firmament, that great fountaine of light, whence the Moone and lesser stars borrow all their splendor. Now if God be the <hi>Alpha</hi> of our Blessings, if they come originally, and primarily from him, just then is it that he be the <hi>Omega</hi> of our thanks: that

Thanksgiving is an <hi>act of Religion,</hi> whereby in an immediate, direct, and especiall manner we honour God, though not <hi>ad intrà</hi> by an inward increase of his honour, yet <hi>ad extrà</hi> by an outward manifestation thereof: And in acts of religion God could never away with corrivalty, and partnership, still he would have all or none at all: Hope not then that a party, and shared thankfulnesse should now content him, who was alwaies so jealous of his glory. <hi>In the beginning he created the earth naked, void, and without forme,</hi> Gen. 1. 2. lest we (thinks <hi>Chrysostome</hi>) should ascribe that beauty, and glory wherewith afterwards it was apparreld <hi>vers.</hi> 12. unto its own nature, and not his omnipotency, that made it out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. In the ceremoniall law he commanded the Israelites not to lift up <hi>any toole</hi> of iron upon <hi>any altar of stone they should erect, but to build it all of unhewen and unpolish'd stones,</hi> Exod. 20 25. Deut. 27. 5. to intimate (saith <hi>Rabbi Isaac</hi>) that what ever blessings they obtained at the Altar, they should attribute them not to humane indeavours, but meerly to the good will, and pleasure of that free spirit, which bloweth when, and where, and how he listeth.</p>
                  <p>But farther: as we are not to detract, or defalk any thing from the <hi>intirenesse, absolutenesse, and plenarinesse of Gods</hi> praises, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them unto others: So neither</p>

But if it be plaine that nothing in us hath gotten our blessings, that God is the sole Author of them, then next we flatter our selves with a presumptuous conceite that we are the <hi>morall causes, the deservers of them.</hi> That something from us, our desert, holinesse, hath moved God to bestow them.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> because <hi>Adam received it from his very originall;</hi> and beginning; as soone as he was created, God created him <hi>in his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, after his likenesse,</hi> Gen. 1. 26, 27.

was the principall part of this image; <hi>God made man upright,</hi> Eccl. 7. 29: he made him, and made him upright at the same time, the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his soule was, in order of nature, before it's uprightnesse, as being the subject thereof, and accordingly it was created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it in order of nature, but yet this is no hindrance, but that the creation of the essence of his soule, and the superinfusion of righte. ousnesse thereinto, might be <hi>simultaneos,</hi> in regard of time; unto these scriptures, I shall only adde a congruence out of the school-men.</p>

                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> the goodnesse with which hee intended to invest him. Secondly,</hi> his decree <hi>concerning the end unto which he designed him. Thirdly,</hi> his decree <hi>concerning the Laws unto which he intended to oblige him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, his decree concerning the <hi>goodnesse</hi> with which hee invested him: man, as the rest of the creatures, was created <hi>very good,</hi> Gen. c. 1. v. 31: and consequently, God decreed to create him very good; for <hi>he worketh all things after the counsell of his own will,</hi> Ephes. 1. 11. But now he could not be made good, much lesse very good, unlesse he had been created with <hi>originall</hi> righteousnesse; for <hi>morall</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is that, which is proper and agreeable unto a reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore, without this righteousnesse, man could not be morally good: presupposing therefore God's decree to make man very good, it was impossible to create him without originall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="294" facs="tcp:115026:163"/>
Secondly, his decree concerning the <hi>end</hi> which he prescribed, and designed unto him: for the utmost end, unto which man was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was the glory of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4: and his owne eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, consisting in the beatificall vision of God's essence, and the eternall fruition of his glory, even the light of reason dictated this only to be the supreme end of man and all other ends to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfactory, below the nature of his spirituall, and immortall soule: God's giving man a capacity of this end was a sufficient intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it was to be the chief end, which he was to aime at; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon also was it, that there was naturally in man a desire of this end and no other end could give satisfaction unto his infinite, and boundlesse desires; so that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe sticks not to affirme that it was naturall unto man, <hi>Quoad appetitum,</hi> though not, <hi>Quoad consecutionem.</hi> Now God by thus designing man unto this end, and placing in him a naturall appetite thereunto, engag'd himselfe to furnish him with all necessary meanes, abilities, and qualifications for the compassing of it; for, <hi>qui destinat ad sinem, destinat ad me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia;</hi> and originall righteousnesse was (undoubtedly) a qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion absolutely necessary for such a purpose; and, if he bad been created without it, he had been made, not only, a <hi>little lower than the Angels,</hi> but beneath the very <hi>beasts that perish;</hi> below the most contemptible wormes, that crawle upon the face of the earth, for there is none of them destitute of such furniture, as is requisite, for the reaching of their respective ends.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly, his decree</hi> concerning the <hi>Lawes</hi> unto which he intended to oblige him: he intended to write the Law of nature in his heart assoone as he was created; and accordingly it was written; so that, from his creation, he was obliged unto severall duties, but it was impossible for man to performe acceptably these duties without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall righteousnesse, and therefore, God by his purpose to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose these duties upon man, determined himselfe to enable him for them, by making him habitually upright, and holy: for if he should have enjoined, impossible commandements where there was no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for obedience, he had been a very unjust Law-giver, like <hi>Pharoah,</hi> that exacted <hi>bricke,</hi> and would not allow <hi>straw:</hi> God's purpose to create such a creature as man, with the rational faculties of understanding, and will, imply'd a purpose, to oblige him to serve, obey, and glorify him as his Creator; and this againe imply'd


<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115026:163"/>
a purpose to enable, and qualify him for such service, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and was not originall righteousnesse a necessary qualification: for this. Man no sooner knew, that he was a poore creature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant upon the All-mighty maker of Heaven, and Earth; but he forthwith understood, that he was, by the Law of creation, without any positive superadded Law bound, to love this his Maker above all things with all his soule, heart, might, and strength; to love himselfe, and all other things in reference unto him, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The second conclusion: <hi>It was absolutely impossible for man to be created with the contrary of originall righteousnesse,</hi> concupiscence, a pronenesse, or inclination of all the faculties of man unto sin.</p>
                     <p>This conclusion is thus confirmed: if man had been created with this concupiscence, God had been the author of it; but 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for God to be the author of it; the Apostle John saith, <hi>it is not from the Father, but is of the world,</hi> 1 John 2. 16: we may goe farther and say, <hi>it could not bee from the Father, and therefore it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus prov'd it was impossible for God to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of sin, but concupiscence is sin, and therefore God could not be the author of it.</p>
                     <p>Unto this argument we find in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> two answers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> that God would not have been the author of this concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, though man had been created with it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> that this concupiscence is not sinne, and therefore, though God had been the cause of it, yet it would not have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore followed, that hee had been the cause of sinne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> that <hi>God would not have been the author of concupiscence,</hi> though man had been created with it, but it would have been <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his purpose</hi> and intention: for it would (saith he) have flowne <hi>naturally from the condition of the matter</hi> of man, and so it would have

been naturall unto man, not as a <hi>good, gift,</hi> or <hi>ornament,</hi> of nature, but as a <hi>defect, disease, or infirmity</hi> of nature: he endeavoureth to illustrate this by the similitude of a Smith: though a Smith frame a sword of Iron, and the sword grow rusty, yet the rust is not cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Smith, but proceedeth, as a sequele, from the nature, or quality of the Iron, that is the matter of the sword.</p>
                     <p>But this answer is, first, <hi>dissonant</hi> from the truth: secondly, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant</hi> unto <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne principles.</p>

                     <p>A <hi>second argument</hi> is: because, <hi>this concupiscence is not only in the sensitive, and inferiour, but also in the rationall,</hi> and superiour facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in the understanding and will: <hi>St. Paul</hi> Coll. 2. 15: speakes of a fleshly mind, <hi>vainly puft up by his fleshly mind,</hi> so then there is flesh in the very mind of man: <hi>the carnall mind</hi> (or the minding of the flesh) <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth that this concupiscence is against the nature of man; And therefore he contradicts himselfe, when he affirmeth, that it results from the principles of man's nature, the condition of his matter.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>similitude</hi> (of the Smith, and the Iron sword) that will be nothing unto the purpose: for</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First, no Smith whatsoever can make Iron,</hi> that is the matter of a sword, but God alone is the author of the matter of man, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently is the cause of all the naturall sequels thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> a Smith, if he could, <hi>would frame such a sword as might not be subject or inclined unto rust,</hi> but it is not a thing in his power, for he cannot alter the nature of Iron, so that, if he will produce an Iron sword, it will be lyable unto rust: The Papists seeme to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe such an impotency unto God himselfe; for they suppose all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, that God cannot make man to be compounded of a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable


<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115026:169"/>
soule, and sensible matter, but that, (besides the intention of God) the naturall, and necessary result of such a composition will, (without supernaturall prevention,) be a headlong inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto sensible objects, against the dictates of right reason: but the falshood of this supposition I shall anon at large detect.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>second answer</hi> of <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> (<hi>which we frequently sind also in Dr. Taylor,</hi>) is, that this concupiscence is <hi>not a sinne,</hi> but only a <hi>disease, languer, infirmity,</hi> or <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </hi> of nature, and therefore, though God had been the cause of it, it would not yet have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that God was the author of sinne.</p>
                     <p>Unto this I shall oppose the cleare testimony of Paul, who (in 6, 7, 8. chapters of his Epistle unto the <hi>Roman's</hi>) cal's it sinne four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene times, as <hi>Bishop Davenant,</hi> and <hi>Dr. Francis White</hi> (after <hi>Bishop of Ely</hi>) calculate the places.</p>
                     <p>But unto all these places <hi>Bellarmine</hi> replyeth, (<hi>in which reply he is seconded by Dr. Taylor</hi>) that concupiscence is called sinne, by the Apostle, not <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally,</hi> but <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But, that concupiscence is <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> a sinne, I shall prove against both <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> (<hi>and his confident second Dr. Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>) from it's <hi>influence, subject, adjuncts, opposites.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> from it's <hi>mediate influence:</hi> it is the cause of all actuall sin whatsoever, whensoever we are tempted to any sinne, we are <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, and drawne away by our own lust,</hi> this is the mother that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth</hi> and <hi>bringeth forth</hi> all sinne, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 14, 15: and doubtlesse the daughter resembleth the mother, the cause and the effect have the same nature: that which <hi>as a habit</hi> or quality is the cause of sinne, must needs be sinne too; but concupiscence, or the originall pronesse of our natures unto sinne is the roote of all sinne; and therefore (to use the Apostles expression) 'tis <hi>excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding sinfull,</hi> Rom. 7. 13: for, <hi>nil dat, quod non habet vel formalitèr vel eminenter:</hi> But, for confirmation of this argument, we have the testimony of him, who is the truth it selfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 17, 18. <hi>A cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt tree bringeth forth evill fruit, a good tree cannot bring forth evill fruit;</hi> now concupiscence, or an inclination unto sinne, bringeth no fruit, but that which is morally evill, and corrupt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     <p>Secondly, from it's <hi>immediate influence:</hi> it naturally, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly produceth, as it's immediate effects, those first motions unto sinne, which are without consent; and therefore, if we can prove these first motions unto sinne to be sinne, our adversaries will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that concupiscence is sinne also: now, that they are sinne, may be concluded from the Apostles description of sinne, 1 <hi>

not a sinlesse infirmity, is taken <hi>from the subject of it:</hi> It is only found in sinfull men, such as are descended from <hi>Adam</hi> in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of naturall generation: Hence now I thus reason.</p>
                     <p>All sinlesse infirmities, so they were <hi>generall</hi> unto our nature, and not <hi>personall,</hi> were found in the <hi>humanity of Christ,</hi> for he was made like unto us in all things, sinne alone accepted.</p>
                     <p>But concupiscence was not in the humanity of Christ, (as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by the generality of Papists.)</p>
                     <p>And therefore 'tis not a sinlesse, and naturall, but a morall, and sinfull infirmity.</p>

                     <p>The first proposition: <hi>Actuall impenitency doth not alwayes bring forth death actually;</hi> for it may be consistent with the seeds of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, gracious habits: and of this we have an example in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> who lay in his sin a long time impenitent, untill awakened and rowsed by the ministry of <hi>Nathan.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth proposition: <hi>when sinne is finished by finall impenitency, by perseverance in a state of impenitency, then it actually bring's forth death:</hi> to wit, hell and Damnation: those of growne yeares, that dye without repentance drop into the eternall flames, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell.</p>

(as Commentators generally reckon) in three chapters of his Epistle to the Romans (<hi>viz: chap.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>and</hi> 8.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> though it be not here called sinne <hi>expresly,</hi> yet 'tis <hi>imply'dly,</hi> for 'tis made the cause of sinne: and such as the fruit is, such is the tree.</p>
                     <p>Adde unto this <hi>thirdly,</hi> that, if the place prove concupisence not to be sinne, it proves it not to be so in those that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, unjustified, and unregenerate, as well, as in the baptized, justified, and regenerate, for it speakes univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally, of all men, <hi>every man when he is tempted, &amp;c:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis fallaciously done to beare his Readers in hand, as if he limitted his conclusion, only to those, that are baptized, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and regenerate.</p>
                     <p>In a <hi>second place,</hi> he endeavoureth from the words to prove, <hi>that there are veniall sinnes: there are</hi> (saith he) <hi>two birthes of lust, one imperfect [lust when it conceiveth bringeth forth sinne,] but 'tis a veniall sinne, for 'tis distinguished from the consummate birth, of lust, sinne finished, unto which it is appropriated to bring forth death, to be mortall, to deserve hell and damnation:</hi> the argument may thus be reduced into forme: every mortall sinne bringeth forth death, deserveth hell, and damnation, but the sinne, that lust ingendreth or bringeth forth, when it hath conceived, doth not bring forth death, doth not deserve hell and damnation, therefore 'tis not a mortall, but a veniall sinne.</p>
                     <p>The minor is confirmed, because 'tis appropriated to sinne finished to bring forth death, and sinne brought forth, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from sin-finished.</p>

food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, shee tooke of the fruit thereof, and did eat:</hi> here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed shee was tempted by her own lust; by those three sorts of lusts, that <hi>John</hi> speakes of, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 16: <hi>First, the lust of the flesh (when the woman saw that the tree was good for food) second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the lust of the eyes (and that it was pleasant to the eyes) third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the pride of life (and a tree to bee desired to make one wise:</hi>) but this was not before her fall, but a degree, and part thereof. <hi>Dr. Taylor</hi> I know teacheth another doctrine [in his <hi>unum necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> pag. 374.] <hi>concupiscence</hi> (saith he) <hi>was actuall before the fall; it was in Adam, and tempted him;</hi> [<hi>and in his further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of originall sinne,</hi> pag. 462.] <hi>by rebellion, and prevailing of concupiscence it was, that Adam fell:</hi> but the <hi>answer</hi> unto this might easily be foreseen; to wit; that the rebellion, and prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his concupiscence was a cause of <hi>a part of his</hi> fall, <hi>viz:</hi> of his outward eating the forbidden fruit, wherein his fall was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated; as also of his resolution to eate thereof: but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it was not the <hi>cause of the first act of his fall,</hi> his first sin, for concupiscence (as I have proved) is sin, and by this, man should sin before he had sinned.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we may hence be instructed what a <hi>wide difference</hi> there is, <hi>betwixt our temptations unto sinne, and the temptations of Christ:</hi> every one of us is tempted by his own lust, but lust is so filthy a thing, as that it was utterly repugnant unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, full, and unspotted purity, and holinesse of the Lambe of God? <hi>the prince of this world commeth, and hath nothing in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </hi> (saith Christ) <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 38: nothing in mee to side, and comply with his temptations: hence was it, that that sygnall temptation of him by Satan, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4: did not, could not make so much impression upon him, as the waves of the sea upon a rocke: the divell tempted him unto all those branches of lust <hi>mentioned</hi> by <hi>John,</hi> [in the now quoted place, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 16.] <hi>first</hi> unto the <hi>lust of the flesh,</hi> Matth. 4. 3: <hi>when the tempter came to him, he said, if thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread: secondly,</hi> unto <hi>the lust of the eyes,</hi> vers. 8. 9. <hi>Againe the Divell ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him up into an exceeding high mountaine, and sheweth him all the kingdomes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115026:181"/>

Thirdly,</hi> unto the <hi>pride of life;</hi> to purchase unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe renowne by his miraculous preservation in his fall from the temple, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. 6: <hi>then the Divell taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto him, if thou be the Son of God, cast thy selfe down; for it is written, He shall give his Angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they shall beare thee up, least at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone:</hi> none of these temptations could fasten on him; for, the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staticall union,</hi> the <hi>all-fullnesse of his grace, and the beatificall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> secured him from the danger of all temptations; and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the prevaling of them a thing utterly impossible.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> wee may from the causality and influence of lust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>it's obliquity:</hi> aganist Papists, Socinians, and Dr. <hi>Taylor:</hi> that 'tis not only a <hi>naturall</hi> but a <hi>morall</hi> disease of the soule; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>vitium,</hi> but <hi>peccatum:</hi> that which as a quality, or habit tempts, drawes, and entices unto sinne, conceiveth and bringeth forth sin, must needs be sinne; but lust doth all this; and therefore 'tis sinne: to wit; properly, and formally: The Minor is affirmed in <hi>terminis</hi> by the Apostle in the text; and, for confirmation of the Major, I shall lay openly three things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>testimony</hi> of our Saviour <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>vers.</hi> 17. 18: <hi>a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt tree bringeth forth evill fruit, a good tree cannot bring sorth evill fruit;</hi> but the fruit of lust is morally evill, it bringeth forth sinne; therefore 'tis a tree morally corrupt.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>second</hi> thing is that knowne <hi>Maxime</hi> in Logick: <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet vel formaliter vel eminenter;</hi> that which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cause of the obliquity and <hi>deformity</hi> of sinne, must needs have in it selfe that deformity or obliquity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>formally,</hi> or <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>;</hi> it must either have the same deformity, or obliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or else some deformity, or obliquity, which is more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent than that; but no deformity or obliquity can transcend that of sinne; and concupiscence is the <hi>principall</hi> cause of sinne, (whether <hi>efficient,</hi> or <hi>deficient</hi> it comes all to one) therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence containeth the obliquity or deformity of sinne <hi>formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> and consequently is <hi>formally a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Third</hi> particular, which I shall alleadge for confirmation of the Major is, <hi>the manner of lusts causality of,</hi> and influence upon sinne: it tempts, drawes, and enticeth unto sinne; not <hi>outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>


                        <pb n="332" facs="tcp:115026:182"/>
as an <hi>object;</hi> but <hi>inwardly,</hi> as a <hi>quality, or habit,</hi> it inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lineth unto sinne, as habits dispose unto their acts; now habits impart both their name, and nature unto their most accomplished, and compleat acts, concupiscence therfore communicates unto it's most consummate acts their nature, and name, and therefore hath (as they) both the name, and nature of sinne: <hi>Ames</hi> thus urgeth this argument against <hi>Bellarmine, Concupiscentia dicitur parere peccatum, eo modo quo interna animi rectitudo</hi> (<hi>quae est justitia) parit justitiam, id est, completum actum, de quo nomen, &amp; natura to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius motus; &amp; principii ejus usitate &amp; proprie maxime praedicatur,</hi> [Bell. enerv. tom. 4. pag. 36.]</p>
                     <p>From this there may be refuted three other points of popery: First, <hi>the absolute perfection of the good workes of the regenerate:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>their justification by them:</hi> And thirdly, <hi>their possibility of fulfilling the law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, <hi>the absolute perfection of the good workes of the regenerate,</hi> for concupiscence worketh in all the actions of man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (seeing 'tis a sinne) it distilleth sinfullnesse into the best of them, and rendreth them <hi>peccaminosa,</hi> though not <hi>peccata, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> though not <hi>sinnes: the flesh lusteth against the spirit, so that yee cannot doe the things that yee would,</hi> Gal. 5. 17: the good things that yee would so exactly or perfectly as yee desire.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we may hence conclude against <hi>justification by goood workes,</hi> at least in a <hi>meritorious way,</hi> for it so distaineth them, as that it disableth them to satisfy for the least sin against God, to merit the least good from God: and this may discover the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of a Christ for our justification, who was God as well as man, and in his man-hood had such an all-fullnesse of grace, as was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly exclusive of, and inconsistent with the least degrree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence: lust therefore did not, could not mingle with any of his actions, and sufferings, to impede the all-fullnesse of their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and merit.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we may hence inferre <hi>the impossibility of fullfilling the law in a legall way,</hi> for though we may keep it <hi>evangellically,</hi> in such a measure, as God, for Christs sake, will accept, yet concupiscence doth so immixe it selfe with all our actions, the very best of them, as that they must needs prove <hi>gradually defective,</hi> and come far short of that exactnesse and perfection which <hi>the law requireth:</hi> and so


<pb n="333" facs="tcp:115026:182"/>
consequently every man is a sinner, a transgressour of the law.</p>
                     <p>But to passe from <hi>speculative unto practicall</hi> uses:</p>
                     <p>The next use is <hi>of reprehension</hi> of all such as <hi>excuse,</hi> or extenuate their sins by discharging them upon the importunity, and violence of outward temptations, the text in hand teacheth us, that the principall cause, into which we are to resolve all the prevailing tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations unto sin, is our own lust: so that God may say to those that perish in their sinnes, as the Prophet unto Israel, <hi>Hosea</hi> 13. 9: <hi>thou hast destroyed thy selfe;</hi> it is thy owne concupiscence hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done thee, hath damn'd thee: oh Beloved! 'tis our own lust, that hath conceived, and brought forth all our sinnes 'tis this internall tempter in our hearts, that hath betrayed us unto all forreigne, and externall suggestions unto sinne, by opening the gate of our consent unto them, and therefore it would be injustice to lay our sins at any others doores: externall tempters are never <hi>totall,</hi> but only <hi>partiall</hi> causes of sinne, they doe never more than cooperate with that sinfull lust within us: <hi>the goodly Babylonish garment, the two hundred shekels of silver, and the wedge of gold of fifty shekels,</hi> had never enticed <hi>Achan</hi> unto sacriledge if he had not been also tempted by his own lust, <hi>the lust of the eyes,</hi> coveteousnesse: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had never by the beauty of <hi>Bathsheba</hi> been allured unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery with her, but that he was tempted by his own lust, <hi>the lust of the flesh:</hi> though <hi>Satan provoked him to number Israel,</hi> 1 Chron. 21. 1: yet he could never have drawne him thereunto, but that he was tempted by his own lust, <hi>the pride of life,</hi> ambition, and haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and hence was it, that he did not throw the blame upon Satan, but charged himselfe alone, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. <hi>Davids heart smote him, after that he had numbred the people: and David said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord I have sinned greatly in that I have done:</hi> when <hi>Scipio's</hi> invasion of <hi>Africa</hi> drew <hi>Hannibal</hi> out of Italy (it is said that) <hi>Hannibal</hi> brake out into this expression; it is not <hi>Scipio,</hi> but mine own country men <hi>Hanno,</hi> and his faction in the Senate of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that hath thwarted, and contradicted all my designes, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred my recruits, and supplies; 'tis he only that hath driven mee out of Italy: So every regenerate man may say, when he is drawn, or driven from his communion, and fellowship with the Allmigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it is not so much Satan, the world, evill company, the badnesle of times, or places in which I live, outward provocations, and


<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115026:183"/>
allurements, the infelicity of my condition, relations, and the like it is not so much these, the traitour in my heart; the flesh lusting against my better part, the spirit, hath tempted, and seduced me, hath drawne me from my God, and Saviour, and hath enticed me unto sinne.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, diverse <hi>exhortations</hi> may be infer'd from the causality and influence of our concupiscence: we may hence be exhorted unto; First, <hi>

                     <p>There will be a great deale of justice in our teares, for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all temptations, the mother of all sinnes: for that which tempteth, draweth, enticeth unto sinne, which conceiveth, and bringeth forth all sorts of sins: <hi>David</hi> therefore (in his peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Psalme, for murder, and adultery) had very good reason to spread before God this his birth sinne, because 'twas a seminall sinne, it contaiued the seeds of his adultery, and murder, <hi>Psal:</hi> 51. 5: hence also 'tis no wonder, that <hi>Paul,</hi> having mentioned the malignant operation of this law in his members, forthwith subjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a most bitter complaint touching his infelicity and misery thereby, and most passionately wisheth for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

giving man so depraved a nature, he cleareth God, by laying downe <hi>two conclusions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>First,</hi> concerning the state of man by creation, <hi>God made man upright.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>second,</hi> concerning the state of man by his apostacy, and defection from God; <hi>but they have sought out many inventions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Unto these two Conclusions he premiseth a preface; <hi>Lo this only have I found;</hi> wherein we have <hi>three things remarkable: First,</hi> the importance of these two conclusions; implyed in the note of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [<hi>Loe!] Secondly,</hi> the <hi>meanes,</hi> by which he came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them, diligent search, and study into the word, and will of God, [<hi>this have I found.] Thirdly,</hi> a <hi>comparison</hi> of them with other points, he found them [only.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First, here's</hi> the <hi>weight and importance</hi> of these two conclusions, implyed in the note of attention [<hi>Loe:</hi>] and the weight, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of them may be gather'd. <hi>First,</hi> from the <hi>influence</hi> of them upon practise; being well studyed, they will make us thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto God; humble in, and watchfull over our selves; charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto others, in admonishing of them, and praying for them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> from the <hi>pronenesse</hi> that is in men to justify themselves, and accuse God for the corruption of their natures: <hi>let no man</hi> (saith <hi>James) say, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God,</hi> James 1. 13: this prohibition implyeth, that men are apt to say, that they are tempted by God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> we have the <hi>meanes</hi> by which <hi>Solomon</hi> came to the knowledge of these two points; <hi>diligent search,</hi> and study into the word, and will of God: <hi>this have I found;</hi> to wit, by inquiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter divine revelations, the light of nature, and reason can never discover, that <hi>Adam</hi> was made upright. as the representative of all mankind; and that, his fall from this uprightnesse was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and derivable to all mankind: indeed the Lord of <hi>Plessie Marlie</hi> in his worke intituled the truenesse of Christian religion, <hi>chap</hi> 26, proveth, by naturall reasons; that man's nature is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that man is falne from his first originall, and for it also <hi>chap.</hi> 27: he alleadgeth the testimonyes of diverse antient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers: indeed, by the woefull <hi>effects,</hi> they had a <hi>confused know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of the <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> that there was a great confusion, and disorder in the soule of man; but <hi>first,</hi> however they knew it to be <hi>vitium,</hi> a


<pb n="348" facs="tcp:115026:190"/>
blemish, or infirmity of nature; yet doubtlesse the generality of them was ignorant that it was <hi>peccatum,</hi> a fault, or sinne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> reason, though never so much improved, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attaine unto so much as a glimmering of it's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the cause whence it came: it fared with them, as with <hi>Rebecca,</hi> Gen. 25. 22: <hi>two children strugled together within her wombe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> said, if it be so, why am I thus?</hi> so they, by dayly experience, find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appetices strugling within them; but they cannot ghesse at the cause of this unnaturall war; and therefore they say, as shee, if it be so, why are we thus? and unto this demand 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have any satisfying answer, unlesse they doe, as shee did in the close of the verse, <hi>shee went to inquire of the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This then may discover the true reason, why Papists, Socinians, and Arminians, have been at such a losse, touching originall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and originall sinne: they have not taken such a course, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> here; they have not gone to inquire of the Lord, they have consulted <hi>reason</hi> only, and not <hi>scripture,</hi> they have followed <hi>Aristotle,</hi> not <hi>Paul,</hi> for their guide.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we have a <hi>comparison</hi> of these conclusions, with other pointes of doctrine; shinted in the particle [only:] <hi>this only have I found;</hi> this, and nothing else. But sounds not this very strangely? was <hi>Solomon</hi> such a truant, such a sorry proficient in the study of divinity, as to know only two heads thereof, originall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and originall sinne? sure then he was not gifted, or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for the office of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> the Preacher, for he had been unable to <hi>declare all the counsell of God.</hi>

                     <p>

                        </gap> of my discourse, I need adde no more; but one thing I cannot but adde to <hi>Mr Jeanes,</hi> that is, since he instances in our B. Saviour, he must needs allow that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <salute>Sir,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I have received <hi>Dr Taylor</hi> his letter sent unto you, bearing date July 4th. What designe you had in concealing of it so long from me I cannot guesse. But if you had delivered it before I had sent you my objections, you would have eased me, and <hi>Dr Taylor</hi> of some trouble: for I should then have let alone these objections, and have only proved, that I did him no wrong, in charging him with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, against which these objections were directed; to wit, that no <hi>sinne is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall;</hi> that all sinne is <hi>essentiall, and intrinsicall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two things he layeth to my charge, <hi>want of care to understand him,</hi> and <hi>disingenuity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Want</hi> of care to understand him. [<hi>If he had been (he sayth) as carefull to understand as he was forward to object, and mistake, he had eas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d you, and me of this little trouble.</hi>] But if the Dr had been a man of that ingenuity, which you fame him for, he would have confessed his carelesnesse in expressing of himselfe, and not have charged me with want of care to understand, that to bee his meaning which I could not understand to bee his meaning without offering violence to his words: he propounds two propositions (without any thing, but a copulative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction interposed betweene them) And unto the last of these propositions he subjoyneth 6 reasons. Now what rule of Logicke obliged me to cary the 5 last of these reasons backwards, and to place them between the above mentioned propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I readily confesse my selfe to be utterly ignorant, and shall be very ready to sit downe at the Doctor's feet, and to learne any such rule of him. If the Dr must have such liberty allowed him to make such unexampled transpositions, he is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry formidable adversary, not to be coped with by mortall wights, who cannot guesse, how he will in an after game sever these reasons, that he hath first joyned together.</p>
                     <p>Logicke informeth me that secondly signifies a relation of order betwixt it selfe and firstly. But now if two reasons be related unto not one, but several conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, I would faine know why one should be the first, and the other the second reason.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:115026:201"/>
Besides here is a first reason, that hath no <hi>second reason</hi> following it, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto the same conclusion. There goeth a story of an <hi>Alderman in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> that upon the reading of some records touching something controverted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Town, and University, he brake out into this expression; unlesse we can prove <hi>King Henry</hi> the 8th to be before <hi>King Henry</hi> the seventh the University will have the better of us: But if we can make it good, that <hi>King Henry</hi> the 8th was before <hi>King Henry</hi> the 7th, then there is no doubt, but that we shall in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> have a full Conquest over the Schollars. I take this to be a fable: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> however give me leave to make application of it unto my present purpose. All the wrong, that the Dr can pretend, that I have done him, is because I did not place <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly</hi> before <hi>firstly,</hi> and if he can make it good, that I ought to have placed <hi>second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> before <hi>firstly,</hi> then I must needs confesse I have done him a great deale of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and shall be ready to aske his pardon; and unlesse such proofe can be made, he must lay the blame upon the Confusion, and disorder of his own discourse: But to goe on. The Dr tels us, that this clause [<hi>it is an effect, or condition of nature, but no sinne properly, is the lesse principall part of the proposition:</hi>] both clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses then, according unto him, make but one proposition; and this is a great fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling against that Logicke, which the learned have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> used; for by that, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> two clauses are not parts of one proposition, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> severall, intire, distinct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps he may say, that they make one compounded proposition.</p>
                     <p>Unto this I shall reply, 1. That a compounded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> consists ever of simple propositions. Now the last of these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> (to say nothing of the first) is a compounded proposition it selfe, for it is an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> proposition; and therefore, though these two clauses may make an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of severall propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, yet they can never concurre to the Composition of one.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If both clauses make one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> proposition, then it is a <hi>

                        </hi> proposition; because they are knit together by a copulative conjunction; Now a copulative proposition is not true, unlesse all parts be true; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> it is not proved to be true, unlesse all parts be proved to be true: Now the Doctor for the proofe of this pretended copulative proposition jumbleth together 6 rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons without any note of distinction to direct the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Againe, 2. The Dr hath told us, that it is the second part of the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position with the foregoing clause, and if so, then it cannot be inserted as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>If this be all; The Dr hath no reason to charge me with want of ingenuity in this particular; for I doe very weil perceive, that for him to meane, what I say, his words hold forth (for as for any secret, and reserved meaning, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with) had been the perfect destruction of all his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>There is one thing more, that the Dr add's concerning our blessed Saviour, that concupiscence taking it for those desires, which are purely naturall, and concrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is no sinne, because it was in Christ.</p>

You tell me, that your work in that very place, is to prove, That no sin is, or can be natural: Now I cannot finde any thing sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that way within forty lines of these words; and that it was my duty to look fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Coherence of them, I confess, I knew not. Another great mistake al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, it seems I have committed; in that I have not so high thoughts of you, as to think it impossible, or very unlikely, that you should be so uncautelous as to drop any contradiction unto your main intention: And this is an error that I can hardly shake off as yet; but I do assure you, that I shall endeavour to have as reverend an opinion of you as I possibly can; onely, I shall never exempt you from a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           <p n="1">1.

                           <p>Out of them they thus argue, whatsoever hath a successive duration, hath also a successive essence or being; but now no body hath a successive essence or being, therefore no body hath a successive duration.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. If the Apostle had said, as you say, he saith, there ought to be no farther controversie about the lawfulnesse of humane ceremonies; but that clause in assigning any rite or ceremony for the service of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] is an Apocryphal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of yours, without any colour from the Text it self, or from the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and therefore all you build upon it is but fancy and fiction: That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles decency cannot be observed without assigning such Rites and Ceremonies as you dispute for, you may dictate and boldly affirm, but can never with all your learning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p n="2">2. Whereas you tell us, 'tis evident that you mean not the frequent usage of that ceremony in opposition to the first usage of it: This evidence of your meaning you have not so much as attempted to prove; and if you shall for the future make such an attempt, it would, I am afraid, prove <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>. The cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of a thing (unlesse you can fasten upon it a sense or meaning never yet heard of) is opposed unto the first usage of that thing; for custome implyeth the frequent usage of a thing, and to say that the frequent usage of a thing is the first usage of it, is an evident repugnancy and an apparent contradiction, <hi>contradictio in adjecto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                              </gap>, and so not onely custome: And if so, then custome is a rule of decency also, and not only the law and light of nature, and where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                              </gap>, and not the light of nature is the rule, there the omission of that doth not necessarily inferre indecency. And of such decency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone it is evident that I spake, on the head of Uniformity (and could not speak sense, if I spake, either of any other, or of the generall notion of decency, which is competible to any other) and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

hath been customary over the world, that in a militia there should be some Banner, or Ensign, to which every one should resort, and fight under it. This hath custome made decent among all; and supposing that custome, the omission of it in an Army is indecent, yet not so, as things dishonest, or breaches of the Law of Nature are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. As our Christian course is a spiritual warfare, so unto this the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Christ Jesus are a more suitable <hi>Banner</hi> or <hi>Ensign,</hi> than any humane invention whatsoever: But you think that the Banner requisite in our spiritual warfare must be of humane invention, not divine institution; for otherwise you speak nothing to the purpose; and if the omission of such a Banner or Ensign be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, you may arraign Christ and his Apostles as guilty of undency.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The signe of the Crosse hath been a long time used by <hi>Antichrist,</hi> as an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> or <hi>Banner,</hi> and is it undecent to lay aside the <hi>Ensign</hi> or <hi>Banner</hi> of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. How little weight there is in the customary use of a <hi>Banner</hi> for the decency of the sign of the <hi>Crosse</hi> in <hi>Baptisme,</hi> will be apparent by these following consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. It is a custome in Armies for different companies or troupes to have <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> or <hi>Ensigns;</hi> but it was never the custome of any Armies for every severall souldier to carry a <hi>Banner</hi> or <hi>Ensign:</hi> from the custome of a <hi>Banner</hi> or <hi>Ensign</hi> then, how you can conclude for the signing of every singular Christian with the sign of the <hi>Crosse</hi> passeth my imagination.</item>
                           <item>2. The customary use of a Banner is in the whole war, and not onely at the first enrolement of Souldiers, and therefore if it prove any thing for the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Crosse,</hi> it will conclude for the frequent and constant use of it all the time of our warfare; and this I hope you will not plead for.</item>
                           <item>3. A <hi>permanent Crosse</hi> hath more proportion unto the <hi>Banners</hi> and <hi>Ensigns</hi> of Armies than the <hi>transient</hi> and <hi>aërial Crosse;</hi> and yet there be some of your party, who allow of the transient Crosse in Baptisme, that dislike permanent Crosses in Gods worship; because they think there is more danger of superstition in them: Now these men, in all probability, lay no great stresse upon this your resemblance of the sign of the <hi>Crosse</hi> to a <hi>Banner</hi> or <hi>Ensign,</hi> and my reason for this my conjecture (for I urge it onely as a conjecture) is, because they reject all <hi>permanent Crosses</hi> in <hi>Gods service,</hi> which doe more resemble a <hi>Banner</hi> or <hi>Ensign</hi> than a <hi>transient Cross.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>4. I have done my best to sound the depth and strength of your argument, and if I be not deceived, thus it stands: The omission of a Banner or Ensign, in our spiritual warfare, that was used by the Primitive Christians, is undecent; but the sign of the <hi>Crosse</hi> in <hi>Baptism</hi> was thus used by the Primitive Christians, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore omission of it is undecent.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>By Primitive Christians, I suppose you doe not mean the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or such <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical persons</hi> as were guided by an infallible spirit, and then I deny your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> and for this my denial I shall give you two reasons.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. In Christ our <hi>great Generall, the Captain of our salvation, were hidden all the treasures of wisdome and knowledge,</hi> and therefore he knew better what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in his worship, than all Primitive Christians, han all the Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils that ever were in the world; and therefore seeing there is such a deep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

                        <p>Whereas you say above, that <hi>Augustines</hi> words cannot be denyed to have truth in them, you mean these last quoted, as well as the former; and if this bee so, then it will be an easie matter for you to clear up by argument this undeniable truth that is in them. God commanded the Israelites to strike the lintel and the two side posts of the door with the blood of the Passeover; therefore all Christians are obliged to be signed in the forehead with the sign of the Crosse, sounds with me as a very wild and loose inference; and therefore I shall intreat you to confirm it, or else relinquish this place of <hi>Augustine,</hi> as containing nothing of an argument in it.</p>

                        <p>Your third Argument, The resemblance of the Surplice unto those Garments which in Scripture are mentioned for the like solemnities, long, shining, white Robes or Garments, I suppose you mean some of the holy Garments of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that were appointed for glory and for beauty, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 4. and then this reason may involve the Surplice in the guilt of Judaisme, rather than prove its decency. Hath God, think you, abrogated those mystical Garments that were of his owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <p>The Word and Sacraments doe sufficiently minde a Minister of his duty, and the light of them is so full and clear, like that of the Sun, as that it needs not the candle of a Surplice. This instruction of the Church by humane Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, is to teach her with a Fescue, to hide the light of the Gospel under a bush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and it is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>Some have concluded the Surplice to be decent, because the Angels appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>shining garments,</hi> Luk. 24. 4. <hi>in raiment white as snow,</hi> Mat. 28. 3. because the glorious Saints in heaven are <hi>

                        <p>Your fourth argument is, the constant usage of other Churches, besides this of ours, Eastern as well as Western, for many Centuries together.</p>
                        <p>But first, the not using the Surplice by Christ and his Apostles, and some Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures immediately following their times, is a saser prosident to imitate, than the usage of it in succeeding Centuries, which were not so pure and incorrupt as the Primitive time.</p>

If we may judge of the late Bishops zeal by their punishments, they shewed more zeal against the neglect of their Ceremonies, than against the omission of the weightiest matter of both the Law and Gospel; the most scandalous and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Ministers found more favour at their Tribunals, than such of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists as were renowned for parts and learning, and exemplary for perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal piety and diligence in their Ministerial function.</p>

                           <l>Therefore Custome cannot be the onely rule of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           <hi>Here before it can be defined, whether this be a regular Syllogisme, or no? It must bee demanded,</hi> quanta est minor, <hi>is the assumption universal or particular? If it be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, then either the conclusion must be particular also, or else 'tis a false Syllogisme. And if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> be particular, then it inferres no more, than that some undecent custome cannot be the onely rule of decency, which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But the Doctor, that the words, may give some countenance unto our Ceremonies, adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth upon a new interpretation of them.</p>
                        <p>The words <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <p>We may say as well as the Doctor, that the words <gap reason="foreign">

Let all things be done in order, then, is as much, as, let all things be done without consusion. And I hope confusion may be avoided in the worship of God without such Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as ours.</p>
                        <p>But we will for once suppose, though not grant, that the clear importance of the words, is that all be done in the Church according to custome and appointment. Yet the D. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>I am sensible that I have by this discourse provoked a very learned and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable adversary, but it is onely love of the truth that ingaged me in so unequal an incounter, and therefore I hope the D. will pardon and excuse my boldnes.

And my answer to this will conclude this whole debate.</p>
                        <p n="51">51. First then I acknowledge, that it is not here necessarily ordained by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> by Christ and his Apostles, as in what gesture publicke supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall be addrest, in what, lauds and hymnes, and confession of the faith, &amp;c. And yet the rule is given by them, that all shall be done according to appointment, and more over in other places, that obedience be paid to those superiors, which watch over our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p n="53">53.

                        <p>Here you explicate your meaning by <hi>first a concession.</hi> 2. <hi>By instances,</hi> and then you produce pretended arguments for the proof of the proposition which I say is incumbent on you to confirme.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. You lay down a concession, I acknowledge, that it is not here necessarily ordained by the Apostle, that all the Churches of God in succeeding ages should institute Ceremonies in worship <hi>&amp;c,</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. I cannot imagine to what purpose you lay down the grant, for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it, you still hold, that uniforme obedience is to be yeilded by the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of each respective Church unto such Ceremonies in Gods worship as have been, are, or shall be appointed or commanded by any Churches in the ages suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Apostles, and so still it will be incumbent upon you to prove, that custome and order are here taken in such a latitude, as that they include the customes and appointments of all the Churches of God in succeeding ages.</p>

                        <p>This pre supposed, I demand, whether you hold it here necessarily ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apostle, that all the Churche of God in succeeding Ages, should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>If you should say, that some, though not all, the Churches of God are obliged either to <hi>institute</hi> Ceremonies in Gods worship, or to <hi>appoint <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>In the beginning of the 52 Sect. you perplex the state of the Question, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancing in the circumstances of Gods worship, which are by the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists expresly excluded from the Question, for they limit it onely unto humane religious Ceremonies. Now betwixt these and the circumstances of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, there is a great, and very wide difference.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Circumstances of time, place, order, and decency, &amp;c. <hi>are necessary, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in generall;</hi> but humane religious Ceremonies are not <hi>

It is impossible for Gods worship to be performed without some circumstances, but it is very possible for Gods worship to bee celebrated without any humane reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Ceremonies.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Circumstances of Gods worship, <hi>viz.</hi> a sitting time and place, a decent Pew and Pulpit, a fair and handsome cloath for the Communion Table, are not Worship; but humane religious Ceremonies are in their nature Worship, as being instituted to lift up Gods honour immediately in their use and end.</p>

                        <p>But to come unto your own instances.</p>

Your first instance is in the gesture, in which publick prayer is to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>But this instance is very impertinent: for</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This is in the general necessary, so that it is utterly impossible for Prayer to be put up, but in some gesture or other; but the Ceremonies which Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists oppose, are meere humane inventions, and so unnecessary in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We have, for the particular gesture in Prayer, sufficient warrant and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the light of Nature and Scripture, without any humane institution: But we have no direction in Scripture for particular humane Ceremonies: This is very well set down in <hi>Ames</hi> disp. about Ceremon. pag. 139. pag. 151. <hi>No <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>But now to prevent as much as may bee the multiplying of needlesse Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies betwixt us, I shall acknowledge that a Church may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> the usage of any reverent, lowly, submissive gesture in publique supplications, when there is conveniencie for the usage thereof.</p>
                        <p>But yet it will not hereupon follow, that all things are to be done in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures of publique Prayer according unto the Churches appointment; for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Church should prohibit in publique Prayers the gestures of kneeling, lifting up the eyes and the hands to heaven, I should conclude such an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Church whatsoever to be unlawfull, because contrary unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse direction of Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Your second instance is impertinent too, for the gestures of Lauds, Hymnes and Confessions of the Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a matter of meer decency, and how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> matters of meere decency are from the Ceremonies in question, I have declared a little before, I shall therefore now onely adde these three things.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. That a rational man may by meer light of Nature, without any institution, easily gather, what gesture is fitting, decent and agreeable unto these actions.</item>
                           <item>2. That notwithstanding this, the Governours or Officers of a Church may appoint in these actions any decent gesture or posture of the body, provided that by speciall institution they doe not put upon it any mysticall signification, and thereby make it a Worship.</item>
                           <item>3. That from this grant it can never be inferred, that in those gestures which are to bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                              </gap> according to the appointment of Church Governours: and my reason is, because it is possible, that Church Governours may bee so irrational, as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point here undecent gestures, as that the people should lye along on their faces in singing of Psalmes of Praise, and in Confession of the Faith. Now an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent gesture would be finfull, because against the Apostles prescription, <hi>Let all things be done decently.</hi>

                        <p>In the last place proceed we unto those arguments, if I may so call them, which you have for confirmation of the proposition, which I say is incumbent on you to prove: If you have for this any arguments in this your discourse, they are, as I conceive, these three.</p>

                        <p>Unto these two places, the conformists answer by distinguishing of the parts, and the Ceremonies of Gods worship; it is unlawful, say they, to adde unto the parts of Gods worship instituted by God, but 'tis lawful to adde unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

That this cannot be rendred possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either by the grace of union with the Diely, nor by any other possible meanes, as he at large excellently deduceth it, <hi>pag. 300, 301, 302, 3.</hi> That it may peradventure be well enough granted in some sense, and after a sort, that Christ is every where present, as man, <hi>viz.</hi> 1.

I am so charitable as to think, that Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath so much of Christianity, so much of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, of a Scholar, of a Gentleman in him, as not to accept, or approve of this <hi>Thrasouical</hi> and <hi>Vain-glorious</hi> Second. And if the Doctor disowne him, I might passe him by with silence, and a just neglect. But if the Doctor shall judge, that 'tis but justice, to chastise with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, calumnies, and reproaches, so contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a person, as my self, for daring to diffent from him, and to represent the reasons of my said dissent, though in a calme and modest way: I shall then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale unto all the world how unagreeable this is unto that humility and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, for which the Doctor is generally famed. To irritate the Doctor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, this Libeller tels him, that I have publiquely bragged, that I have made him a Dunce. But I professe, that this is a grosse, and most unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy untruth; and he can bring no witnesses for it, but Knights of the Post. With the like falshood, disingenuity, and malice, he pretends, page 96. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that I contumeliously undervalue the Doctors Critical Learning, and make him to be but a petty Grammaticaster, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hereupon he spends near five pages, in an Apology for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in general, and the Doctor in particular. And what I pray is the ground of this terrible accusation? Why (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>) I said, I <hi>am very loath to enter into a contest with so great a Critick, about the meaning of a word.</hi> Hereupon he inferres, that I make the Doctor to be but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>;</hi> and hereupon he is termed, <hi>Thomistarum princeps.</hi> Notwithstanding then this Gentleman makes such frequent Musters of the Names of the School-men, as if he were <hi>Nomenclator</hi> to them, it is unto me very probable, that this is his first considerable voyage that he ever made into them; and that now too he hath travelled in them but by the Index. Three great advantages this our Libeller <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> against me: First, his <hi>Billings-gate</hi> Rhetorick, by which, 'tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> improbable, he hoped to tempt me into such an outrageous fury, as his zeal for Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> hath transported him with. But unto this I shal return nothing, but my pitty and prayers, that God would pardon, and heal this his distemper. The second is, the concealment of his Name, for by this he hazards no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; his pretence for it is, that I might not run into personal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. How lyable he is to personal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, I know not: But let him be never so obnoxious, he may be secure, and need not fear any such usage from me: For 'tis that which I shall studiously decline in all contests whatsoever, though my Antagouist should be a Papist, a Turk, a Pelagian, or a Socinian; for I know that personal invectives will betray the best cause unto jealousies and suspicions. And besides, a man cannot throw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and dung in anothers mans face, but some of it will slick to his own fingers. A third artifice that he hath, is the swelling of his Book into so large a volume, as that may either wholly prevent, or much delay all Replication. My Refutation was printed about three years since in 40. pages, and his Defence is now come forth in 644. pages. Unto this tediousnesse I shall apply what Bishop <hi>Hall</hi> speaks of his Popish Opponent; <hi>Should</hi> I <hi>follow him in this proportion, He might expect an Answer in</hi> Tostatus hides, <hi>whose first words should be,</hi> Quis legit haec? <hi>Or if my patience would delay my Reply to the just paces of his Answer, this Volume of his would perhaps be vanished into Grocers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But this doubt would soon vanish, if men would heed the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations that are usually given of it.</p>
            <p>The first is, that there is not such a <hi>medium</hi> of participation betwixt privative opposites, as there is in <hi>

            <p>A second you have in <hi>Scheibler</hi> in his Topicks, c. 20. n. 72. having quoted a saying out of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that <hi>non datur</hi>
