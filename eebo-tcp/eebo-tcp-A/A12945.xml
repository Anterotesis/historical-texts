            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which dayly to the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of al your serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes &amp; subiectes, your highnes
declareth openly, I wolde neuer haue vsed such
boldnes and audacite, as to exhibyte and present
this my rude writynge, vnto your gracis mooste

haue doubted with my selfe, whether hit shulde
pertayne vnto me, other by worde or by writyng,
to touche any suche matters of weyght and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyte.
For as on the one syde, many thynges mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
me' to kepe silence, consyderynge myn own
state, condition, and degre, and how late I was
admytted to the seruyce of youre maiestye, and
howe lyttell experte I am in matters of polycie:
so on the other syde, dyuers thynges styrred me,
to open myne affecte and pourpose, vnto your

your great and synguler humanyte, wherin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge

in controuersy here amonge vs: In the redresse
and due order wherof (as I thynke) stondeth the
chiefe poynte of all pryncely honour, and nother
in abundance of golde, syluer, nor tresure, nor yet
in any worldly power, but euen as the honour of
god, as moche as is set forth to mans iugement,
consysteth and stondethe in the dewe order of all
this sensible worlde, whiche with our eies dayly
we beholde, so the tre we honour of all princis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

of their commynalties, by the prouidence of god
to their gouernaunce commytted, to this ende &amp;
purpose, that all theyr subiectes in concorde and
vnyte may inioye suche quietnes and felicite, as
they are broughte forth vnto, by the goodnes of
god and nature: so that this beinge mouyd, and

as sone as I entred into my countrey, after
my long absence and peregrination, obseruyng
suche disobedience and diuersitie of opinion, as
here amonge your subiectes was growynge in
by corrupte iugement, to great confusion, and
<pb facs="tcp:4815:2"/>
to the great breche of christian vnitie, while your

lay &amp; stablyshe certayn grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des &amp; fundations, to
the restoryng of very, true, and christen vnite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
necessary. wherfore sone after I began with
my self to reson of certayn causes &amp; occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, out
of the which chiefely as it appered to me, sprang
all this controuersie &amp; disobedience lately shewid
here among vs: and somwhat to consyder I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
also the manner &amp; mean howe al suche discord
and diuersitie of opinion vtterly put awaye, we
myght as membres of one body, being couplyd
togyther, and knytte agayne in vnitie, runne in
one course and after one fascion: the whiche dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and reasonyng, bycause I lacked co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
to open to your grace presently, I gathered in
writyng, &amp; so presented it vnto your maiestie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
therby myn opinion, and by what meane
we all your subiectes with mekenes &amp; humilite,
lyuyng togyther in due obedience, myght restore
and conserue this christen vnitie. This was my
purpose, only in no poynt thinkyng than to haue
my sentence and writyng abrode publyshed. And
though it be so, that for the moste part suche men
as be in hart most desirous, to haue their writin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
set abrode to the face of the worlde, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly
vse this kynde of excuse, coueringe their affecte &amp;
studi of glory with one honest pretext of sobrenes
and humilitie, to say they wrote eyther for theyr
owne exercyse secretly, or for the priuate pleasure
<pb facs="tcp:4815:3"/>
of their frende onely, wherby they auoyde and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewe
al note and suspition of pride &amp; arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy:
yet to your highnes most noble prince, this may
I say truly, and without al colour affirm playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that at suche tyme as I presc<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted this my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vnto your grace at winchester in so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer last
past, I though nothynge lesse, than to publyshe
it to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon iugement, though in euery mans
mynde the thinge to be fyxed I desired hartely:
but I thought plainly, partly for bicause I iuge
not my writynge to be of that sorte, which are to
be set out to lyghte, and partely bycause I se the
world al redy with ouer many bokes and writin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
troubled dangerously, wherby though moch
knowledge of the truth be opened &amp; broughte to
lyght, yet by lacke of discretion, and by moch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy,
there is growen in withall in Christis
church a gret brake of christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charite: I thought
I say playnly, &amp; to me it appered sufficiente, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
concernyng suche matters of weight and
grauitie, to your hyghnes only by my writinge

which I haue long noryshed in my hart to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rue
your grace withal, in some part therby to testifie.
For syth the tyme y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I haue had any reson &amp; iuge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to consider the end, to the which al true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes
ought to referre all their actes &amp; dedes, I
haue euer fashioned my studyes after suche ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that I might therby according to my bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:4815:3"/>
to the which stirred &amp; moued I am now mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
by the time, wherin I trust to se, by your high
wisedom &amp; policy, of al such abusion, as by ꝓcesse
of time is growen in to our church and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>grega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a holsom, quiet, &amp; iust reformation: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
though the begi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning hath be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> somwhat rough

So y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> as wel for the steying of the one part of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

by lyghtnes of iugeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which might bring in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vs moche confusion, I wrote this thinge,
declaringe therby vnto your highenes, what I

I shall mooste Christen reders, here in this
prologue, open vnto you a lyttel more at large,
what is the nature of this obedience and vnitie,
to the whiche we be so straytly bounde bothe by
goddis lawe and all good ciuilitie: and touche
also somwhat the cause whiche hath chiefly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
me to the conceyuynge of this mattier and
purpose. But here in the begynnynge to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
the thyng may the better be perceyued, I do
you require a lyttelle to lyfte vp your eies with
som consideration, to wey with your selfe in som
part the diuine power, wysedome, &amp; prouidence,
thoughe the thynge fully to conceyue farre sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth
all mannes witte and imagination.
And fyrst this is open and manifest,<note place="margin">The prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of god.</note> that al this
sensible worlde, wherin is conteyned this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
varietie and nature of thingis,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> is nothing
els but as a certayne shadowe of goddis good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and diuinitie, or rather a glasse of the diuine
maiestie, wherby to mans iudgement and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
is opened, the infinite power,<note place="margin">Psa. 18.</note> and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:4815:6"/>
wisedome of hym, who by his hyghe prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
gouerneth and ruleth all. For whither so
euer you cast your eies, other aboue vnto heuen,
there beholdynge that heuenly body in his syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie,
other here benethe vnto the erthe, there
considerynge of nature the wonderfull varietie,
you shall euer see, of that power and prouidence
in euery thinge mooste certayne argumente and
sure testimony. Wherof I thynke no man canne
doubte, who wyth any consyderation, lokynge
into this glasse, there standeth in meruayle and
admyration. For fyrst there shall he see the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyte
nombre &amp; multitude of sterres euer kepyng
their certayn course and mouyng without al in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stabilitie,
there shal he se the son, the mone, with
all the other planettes waueryng abrode, nowe
to this parte of the worlde, nowe to the other,
to the comforte and creation of all mortal thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
subiecte to corruption: there shall he see the
wonderful vertue and influence of the same, by
the whiche as by chiefe instrumentes the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of god worketh al thinges. Here in the lower
worlde garnyshyng it with this varietie, wherin
standeth all naturall beautie. ye, &amp; yet ferther, yf
he into this glasse diligently loke, there shall he
see, of the foure elementes, of the fyre, the ayre,
the water, and of the erthe, the mooste meruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
nature, so knytte by dewe proportion in a
certaine equalitie, that though they be by nature
mooste dyuers and full of contrarietie, yet they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4815:6"/>
are cowpled and ioyned togyther, as it were in
a natural concorde and vnitie: there shall he see
the erth, as foundation and ground, susteyning
the reste, hangynge in the myddes after a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
maner, and about the same the see conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
rollynge, with his certayne and sure eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bynge
and flowynge after a strange fashion, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
to mans wytte no smal cause of meruayle
and great admyration: and fynally to say, there
shall he see of all beastes, fyshes, and fowles, the
meruaylous nature and propretie, by the which
all, the diuine power spredeth her goodnes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng
to the nature of thinges and their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie:
so that to hym who so euer into this glasse
diligently dothe loke, may remayne no doubt of
this heuenly wysedome and prouydence, wherof
in euery thinge here in this worlde sette forth to
goodis honour and glorye, appereth so sure toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and so certayne signe, for in euery thyng shyneth
the image therof, euery thing here is a glasse of
the same. And to me this thinge, considerynge &amp;
reasonynge with my selfe of the goodnes of god
and of his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, though the thinges before
touched mynister therof sure profe and sufficient
argument, yet it appereth, that nothynge more
clerely declareth the same, than mans actis and
fashion of lyuynge here in policie, all be it many
men haue taken thereby greate argument to the
contrary, in so moche, that whan they haue sene
many men longe to contynue in worldly ioy and
<pb facs="tcp:4815:7"/>
prosperitie, whome they haue iudged most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of al aduersitie: and contrary, other of great

sene, they haue playnly thought, no prouidence
to be nor gouernance of god, but all to be lefte to
mans wyl and tyranny: To the whiche opinion
they slypped, for lacke of iugement and good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

fynde moste manifestly, and by reasone shall be
constrayned playnly to confesse, that this highe
prouydence is not onely declared by suche dedes
and actes of man, as appere to the worlde to be
good and vertuous, but also moche more by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whiche seme pestilent and pernicious, and
to all vertue contrarye. For this semeth to be a
certayne truthe and sure, that euen lyke as god
by his infinite goodnes, these erthequakes and
general fluddes, by the whiche many cities and
hole nations oft tymes be ouerflowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and sonke,
euer tourneth to the good order of the reste, and
conseruation of the holle in a naturall tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite:
so vice reygning in mans lyfe for a tyme, ye
open warre and sedition, his goodnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerteth
to the settyng forthe of vertue and to his honour
and glory. For such is the nature of that infinite
goodnes, that nothinge it wyll suffre vtterly to
be yll, but out of al imperfection and vicious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes,
or more truly to say, vicious defectes, his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4815:7"/>
goodnes pyketh out euer some good. As by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
this thinge to declare, this dyuelyshe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the dyuell, who aboue al other thinges is
moste pestilent and pernicious, the goodnes of
god vseth to good, as to driue man by fere at the
lest to flee from synne and wretchednes, and his
crueltie and malyce he vseth also to declare his
iustyce and ryghtwysenes, as by the miserye of
vice he driueth man oft to the loue of vertue, and
to conceyue the felicitie therof: lyke as he dothe
many tymes, by sycknes of body and aduersitie,
brynge man to helth and prosperitie, and by the
tyranny and wretchednes therof, he induceth ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to perceyue the nature of good polycie, and of al
quietnes and tranquillitie restynge in the same.
Euen lyke as by blynde and folyshe superstition
he styreth ofte tymes man to folowe syncere and
trewe religyon. And thus all thyng, whiche ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth
in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s lyfe to be playn yll, &amp; viciouse, his
infinite goodnes turneth to good: and out of all
thing he pyketh som good.<note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> For if there were any
thing which by nature were yl, than were not he
infinyte goodnes, the which without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can suffre no ylle. Wherfore playnely to saye
euen as I thynke, these thynges whiche to the
worlde, and to the common iugement of manne
seme ylle and moste pestylent, of the goodnes of
god, and of his highe prouidence, minister vnto
men most sure argument. The whiche thyng I
haue here nowe touched to this purpose &amp; ende,
<pb facs="tcp:4815:8"/>
that where as many men nowe adayes, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
the state of the Christen polycie vexed with
so moche sedition and heresie, feare moche to see
shortly therof great ruine and decaye, I wolde
haue them to alter that opinion: And to stande
fully in this perswasion, that this diuysion by
sectes and contrary opinion, reignynge amonge
christen nations, the goodnes of god shall turne
to his honour and glorie, and to the setting forth
of his true religion, the whiche longe and many
a day hath ben by simple superstition moche ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured
and hydde: ye and though it were so that
in folyshely fleinge this superstition, we shuld a
whyle slyppe into the contrary, that is to say, the
contempte of religion, yet I doubte not but the
goodnes of god in tyme conuenient, wolde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
vs at the laste to the meane, and bring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
lyght the knowlege of his true religion, as he
hath done in al tymes from the beginning of the
world vnto this day, by lyttel and lytell euer dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng
mans wekenes to the true waye. And this
maner with vs I dout not but that his goodnes
wyll vse nowe in these dayes, and so inspire and
gyue lyght to the hartis of his christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flock, that
they all with concorde and vnitie shal to his wyl
be obedient moste mekely. This hope and truste
I haue fyxed in my harte, wherwith I moche
comforte my selfe. And though there be here in
our nation growynge in, a certayne diuision, by
corrupt iugement and false opynion, yet I trust
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4815:8"/>
we shall not so farre slyppe from gooddis proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that it may take among vs any such rote,
whereby shall sprynge any sedition, or of good
and ciuile order any ruine or distruction: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
if we as membres of one body, runne all
togyther after one fashion, I trust at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it shall minister a great occasion, to the setting
forthe of Christis trewe religion. For the which
cause nowe, I haue conceyued this lyttel instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
exhortynge our people to vnitie and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
the lacke wherof in the state of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
hath bene a great cause of moche diuision,
and specially in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey of Germany, where
as by the folyshe auoydyng of superstition they
haue slipped into greatte discorde and sedition,
whose example I trust shall be to vs a spectacle,
ministringe vnto vs no small instruction, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if we consyder groundly the cause and fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all their controuersie and sedition, the
whiche doutles, rose of thinges in no poynt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s saluation, but about ceremonies
and traditions, to the which many men blynded
by superstition, leaned none other wyse, thanne
to Christis worde and gospel, they dydde not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne
with ryght iugement, betwixt thinges of
themself good &amp; necessary, &amp; other, which ar only
for the time conuenient to a certayne policie, but
all thinges of longe tyme receyued, by custome,
&amp; generall decree, some of them toke as goodis
lawe indifferently, &amp; som all turned vp so downe
<pb facs="tcp:4815:9"/>
vndiscretely. Wherfore suche persons as by the
examination of them to goddis worde, founde
therin moche abusion, fyrste the reste coude not
well beare, but noted them of herisie, and as mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uers
of sedition: by the reson wherof, sprange y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
great diuision, wherby the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey was deuided
into many &amp; dyuers sectes, but now by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of god eche one spyeng the foly of other,
they begynne to fall vnto the meane, that is to
say to Christis true religion, gyuinge to goddis
worde the full authoritie, that preachinge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
abrogation. And as for ceremonies and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
they suffre as thynges conueniente to
maynteyne vnitie, where as they repugne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to goddis worde, nor to good ciuilitie: the
which thyng if they had done at the begynning,
they shulde not by their blyndnes haue fallen to
suche confusion, nor by their folyshe correction
of the abuses of the churche haue brought in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
a diuision. Howe be it I doubt not, but that
the prouidence of god hath suffered this thinge
for the institution of other, for we may as I ofte
reherse, take example of that foly, and runne to
gyther in one course with obedience and vnitie,
the whiche if we do, we shall doubtles shortly se
the prouidence of god, so worke, that out of our
church &amp; congregation, we shal se plucked vp al
superstitious abusions: as contrary, if we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
in our corrupt iugement and lately growen

directed to the people this rude instruction, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge

            <p>¶Wherin brefely to say, this you shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande,
that obedience in all tymes,<note place="margin">The nature of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> and with all

be vtterly abrogate and boldely disobeyed with

not be suffred in christen ciuilitie: But contrary,
what so euer is decreed in any policie, nothynge

to that euer obedience is required, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

bycause it was of wise men and politike brought

and a great token of infidelitie and of dystruste
in the goodnes of god, who hath promysed to al

when so euer &amp; where so euer with faythful

that princis in euery nation dyd receyue and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyshe

<pb facs="tcp:4815:14"/>

by the which such thinges as were conceyued
in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel generall, were authorised &amp; confyrmed.
Wherfore to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare these authorities to gyther,
with boute of preemyne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the same, it is small

Wherfore this foloweth surely, that the same au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thoritie

For suche thinges are but counsels in dede,
and bynde no man, tyll they be by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
receyued, the whiche euer by the same maye
be also dissolued, and specially touchynge suche
thynges that are indifferente, the whiche at the

            <p>Howe be hit in the fyrste begynnynge this you

taketh fro me in a maner al swetenes of lyfe, the
grefe wherof is greatter than I can expresse, and
the cause why brefely I shal by your pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, first

my purpose: I haue all my lyfe hitherto, for the
moste part, gyuen my self to the study of letters,
occupienge my selfe in dyuers kyndes therof,
both in secular studies and in holy scripture, but
euer referrynge all my labour and peynes to the

This was the thynge that made all my labours
euer to seme lyght: and this hope was euer the
chiefe comforte of my mynde: for borne we be al,
and brought forth of nature, not only to lyue as
brute beastes do, seruynge the bodye, but suche
gyftes of mynde, as god of his mere goodnesse
hath gyuen vnto vs,<note place="margin">Galat, 6.</note> to employe echeone to the

profyte of other, and so to lyue in perfyte ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
This ende I euer loked vnto: This was the
chiefe comforte I hadde in this worlde, and as
me seemeth no smalle comforte to anye honeste
mynde. But nowe frendes sythen I am lately
out of Italy, where as I haue bene many yeres

and haue taken somme experience of your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

depriued of this comforte, I am almoste putte

obserued to reigne amonge you, suche diuision,
suche discorde of myndes, that foly hit were for
me, amonge suche troubled hartes to conceyue
opinion to inioye this, moste desyred of all men,
that is, quietnes and tranquillitie: in so moche
that if it were not for the greatte goodnesse and
hygh wysedome of our moste noble prince, who
nothynge more tendereth in erthe, than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
of this vnitie, ye and if it were not for

I shulde vtterly be putte in dispayre, and shuld

opinyon, and Christen ciuylitie: the whiche
both so manifestly reigne in our hartis, that this
thynge to declare by longe processe &amp; many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

to al honest hartes greuous and sorowful, of the

without great sorowe: for a sorowfull case it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
to me to see suche men, so notable, bothe of
vertue and lernynge, as by common fame, some
of them were reported to be, whiche lately haue
suffred, so sturdely to stycke in a manyfest super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
that rather they shulde chose to lose theyr
lyues, than to be remoued frome their opinion,
wherin they stode so styffely, vnder the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of true religion: For it appered to them to
pertayne to the religion of Christe, by necessitie
the byshop of Rome amonge al christen nations,
to haue suche superioritie, as of many yeres he
hathe, abusynge their pacience, vsurped vppon
them: In the defence wherof, as it had ben an
article of the fayth, they boldly, with more paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
than wysedome, suffred their deth, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
thinge in dede as hereafter shall appere, is a
playne and manyfest superstition, and spryngeth
out of superstitious blyndnes, bryngynge forth
pernicious and sturdy obstinacy, with disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to princely authoritie, and to lawes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysed

the obedience wherof, we are bounden by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes

in the harte of man, by ouermoche feare
of the transgression of the commaundement of

vs to iudge that thynge, to pertayne to

As by example, some of vs are so supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
that if they here not .iii. masses euery day

And some if they crosse not them selfes at sainct

religion. For many men consideringe the
dangers abrode in the worlde, ministred to them

selfes their owne fraylnes and imbecillitie, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by
they perceyued they coulde not resist the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

&amp; solitarie places, auoydyng the worldly

to the pourpose, nowe after that by these
few wordes, somwhat I thinke you do perceiue,
what is true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and what superstition, and
wherin they differre. For as true religion is the
<pb facs="tcp:4815:26"/>
honour of god, with reuerent fere of disobeying
of his preceptes, so superstition is a scrupulous
honour myngled with ouermoche and seruyle
feare, with meruaylous disquieting of the weke
conscience &amp; blynde, the whiche by corrupt iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
taketh suche thynge to pertayne of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to the honour of god, which in dede nothyng
so doth, but hangeth onely vpon mans consent:
so that by this I saye nowe you shall be induced
playnly to confesse, moch blynde superstition to
reigne in your hartes, as I shall nowe partely
note. For all sortes and kyndes of superstition,
here to prosecute, shuld be ouerlonge, &amp; nothinge
necessarie to my purpose: sufficient it shalbe som
to descrybe, the reste leauyng to your owne exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p>And fyrst thinke not you, that like as there hath
bene some to the great sorowe of honest myndes,
which lately blynded by superstition, haue iuged
the vnitie of Christis churche, vtterly to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
by pluckynge frome the pope, his vsurped
power ouer vs and superioritie? so there be some
other of no lesse blyndnes, whych if the organes
shoulde be plucked oute of the churche, and the
curyous syngynge tempered and broughte to a
conuenyente meane, ye or yf the prayers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
sayde amonge vs in temples in a strange
tongue, of the people not vnderstonde, shoulde
openly be rehersed in the mother tongue, to the
entente that the affecte of the harte myght ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4815:26"/>
rather be styrred, to the trewe honour of god,
whiche I say wolde lykewyse iuge with no lesse
superstition, Christes relygion vtterly to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
tourned. And further if to priestes the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of goddis worde, libertye were graunted
by common authoritie, to marye and take wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
for the auoydynge of Fornycation, wolde
they not thynke, that christian purytie were vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
than extincte? ye and if the holy dayes and
masses also celebrat vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same, were brought
to lesse nombre, than wolde they say, Christ were
vtterly driuen awaye. And yet ferther yf mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steryes
shoulde be mynisshed, and of theym the
foundations altered, ye thoughe it were to the
hygh settynge forwarde of vertue and lernynge,
yet wolde many of you thinke, Christis relygion
vtterly therby to peryshe. Suche is our blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
suche is our foly. And what trow you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
the sacramentes, that many of vs haue not
also of them very folyshe &amp; superstitious opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
lokynge onely to the outwarde sygne and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
nothynge consyderynge the inwarde and
heuenly mysterie? Be there not som amonge vs
thynke you, that wold iuge their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to be
wel baptised and christened, if they were not dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in the fount quite ouer the heed, wherby the
childe oft tymes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyueth his deth? &amp; yet this is
but a rite &amp; a custome, diuersely vsed amonge di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; nothing ꝑteining to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> substance of
the sacrament. Be there not som also, the whiche
<pb facs="tcp:4815:27"/>
yf their frende were sycke, and in daungier of
lyfe, and so at the laste taken by dethe, before the
priest coulde aryue to minister to him, the hoste,
and extreme vnction, wolde playnly thinke and
iudge that he shuld die a damned sowle, and sore
lament therfore, the departure of their frende, as
though in suche a case, the wyl and purpose were
not sufficient. Be there not also some, the which
in confession, if for lacke of memorie or a lyttell
negligence, they dydde not recyte all their dedes
with the circumstance of the same, wold plainly
iudge, voyde the absolution? Yes vndoubtedly.
Of this sort among vs there be dyuers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
whiche by manyfolde superstition, haue their
iudgementes so corrupte, that al be it that by the
power of princis and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon authorite, the abuse
of suche thinges, wherto they haue ben long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed,
shuld be reformed &amp; brought to better
frame, yet in their hartes and myndes they wold
not wel beare it, but styl against suche alteration
and refourmyng to true religion, wold murmur
and grudge, moued by their blynd superstiiton:
suche is their madnesse &amp; grosse opinion, they do
not well ponder and wey, the nature of politike
thinges and indifferent, whiche be of this sorte,
that in processe of tyme by littell and littell euer
grow to iniuste extremitie, in so moch that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
they require prudent reformation: ayenst
the which they sturdely armed with superstition,
euer repugne, bicause they lack right iugement,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4815:27"/>
to discerne betwixt thynges worldly &amp; politike,
and thinges whiche hange of the necessite of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of the scripture and gospell of god, the
whiche thinges contrary to the other, whiche by
nature be indifferent, neuer admyt chaunge nor

as hereafter in his place more playnly I shal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
But nowe I thinke dere frendes, in some
part, by this whiche I haue said, our blyndnesse
and vayne superstition, whiche thus reygnethe
in our hartis, is open vnto vs, in so moche that
hereby you may perauenture be styrred, to fynde
by diligent examination of your owne conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
manye other sortes of this superstition, the
whiche all to correcke and amende, lette vs not
cesse continually to pray to him, who is only au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

in vs no lesse thanne dothe this, and with
more hyndrance to all good order and ciuilitie.
For yet better it is, blynded with superstition, to
admyt suche thinges to be of the law of god, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che be not in dede, than by arrogant blyndnes, to
derogate the authoritie therof, and so bringe in

only to the preferrement and encrease of vertue

by common lawe and generall counsell in
euery congregation. This can not be denyed of
any man, whiche with indifferency, and syncere
mynde, nothinge blynded with affection, weyeth
thinges as they be in their owne nature. But
somme of vs blinded with suche perswasion, yet
procede ferther, and plainly do affirme, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis
to haue possession, is vtterly ageinst Christis
doctrine, and his true religion, litell considering
howe that to receiue the gift and benefite of any
man, giuen with charitie, nothinge repugneth
to Christis doctrine, nor to his simplicitie: and
howe that al suche donation &amp; gift was brought
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4815:33"/>
in, and stablyshed, by men of perfyte charitie, to
this purpose that byshoppes, pristes, and al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
shuld holly being intent to the preching
of goddis worde, therby be maynteined in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and tranquillite. This they consider not, but
lokynge to the abuse, wherof doubtles is greate
nede of reformation, &amp; therwith blynded, blindly
do ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation of the thing without
reason and iugement. For this is a certain truth
and sure, that the perfection of Christis religion
resteth not so moch in the refuse of all possession,
and wylfull pouertie, as it dothe in the streight
vse of these worldly thynges, with perfyte cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
Ye and though in the begynnynge the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of Christis worde, were poore and had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge,
whiche was conueniente to that tyme,
whan mankynd was vtterly drowned in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vanitie, yet now in this age, after the stablyng
of Christis religion so longe and many yeres, I
see no cause why, suche pouertie shoulde be soo
necessary, and that possession shulde be soo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to christen perfection. Wherfore this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
bredeth in our hartes a corrupt iugeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
and a pestilent diuision, by the whiche somme of
vs are slypped to a more corrupt and pernicious
grounde, whiche is to flee the order of generalle
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel, and of al interpretation of scripture there
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly receiued. For to this succedeth in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the ruine of scripture it selfe, the authoritie
wherof declared to man comonly, hangeth moch
<pb facs="tcp:4815:34"/>
vpon generall counsell. For though the truth of
goddis worde dependethe nothynge vppon the
iugement of man, yet the declaration therof, to
the face of the worlde, hangeth moche theron: in
so moche that these whiche we haue and take to
be the true gospelles, and to conteyne the veray
doctrine of Christ, we knowe not surely so to do,
but onely by feyth and confidence that we gyue
to the definition of generall counsell and conse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of the same: In so moche that if dyuers nations
shulde dissente in the groundes of scripture,<note place="margin">

in the interpretation therof, refuge shoulde we
haue none conuenient to chrystian policie, and
mete to conserue the polyticall vnitie, yf frome
generalle counsayle we shoulde take awaye all
order and direction, and to that gyue no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
at all. This therfore to iudge is playne ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancye,
and the streyghte waye and certayne
to brynge all to vncertayntie: so that boldely I
dare affyrme, that this perswasyon, hathe sette
in many of vs, of many thynges corrupte opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon.
And thus, whatte by superstition, and
what by arrogant opinion, many of our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
dere frendes, are fowle and pernicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
corrupte, by the whiche we are nowe induced
by false and blynde perswasion, to conceyue eche
one of other an odious and a corrupt opinyon:
by the reasone whereof, somme of vs are called
of the newe fashyon, and somme of the olde,
somme phariseys, and some schismatykes, and

some also playne heretikes: As by example this
somwhat to declare such as repugne ageynst the
pride of Rome, gladly shakyng of the yocke ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of,
and wyllyng to receyue some newe doctrine,
to the comforte of their myndes: suche, as newe
fangled persones, be noted of other to be of the

in redynge of newe bokes, and scripture, freely
condempnynge manye of the olde customes, by
processe of tyme growen to great abuse, though
their purpose be neuer soo good, yet shall not
they scape the note of an heretyke, or els of more
gentylnesse, they shall be called but a schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike:
wherin I dout not to pronounce, that they
be euyll iudged, and that they whiche so iudge,
haue conceyued of them a corrupte iudgement.
For the moste parte I dare saye of them, whiche
be called of the newe facion, lyke trewe and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient

wolde gladly with common quietnesse, the alte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration

wherfore without fayle many of those of the

slypped from the trewe and catholike faithe, the
which some by newe facion pretende to bring in:<note place="margin">Diuisyon.</note>
and some by the olde study to defende, so that by
this contention, whyle euery man besily endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
him selfe, to maynteyne among vs this true

is vnder growing secretly in our hartes this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
diuision, the very bracke of the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
of Christis religion, whiche is founded &amp; groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vppon vnitie, wherof here is amonge vs a
playn and manifest dissolution. For he that thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth
that in those hartes resteth christen vnitie,
where as one in harte iudgeth an other to be an
heretike, he is playne frantike, and lacketh the
common sense: he is eyther blynde, or playnely
wyll not see, the whiche thynketh, that with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
contrary and corrupte iudgementes may be
conserued this spirituall vnitie, which requireth
<pb facs="tcp:4815:36"/>
our hartes as in a common bande, to be knytte
and coupled to gether in charite: wherof betwixt
the newe facion and the olde our hartes are soo
voyde and soo colde, that I thinke many of vs
there be, whiche withoute grefe wolde see, their
christen brother to hange vpon a galowes tree.
Suche enuye &amp; malice of one to an other is gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng
in amonge vs, that I can not se howe we
may iustely be called membres of this spirituall
body of Christe: in the whiche as by charitie all
partis do flouryshe and growe in vnitie, recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge
grace and spirituall comforte of that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
heed, soo by malyce and rancour, the same
falle in diuisyon, and for lacke of that spiryte
receyued of that heed, runne into manifest ruine
and destruction. The experience whereof here
amonge our self dayly we se, where as you may
perceyue, one nothing gladde to helpe an other,
though he be in extreme necessitie: one nothynge
prompte to gyue succour to other, thoughe for
lacke therof he shulde incontinent dye, one not
redy to instruct an other, though he iuge hym to
be in greatte errour and folye: one not redy to
beare the weakenes of an other, though he be of
greatte simplicitie: but contrarye one denyethe
helpe and succour to other, euery one fleethe the
instruction of other, no man gladdely nor wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngly
admonyssheth his christian brother, but
suffereth hym to erre, and hath him in derision.
For suche is the diuision growyng in by folyshe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4815:36"/>
simplicitie and arrogant opinion, that one of vs
in no meane may abyde of the other any brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admonition, but euer one hathe an other sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte,
that with some corrupt and newe opinion,
he wyll infecte his iudgement, and bringe hym
into some pernicious errour, contrarye to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis
catholyke faithe and religion: Thus in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
and harte we be deuyded, and of this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
vnitie is growen a playn bracke and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
which is an effect consequently folowing
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon corruption of our iugementes, which
we conceyue one of an other: the whiche thynge
is open vnto all theym that delyte not in their
owne blyndenes, and wyll not lyft vp their eies,
this for to see. For al suche, whiche with christen
hartes be desyrous of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon quyetnes, and

that the thing of it selfe is so open to euery man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
eye: in soo moche that many men of greatte
wisedome and prudence, greatly do feare, that to
this breache of this spirituall vnitie, growynge
in by lacke of knowledge &amp; charitie, shall succede
the ruyne of good order, and of the iuste co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
policye: to the coniecture wherof, by this maner
perauenture, whiche I shall brefely touche, they

Therfore where as that ground fayleth, hauyng

to fasten in you their folyshe doctrine, they shuld

the hartes of them, to whome it is communed,
there be founde to the receyuynge therof somme
promptnes and conueniency. The faute wherof
is to our selfes holly to be imputed, for thoughe
as I sayde before, the vulgare people be moche
ignorant, and of iugement very bare, yet they be
not of nature so naked sette forthe here into the
worlde, but that certaine sedes in their hartes
they haue planted, certayne sparcles of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
there they haue grafted, which if with any
meane diligence they wyll sette forth &amp; tyll, some
iugement they shall haue betwixt good and euil,
some discretion they shal attayne, to discerne the

of Peter and of Poule in their holy epistles, ye

men obserued lawes onely by feare of punyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Christ wold haue his flocke to be obedient
and fulfyll the same only by loue, &amp; by none other

as a corner stone, agreinge to al polycie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyneth
therin no certayne kynde at al, but as

This thing dere frendes I oft inculke and
reherse, bicause if it be wel and throughly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and in our hartes surely grounded, it shall
minister vnto vs a great grounde &amp; occasion, to
pluck vp by the rotis this fals superstition, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
in these days disquieteth so many mens feble

if to this we ioyne an other grounde, wherby

<pb facs="tcp:4815:47"/>
The lacke of the iugement and discretion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
hath gyuen great occasion to stable in many
mens hartes this vayn superstition, and is also
no small cause of proude arrogant opinion. For
the conceyuynge wherof, this dere frendes you

groundes, whiche of necessitie, must euer be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>serued,
and neuer suffre dispensation: and other

and sturdy obstinacye, they ought not to be
defended, as many men thynke, for lacke of the
sure conceyuynge of this grounde, whiche nowe
you haue harde in few wordes touched, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
grounde if it had ben stabled in the hartes of
some of them, whiche for their disobedience by
superstytyon conceyued, lately haue suffered,
they wolde not peraduenture so heedlynge haue
runne to their dethe, the whiche they so gladly
suffered, induced by corrupt opinion: for perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they were, that the vnitie of Christis church
coulde not by any case maynteyned be, withoute
this longe vsurped superioritie, whiche the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe
of Rome hath of many yeres by the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie
of christen people be magnified in, and
that such a heed shuld be stablyshed by the word
and doctrine of Christe, here in his churche of
necessytie, and not to be a thynge of nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different:
&amp; that he shuld also be the vicar of god
and vniuersall iudge of all christianitie. This
was their perswasion, whiche is the chiefe key of
all superstition, this is as it were the fountayne
and grounde of all other lyke abusion. wherfore
all be it that this ground by the hye prouydence
of out most noble prince, and by common autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie
here in our nation, be soo vtterly abrogate
and pluckid away, that among you most christen
people there is none I thynke so ferre from wit
and iudgement, that wyll theragaynst repugne,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4815:49"/>
but as true subiectes be therto obedient: yet for
the instruction of some weake consciences, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
by some fals perswasion, perauenture maye
yet be troubled with some scrupulosite therof, I
haue thought conuenient nowe in this place, as
I promysed before, somwhat to say touching the
chiefe poyntes, wherby I haue fourmed myne
owne iudgement with knowlege and due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to the intent that you also mooste christian
people, conceying the nature of the thynge as
it is in dede, indifferent, may with harte and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
be therto gladlyer obedient, and not only
by feare of common punyshment. Wherfore the
nature of the thinge as it is in it selfe plainly, as
farre as my wyt and lernynge wyl serue, in fewe
wordes I shall open vnto you indifferently.</p>
            <p>After the tyme that I had exercysed a parte of
my youthe in secular studies and in philosophy,
and therby formed my iugeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with som know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of nature, and of thinges perteynyng to the
maners of man in the ciuile and polytike lyfe, I
toke streight forth holy scripture in hande, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to instructe my mynde with the lyghte of the
doctrine of Christe, the onely comforte of true &amp;
faithful hartes, to the which ende al my labours
and studies in other kynde of letters I euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
&amp; directed, as to the thing, which all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis
scholers oughte euer to loke vnto. But as
sone as I hadde exercysed my selfe a fewe yeres
therin, and some lyght of iugement by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb facs="tcp:4815:50"/>
of Christis spirit gathered in the same, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by
I myght the better discerne thinges, whiche
stonde in worldly polycie, from the groundes of
scripture and pure christianitie: and as soone as
I hadde conceyued with my selfe the perfection
therof, the sincere simplicitie conteyned therin,
and the quietnes of faythefull hartes and pure
consciences, whiche to the stablysshynge therof,
was surely adioyned, I began with my selfe sore
to lament, to se and consider the state of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> worlde
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly, howe far it was slypped from that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
perfection, and celestial conuersation, and
both with my selfe diuers and sondry tymes, and
with other with whom in studies I was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
of the causes therof I beganne to consider
and reasone? in the enserchynge wherof, all be it
many and dyuers causes I founde, whiche now
to reherse were ouer longe, &amp; not to my purpose:
Yet this I wyl say dere frendes nowe vnto you,
that fewe other I se of gretter efficacy, than this
vsurped long and many yeres superioritie of the
pope, whyche for the maynteynynge of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorite
vnder the cloke of religion, hath brought
in amonge christen nations moche fals supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and for the mayntenance of his hye pride &amp;
cloked tiranny, hath amonge christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> princis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tymes to the greatte ruine of common quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
sette greatte diuision. For who is he that of
storye hath any consideration, whiche playnely
bothe not see, how fewe christen princis there be,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4815:50"/>
whiche for the set tynge vppe of this arrogancy,
hath not ones one agayne an other drawen their
swerdes, to the great effusion of christen blode,
and ruine of all good ciuilytie, ye and yet which
is worste of all, they haue ben perswaded therby
to sette vp Christis honour and religion; O lord
what a blyndnes was this reignynge in princis
hartes, and what a superstition one christen man
to kyll an other vnder the pretext of Christis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
And as for the abuses of that authoritie
as well in pardons and dispensations as in inter
dytes and excommunication, I thynke there is
no man so blynd, no nor yet nation so farre from
iudgemente, nor so farre from the commonsense
and trewe consyderation, the whyche that dothe
not see, and obserue. For amonge christen men
no nation there is, whiche beynge obedyente to
that authoritie, hath not felte by pyllynge and
pollynge, and tyrannycalle exaction, euer coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the pretexte of religion, of these abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the playne and manyfeste experyence. This
thynge I haue obserued dere frendes longe and
many a daye, not withoute greatte sorrowe and
dolour of mynde, and yet somme hope euer I
haue hadde ones to see, of these thynges a iuste
and a true reformation, as welle in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
and nations as here at home in our owne
nation. This hope I hadde, wherwith I very
moche eased my sorowe and doloure, lyuynge
in great desyre to see the thynge putte in effecte.
<pb facs="tcp:4815:51"/>
Wherfore dere frendes now of late, at such time
as I retourned oute of Italye, hyther home to
myn owne countrey, here to finyshe in quietnesse
the reste of my lyfe, seruyng our prince, if I were
in any poynt able, to the whiche ende of youthe
I appoynted all my studies: whan I retourned
I say, and sawe this thinge partly put in effect,
whiche I soo longe desyred, the whiche desyre I
testifie god was to his honour, what ioye, what
gladnes in my hart and mynde, I therof concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
I wyll not nowe be about to you by wordes
largely to expresse. But this I wil say vnto you,
the gladnesse that I conceyued of pluckynge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye
this superioritie, was not so moche for the
stopping of the profites, which to the imparyng
of this realme, was no small thing, wherin the
moste parte of mens eyes are chiefly fyxed, as it
was for the hope I had of the reformynge of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
religion, and of the purgynge of vayne su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
wherwith many symple myndes here
in our nation, haue ben greatly infect: the chiefe
cause wherof hath bene this superioritie of the
see of Rome: in so moche that this I thinke tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I may say, that euen as Rome by mekenes &amp;
charitie, was the fyrst occasion of communynge
and propagation, ye and stablyng also long and
many yeres of Christis doctrine and true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
here in our nation, so nowe the same by pride
and arrogancy, by processe of tyme hath ben the
chiefe and principall occasion, of ouermoche ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollyng
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4815:51"/>
mans tradition, and the very open gate
of all superstition, so that nowe by the stopping
of this gate, great hope I haue ones yet to see,
Christis doctrine restored agayn to the pure and
natiue simplicitie, and to the olde simple purite.
And to the conceyuynge of this hope moche mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
I am by the hye vertues of our moste noble
prince, whose highnes boldly I dare affirme, no
thing more desyreth, than the restitution of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis
true doctrine here in our nation, and that to
see flourishe in the hartis of his subiectes, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe
in lyfe the frute of the same. To this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all the cures, thoughtes, actes, and dedes
of his royall maiestie. Wherfore me semeth not
without a cause my hope is conceyued, if this be
true that all antiquitie hath approued, suche as
be princis, suche be their subiectes, whose trace
euer foloweth all the comminaltie. Seing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
oure prince to be of this pourpose and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre,
and of suche iudgemente and policie, that
beste he knowethe the meane of the restitution
hereof, why shulde not I conceyue this gladde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and stable hit in my harte? why shoulde not
I reioyse, or rather why shuld not all we be glad
and reioyse most christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people? Truly we ought
to gyue thankes to almyghty god, by whose pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uidence,
we haue this noble prince now reigning
in our tyme. And surely I doubte not, but that
the goodnes of god, who hath inspired his harte
with lyght and iugement to conceyue the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb facs="tcp:4815:52"/>
of this popes superioritie, and to his honour to
plucke hit downe, shall also gyue hym the same
lyght and grace to fynde out all conuenient me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to the mayntenance of the same, that it may
procede with a common quietnesse bothe to the
comforte of our present age and of the posterite,
and that so therby hereafter may succede the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the pure doctrine of Christe and syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
religion, with the pourgynge of all fals and
vayn superstition: This is my hope and this is
my truste, of the whiche as I sayd at my retorne
here into my countrey, great gladnes I concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
the whiche contynually I nouryshe in my
harte, with sure hope dayly the same to increase,
howe be it herin I fynde the nature of mannes
affecte, and that to be trewe whiche of the wyse
and auncyent Socrates, ofte was rehersed, that
in mannes affecte, plesure and peyn, sorowe and
ioye, were neuer seperate, but as the partes of a
rynge euer coupled togyther, and euer knyt one
to the other, as it were by a common chayne. For
thoughe it be soo that of this acte of pluckynge
downe this popyshe authoritie, moste iustely as
me semeth I haue conceyued this gladnesse, yet
it is not perfyte and syncere, there is in my harte
a certayne sorowe myngled with the same, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
hath moche defaced my gladdenes and ioye.
For sory I am &amp; of the very hart, to se that thing
whiche you all moste christen people, I am sure
with no lesse sorowe lately haue sene, that is to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4815:52"/>
say, to see so noble an acte, so good and so profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
so open a gate to the restoringe and stably<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shynge
here amonge vs a very true and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
weale, whiche coulde neuer lyghtly haue hadde
place, standynge this outwarde and tyrannicall
authoritie. For euer it shuld to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince haue ben
a lette and an obstacle, at suche tyme as he shuld
attempte any refourmynge of true religion, to
see I say ageynst so noble an acte, suche men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne,
suche men to be disobedient, whose ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
I euer trusted shoulde haue benne to oure
prince, to wchynge the restitution of his true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weale a chiefe instrumente. For what ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
were in somme of them, superstitious sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie
set a syde, all the worlde knoweth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
suche vertues so to be corrupt with supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that therby they shuld be induced to be diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to their prince, and to suche holsome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
I can not but of hart sore to lament, I can
not but be sorowfull, that suche blyndnes shulde
be ioyned to such knowlege, &amp; such vertue shuld
be blurrid with such vice, &amp; such an acte so wisely
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyued shulde be blotted with disobedience so
folyshly declared. This maketh me sory &amp; sore in
hart to lament, and truly to saye not so moche for
their causes, who for theyr disobedience, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
to the course of lawe, iustely haue suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as for yours mooste christian people, whose
symple and weake consciences, not able perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
well to conceyue the nature of thynges,
<pb facs="tcp:4815:53"/>
as they be in dede, by their disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
obstinacie, may in some part perauenture be
moued to conceyue of this acte some scrupulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
by the reason whereof in you may succede,
disquietnes of mynd, diuersly drawen by diuers
obedience. Wherfore partly to the auoydynge of
myn owne sorow conceyued by suspicion of your
simplicitie, and partly to do my duetie in setting
forthe of so manyfest a truthe, I shall as brefely
and clerely as I can set before your eies, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing, vsinge therin no longe scholasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

I wyll shewe vnto you, that this superioritie is
not of the law of god, prescribed vnto vs for the
necessitie of our saluation, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is a thyng in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
the disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wherof, bringeth not to

you, howe it fyrst grewe in, as a thinge conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and to the conseruation of the vnitie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis
churche expedient. Thirdely I shall declare
howe that as it hath bene many yeres vsurped,
it is to the very spirituall vnitie, nother necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye

            <p>And fyrst most christen people this is of you al

accordyng to their rude capacite, the which

the instytution whereof he euer refused, as a

I saye, and well ponderynge in mynde indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentely,

the byshoppe of Rome, that he therby
vppon all christendome shoulde be a chiefe iuge,
and vppon all princis and lawes to haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
with interdites and dispensation, theym to
tempre and reule at pleasure, ye and vppon the
worde of god alone to haue power of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
this to my iudgement, whan I weye the
thinge with my selfe, appereh to me, more than
madnes and extreme foly. For this passethe all
pryde and arrogancy, this is aboue all tyranny,
Christen nations were neuer so madde, by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
decree or consent in counsell generalle, euer
to gyue to any one manne, suche authoritie: but
vndoubtedly by the symplicitie of christen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and by the pacience of good princis, ye and
by the arrogancye and pride of those, the why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

frendes the authoritie of Peter, whiche to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
apostels was equally gyuen, withoute any
superioritie, shortly I shal declare it vnto you.</p>
            <p>Lyke as the lyfe whiche Christe came to insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and stablyshe in the hartes of them, whiche
wolde folowe him, was of an other sorte and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
of a hyer puritie and excellency, than was
the lyfe of them, whiche loked no ferther than to
thynges present, drowned in all worldly &amp; vaine
affection, and folowed only the course of the lyfe
politike, wherof I spake at large before: so is the
power and authoritie, that he gaue vnto theym,
whiche with sure faythe and truste in his worde,
folowed hym and his doctrine, of an other sorte
and greatter excellency, than euer before Christe
was gyuen to man in this worlde, or stablyshed
by any policie, there was neuer before him suche
thinge gyuen to mortall man. For to whom was
hit euer sayde, what soo euer thou byndeste or
loosest in erthe, the same in heuen shall lykewyse
be loosed and bounde? And yet to Peter this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
was gyuen, and to all the apostelles with
equalite. There was neuer before Christe empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in Rome, nor sens Christ prince out of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
whether he were gret turke or sowdan
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4815:58"/>
or amonge the mores any kinge most myghty of
power, that euer had any suche dignitie, to none
of them all was euer gyuen suche power. For
their power and authoritie, resteth onely in the
lordshyppe and dominion, gouernance and rule
of those thynges worldly vnstable and transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
the which al as vyle by nature and of small
dignitie, Christis doctrine techeth to treade vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foote, and to a hyper degree he lyfted the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of his disciples,<note place="margin">Ioan. 10.</note> and soo gaue theym hygher
authoritie,<note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> as to lose manne from all myserie of
synne, though the synne were neuer so great, and
to sette hym in sure state of felicitie: and who so
euer he were and of what nation,<note place="margin">The antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Peter.</note> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicion, state,
or degree, all indifferently to lose from synne, yf
they wyll with perfyte faythe and sure truste in
Christe professe his doctrine folowynge euer the
perfection of the same. To this fayth and truste
being in Peter and in the other apostels our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
gaue this diuine power, and this is the very
key of the gate of heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which as you se openeth
to all men the gate indifferently, there is no man
excluded from entrynge therin,<note place="margin">Galat. 3.</note> but all, puttynge
their holle affiance in Christe folowynge his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
shall be admytted withoute difficultie.</p>
            <p>This is a meruaylous power to man gyuen, to
plucke man so myserable and wretched out of al
myserie, and to putte him in the state of felicite:
And with this power our master Christ se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t forth
his disciples, instructe with his spirite, to all the

worlde, by the prechynge of his doctrine to turne
them out of their wretched trade and misery, and
to wake them out of their dreame: for drowned
mankynde was with worldly affection, and fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to put them in remembraunce of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytes
of god and of their dignitie, and that so by
his doctrine they at the last inspired and styrred
vppe, myght attayne to their felicite. This was
the chief authorite &amp; power, to thapostels by our

tende all the sacramentes of Christe institute, to
brynge vs I say to the remembrance of suche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefyte,
as he to all theym, whiche by sure saythe
hang vpon him, hath surely promysed, as I shal

and greattest that euer to mankinde was gyuen
in erth, to the apostels of Christ gyuen was this.

people manyfestly, that this hygh authoritie, by
Christe was vndoutedly gyuen to his heuenlye
messangers &amp; apostels, whan he sent them forth
to preache his heuenly doctrine, by the benefyte
wherof man shulde be quyte delyuered frome al
kynde of synne and myserie: but that this same
was to all them gyuen equally, this is not to all
men so manifest &amp; playn, this many men denye,
affirmyng y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> to Peter it was giuen with a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue
of excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, and so therby to the bishop of
Rome, in whose place he only dothe by their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
succede, they attribute a superioritie. This
they say &amp; only they say, but as for sure grounde
of scripture, their sentence to confirme, playnly
there is none. For as touchynge this, whiche is
of al other, most chief,<note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> that to Peter Christ spake
particularly, gyuynge to hym this power, that
was vndoutedly, bicause he beinge of faith more
<pb facs="tcp:4815:61"/>
feruent, and as it appereth of greatter stomake,
ye and as it shulde seeme also by many signes, of
better vtterance and eloquence. For the whiche
cause he of the olde interpretours of scripture is
euer called the mouthe of the apostels: he I saye
hauyng these giftes, spake before the rest, and so
to him particularly Christe sayd, he wolde gyue
the keyes of the kyngedome of heuen, but he
sayde not, that vnto hym alone he wolde gyue
them. For after whan he gaue theym in dede, he
spake to all indifferentely. And ferther yet this
same power whiche he said he wold gyue to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
was not of any other sorte, then that, whiche
he gaue to al other, as it appereth by the wordis,
but euen all one, and runnyng to the same effect,
as to release and bynd sinne with like authorite,
and therby to make ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gates of heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
to affirme suche prerogatiue, onely bycause
he spake to Peter particularly, semeth a weake
and a sklender grounde, seing that he dydde not
say that to him alone, he wolde gyue such autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and besyde that whan he gaue it in dede, he
than gaue it equally. And yet more ouer, he that
indifferently weyith the same place, with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
therof, shal fynde playnly, that spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge
to Peter he spake also to all, as he for all
answered. For euen as the question was not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of Peter alone, but of al equally, so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryly
the promysse of power to al was at the same
tyme indifferentely opened, thoughe Peter as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4815:61"/>
spokes man to the rest, onely made answere: but
Peter alone had not that fayth, the whiche is the
foundation and sure stoone, whervppon Christe
buylded his churche, to the which was made the
promyse of this power, but of that feythe they
were all indifferently, though Peter with more
feruent affect out wardly it declared, &amp; the faithe
it was that Christe founde in them, whiche mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
hym to make the promyse of that hyghe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
the whiche he after gaue indifferently to all
other, whiche with lyke faith are sent forthe and
appoynted by his churche and faythefulle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
to preache the fruite of his heuenly
doctrine abrode to the people,<note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> to their comforte
&amp; saluation. Of this place therfore to gether any
prerogatiue of power to be gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Peter, is but
a weke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture, &amp; a feble grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; like to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same
which is gatherid of an other place, where Christ
sayd to Peter he had prayde for him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his faithe
shuld not fail, &amp; that after his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion he shuld
confirm his brethern, the which wordes he spake
to the comfort of Peter, forseinge by his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
the wekenes of his faithe and imbecillitie,
whiche he shewed aboue the rest of his apostels.
Wherfore beside the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, which he gaue
to them al, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shulde syt with him in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
at the extreme iugement of al, to take oute

hym, he promysed his faithe shoulde not fayle,
<pb facs="tcp:4815:62"/>
and that by the occasion therof he shuld confirm
his brethern, to put faith in him, whose goodnes
was not soo offended with suche infidelitie, but
that by sorowfull harte and repentance he short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recouered his fauour agayne. Wherof al chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten

not but appere a weyke grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de &amp; feble co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture:
and yet weyker is this, whiche of an other place
of the gospell as most principall is taken, where
as Christe demaunded of Peter, whether he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him more than the other of his apostels,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

whiche he affirmed, to whom Christe then sayde
and commaunded, that he shulde than fede his
flock, and that he rehersed thrise to gyther, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of
is thought manifest al the hole matter. But in
this leauynge other answeres of many wyse me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
made, I wyl shewe you my sentence &amp; iugement,
that Christe there intended no suche thing at all,
nor to stablyshe in Peter any superiorite therby,
was nothinge his purpose, as it semeth manifest
for as moche as he sayd onely fede my flocke, not
addyng or puttyng to any argument or token of
any higher power and authorite, but only thrise
rehersed that thinge, whiche is the common of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of all his apostels, and of al other, which be
appoynted to be preachers of his worde, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4815:62"/>
thing as it semed by inculcation he wold fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
in Peters harte, ye and soo consequently in
the hartes of all them, whiche of his name wyll
make profession. That thing I say he wold fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
in hart, which is of al his doctrine the chefe
ground and foundation, that is to say, that who
so euer by mouthe and outwarde confession, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
to loue Christe, and to be a sheparde of his
flocke: thenne must he in dede, and by outwarde
demonstration openly declare, when occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth,
the inwarde affect, to the entent that the
worde and dede may in effecte agree. For he that
by mouthe sayth he loueth Christe, and by dedes
dothe hym deny,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.</note> he is no mete disciple of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christe, nor mete apostle, nor sheparde
for his flocke, for his confession doth not profite
nor edifie the inwarde affecte of all christen har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
may not onely in wordes,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> but in dede be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared:
without the whiche thou shewest thy selfe
to be an hypocrite,<note place="margin">Hypocrisye,</note> and a dissemblyng professour
of Christis doctrine, the which hypocrisie aboue
all thinge Christe doth abhorre, and hath as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
Wherfore as I thinke, Christe asked Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thrise of his inward affecte, and was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
onely with the outwarde confession of loue
by mouthe, whiche may by dissimulation be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
and cloked, but gaue him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandment to
fede his flocke, with that faith &amp; with his heuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doctrine: and so in effecte to declare his loue,
the whiche though Christ without dede outward
<pb facs="tcp:4815:63"/>
who lokith into me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hartis, right wel doth know
yet to the comforte of other, and to their instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we muste euer as occasion requireth: so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
our inwarde affecte, with loue and charitie
by outward workes to the profyt of other. This
doctrine maye well be taken of this inculcation
and ofte rehersall of these wordes to Peter, but
as for any superioritie of power, therby to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
vnto hym, playnly to me semeth a dreame,
where as of power is made no mention. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the groundes of scripture, and of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis
gospelle dere frendes no man can take sure
argumente of this prerogatiue, as by these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ye maye see, whiche are amonge other of all
moste chiefe and principall. For of the rest be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
yet more feble coniectures, the whiche haue
many yeres troubled all the worlde, and blynded
these popes with arrogancy, and in all other sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
moche superstition, to the greatte ruyne of
Christis pure doctrine and of all good religion.
Wherfore frendes seinge that the manifeste doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of our master, so playnly sowneth to equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytie
of power, in all the apostelles indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and onely by lyghte coniectures menne maye
be ladde to the contrarye, I wotte not why we
shulde so styffely defende this authoritie, so febly
founded, and so wekely, as you partly haue hard
by scripture grounded.</p>
            <p>And moste specially seinge that the practyse of
the same authoritie in the tyme of the apostelles,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4815:63"/>
whiche moueth me aboue all other argumentes,
out of the gospell drawen, and wordes of Christ
wrytten, is vtterly contrarye, ye and many yeres
so continued in the begynnyng of Christis chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
the whiche I shall nowe breuely to you also
declare, wherby you maye better be instructed,
thanne by argument oute of scrypture drawen,
wherin lyeth moche controuersie. For this is to
be thoughte as a certayne truthe and sure, that
the apostelles so inspired with the spirite of god
wolde neuer put in practise thynge contrarye to
the doctrine of their maister Christe, which they
had so newly receyued, and so stablyshed in their
hartes. Wherfore though Peter lyke as he euer
dydde in the presence of his mayster, shewe hym
selfe moost prompte and redy with faithfull hart
and loue to serue hym in all thynge, so after his
Ascension vppe to his father, shewed hym selfe
mooste studiouse in the preachynge, and in the
fyrste stablynge of his newe and godly doctrine,
euer redye to preache and common the same, to
the foundynge of his churche and faythfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
Yet this ye shall fynde in obseruyng
his actes and practyse of his lyfe, and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christis apostelles, that he nother of hym
self preched this doctrin, any prerogatyue of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
aboue other vsynge therin, nor yet they any
suche thinge gaue vnto hym, in settynge forthe
the same. As of the fyrste acte, whiche the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stelles
dydde, hit is verye euydente and playne,
<pb facs="tcp:4815:64"/>
when they shoulde supply the roume of Iudas,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </note>
Peter onely dyd purpose the thing, whiche after
they perfourmed, by election and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
gyuyng to hym no prerogatiue at al of any
hygher power, sauinge only that he as most elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
&amp; bolde proposed the matter, whyche they
fynyshed by their common assent. And after the
same maner in the creation of Diacons, this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was obserued, whan certayne were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to minister in lower office to the hole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
while the apostels occupied them selfe in
prechynge of Christis doctrine:<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> this thyng was
not done by the authoritie of Peter alone, but by
the common agreement of all the rest, whiche at
the begynnynge of the churche, were in that lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
congregation. And at such tyme as the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles
beganne to receyue the doctrine of Christe
Peter dydde not by his authoritie commande or
appoynt, whiche of the apostelles shulde god to<note place="margin">Act. 8.</note>
preache vnto theym, to the increase of Christis
churche, but he hym selfe with Iohn were sente
forth of the other this office to do: whiche argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that aboue the reste he had no authoritie, for
than he myght of him selfe haue done that thing
whiche he dyd not, but with the authoritie of the
hole congregation was sent forthe with Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;
with equall authoritie together they preached, to
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon edification of Christis churche, in no
poynt shewyng any prerogatiue therin. But this
thynge is yet moche more euident, by the entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4815:64"/>
of a controuersie, which at the begynning
rose in that lytel church, the order wherof yf you
obserue with diligence, you shall most manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see, that to Peter was gyuen no prerogatiue
of authoritie: The controuersie rose by the reson
of some whiche preched to the gentyles, that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuncision<note place="margin">Act. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
was necessary to their saluation: this
thinge beinge in great controuersie, was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyned
by Peters authorite, but referred to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
to the counsell of the apostels, wherin this
order was obserued. Peter fyrst declared his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
and mynd, how that this circuncision was
but a ceremony, and to the saluation of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles
nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g necessary: after whom spake Poule
&amp; Barnabas to the same sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but after them
all, Iames gaue iudgemente of the thynge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarynge
of them all the common sentence, and
sent it forthe by writinge, not as a thynge deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by any prerogatiue of Peters authoritie,
but by the assent of all together, agreinge in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
Wherby ye may se dere fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, that Peter,
as it were giuing place to Iames at Ierusalem,
in that tyme shewed no argumente of any hyer
authoritie, but rather contrarye of that place hit
shulde seme, that Iames shoulde be of greatter
authoritie, for as moch as he pronounced the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sentence and iudgemente of all. But after
myn opinion, nother Iames was heed, nor yet
Peter, but all with equall authoritie and one as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
laboured mooste besily, to common abrode
<pb facs="tcp:4815:65"/>
this heuenly doctrine, to the saluation of man in

            <p>But aboue all other yet to me of the dedes and

this I say sheweth mooste surely, that Peter
was then no suche heed of the churche, as many
men dreme, that of hym as vicar of Christ, al po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
shulde be deriued to other. For then Poule

the whiche is iudged to be of suche necessite,
that the denienge of his superioritie, shuld bring
in euerlastinge damnation. And besyde this loke
what he dyd at Antyoche, where as Peter vsing
a lyttell mannes policy, gaue place to the weke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

and applyed, without respecte of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony:
this he dyd manifestly, which I thinke
he wolde neuer haue doone, if he hadde iudged
in Peter to be any suche hyghe authoritie, but
rather he wolde haue confourmed hym selfe to

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4815:65"/>
beinge the onely liefetenaunt and vicar
of his maister: but playnely he iudged no suche

after he had longe tyme preached the gospelle of
Christe amonge the gentyle nation: He ascended
to Ierusalem, there to conferre with Peter, and

place to the wekenes of them to whome he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
whom he thought rather to wynne, hauing
his doctrine to Peters, and other there being of
great fame agreable, the whiche he dyd in dede.
For of them he saythe, thoughe they were neuer
so greatte, by suche collation to hym self he had
no profytte, no thynge he there lerned, that by
the goodnesse of their common mayster Christe
he hadde not lerned before. Wherfore he saythe,
he departed frome Ierusalem, not as one that
toke Peter for any hedde or gouernoure of the
churche of Christe, but as one of equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytie,
hauynge his doctryne and power of the

to somme peraduenture this argumente appere
weyke, bycause it semeth not wel to folow, Poule
maketh no mention therof, therfore it is not so:
Yet to me consyderinge the thinge as it is, with
the circumstaunce therof, it appereth almoste a
sure demonstration, seinge that Poule makyng
soo moche mention of the heed of the churche of
Christe, inculkynge it so ofte as a thinge mooste
necessary, if he had thought, that Peter had bene
an vnder heed of Christe hym selfe, as some saye
nowe in his churche stablyd, as necessarye to the
conseruation of the vnitie therof, I thynke I say
in some place he wold haue made mention ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
or elles plainly his doctrine had ben insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente,
lackynge the declaration of that thynge,
whiche to the stablynge of Christis doctrine, is
of soo hyghe necessitie. But this Paule neuer
dydde, but the contrarye playne. For he neuer
toke Peter for hedde of his Churche: whyche
thing also I am sure Peter, if it hadde ben putte
to hym, wolde haue vtterly and cleane forsaken
it, specially after that sorte to be of suche necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.<note place="margin">

Paule toke him as his compaignion equall
with hym in power and dignitie spirituall, both
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4815:67"/>
two despisers of dignitie temporall. I am sure,
if Peter were alyue, that he wold thinke nothing
more contrary to the doctrine of his master, than
to affyrme of suche power anye superioritie, as
nowe is to him against his wyll ascribed to be of
suche necessitie, that withoute it the doctrine of
Christe shoulde runne to ruyne and decaye. And
that man without the confession of suche power,
shuld fall to sure perdition. This I am sure Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wolde abhorre and Paule also, This they<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.</note>
wolde thinke to be plaine contrary to the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
of Christis doctrine and vnitie. Wherfore
frendes seing that nother the places of scripture
indifferently weyed, nor the practyse of the same
in the tyme of the apostels to the world declared,
serue to the ascribynge of any prerogatiue of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to Peter, or aboue the reste any superioritie,
and seynge also that bothe the dedes and doctrin
of the mooste diuyne Interpretour of Christis
gospelle Paule, sound to the contrary, as I haue
manyfestly shewed, I see no cause why we shuld
of suche necessytie, attrybute to the bysshoppe of
Rome suche superioritie, that the defection from
the same, shuld blotte any nation, with the crime
of heresie or of scisme, and so consequently induce
any scrupulous suspicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euerlastyng damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But playnly to say, the assertion of such su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piorite,
after this sort appereth a great madnes,
extreme foly, &amp; playn suꝑstition: the whiche thing
thoughe of scripture it selfe as I haue towched,
<pb facs="tcp:4815:68"/>

be tediouse therin, bothe by storye and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Argumente declare vnto you, and so it shall
be manyfeste, that this thynge is not of suche
greatte necessitie, to the conseruation of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christis churche, as many menne blyndly
do iudge.</p>
            <p>¶And fyrste herein to me it apperethe a thynge
moche meruaylous, by what meane this thynge
to be of so great necessitie, shulde enter in to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
fantasies and myndes, specially of lernyng and
iudgement, consideringe that frome the tyme of
Peter vntyll the tyme of Syluester byshoppe of
Rome, in the reigne of Constantyne, aboute the
space of .iiii. hundrethe yeres, of this heed with
such superioritie was no mention at all. For this
by certayne storye is knowen, that all that tyme
the byshoppes in euerye place chiefe and princy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palle,
as Ierusalem, Antioche, and Alexandria,
were bothe chosen and institute of the hole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
or els by the priestes, to whome was
gyuen of the multitude suche authoritie, and no
mention is had all that space, that they ranne to
the bysshoppe of Rome, as theyr common heed
and superiour, whyche at the same tyme was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as by probable coniecture we maye gather,
longe and many a daye, inferiour vnto the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
of Ierusalem, &amp; Alexandria, I meane not in
power &amp; authorite, for therin was sure equalitie,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4815:68"/>
but in vertue and knowledge of Christis doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
whyche in Alexandria and in Antyoche,
as nere to Ierusalem, toke fyrst greater ground,
than it dyd in the citie of Rome, whose pryde &amp;
worldely polycye many a daye, moche resysted to
the truthe of the gospel, and that heuenly humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
therin to vs taught, the which nothing was
agreable to the imperial pryde, in the emperours
then reygnynge. Wherfore christen men there se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
in corners made their assembly, and priuy
profession of Christes name, auoydyng the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of the wycked emperours, whose arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
was clene contrary to Christis simplicite.
And thus at Rome it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued without great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of Christis doctrine longe &amp; many yeres,
where as at Alexandria and Antioche was at the
begynnyng moche more open profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis
name and doctryne, the whiche may well be
gathered of the multitude of lerned men and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligyouse,
wherof at the begynnynge of Christis
churche was in Alexandria and Egypte, in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche,
and in the parties of Grece, as story ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
mention, far greatter nombre, than there
was at Rome, or here in the weste parties of the
worlde, where as Christis relygyon toke more
slowe encrese, than it dyd in the easte, where it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne.
For at Rome vntyll the tyme of Consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyne
it neuer toke so notable encrease, his vertue
goodnes and authoritie, moche altered the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Rome: for his fame and example greattely
<pb facs="tcp:4815:69"/>
styrred y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hartis of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon peple, whose iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
euer moche folowe theyrs, whiche be in
authoritie, by theyr example moche they fourme
their myndes, theyr trade of lyfe they studye to
expresse: so that vntil this good emperours time,
thoughe before at Rome it had a good grounde,
yet it was not so stablished by authorite of prince
it did not so florishe in the face of the worlde, but
christen men liued there in moche subiection, and
specially at the begynnynge, when for their rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
they suffred moche miserie, &amp; persecution.
But nowe to the purpose, al this space of thre or
foure hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth yeres, nother the byshop of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
nor of Antioche, no nor yet Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dria, neuer
shewed argument of any superioritie of power
dewe to the byshoppe of Rome by the doctrine of
Christe, they neuer gaue to hym of necessitie, and
of the gospell dewe any poynt of obedye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, they
were not institute, nor made by his authoritie,
they neuer cam to his iugeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for sentence, as to
the vicar of Christ: but often tymes by collation,
they toke one of another the trewth of scripture,
and therof the trewe interpretation therby they
founde oute, to that euer gyuynge dewe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but of that hyghe superiorite, all that tyme
was no mention, no worde, nor by story and lytel
sygnyfication? whiche is also mooste manifeste
by the celebration of the fyrste counselles gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralle,
whiche were congregate by the princelye
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4815:69"/>
authoritie, without mention of any suche supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorytye,
gyuen to the byshoppe of Rome, the
whiche thynge to proue is more open thanne
nowe nedeth any declaration. Wherfore hit can
not be thoughte, to be of suthe necessytie, specy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
seynge all that tyme at the begynnynge of
Christis churche, whenne the doctryne of oure
mayster was mooste pure, and not corrupte by
mannes inuentyon, but as hit came from the
fountayne, syncere and clere, was entred and
stabled in the hartes of them, which therof made
professyon, there is noo storye made oone tytle
of mention, of anye suche superyoritye to the
bysshoppe of Rome to be gyuen, no nor yet to
none other, speciallye that it shoulde be of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
hygh necessitie, that without it Christis do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
coulde not stande, the whiche to all menne
that haue eyes, and consider the storye of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyng
of the churche, stode than in greatter
puritie, than euer hit dydde, sens the tyme that
we haue had this one hed, stablisshed with suche
authorytie and power, the whiche thynge is so
manyfeste and playne, that no manne consyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge
the antiquitie, and comparynge it with
the posteritie, maye denye this. For this to the
worlde is open, in so moche that this thynge to
be of necessyte to the saluation of man, as many
men dreme, now also to confyrme with moch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
and reson, appereth vtterly superfluous.
<pb facs="tcp:4815:70"/>
Howe be it this I wyll saye, a great lykelyhode
that this shoulde not be necessary is this. Fyrste,
that all the aunciente and good Interpretours
of Christis Gospell amonge the grekes, whome
I iudge to haue more lyghte in the holye scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as they had in al other letters and lerning,
than any other nation, that euer yet receyued the
trewthe of Christis religion, the whiche without
profe here of me, is open by theyr workes to all
men, that with diligence them wyl rede. Al these
I say with one consente, kepe sylence of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
to be gyuen to the byshoppe of Rome of
suche necessitie, in theyr workes therof ye shall
neuer fynde mention, the whiche is not like, they
wolde haue done, if they had iudged it to be soo
necessary a thynge, and a gospell truth of Christ
institute, and stabled: besyde this if this ground
were trewe, then shulde al the Indians all these
thousand yeres haue runne heedlyng to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which neuer toke the byshop of Rome heed
of Christis churche and his vicar in erthe, nor of
hym neuer toke tradition, and yet they haue ben,
ye and yet be nowe in our dayes, vnder Preter
Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their kynge and heed, of Christis doctrine
deuout &amp; true professours, and with vs in al the
grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of scripture vtterly agre, in ceremonies
and rytes ecclesiasticalle, there is moche diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as it is necessary, accordyng to the nature of
the contrey and people. The same thynge myght
be sayde of them in Armeny, whiche neuer wold
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4815:70"/>
be obedient to the byshoppe of Rome, but hadde
amonge them their heed, whom they called their
catholyke, as he that was a trewe professour and
maynteyner of the catholyke faythe. The same
also myght be sayd of the Greke nation, whiche
neuer wolde confesse the obedience to the church
of Rome, to be necessary to the saluation of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Wherfore chiefely by the byshops of Rome, they
were most vniustly noted, not to be as membres
of Christes vniuersall and catholyke body. But
now al these nations, Indians, Armenians, and
Grekes vtterly to condemne, and seperate them
from the benefit of Christis passion, wherin they
haue had euer their chiefe comforte and trust, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for bycause they wold not, nor were not to this
heed, as to the vycar of Christe obedyente: All
these I say to condemne and caste theym into the
depe pytte of hell, semeth playne madnesse, and
moste blynde arrogancye: and I pray god, that
they whiche so blyndly do iudge, be not for their
owne iudgement rather to be condempned. For
this iugement hath no grounde neyther of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
nor yet of reasone, but is a playne blynde
superstition. For as I haue shewed you before,
that thynge to attribute to god of necessitie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretense of religion, whiche in dede is not so,
but hangeth only vpon ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitution, is moste
playn and manifest superstition. Wherfore dere
frendes, seinge that neyther scripture, storye, nor
good reason dryueth vs to confesse this superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb facs="tcp:4815:71"/>
that tyme taken as of Scripture necessarye, for
than his decree hadde bene ryghte foolysshe, by
lawe to stablyshe that, whiche of the gospelle do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
shuld be so necessary. But to the purpose,
he thenne was made heed, but not by authoritie
of the generall counselle, but onely of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
who by his prudence and policie, thoughte
it expedient to stablysshe one heed, to order suche
thinges and putte in effecte at all tymes, whiche
were by generall counsell conceyued and decreed
concernynge the interpretation of scripture, the
controuersie wherof at the fyrst begynnyng was
onely there intreated, and no other thynge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynynge
to polycye: Suche thynges were euer
lefte to the iudgement of Princis, and of euery
commynaltie: and there the dyuersitie of opiny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in scripture were euer brought to a certayne
vnitie and concorde. This Authoritie only had
the bysshoppe of Rome at the fyrste begynnyng
of his superioritie, as it apperethe by generalle
counsaylles, and with this he contynued manye
yeres, neuer attentynge farther, vntylle at the
laste by longe warres and moche greatte dyui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
amonge princys, the Empyre of Rome fell
in moche ruyne and decaye, the whyche gaue the
fyrste occasyon to this greatte heddy power and
authoritie of Rome. For as the Emperour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
by prowde dyuysyon, so the pope increased
by symple superstytion. For to that authorytie
whiche firste he had of Constantyne, his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4815:71"/>
in the empire added moche more, gyuynge
theym priuiledge and possession, with moche
worldely authoritie and iurysdyction, thynking
therby moch to honour god, whose vicar in erth
he soone after beganne to call hym selfe. For as
soone as this authoritie, by emperours was sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyshed,
than he of hym selfe beganne to call ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
counsayle, and there many other thynges
to decree besyde scripture, whiche were iudged
partely to be good for the conseruation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis
doctryne, as dyuers decrees, and ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calle
lawes, and partely for the mayntenance of
this vnitie of heed, which then appered for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding
of schisme and diuision, to the world al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
necessary, and specially after that purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
after a newe facion was inuented, and surely
iudged to be: for therby chiefelye beganne his
reygne, thenne came in pardones and reserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his owne see, than crope in the difiniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thynges by his hye authoritie, than entred
excommunication and interdytes vpon all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
and christen nations: for after that the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
by symple superstition came to that poynt,
that to the popes they iudged theym selfes to be
subiectes, and not to be in full authoritie, tyll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his presence they were intronised and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
what other prince coulde there be, whiche
shuld not iuge him selfe inferior to the power of

poynt conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seruation of this vnite,
but rather a great occasion of the breche of good
christyan ciuylitie. This remayneth in the laste
place now to be declared, wherin I shal not nede
long to stond. For who so euer consydereth with
hym selfe the vsurped authoritie, in dispensynge
with the good and catholyke groundes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonyke,
propowned by generall counselles, and
the sellynge of the same, the interditynge of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
and nations vpon worldly causes, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications
chiefely sente out for the same,
vpon the good christen flocke, I thynke he shall
fynd &amp; shortly se, that this superioritie, as it hath
ben vsed, is lyttell conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to christen ciuilitie:
specially if he ioyn to this the authorite by ꝑdons
abused, &amp; plucking soules out of purgatory, with
the reseruyng of causes to his own power, &amp; defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of causes by apellatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> referrid to his popely
authorite. These thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges who so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>siderith, he shal
shortly ꝑceiue, what inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces among al chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
nations doth rise of this heedy authorite, and
what blynd superstition is therby grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in all
Christis religion: For though in euery ꝑticular
church &amp; proui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it be conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to haue one heed
to gouerne, for the auoyding of confusion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
byshops were institute aboue all priestes in
euery church cathedral, as testifieth al antiquite,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4815:73"/>
yet by lyke example therof to induce, the same to
be so conuenient in the hole body, as it is in euery
parte, is playne foly, and not without manifeste
lacke of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For where as in the hole body
of Christis churche be so many sondry nations,
and therin besyde the diuersities of tongues and
maners, so diuers polycies and ordynaunces of
lawes, that one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof to haue knowlege and
experience, which is required to the ryght iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of causes, it semeth impossible. How shuld
it be thought conuenient in suche a body to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
one heed with suche authoritie, to whose
iudgement in all causes to hym deuolued and
brought, all the reste of christian nations shulde
stonde and be obedient? For thoughe he were a
man of mooste hye perfection, and of wysedome
mooste polytyke, seynge that the administration
of Iustice and equitie standeth a greate parte in
the knowledge of the particular circumstaunces
of causes, howe shuld he to so many nations, of
whom he hath no knowlege nor experience, giue
iustice with truth &amp; equitie? For it can none other
wyse be, but that one man and one hede, so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt
of thynges, not hauyng particuler instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
therof, shal be impotent and lacke power,
be he neuer so good, to satisfie all suche persons
and causes, whiche by appellation out of diuers
countreis and nations, shuld thither be referred:
by the reason wherof shuld succede many iniust
&amp; wronge iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, as we both by olde story,

Wherfore frendes if we with louinge harte one

lykewyse out of the ceremonies, vsed in Christis

are but dumbe sygnes, he euer gadreth somme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4815:84"/>
wherby he induceth manne to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

And as for all other thynges, whyche
stonde in mannes polycye: he euer therin indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
and teacheth obedience to common autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
nothynge agaynste the same superstitious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

he settethe before his eyes, as chyefe ende, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde
and vnitie, vnto the whiche he euer direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
hym selfe, and his oracyon with prudente
symplicitie, auoydynge all diuisyon, whiche is
the mother of all confusion: and so atte the laste

the whiche are stedfast, sure, and stable, and also
