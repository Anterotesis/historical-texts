         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Full and True ACCOUNT Of the Strange Diſcovery of the Suppoſed Murther, OF Mr. Thomas Tedder</head>
            <argument>
               <p>In <hi>Black Swan-Alley</hi> in <hi>Pauls-Church-Yard,</hi> who hath not been heard of this 5 Years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With the manner of the Diſcovery,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By Letters to ſeveral Perſons of Note, to ſearch a Vault in the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> where he formerly Lodg'd, where was found the Bones, and part of the Scull of the ſuppoſed Murthered Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With Mr.</hi> Allvens <hi>Examination,</hi>
                  <lb/>
Before the Lord <hi>Mayhr</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, and of his being Bound over to Anſwer it at the next <hi>Seſſions.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>UPon account of ſome Letters arrived here, whereof one to the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, one to— <hi>Andger</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Counſellor at Law, and the reſt to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Perſons of Note, giving an Account of a ſuſpitious Murder, thought to be committed by one Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> who keeps a great Toy-Shop near <hi>Deans-Court</hi> in <hi>Paul's Church-yard,</hi> upon a certain Gentleman, who lodged at his Houſe, a Juſtice of Peace in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who has not been heard of theſe ſince theſe five or ſix Years paſt; about which time, he was known to be at the ſaid <hi>Allen</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Black-ſwan-Alley,</hi> in <hi>Paul</hi>'s-<hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> and the ſaid Letters particularly inſiſting, that the ſaid <hi>Allen</hi>'s Houſe of Office ſhould be emptied and ſearched; and the ſaid <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Andger</hi> going to the Lord-Mayor, to acquaint him with the purport of the Letter, his Lordſhip finding it to agree with that ſent to him, gave orders on laſt <hi>Friday</hi> for emptying the ſaid Vault, and ordered the other Gentlemen concerned to take care to ſee all that came out carefully examined: Which being done accordingly, we are told that the ſaid Night-men found a piece of a Scull with Hair upon it, and ſeveral other Bones, which were carefully kept and carried; together with Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> and the Night-men, before his Lordſhip; where the Night-men declared, That beſides the Soil which they took out, they brought alſo a good quantity of Lime, which gave ſome ſuſpition that the ſaid Lime had been thrown in to conſume the Fleſh of the party ſuppoſed to be Murdered.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> owned, as I am told, that he put in the ſaid Lime, but alledged, that it was to ſave the charge of emptyng the Vault, becauſe he did not think of living long there, and to prevent annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Neighbours by the Stench. Some Surgeons were ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give their Verdict upon the Bones this Night, which all agreed that it was the Scull and Bones of ſome Perſon, thought to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. However, upon the whole, the ſaid <hi>Allen</hi> is bound over to anſwer the ſame the next Seſſions, and has given Six Hundred Pound Bail to anſwer it accordingly.</p>
