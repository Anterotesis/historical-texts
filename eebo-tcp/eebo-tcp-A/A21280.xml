            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> ſlaundered with a Booke ſet out by one <hi>Anthony Munday,</hi> concerning the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the ſayd lewde people, which for the trueth thereof, is almoſt as farre differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from trueth, as darknes from light, and as contrary to trueth, as an egge is contrary in likenes to an oyſter.</p>
            <p>And therefore, conſidering, I am able to report a troth for the manner of the finding and taking of the ſaide ſeditious perſons, (although fine skil be farre from me to paint it out) hoping the wiſe will beare with my want therein, and eſteeme a true tale, bee it neuer ſo bluntly told, rather then a lye, be it neuer ſo finely handled: I haue imboldened my ſelfe to take this Treatiſe in hand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (God willing) I wil deſcribe nothing but truth as in brief by the ſequele ſhal appeare. Which is this: That aboutes foure yeeres paſt, (the Diuell being a craftie Foxe, and chiefe Patrone doubtles of the Popes prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie) hauing diuers and many Officers and inferiour ſubſtitutes to the Pope his chiefe Viear, and inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding by them, to encreaſe the kingdome of this Antichriſt. Diſperſed his ſayd officers in diuers places of this Realme,
<pb facs="tcp:19175:3"/>
where like vagrant perſons, (refuſing to liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>within the lawful gouernment of their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) they lead a looſe life, wandring &amp; run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hither and thither, from ſhire to ſhire, and countrey to countrey, with ſuch ſtore of Romiſh relikes, popiſh pelfe, trifles &amp; traſh, as were able to make any Chriſtian hearte (that hath ſeene the tryall of ſuch practifes as I haue done) eue for ſorrow to bleed, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-thereby to drawe the Queenes Maieſtres ſubiects their heartes and faithes both from God and her highneſſs, as namely by deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto them Bulles from Rome, Pardons, Indulgences, Medalls, Agnus Dei, hallowed graines and beades, Crucifixes, painted pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; ſuch other paltrie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euery part wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they will not let to ſay to bee matters ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſary for ſaluation. By reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (moſt louing Reader) I my ſelfe about that time by the ſpace of one quarter of an yeere together, was deepely be witched and drawn into their darkneſſe, as the blindeſt bayarde of them all. But at the laſt euen then, by Gods great goodneſſe, mightie prouidence, and eſpeciall grace, all their inchauntments, witcheraftes, ſorceries, diueliſhe deuiſes and practiſes we are ſo broken and vntyed in me
<pb facs="tcp:19175:4"/>
and the brightneſſe of Gods diuine Maieſtie ſhining ſo ſurely in my hearte and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that I perceiued all their doings to bee as they are in deede, only ſhewes without ſubſtance, manifeſt errours and deceitful iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling caſtes and none others. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I determined with my ſelf (for certain cauſes which I omit) to ſound the depth of their diueliſh drifts (if I might) &amp; the rather therefore vſed and frequented their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, whereby appeared vnto me not a few of their vngracious and villanous falſe harts faiths, and diſloyall mindes, ſlaunderous wordes, and moſt vile treaſons, towardes my moſt excellent and noble myſtrys the Queenes maieſtie, and towardes diuers of her moſt honourable priuie councell, in ſuch ſorte as many times did make mine eyes to guſh out with teares for very ſorrowe and feare to thinke of it. Wherefore lately I made my humble ſubmiſſion vnto the right honourable her Highneſſe priuie councell for my vnlawful liuing as aforeſaid: at whoſe handes I founde ſuch honourable dealing &amp; by their meanes ſuch mercie from her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, that I wiſhe with all my hearte all the papiſts which are ſubiects borne to her high
<pb facs="tcp:19175:4"/>
neſſe to runne the ſame courſe that I haue doone, and then ſhoulde they eaſily ſee what difference there is betweene the good and mercifull dealing of our moſt gracious louing and naturall prince: &amp; the great trecheries of that great enimie to our Countrie the Pope. For her highneſſe freely forgiueth offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but the Pope pardoneth for money: her graces handes are continually full of mercie, readie to deliuer enough freely to any that will deſire and deſerue it, and the Pope his great clutches and fiſtes, are readie to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nothing but diueliſh deuiſes and paltrie ſtuffe of his owne making, to ſet Countrie and Countrie together by the eares, and yet for theſe hath hee money. Truly it is a moſt lamentable caſe, that euer any Chriſtian ſhould be ſeduced and drawne from the true worſhipping of God, and their duetie to their Prince and Countrie (as many are) by the Pope and his ſatanicall crewe. I beſeech God turne their heartes, and graunt vs all amendment, which can neither be too time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (if it were preſently) nor neuer too late, whenſoeuer it ſhall happen, vnleſſe wilfully they proceede in their dealings, which God forbid: for <hi>humanum eſt errare, perſeuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>

But God I take to witneſſe I neuer was of that opinion, that it came to mée by any other meanes, but onely by ryding poſt two or thrée iournies about the buſines aforeſaide, yet within one day or two after my ſicknes, there came to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours houſe where I lodged in South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke one Myſtrys <hi>Beyſaunt</hi> a widow,
