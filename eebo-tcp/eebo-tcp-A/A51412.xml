         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as to the present Enquiry. The <hi>words</hi>
thus Explained, we come now to view
the <hi>parts</hi> of the Text, wherein we have.</p>
            <p>1. Two <hi>Acts. Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Author</hi> of them, <hi>God;</hi> to whom
the Prayer is Directed.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Modification</hi> of them; <hi>wholly,

            <p>4. The <hi>Subject,</hi> the <hi>whole man,</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the <hi>Whole Spirit, both Soul and Body.</hi>
And this Last it is, with which (at present)
we are mostly concerned.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Whole Man</hi> is sometimes expressed
by only two words <hi>[Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> or
<hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Body]</hi> which are the two phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical,
or constituent parts of Man. SO
1 Cor. 6. 20. <hi>Ye are Bought with a price,

therefore Glorifie God in your Body, and in
your Spirits which are Gods.</hi> Also in 2 <hi>Cor.

our selves from all filthiness of the Flesh and

by three particulars, is a matter
wherein Expositors do differ, and I find
these several Interpretations of the place.</p>
            <p>1. Some will have <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> to be
put <hi>Exegetically;</hi> as if both signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Austin.</hi>) But (indeed methinks) this
here seems a little harsh, because needless;
for <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> (as
it is in the two fore-cited Scriptures)
were Intelligible enough to express the
two physical constituents of a man. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the particle [<hi>Kl. And,</hi> or rather
<hi>Both</hi>] seems to connect Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it,, <hi>And</hi> Soul,
as two things that have some Distinction
between them.</p>
            <p>2. Others will have <hi>Spirit</hi> to signifie
the <hi>Mind and Understanding;</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> the
<hi>Will and Affections (Calvin, Marlorate,</hi> and
divers other) from whom I would not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48797:8"/>
willingly Dissent, and therefore shall not
slight their Judgment; yet I must humbly
profess, however clear the Notion was to
them, it is not so to me; for that which
they call <hi>Soul</hi> is as truly <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Faculty (the <hi>Intellect.</hi>) Yea, I find
the Expressions quite Transverse; As if
<hi>Soul</hi> signified the <hi>Intellectual</hi> Faculty and
<hi>Spirit</hi> the <hi>Volitive</hi>) in <hi>Mary's</hi> Song. <hi>Luk.

                  </gap>y Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
As if she had said; My <hi>Soul,</hi> (that
is, my Mind and Understanding) <hi>Doth
Magnify (i. e.</hi> Has high Thoughts of God,
great Estimation of him; which are Acts
of the <hi>Intellect,</hi> and the only Internal
Magnification of him) And my <hi>Spirit,
(i. e.</hi> my <hi>Will and Affections</hi>) hath Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
(which is their proper Act.) This to
me seems more currant, if in this place
there be a <hi>Distinction</hi> between <hi>Soul</hi> and
<hi>Spirit.</hi> But I will not Assert it, I rather
think there is none here; only her Inward
Joy of heart, being great; her Outward
Expressions thereof in words, are Enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
Soul and Spirit in a <hi>Pleonasm</hi> signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

present Conceptions of the word <hi>Spirit</hi> in

            <p>3. Some will have <hi>Spirit</hi> (in our Text)

               </gap>iour Powers (contrary
to that <hi>Logical</hi> Rule. <hi>Denomination is from

capable of other Sanctification then that

               </gap>ch
belongs to a man in a proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
sense; and of this kind there seem
to be four distinct Significations of the
word. Such as.</p>
            <p>1. When taken for the <hi>Soul</hi> (the <hi>forma
hominis</hi>) Resigned up to God in Death.
So I understand <hi>David, Psa. 31. 5. Unto
thee, O Lord I commit my Spirit;</hi> (howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
men deal with my <hi>Body;</hi>) And this
the rather, because <hi>Christ,</hi> at his Death u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the same words, must needs be so
understood. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 46. Agreeable to
<hi>Eccles. 12. 7. The Spirit returns to God who
gave it.</hi> And in the same sense also, <hi>Ch.
11. 5. Thou knowest not the way of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
nor how the Bones grow in the womb.</hi>
That is, (as I take it) Thou understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not how the <hi>Soul</hi> doth form the <hi>Body,</hi>
as an Habitation for it self. 'Tis the <hi>Inward</hi>
part of man; so the Exegesis seems very
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48797:10"/>
plain, in that <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 9. With <hi>my Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
have I desired thee in the night; yea, with
my Spirit within me will I seek thee early;
i. e.</hi> with my inward man I <hi>have,</hi> and
<hi>will,</hi> apply my self to thee: from whence
arises a <hi>Tropical</hi> sense of Spirit, namely
to signifie <hi>Sincerity. God is my witness,
whom I Serve in my Spirit in the Gospel,
Rom.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Spirit</hi> is taken for the <hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>Union</hi>
of Soul and Body; or Souls being in
the <hi>State of Union.</hi> So I understand, <hi>Iob.
10. 12. thou hast granted me Life, and thy
visitation hath preserved my Spirit;</hi> namely
to continue in and with my Body. And
ch. 34. 14. 15 <hi>If God gather to himself mans
spirit and his breath, all flesh shall perish to
gether, and man shall turn again unto Dust.</hi>
Thus tis said of the Damsel. whom our
Saviour Raysed to Life; <hi>Her Spirit came
again, and she arose Luk 8. 55. came again
(ie)</hi> to be <hi>again United</hi> to her Body. We
Read <hi>Ecl.</hi> 3. 21. of the <hi>Spirit of a man, that
goes upwards; and the Spirit of a beast that
goeth Downwards,</hi> If the <hi>Spirit</hi> in both
parts be understood in the same sense (as
most likely it is); then either <hi>Brutes</hi>
have <hi>proper</hi> Spirits (which many are
loath to admit;) or the Spirit of man
must signifie but the <hi>Life,</hi> which is all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48797:11"/>
(if not more, then) some will allow to
Beasts. Again, <hi>Chap. 8. 8. No man hath
power over the Spirit, to Retain the Spirit in
the Day of Death.</hi> i. e. No man is M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ster
of his own <hi>Life</hi> to prolong it. To the
same purpose is that Expression in <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi>
Prayer, <hi>Isa. 38. 16. O Lord by these
things men Live, and in all these things is
the Life of my Spirit, so wilt thou Recover
me, and make me to Live.</hi> He me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns not
by the <hi>Life of his Spirit;</hi> the continued
Duration of his Ever-living Soul, but
the continuance of its <hi>Union</hi> with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
whereby the Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of his person should
be prolonged.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spirit,</hi> in this sense taken, may indeed
be <hi>Sanctified.</hi> The <hi>Life</hi> may be Devoted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God; according to that of the Apostle.
<hi>Rom 14. 8. Whether we Live, we Live unto the
Lord; or Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther we Dye</hi> &amp;c. But this (I
think is not the direct meaning of the
<hi>Spirit</hi> in our Text.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Spirit</hi> is taken for some special <hi>Faculties,</hi>
or particular <hi>Acts</hi> of the mind; such as,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Understanding,</hi> Prov. 20. 27. <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of a man is the Candle of the Lord,
searching all the Inward Parts of the Belly;</hi>
not in an <hi>Anatomical,</hi> but <hi>Moral</hi> Sense;
The Understanding is set up by God
in man (as a Candle) to search and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48797:11"/>
find out by its Exercise, all those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Acts and Inclinations which would
othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wise lie hidden and undiscovered.
So that, <hi>Isa. 29. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They that Erred in
Spirit, shall come to Understanding, and
they that Murmured, shall Learn Doctrine.</hi>
That is, they that had misapprehensions
of Me, and my Ways, shall come to
<hi>Understanding</hi> (not the <hi>Faculty,</hi> but)
the <hi>Rectitude</hi> thereof; and they that
Murmured, whose <hi>Wills</hi> were averse to
embrace Truth shall be graciously Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Learn that which is Right.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Fancy</hi> or Imagination is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to be understood by <hi>Spirit.</hi> Ezek.
13. 3. <hi>Wo unto the Foolish Prophets, that
follow their own Spirit, and have seen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
or that walk after the things which
they have not seen; (as in orig.) which
God hath not Revealed to them, but
they have fabricated to themselves out
of their Evil Hearts and Foolish Fancies
or Imaginations.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Spirit</hi> is also taken for the
<hi>Thoughts upon,</hi> or Remembring of some
person or thing. Thus the Apostle Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
his <hi>Thinking</hi> of the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
I Cor. 5. 3. I <hi>verily as absent in Body, but
present in Spirit, have judged already, as
tho' I were present, concerning him that hath
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48797:12"/>
done this Deed.</hi> He thought of them
and their Affairs; tho' at a distance
from them. So of the <hi>Colossians, Chap.
2. 5. Tho' I he absent in the Flesh, yet am
I with you in the Spirit, Ioying and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
your order, and the stedfastness of
your Faith in Christ.</hi> He Rejoyced to
behold their Graces by the eye of his
mind, his Cogitations of them. And
thus much of the Souls <hi>Faculties</hi> or <hi>Acts,</hi>
for which sometimes the word <hi>Spirit</hi> is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aken.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Spirit</hi> is Lastly taken for some <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,</hi>
or <hi>Inclinations</hi> of the mind <hi>as
United</hi> to the Body, and <hi>Conformed</hi>
much thereunto.</p>
            <p>This is the product of <hi>Nature, Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi>
and <hi>Circumstances</hi> of Life, all which
concur to form the GENIUS, <hi>Temper,</hi> or
<hi>Disposition</hi> of man. Each man hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>peculiar</hi> to himself in this Respect;
as he has in the Features of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
Stature, Shape, Meen or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of his Body, whereby he is Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished
from any other. So, if we
ask, [What <hi>Spirit</hi> is he of?] we mean,
of what Temper, Inclination or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us?
How Disposed? How Qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ified?
And the true Answers will be as various,
as men; of whom <hi>one</hi> man is (by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48797:12"/>
Acquisition, or both) of a sober,
grave Spirit. <hi>Another</hi> of a Quick, Active,
Chearful Spirit. <hi>Another</hi> of a weak, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous,
Careful; <hi>Some</hi> are Gentiel, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,
Courteous, Open Hearted; <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
Churlish, Clownish, Surly, Rough,
Close and Reserved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All these <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
are viciated by Corrupt Nature;
and may by the Spirit of Grace be so
Sanctified, as to Render men <hi>Serviceable,</hi>
tho' in a <hi>different</hi> way, and of good
acceptance both with God and man.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>This</hi> I take to be the <hi>most proper</hi>
meaning of the word <hi>Spirit</hi> Here in the
Text; And then the sense of it is,</p>

            <p>I rather take it thus. The Apostle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

implies that this work should be done,
with all Sincerity, for that they had to do
herein with a Heart-searching God; This
is manifest by the Energie of his Word,
which openeth to a man the Secrets of his
Soul; for the word is <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iving</hi> or <hi>Quick,</hi> &amp;c.
As if he had said; God, who made man,
knows him altogether, and better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
what is in man, than man does
what is in himself. Man has but Dark
Apprehensions of himself, and therein oft
times grosly does mistake; B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t God by

fully to him what he else would
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48797:14"/>
not take notice of: His <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> lye
close together (as do his <hi>Ioynts</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi>)
But, as the <hi>Anatomists Knife</hi> lays
open the <hi>one</hi> Difference; so the piercing
Two Edged Sword of the <hi>Word,</hi> does the
<hi>other:</hi> That word shews him, How his
<hi>Soul</hi> came pure out of the Hand of God;
but he hath added thereto a vicious <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
by the perverting of what God did
make upright.</p>
            <p>Let not man therefore charge God foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly,
and say (as <hi>Adam</hi> did concerning
<hi>Eve</hi>) From the <hi>Soul</hi> which thou gavest
me all my faults do arise: No, It is from
that Evil <hi>Spirit,</hi> which man hath to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Acquired: His <hi>Soul</hi> indeed has the
<hi>powers,</hi> but 'tis his Spirit that gives the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,</hi>
which (in a natural corrupt State)
are wholly bent unto Evil. Thus the
<hi>Malady</hi> is opened and searched by the
word, and the <hi>Cure</hi> is also by the same
word prescribed: As here in the Text;
Namely <hi>Sanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much for the <hi>first</hi> particular;
That there is in Scripture such a <hi>Distinction,</hi>
betwixt the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>Constitution</hi> of this <hi>Spirit</hi>
or <hi>Genius,</hi> is an <hi>Aggregate</hi> or <hi>Resultant</hi>
from the Connexion of divers things in
Man: As his <hi>Souls Faculties;</hi> his <hi>Bodies
Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48797:14"/>
His <hi>Acquired Habits,</hi> by Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Examples, or Customes; And Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
The <hi>Outward Adjacents,</hi> or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of his present Life. A little of
each of these.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Faculties</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> (as Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
Will, Sensitive Appetite or
Passions) are all Ingredients as the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
Matter</hi> of this <hi>Spirit</hi> in Man; But
the <hi>Modification</hi> of them is from the other
Causes. <hi>Souls</hi> in themselves are all <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual;</hi>
but the <hi>Spirits</hi> are vastly <hi>Different</hi>
one from another. And this is from the
particulars that follow, and in a chief
manner from</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Temperament</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi>
which is (more or less) Different in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Individual Man. As there are scarce
Two Pebbles on the Sea Beach, or Two
Chips hewen from the same wood, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
figured alike; Nay, As there are
hardly Two Faces, Gestures, or Meenes
of Men (which are the outward Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their Inward Constitutions) But
doe in some things Differ, tho' some
are more alike than others: Even so it
is with their <hi>Temperaments,</hi> which are a
chief Ingredient into their <hi>Spirits,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we now speak. That saying of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
<hi>[Manners of the Mind follow
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48797:15"/>
the Temperament of the Body]</hi> is true if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood with a due Temper, or

            <p>Nor must we understand by this, our

as if, The <hi>Body</hi> has an <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
Influence upon the <hi>Soul</hi> to Induce
(as it were) a new form upon it; for
the <hi>Soul</hi> is the <hi>Active</hi> part, in Man, and
the Body nothing so. But the thing
stands thus.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Soul,</hi> which is a <hi>True Spirit</hi> (in
a Nobler Sense, than that whereof we are
now treating) being, by its <hi>Information</hi> of the

while it is in the State of Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and Union in Man, <hi>Uses</hi> the

or <hi>Organs,</hi> in all its Operations.
Now as a Workman Receiveth nothing of
his strength or skill, from his Tools where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

with he works; yet in the Exercise of
his Abilities he will find himself much
furthered or hindred in his business, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as his Tool is either Apt, or Unapt,
for his Work. So is it in this Case: The
<hi>Soul</hi> Receives no power from the <hi>Body;</hi>
But in Exerting its own proper powers, is
helped or hindred by the <hi>Bodys</hi> good or
ill <hi>Temperament.</hi> Thus an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Habits (whether good or evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are formed

All vicious and erroneous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,

of Youth, when they are stepping from

to chuse their own way; then, (if ever)
<hi>Multum Refert quocum vixeris;</hi> it concerns
you to think where you dwell. The force
of Example is set forth in that <hi>(Prov. 22.

and fascinating Insinuation, whereby, at

Ill things, to which we are enured is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much abated. So as, not only the
<hi>Vices</hi> themselves under some false name
(such as Gallantry of Spirit, Greatness of
Soul, Scorning to take an injury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
put fair for an approbation, and are conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious;
But even the <hi>Inclinations</hi> to them, &amp;

spread themselves from one person to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>And, so also (in some measure, tho' not
casually) may we expect in things of a
<hi>better Character. Prov. 13. 20. He that

Which place (I think) does not only
intimate Gods usual Blessing upon fit

to operate, in a Moral way upon the minds
of men: not indeed to give the <hi>Truth</hi> of

much in the City, has more of Civility,
Sagacity, and Cunning. One, who lives
where News is frequently Talked, Gets
somewhat of a Publick Spirit: Amongst

Amongst Souldiers, a Bold and Boysterous

vary <hi>mens spirits,</hi> and that in a

Contract and Emasculate the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If these are of a long continued Series,
they do very much towards the forming
of a setled and fixed <hi>Genius.</hi> But if only
Occasionally, or at certain times they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur;
then they vary and <hi>Contemperate</hi>
the <hi>Setled Spirit</hi> for a season; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
become a means to Reduce it to a

and Airy Spirit, and for the most part
in all good Circumstances, (may at
such times) be unmanageable by Advice;
until perhaps, a particular sore A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Explaining of our <hi>General Notion,</hi> shall be

of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> have the <hi>principal</hi> stroak

that are <hi>External</hi> to the Essence of man;
the Accidental Inherents, and Adjacents;
do but somewhat <hi>Modify</hi> and <hi>Affect</hi> the

            <p>This <hi>Active Spirit,</hi> while <hi>Unsanctifyed</hi> is

to make a Proselyte. In a word; They
are the <hi>nimblest Servants</hi> of the Devil, and

            <p>But if <hi>Sanctified,</hi> Then, none so <hi>Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
to God, or Man. Such <hi>Spirits</hi> will
make men <hi>willing</hi> to do Service. (as <hi>Exo.
35. 21.) They came every one, whose Heart
stirred him up; and every one, whose Spirit
made him willing;</hi> and <hi>they brought the
Lords Offering to the work of the Tabernacle.</hi>
'Tis not said, [whom <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> made
willing] Tho' that is most true, as to the
<hi>First Cause;</hi> But <hi>[whose Spirit made him
willing, whose heart stirred him up]</hi> That
is, his <hi>own</hi> Spirit, being <hi>Sanctified</hi> by
the Spirit of God: Here the <hi>Second

<hi>First.</hi> And indeed God often <hi>Warms</hi>
and <hi>Raises up</hi> mens Spirits for any noble
Designs, in which he intends to use
them. So in those <hi>(Ezra 1. 1.) The

<hi>Then rose up the chief of the Fathers, the Priests
and the Levites, with all them, whose Spirit
God had Raised to go up (v.</hi> 5.) Not
<hi>All</hi> the People, but some <hi>Chief</hi> men: men
(its likely) that were of <hi>Large Souls,</hi> act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive
and Gallant Spirits in themselves, fitted
for Noble designs; but (alas;) they
were so shrunk, and sunk by their long
Captivity, that neither <hi>In nate</hi> briskness,
nor the <hi>Encouragement</hi> which <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave
them, was sufficient to Chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>p them up,
till God <hi>Sanctifyed their Spirits,</hi> and raised
them above themselves to this Pious and
Noble undertaking. Two of them are
mentioned <hi>by Name</hi> (besides others, Hag.
1. 14.) <hi>The Lord stirred up the Spirit of</hi>
Zerubbabel, <hi>the Governour; &amp;</hi> Joshua, <hi>the
High Priest;</hi> and <hi>the Spirit of all the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the People,</hi> and they came and did
work in the house. Now, was it the
<hi>Souls</hi> of these men? Or, the <hi>men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</hi>
Methinks tis more Genuine, <hi>The
Spirits</hi> of those men in the sense we now
propose.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48797:22"/>This <hi>Active Spirit,</hi> uses to discover and
express it self (as is befere noted) in a
strong Inclination, <hi>&amp;</hi> vigorous Motion.
<hi>Elihu</hi> speaks of a <hi>Spirit</hi> in man (<hi>Iob</hi> 32
8.) which I suppose is the same, to
which he hath Reference. (<hi>v.</hi> 18.) <hi>I
am full of matter</hi> (or words) <hi>and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
within me</hi> (or of my Belly) <hi>constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
me (v. 20.) I will speak, that I may
be refreshed.</hi> Now <hi>Elihu</hi> was the <hi>youngest</hi>
of <hi>Iobs</hi> Friends, as he himself intimates
(<hi>v.</hi> 6, 7.) and upon that account, in
part, he is more earnest, and copious,
then the rest; the Ardour, and Activity
of his Spirit, caused an eager desire in
him to express his mind; which he
calls the <hi>Constraining of his Spirit.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there was somewhat of <hi>anger</hi> in the
case, (besides his <hi>Youthful Warmth</hi>) we
shall have occasion to reflect upon this
instance again; and then shew more of
this vigorous Motion, and strong Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
under the Head of <hi>Zeal,</hi> to which
we shall referr it.</p>
            <p>3. This <hi>Hotter Spirit,</hi> is a Spirit of
<hi>Courage</hi> &amp; <hi>Boldness,</hi> to address Difficultys,
and meet with Evil.</p>
            <p>This shews it self divers ways.</p>
            <p>1. Sometimes in a wrath for <hi>War;</hi>
which God <hi>Stirs up</hi> or <hi>Abates,</hi> as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48797:22"/>
to his own holy purposes. Thus
to Impoverish, take, and lead Captive the
Idolatrous <hi>Israelites,</hi> (1 Chron. 5. 26.)
<hi>The God of</hi> Israel, <hi>stirred up the Spirit of
Pull, King of Assyria, and Tilgath Pilne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
King of Assyria, and he carried them
away.</hi> The former took their Goods (2 King.
15. 19.) <hi>Menahem gave Pull</hi> a Thousand
Talents of Silver (that is an Hundred
and Eighty Seven Thousand, One Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds) <hi>And he turned back, and
staid not in the Land.</hi> This was a Vast
Sum; But the other came and swept
all both Goods, and Persons too.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, He <hi>Abates</hi> also
Mens Courage, and takes down their
<hi>Spirits. He shall cut off the Spirit of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
He is terrible to the Kings of the Earth</hi>
(psal. 76. 12.) Thus <hi>Moses</hi> Prophecy
of the Dukes of <hi>Edom,</hi> and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Canaan</hi> (Exod. 15. 16.) <hi>Fear

greatness of thine Arm; they shall be as
still, as a stone, till thy People pass o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
O Lord.</hi> And to the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
is that Promise, (Ex. 11: 7.) <hi>But
against any of the Children of Israel, shall
not a Dog move his Tongue.</hi> The Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
and Spirit of a Dog, is (you know)
to Bark at Strangers: This is an effect
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48797:23"/>
of Heat and Boldness in that Animal,
where it is but a little afraid; but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it be greatly Terrifyed, it will then Run
and hide it self in silence: So some
Men, that would in their wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
both Bite and Devour, may
be yet so far over awed by Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that they dare not so much as
Bark at his People.</p>
            <p>2. Sometimes in a stout Resolvedness
of Mind, that will take no discouragement;
this is to have <hi>a Heart like that of a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(2. Sam.</hi> 17. 10.) Now a Lyon,
<hi>when a multitude of Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

1:) So that you see both ways, in
the <hi>Abundance</hi> and in the <hi>Defect,
Spirit,</hi> Signifies Courage and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now if this Spirit be <hi>Unsanctifyed,</hi> tis
a stoutness in evil: that will be ready
to say, (with <hi>Pharoah) Who is the Lord?</hi>
Tis Obstinacy and Hardning; <hi>Sihon King
of Heshbon would not let us pass; for the Lord
had hardned his Spirit, and made his Heart
Obstinate (Deut.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 30.) This may be
also the meaning of the <hi>perverse Spirit min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
among the Egyptians, (Isa.</hi> 19. 14.)
that is, a quarrelsome and contentious
Spirit, among themselves, whereby their
Councils were Divided, and their Affairs

enough against one the other; but
for <hi>Publik</hi> defence, <hi>Aegypt shall be like unto

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48797:24"/>
that set not their hearts aright, whose

(<hi>v.</hi> 9.) that, how Sturdy soever they were
against God; yet against their Enemies
they were very Cowards, or God, in Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
made them so, for their Stubborness
against him. <hi>The Children of Ephraim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Armed, and carrying Bows, turned back

            </p>
            <p>But, If <hi>Sanctified,</hi> 'tis an <hi>Excellent Spirit,</hi>
and of great use. This was that <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Spirit</hi> of <hi>Caleb</hi> (Numb: 14. 24.)
The Spirit of the other Spies was Base and
Cowardly, and caused the heart of the
<hi>People to melt</hi> (Iosh. 18. 8.) at which God
was greatly displeased; but <hi>Calebs</hi> cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
was approved, and accepted of
God, tho' it had not its desired effect
upon men; and was Rewarded with
admission into the Land of Promise,
when others were excluded.</p>
            <p>This Spirit <hi>Sanctified,</hi> is a Spirit Bound
Bent, and Resolved, in the service of
God what-ever be the Hazards. <hi>And
now bohold</hi> (says <hi>Paul) I go bound in the

all these foreseen difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to break thorow which he was

'Tis <hi>always good to be Zealous

            <p>Take a view of his <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Earnest Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
in some particulars. At <hi>Athens his

'twas full of Gods, without the True God,

the Christ. <hi>(chap. 18. 5.)</hi> Now when was
this? 'Twas <hi>when Silas and Timotheus, were

then he Reasoned and perswaded every

(Prov.</hi> 27. 17.) He had good <hi>Metall</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but now is a Keen <hi>Edg</hi> put upon
it. Whether it were, that they brought

a pegg higher: or else that they were to
be his Fellow Travellers; and so, being
now <hi>Ready to Depart (v.</hi> 7.) He was
bravely resolved to out with that, which
had so long broyled in his Bosome.
Some way or other (whatever it were)
it had relation to their coming, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
his Spirit was enlarged. He had a
<hi>Good Spirit</hi> before, but now a <hi>Great one</hi>
His <hi>Zeal</hi> before was <hi>kindled,</hi> but now it
breaks out. He cares not now, what
they said, or thought of him; he now
Ruffles them; Roundly delivers his Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony;
shakes his Raiment at them;
Tells them their own; and throws the
Blood of their Obstinacy upon their own
Heads. So much may <hi>Outward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>

sometimes Help forward the actings
of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> in a <hi>Sanctifyed
Spirit:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis manifest he was of a <hi>vehement
Spirit,</hi> and eager in all things. When
he missed his friend, he could not stay
at <hi>Troas</hi> (tho' he might have done it
to good purpose; for there a <hi>Door was
opened to him of the Lord (2 Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But he had no rest in his Spirit; because
he found not Titus his Brother there,</hi> and
away he must, <hi>into Macedonia after him.</hi>
(<hi>v.</hi> 13.)</p>
            <p>Doubtless, the Apostles Removes, were
by direction of the Spirit of God; but
yet (oftentimes) they were according
to <hi>Humane Affection or Spirit,</hi> Tho' secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
over-ruled by God for his Holy ends
Thus, this <hi>Hot Spirited Man</hi> was parted

39.) <hi>The Contention was so sharp that they
parted;</hi> one to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and the other to
<hi>Syria &amp; Cylicia;</hi> but both about the

            <p>Another Instance of his <hi>Zealous,</hi> Sturdy,
and Vehement <hi>Spirit,</hi> was his Carriage
to <hi>Peter: 1 withstood him to the face;</hi>
(Gal. 2: 11) <hi>Peter,</hi> was <hi>Pauls</hi> elder

(perhaps) in the case, would have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

to his Grace, that fitted him
to <hi>Speak Boldly in the Synagogues; and

            </p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Froward Peevishness,</hi> in this
Colder and Mournful Spirit, we have a
Notable Instance in the <hi>Israelites;</hi> who
could not hear what was <hi>Reasonable,</hi> and
might be <hi>Comfortable,</hi> to them. God by
<hi>Moses</hi> had sent them a very good and
Gracious Word; A Promise of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance;
of being their God, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48797:34"/>
them to be his People; <hi>And Moses
spake so, unto the Children of Israel; But
they hearkened not unto Moses, for Anguish</hi>
(or Shortness) or Spirit, and <hi>for Cruel
Bondage,</hi> which was the occasion thereof.
(<hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 9.) They were in this <hi>Like</hi>
weeping <hi>Rachel,</hi> who <hi>Refused,</hi> and <hi>would
not be Comforted. (Mat. 2. 18.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From these <hi>Instances</hi> (besides frequent
<hi>Experience,</hi>) we may Learn, That the
<hi>Consequents</hi> of a sad <hi>Unsanctifyed Spirit</hi> are
Deplorable; All manner of Evil, <hi>Natural,
Moral</hi> and <hi>Iudicial. Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi>
seem to be pointed at in that Expression
(2 Cor. 7. 10.) <hi>The sorrow of the world
worketh Death.</hi> This may referr to both;
'tis both a <hi>Sin</hi> and a <hi>Mischief;</hi> as appears
by the <hi>Antitheta</hi> (in the former part of
the verse.) <hi>Godly Sorrow worketh Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to Salvation, not to be Repented of;</hi>
Therefore (by the Rule of contrari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s)
Worldly Sorrow is <hi>Sin,</hi> unto <hi>Destruction,</hi>
and to be Repented of by those, who

not the <hi>Subject</hi> of Anger, because it would
not be the <hi>Object</hi> thereof; always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with self-secking; and its

This <hi>Gallio-like</hi> Spirit <hi>cares for none of these
things.</hi> (Acts 18. 17.) But wholly Leaves
men to their own Course, without any

A Professor of such a Spirit is but

must be acknowledged of it: That of

The <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Elias</hi> (under which
you would cover your passions) Has
done its <hi>Preparatory</hi> work in Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist;
But now the <hi>Evangelical-Spirit</hi> hence

full of <hi>meekness, sweetness,</hi> and <hi>gentleness</hi>
of mind; which by your present talk,
you seem little to understand; You (as

to every good purpose. Therefore</p>
            <p>3. Some men are of a more <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Spirit,</hi> which is <hi>Cool</hi> in Respect of
the Heats; and <hi>Warm,</hi> in Respect of the
<hi>Chills</hi> of Spirit, in the former two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams.
All the <hi>Conveniencies;</hi> of those it
has, without their <hi>Inconveniencies;</hi> This
is the Well-balanced Spirit, that moves
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48797:43"/>
Evenly, Smoothly, and Firmly; The
Vessel of due proportion, betwixt Hull,
and Sayl, which usually well Arrives at
its intended Port. 'Tis the <hi>faelix Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries</hi>
of the Philosophers, that naturally
<hi>Disposes to,</hi> and <hi>Adapts for, General</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
'Tis best enabled to Use its own
Abilities; and manage its own powers,
whether <hi>Intellectual</hi> or <hi>Volitive</hi> to the best
Advantage.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Intellectual</hi> by a moderation, and
order of Thoughts; of a sufficient <hi>Heat
to Excite</hi> them, and yet of <hi>Coolness</hi> enough
to <hi>Govern</hi> them, and their Effects, which
otherwise might be Exorbitant. 'Tis
not the <hi>Dull Soul,</hi> that thinks not <hi>Intense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of any</hi> thing; Nor the Phantastick
Air, that Huddles, and is <hi>precipitant in
all</hi> things. But it is such a well compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Spirit, as indeed <hi>Quickens</hi> a man to
Act, and yet Renders him <hi>Sober,</hi> and
<hi>Deliberate,</hi> in all his Actions. Hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises
<hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> in Matters,
and a <hi>firm Iudgment,</hi> that will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it self to be Biassed or Disordered
by any unruly <hi>Passions;</hi> But Governs
them by Reason; and brings and keeps
them in their due Subordaination.</p>
            <p>Whence follows</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Volitive</hi> Powers are well used,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48797:43"/>
and ordered by such a <hi>Moderate Spirit;</hi>
The <hi>Will</hi> is Benign, and the <hi>Passions</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.
The <hi>Will,</hi> and all the <hi>powers under</hi>
its Commands are Disposed to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
unto Right Reason. Hence <hi>This
Spirit</hi> is apt to be well governed <hi>In the
man;</hi> that has it; And thereby Renders
him more fit to Govern amongst <hi>other
men</hi> in the world; from both which it
may be Denominated <hi>A Spirit of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Of this brave Spirit was <hi>Titus
Vespasian,</hi> who from thence was called
(<hi>Humani Generis Deliciae</hi>) The Delights
of Mankind. Faithfulness, Candour,
Beneficence, and all other things that are
Excellent (so far as <hi>Nature</hi> can go)
have their Derivation from this Spirit;
because it is not so liable to the Infirmity
of Unruly Passions, which is the Natural
Cause of all the contrary Vices.</p>
            <p>Yet if this Rare and Excellent Spirit,
which is so very good <hi>in it self</hi> be <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctify'd</hi>
and Corrupt; 'Tis all as Bad, if
not worse, then the Rest. Corruption of
the best is worst. For</p>
            <p>1. Its <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> if <hi>Unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed,</hi>
is (at best) but <hi>Worldly Wisdom,</hi>
and Imployed wholly to serve Worldly
Interests: But it seldome stops there;
for it commonly proceeds in a way of

               <hi>Enmity</hi> against God and Goodness; And
becomes too often a <hi>Devilish Policy.</hi> If
the Enemies of the Church be men of
<hi>this Spirit,</hi> they are most Dangerous: 'Tis
the men of this Temper, that are the
<hi>Achitophels</hi> for Mischievous Counsels.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hot Spirited Huffs,</hi> and <hi>Hectors,</hi> may
have as great an Enmity, which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
shew in a <hi>storming rage;</hi> But their

them, of a discreet consideration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they overshoot themselves, and miss
their Designs. The Smooth-bootes that
look Demure, who can think and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive,

The Wolves in Sheeps-cloathing; (in a

(who by means of this <hi>Moderate
Spirit,</hi> may more easily so be.) These are
the Dangerous Enemies; These under

            <p>As to that <hi>General Vertue,</hi> in respect to

these <hi>Moral Vertues</hi> become <hi>True
Graces.</hi> In Heathens, where is no Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
yet, if God Excites their Spirits,
they become eminently Serviceable. So
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> who was of a Generous Noble
Temper in himself; yet how much did
he act above himself, when God stirred
up his Spirit (2 Cor. 36. 22.) <hi>The Lord
stirred up the Spirit of Cyrus King of Persia;</hi>
upon which he Issues forth a Noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.
(<hi>v.</hi> 23.) It was <hi>Cyrus his
Spirit,</hi> tho' <hi>stirred</hi> by God, and Inclined
to this special Service.</p>
            <p>But where Sanctification <hi>Renews the
whole man;</hi> and gives <hi>New Principles</hi> and
<hi>Ends</hi> in all their Actions; The whole
Nature of their Laudible Atchievements
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48797:49"/>
is also changed; so that, their <hi>Natural
Spirit</hi> of <hi>Candour</hi> becomes the Character
of a <hi>Blessed man, in whose Spirit there is
no Guile.</hi> (Psal. 32. 2.) Their <hi>Fidelity</hi>
comes from that <hi>Faithful Spirit, which</hi>
(on just occasion) <hi>Concealeth the matter,</hi>
and is commended for it. (Prov. 11. 13.)
Their <hi>Moderation of Affections</hi> is also from
a principle, that, not only <hi>Restrains</hi> (as
Heathen Morals do) but <hi>Mortifyes the
Affections and Lusts.</hi> (Gal. 5. 24. &amp; Col. 3.
5) Their <hi>Firmness</hi> is farther fortifyed by
<hi>Might in the Inner-man;</hi> (Eph. 3. 16.)
whereby they are <hi>stedfast, unmoveable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
abounding in the work of the Lord.</hi>
(1 Cor. 15. 18.) for, if their well-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<hi>Reasons</hi> do fix their purposes;
Much more will their well-grounded
<hi>Faith</hi> establish them. In a word; its <hi>own</hi>
Nature is Lovely; But <hi>Grace</hi> super-induced
renders it <hi>most</hi> Exemplary, Amiable, and
Useful in the World.</p>
            <p>And thus, we have done with the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Spirits</hi> that are in men. The
