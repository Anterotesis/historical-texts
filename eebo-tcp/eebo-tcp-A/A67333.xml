            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE shall make it appeare; the errour of Divines who would that a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch can be absolute, and that he can doe all things <hi>ad libitum</hi> receding not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their Text, (though that bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring too) but from the way their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession might teach them. <hi>Stare super vias antiquas,</hi> and remoove not the ancient bounds and Land-marks, which our Fathers have set.</p>
            <p>If to be absolute, were to be restrained by no Lawes; Then can no King in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom bee so, for they all stand obleidged to the Lawes Christian, and we aske no more, for to this Pillar, be our Priviledges fixt.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96506:3"/>
Our Kings at their <hi>Coronation,</hi> having taken a Sacred Oath, not to infring them, I am sorry these men take no more care, for the inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our faith of these things, which they tell us for our soules health; whilst we know them so manifestly in the wrong way, in that which concernes the Liberties and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Subjects of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They gain preferment, and then it is no matter, though they neither beleeve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor are beleeved by others. But since they are so ready, to let loose the Conscience of our Kings, we are the more carefully to proceed, for our protection against this Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit-law, by declaring, and reinforcing Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Lawes of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It is worthy the observation, how now this opinion, or rather this way of rising is even amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>For, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker</hi>) M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hooker,</hi> who was no refractory man, as they terme it thinks that the first goverment was arbitrary, untill it was found, that to live by one mans will, becoms all mens misery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> these are his words, and that these were the originall of invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lawes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96506:3"/>And (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) if wee looke farther backe, our Histories will tell us, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of this Kingdom, hath often been the Mediators, between the King and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to present and pray redresse of their greivances, and had reciprocally then, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much love and reverence from the people.</p>
            <p>But these Preachers more active then their Predecessors, and wiser then the Lawes, have found out a better forme of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The King must bee a more absolut Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, then any of his Predecessors, and to them he must owe it, though in the meane time, they hazard the hearts of his people, and involve Him into a thousand Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>For suppose, this forme of Government were inconvenient; (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) this is but a Supposition; for this five hundred yeares, it hath not onely maintained us in safety, but made us victorious over other Nations: But suppose, this form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were inconvenient; and they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Idea</hi> of one more convenient; Wee
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96506:4"/>
all know, how dangerous Innovations are, though to the better; and what hazard those Princes runne, that enterprize the Change of a long established Government.</p>
            <p>Now, (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi>) of all our Kings that have gone before, and of all that are to succeed in this happy race, why should so pious, and so good a King, be exposed to this trouble and hazard? Besides, that King so diverted, can never doe any great matters abroad.</p>
            <p>But, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker,</hi> whilst these men have thus bent their Witts, against the Law of their Country; have they not neglected their own profession? What Tares are grown up in the field, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they should have tilled? I leave it to a second Consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not but Religion be the first thing in our purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and desires; But that which is first in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is not alwayes to preced in order of time; for well-being, supposes a being; and the first impediment which men naturally, endeavour to remoove, is the want of those things, without which they cannot subsist. God first assigned unto <hi>Adam,</hi> maintenance
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96506:4"/>
of life, and added to him a title to the rest of the Creatures, before he appointed a Law to observe.</p>
            <p>And let me tell you, that if our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have any such designe, as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more easie, then to impose Religion on a people deprived of their Liberties, so there is nothing more hard, then to do the same upon free-men.</p>
            <p>And therefore (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Speaker</hi>) I Conclude with this motion, that there may be an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der presently made, that the first thing this House goes about, shalbe, the restoring of this Nation in generall, to the fundamentall and vitall Liberties, the prosperity of our Goods, and freedome of our Persons: And then We will forth-with, consider of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply desired.</p>
            <p>And thus shall We discharge the trust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in us, by those that sent us hither; And his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> shall see, that wee will make more then ordinary hast to satisfie <hi>his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi>; and we shall let all those know that seeke to hasten the matter of supply, that they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96506:5"/>
will so farre delay it, as they give no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to the Former.</p>
