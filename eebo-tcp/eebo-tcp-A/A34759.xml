            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>TYS,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Croeſus</hi> the Rich King, was dumbe in his Child-hood, &amp; ſo continued many years: he was never
<pb facs="tcp:104245:5"/>
heard to ſpeake a word, till <hi>Cyrus</hi> enter'd <hi>Sardis,</hi> and then, the Child ſeeing a common Souldier running upon his Father with a drawn ſword to kill him, brake forth into violent and articulate ſpeech, <hi>O man, kill not Croeſus!</hi> So that he, who till that time lived mute to himſelfe, then became a cleare ſpeaker for the ſaving of his Father.</p>
                  <p>This, <hi>Madam!</hi> in a ſence, is my very caſe. I had thought to have been mute in this kind for ever, and never to have ſpoken againe by my Pen in Print. Though many, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, even your Honour have endeavoured often to perſwade me to make ſome poor pieces of mine publike: But bring ſenſible of mine
<pb facs="tcp:104245:5"/>
owne weakneſs, I ſtood out, and was reſolved forever to forbeare. For Iam a Child, and cannot ſpeak; at leaſt, not with that skill, and energy that the Printing-preſſe calleth for: Yet now at laſt ſeeing my precious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his name in hazard (not of being ſtained, its not capable of that; Nor of being utterly forgotten, for his name is written in the Booke of <hi>Life,</hi> with Golden letters, and his praiſe ſhal be for ever in the Goſpel; but that his remembrance amongſt men (after this Generation) might have beene cut off by devouring time; to ſave the memory of my Father alive, I break ſilence.</p>
                  <p>I annex to his life, a piece of mine own. The reaſon why I do ſo, and
<pb facs="tcp:104245:6"/>
why I put forth <hi>this Sermon</hi> rather then any other, it is not for any worth that I apprehend in it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had a ſpecial calling to it: So ſoon as it was preached, the Major with the Aldermen, and ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters came to me, and with great earneſtneſſe, deſired me to print the Sermon, that ſo they might againe ſee what they had already heard. I did not yeild to them at that time. But now ſeeing that God hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe fow daies ſtirred up my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to do ſomething whereby I might honour my Father, before I go hence to meet him in another, and a better Country, I remembred my Friends requeſt, and did reſolve to anſwer their deſires, according to my poore
<pb facs="tcp:104245:6"/>
ability, though ſome few yeares after.</p>
                  <p>Why I preſume to tender this homely peece to your Honour, I ſhal humbly give a ſhort account; Partly for my Fathers ſake. <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his good old Father <hi>Iacob,</hi> brought him, and ſet him before the King. Give me leave alſo, Elect <hi>Lady!</hi> to bring my Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into your Honours preſence: It will be ſome grace to him on Earth; and had your Ladyſhip known him, you would have honoured him.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, becauſe the Subiect is ſoe ſuitable to your Honour all the way. Your Ladyſhip loves the ſweet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume of the dead Saints. And as
<pb facs="tcp:104245:7"/>
for the Lyon, it is the Enſign of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and Magnanimity; and your Honour bears the Lyon in your own Coat of Armes. But as for <hi>the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tribe of</hi> Judah, you bear him in your heart, and embrace him with the Arms of your precious faith. My <hi>Naile,</hi> and <hi>Wheele,</hi> I preſented to your Ladyſhip out of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and gratitude onely. The Subiect of thoſe worthleſſe papers, did not ſo aptly cloſe with your Honours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; they did more immediately concern the Magiſtracy. But in this work of mine, my whole deſigne is to exalt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; I ſet him up before you as an Enſigne; which I know your Honour wil with all cheerfulneſſe follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:104245:7"/>
Yet further, your Honour cannot be ignorant of the frame of my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that as the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid concerning his Corinthians, ſo I of your Ladyſhip. Madam! you are in my heart; Chriſt lives in your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and where ſo much of Chriſt appears, who can but give Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</p>
                  <p>Finally, As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writ to <hi>Philemon, Thou oweſt to mee even thine owne ſelfe;</hi> In a like phraſe I may ſpeake to your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; Iowe even mine ownſelf to your Honour, which I would have acknowledged to the whole world, &amp; made it out in ſome particulars; but that I feare (ſuch is your humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and goodneſſe) your Ladyſhip

                  <p>It was the ſaying of a learned and godly Divine unto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when he was at the point of death. <hi>How will you looke me in the face, before the dreadfull Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall of Jeſus Chriſt, if any of you appeare before me then, in an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate condition?</hi> How will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you look your Venerable Grand-Father in the face at that terrible day; If you be found in any Error, Hereſie, Schiſme, or inordinate walking, as becomes not the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt?

                  <p>THAT which <hi>Naomi</hi> ſpake to <hi>Ruth</hi> concerning <hi>Boaz; Hee hath not left off his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the living, and to the dead:</hi> It is fully verified of your ſelfe; you ceaſe
<pb facs="tcp:104245:14"/>
not to ſhew kindneſſe to the living, and to the dead. To the living; by your preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Miniſtry, you make Saints dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. To the dead Saints you ſhew kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by perpetuating their Names, to their honours, and the good of many. And herein you are a great gainer; you ſhine your ſelfe, by making others ſhine. Amongſt the reſt of thoſe that honour you, I am one, though I never ſaw your face, otherwiſe then in the <hi>Frontiſpice</hi> of your learned Bookes.</p>
                  <p>In your firſt part of <hi>the marrow of Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory,</hi> We had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that you did reſolve to add a ſecond part; and to put in the Lives of ſuch godly Divines, and others, as were eminent in theſe latter times, if you were furniſhed with faithfull infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Hereupon, divers did ſet upon me with very great importunity, to write the life of my deare Father, and to ſend it up to you. Truely, Worthy Sir! I was deſirous of the thing, but durſt not undertake the work: I was ſenſible of mine own weakneſſe; and alſo that his
<pb facs="tcp:104245:15"/>
ſayings, and doings had ſo far ſlipped the memories of this Generation, that I ſhould have brought to light ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect thing, as rather would have been a blemiſh to ſo eminent a Saint, then an honour. Hereupon, I laid all thoughts aſide of medling, or attempting ſuch a thing. I knew that he is glorious in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and on the Earth too, ſo far as his name is ſpread.</p>
                  <p>Now, good Sir! let me be bold to give you a ſhort account of my ſelfe. Some few daies ſince, I went about to make a new Diary for my ſelfe. I was deſirous in the firſt place, to ſet down ſome paſſages of my Father, for mine own ſatisfaction, and uſe. I began ſo; and before I was aware, it amounted to ſo much, as I thought better that publiſhed, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all: and at the laſt my Spirit grew reſtleſſe; I could not ſatisfie my ſelfe, till I had digeſted it into ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and made it publike. And now, Sir, here it is; I preſent it to your judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious view: accept it in good part from a meer ſtranger. Becauſe it was ſo ſhort,
<pb facs="tcp:104245:15"/>
therefore I joyned it to a weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy piece of mine own, to make it a Book.</p>
                  <p>My humble requeſt to you, worthy Sir, is this, that (though I ſlipped the laſt opportunity, yet) if you ſhall ſet forth any more lives; or if you ſhall have a new Impreſſion of any of the former: that you would extract ſo much of my precious Fathers life, as you ſhal judge fit, and place it where you pleaſe, in your <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall</hi> Hiſtory. Your Monuments will bee laſting in after ages, when my poore <hi>Pamphlet</hi> will bee worne out with time. Pardon my boldneſſe: The Lord ſtrengthen out your daies, for the good of his Church, and the honour of his Saints.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Aſter <hi>John Carter,</hi> my deare Father of bleſſed memory, and now a glorious Saint in Heaven, was borne at <hi>Wickham</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> neer <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> about the yeare of our Lord 1554.</p>
                  <p>He was deſcended but of meane Parents, (yet religious, and of good repute) not able to maintaine him, at the Univerſity, wholly at their own charge. One Mr. <hi>Roſe,</hi> a rich man in <hi>Canterbury</hi> (as my Father hath told me) Surely, taking notice of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104245:17"/>
his piety, in thoſe his tender years, and of his ſtudiouſneſſe, and proficiency in all Learning, beyond the pitch of a Grammer Scholar, and finding him hopefull, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove a precious inſtrument in the Church of Chriſt; took him into his care, and disburſed monyes from time to time (as was needfull) for his maintenance in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> He was of <hi>Clare Hall:</hi> Pupill to Doctor <hi>Byng</hi> the famous Civilian, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of that Houſe: (whoſe Son, Doctor <hi>Robert Byng,</hi> a learned and worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was my Tutor afterwards in the ſame Colledge) when he was firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Colledge, he was preſently taken notice of, to be of ſingular learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ripeneſſe for one of his yeares. He had, with the reſt of his year, a <hi>Theme</hi> given him to make. The <hi>Theſis</hi> was,
<q>Frugalitas virtutum maxima.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the young Schollars brought in their Themes, the Lecturer took them, and read them; and when he came to <hi>Carters</hi> Theme: he ſtood a little at a ſtand: at laſt, ſayes he before them all: here is the beſt Theme that I ever read: and gave him money, commended, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him: and alwayes after had a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104245:17"/>
carefull eye over him: and ſought op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to do him good.</p>
                  <p>After my Father had taken his degrees, Batchelor, and Maſter of Arts: His Tutor Doctor <hi>Byng</hi> (out of his ſingular love to him, and reſpect to his learning, and piety) gave him a Chamber in his own lodgings, where he continued a yeare or two, which made much to the compleating of him for the work of the Miniſtry. And all that while he continued a gremiall in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and Lap of his Mother the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, he had conſtant meetings with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his famous contemporarys, and that weekly: Doctor <hi>Chaderton,</hi> Doctor <hi>Andrews</hi> (afterwards a Prelate) Maſter <hi>Culverwell,</hi> Maſter <hi>Knewſtubs,</hi> &amp;c. and divers others, whom God raiſed up, and fitted to ſend forth into his Harveſt, to gather his Corn, then ripe for the Sickle, into his Barne. At their meetings they had conſtant exerciſes. They prayed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: they bent themſelves to the ſtudy of the Scriptures: one was for the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Tongues, anothers taske was the Grammatical interpretations; another for the Logicall Analyſe: another for the true ſenſe, and meaning: another to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrines. Thus led they their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104245:18"/>
employments; till at laſt, they went out like <hi>Apollos,</hi> eloquent men, and mighty in the Scriptures. And the Lord was with them. They brought in a great Harveſt into God's Barne.</p>
                  <p>He would not run before he was ſent: he would not enter upon the exerciſe of the holy work of the Miniſtry, till he had, not only an inward calling, but alſo an outward: <hi>viz.</hi> an aſſignation, approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſolemne admiſſion, by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery. When he was ordained, the Biſhop (who in thoſe dayes was <hi>primus Presbyter,</hi> or <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes)</hi> going about to oppoſe him: asked him this queſtion: Have you read the Bible through? Yes, ſaid he: I have read the old Teſtament twice through in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew: and the New Teſtament often through in the Greek: and if you pleaſe to examine me, in any particular place, I ſhall endeavonr to give you an account. Nay, ſaid the Biſhop, if it be ſo, I ſhall need to ſay no more to you. Some words of Commendation, and encouragement he gave him. This paſſage I had from my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers own mouth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1583. The Vicaridge of <hi>Bramford</hi> in <hi>Suffolk</hi> neer <hi>Ipſwich</hi> fel void. Mr. <hi>Roſe</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104245:18"/>
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> before mentioned, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the preſentation of it for my Father, from the Dean, and Chapter of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> The ſalary was only twenty Marks <hi>per Annum</hi> at firſt: afterward the Church raiſed it to twenty pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and that was the moſt that ever he had there.</p>
                  <p>He accepted of it: and being ſettled in it, he ſet himſelfe to do the work of Chriſt faithfully, with all his might, as a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that needeth not to be aſhamed.</p>
                  <p>Every Lord's day he preached twice very powerfully, and Catechiſed the younger ſort. He preached a Lecture every Thurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; to which multitudes from <hi>Ipſwich</hi> and other adjacent places did reſort. And God gave ſuch ſucceſſe to his Miniſtry, that from time to time, many were gathered in to Jeſus Chriſt. There are many precious Chriſtians that remaine unto this day, that acknowledge their converſion was by Mr. <hi>Carter's</hi> Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>Before Sermon he prayed very ſhort: and ever in the ſame words. After Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon he was large, and full, and expreſſed himſelfe with great variety, and fervency: and alwayes cloſed with Chriſts Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:104245:19"/>
He was very diligent in viſiting the ſick: eſpecially the poore. He never went to the houſe of a poore creature, but he left a Purſe-Almes, as well as a ſpirituall Almes of good Heavenly advice, and Prayer. No poore body ever came to his doore that went away empty. And this my dear Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would ſee to as carefully as himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The Milk of his Cows he gave to the poor of the Town every Saturday through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole yeare. I am confident he gave more to the poore every year, then the Revenue of his ſlender Vicaridge came to in all.</p>
                  <p>Yet God ſo bleſſed him, that whileſt he was in <hi>Bramford,</hi> he quickly paid Mr. <hi>Roſe</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> all the money he laid out towards his education in <hi>Cambridge:</hi> and before he left <hi>Bramford,</hi> he purchaſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi>
                     <q>God's bleſſing only makes rich.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He brought up both my elder and only Brother, and my ſelfe, at the Univerſity in a good faſhion: and for my ſelfe, I muſt acknowledge, beyond my deſert, or rank.</p>
                  <p>He was Orthodox and ſound in his judgement: an able and reſolved Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104245:19"/>
againſt all manner of Popery and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſme; as alſo againſt Anabaptiſme, &amp; Browniſme, that then did begin to peep, and infeſt the Church: and to teare the Seamles Coat of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>He was alwayes A <hi>Nonconformiſt,</hi> One of the good old Puritans of <hi>England.</hi> He never ſwallowed any of the Praelaticall Ceremonies againſt his Conſcience. He was often in trouble by the Biſhops; but God ever raiſed him up friends that brought him off. He was of a peaceable Spirit; and never cenſured any that were conformable, if he judged them conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and ſaw any thing of God in them.</p>
                  <p>At his firſt comming to <hi>Bramford</hi> he ſaw the travel of his Soule: he had a plentifull Harveſt! many Soules were added to the Church daily by his powerfull Miniſtry, and holy life.</p>
                  <p>But after many yeares the people were glutted with Manna, and began to loath it; there grew a great decay in their firſt love.</p>
                  <p>About the yeare 1615. or ſomething before, there aroſe up a Generation of malignant men, haters of a faithfull, and painfull Miniſtry, and of the power of Godlineſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:104245:20"/>
Theſe were of the Gentry, and chief of the Pariſh: theſe roſe up againſt my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father, preſſed him to conformity, complained of him to the Biſhop, and threatned that they would make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable, or elſe out him.</p>
                  <p>At this very juncture of time, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of little <hi>Belſted</hi> fell to be void: a very ſmall Village, ſome three miles from <hi>Ipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> a ſolitary place: the means better then <hi>Bramford:</hi> yet ſhort of a competency for ſuch an eminent pillar of the Church; ſome 50, or at moſt 60 pounds <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Patron Mr. <hi>Bloſſe</hi> became a Suiter to my Father to accept of it. He refuſed it againe, and againe. His reſolution was to endure perſecution at <hi>Bramford,</hi> to grapple with all difficulties, and dye there, rather then to remove. But the providence of God over-ruled him. At <hi>Bramford</hi> he ſaw he muſt be outed: Mr. <hi>Bloſſe</hi> would take no deniall: he found favour in the eyes of the Biſhop; and was inſtituted without ſubſcription, or any ceremonyes: and then at laſt, God taking him by the hand, and pulling him whether he would or no, he removed from <hi>Bramford</hi> (after ſome 34 yeares ſervice in the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104245:20"/>
to <hi>Belſted</hi> Parſonage, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued eighteen years, before God cauſed him to reſt from his Labours. In all that time he diſcharged his holy Function juſt as he did at <hi>Bramford;</hi> and though his Congregation there were but ſmall, yet he had many Fiſh that came to his Nett, from <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> and other adjacent Townes, deſtitute of faithfull Shepheards: So that his latter Crop in Gods harveſt-field was very conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>Little <hi>Belſted</hi> was a <hi>Tuſculanum</hi> to him; where in his age he had much ſecret and ſweet Communion with God, in the houſe, and with <hi>Iſaac</hi> in the fields; a beginning of that glorious communion he now enjoys with God in the mountains of Spices.</p>
                  <p>He being dead, yet ſpeaks; his Works praiſe him in the gates. From the Preſſe we have had his learned, and pithy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on the Sermon of Chriſt in the Mount: And two ſhort, but ſubſtantiall, ſolid, and profitable Catechiſmes. One
<hi>Milke for Children.</hi> The other, <hi>Winter evenings communication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His paines in the ſtudy of the <hi>Revelation</hi> were indefatigable. He writ much in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle room. But theſe Labours of his never
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104245:21"/>
yet ſaw the light. Many Miniſters that converſed with him privately, did light their Candles at his.</p>
                  <p>For his carriage and deportment in his Family, it was very religious. He had the Morning and the Evening Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; his houſe was a Church. Twice a day he had Scripture read, and after the Pſalme or Chapter were ended, he would aske of all his Children and Servants, what they remembred; and whatſoever ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they rehearſed, he would ſpeake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them that tended to edification. For his habit, and my dear Mothers appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling, it was very plaine, and homely; of the old faſhion, yet very cleanly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; inſomuch that all that came to the houſe would ſay, they had ſeen <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> or ſome of the old Patriarchs.</p>
                  <p>And in all his Houſe there was nothing but honeſt plainneſſe. He was ſuch an one as <hi>Jacob,</hi>

                  <p>He never uſed Plate in his houſe, but Veſſels of Wood, and Earth: Pewter and Braſſe were the higheſt Mettals for his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſils. All the dayes of his houſekeeping hee uſed conſtantly at his Table a little
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104245:21"/>
wooden Salt, which with age was growne to be of a duskiſh black, which was much taken notice of by all comers.</p>
                  <p>He never feaſted, but alwayes had whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, full, and liberall dyet in the houſe. And all fared alike: He, and my Mother, never thought his Children, and Servants, and poor folks, did eat enough.</p>
                  <p>The righteous man is mercifull to his Beaſt: he was carefull even for the bruit Creatures, that they ſhould be fed to the full. All his Cattell were like the firſt Kine that <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſaw feeding in the Meadow, they were fat-fleſhed, and well-favoured; in ſo much that I have heard ſome godly people ſay merrily, If they would be a Cow, or a Horſe, or a Hogg, or a Dogg, they would chuſe Mr. <hi>Carters</hi> houſe.</p>
                  <p>Hee had a ſharp wit: and was ſweet, mild, and pleaſant in his converſation; yet not any of his moſt facetious paſſages, that did not ſavour of holineſſe. His diſcourſe was ever heavenly, and his eyes, almoſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lifted up to Heaven. he did not eate, or drink, without praiſing God with his mouth and eyes; his whole converſation was in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Beſides his Family prayers, and duties, he prayed conſtantly in his Cloſet, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104245:22"/>
he went into his ſtudy, and before he came out to Dinner or Supper. Hee prayed very loud, and moſtly very long. For the extenſion of his voice (I conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture) he had a double reaſon; one, that by his earneſt ſpeech he might quicken up his owne heart and devotion: the other, that he might be a pattern of ſecret prayer to his Children and Servants. And I never heard him cloſe any prayer, without the Lords Prayer.</p>
                  <p>And I know his ground: he judged his owne beſt prayers imperfect, and Chriſts prayer moſt perfect, and comprehenſive.</p>
                  <p>That you may the better be ſatisfied concerning his ſenſe and judgement in this matter, I will here tranſcribe one paſſage out of his Printed Commentary upon the ſixth of <hi>Matthew, v.</hi> 9. Where after hee hath ſet forth the excellency and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts Prayer: he addeth, <hi>He now directeth us to the right performance</hi> (Viz. of the duty of prayer) <hi>After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pray yee.</hi> Or as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſetteth it down, <hi>[When you pray, ſay] Not binding us ſtrictly to uſe theſe words alwaies, and none other, but to uſe the matter, manner, and like affection. But as for them who cannot ſo well inlarge their ſuits in other words, or for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104245:22"/>
thoſe alſo, who can, and do it, yet remain ſtill unſatisfied, as not having done it ſufficiently (and who can do it ſufficiently?) the Lord hath left this moſt excellent helpe, to uſe the very words of this divine prayer, as the moſt worthy Servants of God ever have done: And learn we here by the way, what an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity lyeth upon us (which ought to be our greateſt glory and comfort) to pray in theſe words, or in this manner: For it is the undiſpenſable Commandement of our Lord Chriſt. After this manner pray.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus farr he.</p>
                  <p>He had a ſpeciall dexterity in comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afflicted conſciences, reſolving doubts, and anſwering queſtions. When ſome came to him (not long before he left this Earth) and told him of the tyranny of the Prelates, how it heightned every day, of their perſecuting conſcientious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, of their Innovations, and the Book of Liberry for ſports on the Sabbath day, tending to the fearefull profanation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; He uſed theſe expreſſions: <hi>I have had a longing deſire to ſee, or heare of the fall of Antichriſt: But I check my ſelfe. I ſhall go to Heaven, and there newes will come thick, thick, thick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When others came to him, and preſſed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104245:23"/>
him with importunity, to tell them his judgement concerning the future ſtate of the Church; ſaying to him, That he had travelled much in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and they were perſwaded, God had revealed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then ordinary to him: What do you thinke? Shall we have Popery once againe, or no? Hee anſwered, You ſhall not need to feare fire and fagot any more, but ſuch dreadful diviſions will be amongſt Gods people, and profeſſors, as will equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the greateſt perſecutions.</p>
                  <p>A man met him neer his houſe, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him. O Mr. <hi>Carter!</hi> what ſhall I doe? My Wife is entring into her Travell, and I thinke ſhee will dye with very fear. Sayes he to the man, Make haſte, run to your Wife, and tell her I am going to my Cloſet as faſt as I can to pray for her; bid her not faint, but be of good comfort: The man ran to her, and told her what had paſſed. Preſently her feares vaniſhed, God gave her ſtrength, ſhee was delivered immediately, and very ſafely; and her Husband came back to my Father (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member before he came out of his Cloſet) to tell him what God had done.</p>
                  <p>Another time a poor man met him by the way, and cryed to him piteouſly, Mr.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104245:23"/>
                     <hi>Carter!</hi> What ſhall become of mee? I work hard, and fare hard, and yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thrive, I continue bare, and know not how in the World to live. Hee anſwered him, You want one thing; I will tell you what you ſhall doe, Work hard, and fare hard, and <hi>Pray hard,</hi> and I warrant you thrive.</p>
                  <p>There dwelled in his Pariſh a Tanner, a very godly man, and one that had much communion with my Father: This man, as he was very buſie tawing of a Hide with all his might, not ſo much as turning aſide his head any way; My father coming by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally, came behinde him, and merrily gave him a little clap upon the back; hee ſtarted, and looking behinde him ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bluſhed. Sir, ſaith he, I am aſhamed you ſhould finde me thus. To whom my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayd again, Let Chriſt when he comes finde me ſo doing. What? ſayes the man, doing thus? Yes, ſaith my Father to him, <hi>Faithfull in the duties of my Calling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being at Dinner in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> at one of the Magiſtrates houſes; diverſe other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters being at the Table: One amongſt the reſt (who had years enough, &amp; learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough to have taught him more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility) was very talkative, bragged of his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104245:24"/>
parts and skill; and made a challenge: He ſayd to them, Here are many learned men; do any of you propound any queſtion in Divinity or Philoſophy, and I will diſpute with you, and reſolve and ſatisfie you ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. All the Table (but he himſelfe) were ſilent a while. Then my Father (when he ſaw no body elſe would ſpeak) ſayd to him (calling him by his name) I will go no further then my Trencher to puzzle you. Here's a Sole: Now tell me the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why this Fiſh, alwayes living in the ſalt water, ſhould come out freſh? My Gentleman could not ſay any thing to it; and ſo he was laughed, and ſhamed out of his vanity.</p>
                  <p>A certaine man came to him, and made his moane: Saith he, I have loſt the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Freind I had in the World; I had in a manner my livelihood from him. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwered him, <hi>When the Fountaine dryes up in one place, God will open it in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To me he ſayd once, <hi>John!</hi> God hath alwayes brought water for me out of the hard flinty rock: Thoſe covetous, hard-hearted men who have beene enemies to my perſon and Miniſtry, have many times come in, and given me countenance and maintenance.</p>
                  <p>

My elder, and onely dear Brother (a bleſſed Inſtrument in the church of Chriſt) being dead: my Father took care of his eldeſt Son; he ſent him to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and walking with him towards the Stable, took his laſt leave of him in theſe words, in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, <hi>Cave, mi fili, faſtum, ignaviam, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtum: i. e.</hi> My Son, beware Pride, Sloth, Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>He would ſay, a Traveller muſt have a Swines belly, an Aſſes back, and a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants purſe: Meaning, to fare with all dyet, to beare all injuries, and to provide for vaſt expences. Wee are Pilgrims, and Travellers here, and we muſt prepare for Want, Wrongs, and ſpoyling of our Goods.</p>
                  <p>It may wel be ſayd of him, <hi>Semper erat, ubi non erat:</hi> His heart was where his head is, and where now his ſoule is; in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>His whole life was nothing elſe but a Communion day. I have often thought that old <hi>Jacob</hi> lived in him. I am ſure the ſpirit of God breathed as much in him, in his words, writings (holineſſe dropped from his Pen in every ordinary Letter that he writ) in his actions, Soliloquies, as in any man of later times. He was alwayes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104245:25"/>
diſtilling precious precepts, exhortations, inſtructions, conſolations, into thoſe with whom he had to converſe.</p>
                  <p>A godly Woman told me once, That ſhe had been ſervant to a religious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to whoſe Houſe my Father did often reſort; and that ſhe was won to Chriſt at firſt by the heavenly ſpeeches, and ſweet principles which dropped from him, as ſhe was warming his Bed, and waiting upon him in his Chamber.</p>
                  <p>A man he was moſt juſt and exact in his dealings: he put a clauſe into his Will for the carefull payment of his debts: And when my Siſter <hi>Eunice,</hi> and I (his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) enquired, wee could finde nothing that he owed, except to the Smith for ſhooing of a Horſe or two.</p>
                  <p>In his Library, I found two or three Books (I beleeve not one of them worth a groat) upon which he had written. <hi>This Book is borrowed of ſuch an one: Let it be reſtored; or if the Owner cannot be found, allow ſomething to the poor for it, and that liberally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once being in a journey many miles from home, in changing a peice of Gold at a Shop, he tooke a halfe crowne peice in ſtead of a ſhilling; neither he nor the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104245:25"/>
Shopkeeper minded it: As ſoone as hee came home, he found that he had taken a halfe crowne for a ſhilling: He could not reſt, but next day he took a long journey on purpoſe to that Towne, to carry back that halfe crown againe.</p>
                  <p>He was of a ſweet, milde, and gentle nature, and of a gracious ſpirit: A loving and faithfull Husband, and an indulgent Father; if he failed in any thing, it was in his carriage to his Servants; for truely he did not carry himſelfe as a Maſter to Servants, but as a familiar friend to his freinds. He would make them to ſit down with him, and drinke to them at meat.</p>
                  <p>He, and my Mother were marryed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether well-nigh ſixty yeares; and I am confident in all that time, there never was a diſtaſtefull word betweene them. And indeed, how could there be? Hee lived with her as a man of knowledge; he was a wiſe, faithfull, and tender guide; and ſhe was humble and meek, did reverence, and highly eſteem him: Every word hee ſpake was an Oracle to her, and her will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cloſed with his Judgment.</p>
                  <p>He lived to eighty yeares of age: When I (the youngeſt of nine, and the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt of all) was born, he was forty years
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104245:26"/>
of age. He called me the Son of his age, yet lived to ſee me forty yeares old before he dyed.</p>
                  <p>He was much and frequent in ſecret faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And when he kept a day, hee told none of the houſe of it, ſave my Mother onely (who would not eate that day that he faſted, but oft-times ſhe was with him in his retyring Chamber, to joyn with him in prayer) yet all the Family knew it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at night hee ſupped not; but onely had a Toſte, and a draught of ordinary Beer to ſuſtaine nature.</p>
                  <p>On the Sabbath day he never had any thing roſt to Dinner, becauſe hee would have none detained at home from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Ordinances. The Pot was hung on, and a peice of Beefe and a Pudding in it; that was their conſtant Lordſ-day Dinner for well-nigh ſixty years.</p>
                  <p>His Church at <hi>Belſſed</hi> ſtood in a very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary place: He alwayes kept a Key of it, and would often reſort thither all alone. A Gentleman once eſpying him going to the Church-ward on a private day, hid himſelfe till my Father was paſt, and in the Church; then hee came cloſe up to the Church wall, deſirous to peep in at ſome Window to ſee what he did, and to liſten
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104245:26"/>
him, if he ſayd any thing. And the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman told me, the laſt time I was at <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,</hi> that he prayed, then read a Chapter, and after that prayed largely, and very heavenly, as if he had been in his Family, or in the publique Congregation.</p>
                  <p>He vigorouſly held on the courſe of his Miniſtry to the laſt. It may be ſaid of him, as of <hi>Caleb,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua;</hi> he was as fit for Service in Gods Harveſt-field at foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, as he was at forty.</p>
                  <p>Some abatement of bodily ſtrength there was, as old Age did ſteale upon him: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his after-noon Sermon on the Sabbath, he would be ſomething faint; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly when he came home, he would call for ſome comfortable Draught; and when he had lifted up his eyes to Heaven, and taken it, he would ſay to them about him, theſe are Crutches to ſhore up a ruinous houſe.</p>
                  <p>But in his Intellectuals, and Spirituall ſtrength, there was no failing. I cannot but here interſert a Paſſage that now comes in my minde.</p>
                  <p>Old Mr. <hi>Benton</hi> of <hi>Wramplingham</hi> in <hi>Norffolke,</hi> a holy man of God, being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion in <hi>Suffolke,</hi> in thoſe parts, could not but give a viſite to his old friend
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104245:27"/>
Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> of <hi>Belſted.</hi> Being with him, he heard him diſcourſe with holy Gravity, &amp; a mixture of all kind of Learning, Solidity, and Wit; he ſtood amazed, and ſaid, Mr. <hi>Carter!</hi> I ſee you are like the Palm, and Cedar, that bring forth more Fruit in your Age. <hi>I thank you</hi> (ſaid my Father) <hi>for telling of me what I ſhould be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now the time of his departure was at hand. Some fortnight, or three weeks before his tranſlation, there appeared ſome decaies in his Body, and his memory did a little faile. He would ſometimes (but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rarely) call to go to Sea, and to his better Country. Yet he ſat up from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to night, and walked commonly up and down the Room, and never failed the performance of Prayer, and other Family duties; and ſo as none could diſcern any conſiderable defect in his ſpirituall, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſtrength. Onely this, when he had done, he would preſently call to begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and ſay, Daughter <hi>Eunice,</hi> (for my Mother being dead about two yeares before, ſhe was the ſtay of his houſe, and ſtaff of his Age) ſhall we not go to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? and when ſhe ſhould anſwer him, you have been at Prayer already, and you are weary; he would anſwer, <hi>I feare we have not done what we ſhould do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:104245:27"/>
It was an ordinary, yea, a conſtant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in every Prayer, that God would vouchſafe a mercifull, and eaſie paſſage out of this life; And moſt graciouſly did the Lord anſwer it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Febr.</hi> 21. 1634. being the day before the Sabbath, in the Evening he calls ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry earneſtly for Paper, Ink, and two Pens: for by Gods grace, ſaith he, to morrow I will Preach twice: But God knowes, he was not in a fit condition for Study: yet with that reſolution he went to Bed, and God gave him ſome reſt that night. In the morning upon the Sabbath-day, he did riſe out of his Bed, as he uſed to do, came out of his Bed-chamber into the Hall, and after Prayer he called for his ordinary Breakfaſt, before he went to the Church, (for ſtill he held his reſolution of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) which was an Egge; he took it in his hand, but alas it would not down.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eunice!</hi> ſaith he, I am not able to go to Church yet; I prethee lead me to my Bed, I will lye down a little, and reſt me. So he aroſe up out of his Chaire, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe ſupporting of him. And when he came to the Parlour-door, before he put his foot over the Threſhold, Oh <hi>Eunice!</hi> ſayes he, what ſhall I do? <hi>Put your truſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:104245:28"/>
ſaith ſhe, <hi>in that God of whom you have had ſo much experience, who never yet did leave you, nor forſake you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſaid, <q>The Lord be thanked.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So he gather'd up himſelfe, went to the Beds-ſide, ſate downe upon it, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately compoſed himſelfe to lye down: He lifted up one of his Legs upon the Bed, without any great difficulty, laid down his Body, and reſted his head upon the Pillow: My poor Siſter ſtood by, expecting ſtill when he ſhould lift up his other leg; ſhe thought he had been fallen aſleep: And ſhe was not miſtaken; ſo it was, it proved his laſt ſleep, and before ſhe could diſcern any change in him, his Soule had taken its flight to Heaven, even into the Armes and Embraces of his bleſſed Saviour, whom he had faithfully ſerved.</p>
                  <p>Hee intended a Sabbaths Labour for Chriſt, and Chriſt gave him reſt from his Labour; even the reſt of an eternall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
                  <p>When my Siſter began to ſpeak to him, and lift him, ſhe found that his breath was departed, and yet no change in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance at all: his eyes, and his mouth continuing in the ſame poſture they uſed to be in his ſweeteſt ſleeps.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:104245:28"/>
Thus the Lord gave unto his faithfull Servant, the deſire of his Soule; ſuch an eaſie paſſage, that his death could not be diſcerned from a ſweet naturall ſleep.</p>
                  <p>Not many daies before he dyed, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my Siſter: Daughter, ſaith he, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my Love to my Son <hi>John,</hi> I ſhall ſee him no more in this life; and remember me to the reſt of my Children, and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and deliver this meſſage to them all from me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Stand faſt in the Faith, and love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi> This was the laſt meſſage that ever he ſent.</p>
                  <p>Hee ended his life with a Doxology, breathing out his laſt, with theſe words; <hi>The Lord be thanked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he had thus yeelded up his ſpirit into the hands of his heavenly Father, my Siſter <hi>Eunice</hi> diſpatched a Meſſenger to me to <hi>Norwich:</hi> For ſo he had given order before he dyed, that his body ſhould not be put in the Coffin till his Son <hi>John</hi> came. God carryed me through the journey in hard weather: and through his good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, I arrived at <hi>Belſted</hi> early on the Tueſday. And going to the houſe of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I found the body of my deceaſed Father ſtill lying upon the Bed. They un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104245:29"/>
his face: Sweetly he lay, and with a ſmiling countenance, and no difference to the eye between his countenance alive and dead, ſave onely that he was wont to rejoyce and bleſſe me at my approach, now he was ſilent.</p>
                  <p>I fell upon his face, I confeſſe, and kiſſed him, and lift up my voice and wept, and ſo took my laſt leave of him, till we meet in a better World.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon, <hi>February</hi> 4. 1634. at his interring, there was a great conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of people from all parts thereabouts, Miniſters and others, taking up the words of <hi>Joaſh</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Oh my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! my Father! the Chariots of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the horſemen thereof! Old Mr. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Ward,</hi> that famous Divine, and the glory of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> came to the Funerall, brought a mourning Gowne with him, and offered very reſpectively to Preach his funerall Sermon, now that ſuch a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation were gathered together, and upon ſuch an occaſion.</p>
                  <p>But my Siſter and I durſt not give way to it: For ſo our Father had often charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us in his life time, and upon his bleſſing, that no Sermon ſhould be at his buryall. For, ſayd he, it will give occaſion to ſpeak
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104245:29"/>
ſome good of me that I deſerve not, and ſo falſe things will be uttered in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> reſted ſatiſfied, and did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare: But the next Friday at <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> he turned his whole Lecture into a Funerall Sermon for my Father, in which he did la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and honour him, to the great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the whole Auditory.
<q>Gloria fugientes ſequitur.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Glory is like a ſhadow; follow it, and it will fly away: fly from it, and it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>For humility hee was moſt eminent. Humble in his habite, humble in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: for though his gifts called him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great men, yet his moſt ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe was with thoſe of inferiour ranck, in whom he ſaw moſt of the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
                  <p>He writ very much; but hee left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behinde him, ſave <hi>what is Printed: and his Expoſition of the Revelation;</hi> and <hi>a Petition to King James for the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of burdenſome Ceremonies out of the Church:</hi> nothing elſe but a few broken Papers, which, I ſuppoſe, he look'd upon
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104245:30"/>
as Waſte paper. Surely, he burnt the reſt, when hee ſaw his appointed time draw neer, meerly out of a low opinion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and gifts.</p>
                  <p>He baulked all things that might tend to outward pomp, and oſtentation: He would have no Funerall Sermon: He gave order to be buryed, not in the Church, but in the Church-yard: where hee and my ſweet Mother, that glorious Paire, lye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred together, without ſo much, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo little as a poore Graveſtone over them.</p>
                  <p>He had learned of Chriſt to be meek, and lowly in heart; he was humble in his life, and humble in his death; and now the Lord hath highly exalted him.</p>
                  <p>He kept a conſtant Diary, or day-book, in which he ſet down every day Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary diſpenſations, his own actions, and whatſoever memorable things hee heard or read that day.</p>
                  <p>He caſt up his accounts with God every day; and his ſins were blotted out, before he was called to his laſt reckoning: His day of refreſhing is come, he reſts from his Labours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plus vivitur exemplis, quam praeceptis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca:</hi> Examples of the dead are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104245:30"/>
Sermons for the living. And though when I firſt ſet Pen to Paper, I intended onely to recollect ſome of his doings and ſayings (now eighteen yeares after his deceaſe) for my owne memory, inſtruction, and comfort; yet I cannot but conceive, that the example of this holy man of God, if it be communicated, may be uſefull and profitable to the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>He was a true childe of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> fell upon him, <hi>I will bleſſe them that bleſſe thee, ſaith the Lord; and I will curſe them that curſe thee.</hi> Not long ſince I was at <hi>Bramford;</hi> there dwelleth an ancient Gentleman, one of great quality, my friend, and my Fathers old friend; he ſpake thus to me: Mr. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter!</hi> I have now lived to ſee the downfall of all your Fathers oppoſers, and enemies. There is not one of them, but their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are ſcattered, and ruined. Let the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Gods faithfull Meſſengers heare, and feare, and do no more wickedly.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but add one thing more; It may be truely ſaid of him, and his faithfull Yoke-fellow, as it is writen of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> They were both righteous before God, walking in all the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and Ordinances of the Lord,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104245:31"/>
blameleſſe. I dare ſay, the World will teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that neither of them did ever do that thing that was unjuſt, or evill, or ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or uncomely, their Enemies being Judges. They were as to men without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, their life was a ſweet ſavour, and they went out of this life as a fragrant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe I have drawn his life very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly. I muſt ſay as the Queen of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba;</hi> the one halfe hath not been told you. It will not be long before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall open the Books at the laſt, and great day, then, and there you ſhall read his compleat Story.</p>

1. And firſt I am to open and expound the Text.</p>
                  <p>Behold!] This demonſtrative, hath ſingular weight, and moment. <hi>Aliquid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentinum, et inſperatum demonſtrat.</hi> It points to ſomething that is ſudden, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, unhoped for: ſomething that is rare, excellent, and admirable.

                  <p n="1">1. To excite, and ſtir up attention, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: it calls for your ears, and eyes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To command. Thus Chriſt made uſe of it. It was his word of command. He ſaid unto them <hi>In his Doctrine, Hearken, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</hi> I command you to attend.</p>
                  <p>So here: it's the ſounding of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet: it invites, it commands you all to fix your Eyes upon this rare, and excellent ſight which is now comming forth.</p>
                  <p>Behold then! But firſt, I pray, before you look for the Lion, Lift up your eyes a little higher, to the firſt Verſe. There you ſhall ſee <hi>A Throne ſet in Heaven,</hi> and one ſitting upon that Throne, in great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <note place="margin">c. 4. 2.</note> Majeſty, and brightneſſe. That is—God the Father! In his right hand he holds <hi>a book, written within, and on the back-ſide, and ſealed with 7. Seals</hi> V. I.</p>

Q. <hi>What Book may this be?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is none other but this Book of the Revelation.</p>
                  <p>Would you know the Contents of this Book? It is a Propheticall-Hiſtoricall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretall.</p>
                  <p>Not onely decreed, but as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed in the Court-Roules of Heaven: It was a great Roule written on both ſides for the multitude, and variety of matters, as containing a compleat Hiſtory of the Church unto the Worlds end: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took up both ſides of the Book, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, or Roule.</p>
                  <p>It containes the decrees, Counſels, and will of God, concerning the future ſtate, and government of the Church. It contains great Myſteries; Of the Kingdome and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Antichriſt: of the perſecutions, troubles, and afflictions of the Church in all Ages, till Chriſt ſhall come the ſecond time, and deliver up the Kingdome to God even the Father. It foreſhews the patience, and conſtancy of the faithfull; the utter ruine of their Enemies: and their eternall glory, and faelicity at the generall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Conſummation.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Myſteries are written in a <hi>Book.</hi> i. e. in Gods eternall Praeſcience, Providence, and Decree.</p>

                  <p>Who? O it's a hard, and difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to open the Book, and to looſe the Seales. Verſe 3. None <hi>in Heaven.</hi> No An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.

to read the Book,</hi> &amp;c. He wept much, to ſee himſelfe, and others, deprived of ſo deep, ſo ſweet, and ſo excellent Myſteries; but eſpecially to think, that God ſhould be deprived of the glory of them. What then? Shall the Church never know the Contents of that Book?</p>
                  <p>Yes; yes, it ſhall.

                  <p>Behold! with admiration, and joy, this is the Lion. I finde in the Scripture a three-fold Lion. 1. Of the Foreſt. 2. Of the Internall Pit. 3. Of the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</hi>

                     <hi>Judah</hi> carried a <hi>Lion</hi> in his Standard. The occaſion of this Coat of Armes you have, <hi>Gen. 49. 9. Viz.

                  <p>Armes were tokens, or reſemblances, ſignifying ſome Act, or Quality of the Bearer. In their Banners, Shields, or Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets they did engrave, emboſs, embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or depict ſome Beaſt, Bird, Fiſh, or other thing, whoſe nature and quality did beſt quadrate with their own.

Such Armes were remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations for Service, beſtowed by Kings, Emperours, and their Generals: Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Teſtimonies of their glorious Merits.</p>
                  <p>This armoriall Enſigne, <hi>the Lion,</hi> was given to <hi>Judah,</hi> to ſhew, 1. The Courage of that Tribe above the reſt; and 2.

                  <list>
                     <item>1. That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is a Lion.</item>

                     <p>The truth of this, with the reaſon, I will give you both together. It is both prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyed,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104245:41"/>
and typified, <hi>Gen. 49. 9. Iuda is a Lions Whelp. Iudah!</hi> this cannot be meant of the perſon of <hi>Judah,</hi> that's certaine: for he crouched, and bowed downe to <hi>Joſeph</hi> his younger Brother, and dyed in <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore it muſt be underſtood firſt, <note place="margin">Num. 24. 9</note> of the poſterity, of the Tribe of <hi>Judah. The Ofſpring of Judah ſhall be a Lion's Whelp:</hi> but for what cauſe is he ſo deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed? <hi>Propter dignitatem Regiam.</hi> The Lion is <hi>Rex quadrupedum:</hi> The nobleſt of all fourefooted creatures: and the King of all beaſts. <hi>Pro.</hi> 30. 30. 31. A Lion, and a King put together. In the 8, 9, and tenth Verſe of that 49. <hi>cap.</hi> of <hi>Gen.</hi> you have a graphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call deſcription of the Kingly power and Soveraignty that ſhould be in the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> many Generations after: ſhewing, that <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhall meet with many potent, and implacable enemies to conflict withall: that he ſhall conquer and ſubdue them all. Ver. 8. <hi>Thy hand ſhall be in the neck of thine Enemies.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>From the prey, my Son thou art gone up. 1. Iudah</hi> ſhall teare his Enemies in pieces, as a Lion rents his prey. <hi>He ſtouped downe, he couched as a Lion, and as an old Lion.</hi> That notes a full victory over all his Enemies: The Lion's couching is not for feare, but becauſe he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104245:41"/>
hath conquered his prey, and ſcattered all oppoſition; and now, lyeth downe by it in tryumph, feeding and reſting himſelfe in peace. So ſhall <hi>Judah</hi> tread on the neck of all his enemies, and ſit downe in peace. But to raiſe it to the height, it ſignifies, that <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be the Kingly Tribe, in which ſhould be the Regall power. 1 <hi>Chr. 5. 2. Judah prevailed above his Brethren, and of him came the cheife Ruler.</hi> This ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, <hi>Verſ. 8. Thy fathers Children ſhall bow downe before thee. Verſ. 10.

                     </p>
                     <p>But though the Propheſie were in part fulfilled in the temporall Kingdome of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> yet chiefly all is verified in Chriſt; and it hath its complement in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, and is interpreted, and fully fulfilled in my Text. Jeſus Chriſt is the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> which words are nothing but a Periphraſis, an elegant metaphoricall deſcription of the Kingdome of Chriſt: Jeſus Chriſt is a Lyon; that is, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is a King:</hi> Chriſt a King.</p>

And <hi>wiſdome</hi> (for Government) is better then Strength.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p>In this grace of Juſtice Chriſt excelled all others. <hi>He ſhall order his Kingdome, and eſtabliſh it with Judgment, and with Juſtice</hi> for ever.

                     <p>Here are his Kingly graces, his Lion-like qualifications, whereby he was fitted to weild the Kingdome. No man, Angell, nor Arch-angell; none in Heaven, and Earth, can be found meet to under-go this Office, onely Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>God-man</hi> could beare it.</p>

                     <p>And this externall Unction had Jeſus Chriſt; not with materiall oyle, but he had a full, and undoubted right to the Government: He was no uſurper, he had a ſolemn calling from God the Father to this Office; and from him he derived a three-fold right.</p>

                     <p>I anſwer with Saint <hi>Paul, There are</hi>

But ſuch a King as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is not in the whole World. And I will ſhew you ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between Chriſt the King, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

3. In regard of bounds: all other Kings, they have Dominion only over ſome part, and a little part of the World: Indeed there have been Monarchs that have ſtyled themſelves Emperours of the World; but they were miſtaken two wayes: Firſt, in their times ſcarce halfe the habitable part of the World was diſcovered: Secondly, Had they had all they layd claime to, it was but to the lower and baſer part of the World, <hi>the Earth:</hi> But the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath an univerſall Kingdome. <hi>Pſal. 72. 8. He ſhall have Dominion from Sea to Sea, and from the River unto the ends of the Earth.</hi> v. 9. <hi>They that dwell in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall bow before him, and his enemies ſhall lick the duſt.</hi> v. 10. <hi>The Kings of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiſh, and of the Iſles ſhall bring preſents; the Kings of Sheba, and Seba ſhall offer gifts.</hi> v. 11. <hi>Yea, all Kings ſhall fall down before him, all Nations ſhall ſerve him.</hi> He is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; yea, he is King of Heaven and Earth, and of all things in them.

                     <p>The Husband and Wife were both of the ſame Family; and therefore Chriſt had a title to the temporall Kingdome, Crown, and Dignity, both by the Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſide.

                     <p>But as for this temporall Kingdome and Dominion over <hi>Judah</hi> &amp; the other Tribes, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt would not meddle with it.

                     </p>
                     <p>He muſt be a Lyon, a King, becauſe he is Mediator of his Church. This great and <note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> high office of a King was ſo neceſſary, that the Church could never have been ſaved, except Chriſt had born it.</p>
                     <p>A Mediatour is for the reconciling of parties that are at variance: and hee that undertakes the work, muſt be in grace and favour with both parties, and he muſt deal, not onely between, but with both parties; with the party offended, and the party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending.

Jeſus Chriſt is willing (Oh the infinite grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt!) to negotiate in this great buſineſſe with his Father: and on mans behalfe he doth three things. 1. He ſuffers whatſoever man ſhould have ſuffered, to ſatisfie God and acquit ſinfull man. They write of the Lyon, that he alwayes hath a quartain ague: I am ſure Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Lyon of the tribe of Judah,</hi> hee had a quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian for us. <hi>Hee was a man of ſorrowes, well acquainted with griefe,</hi> from his birth to the Croſſe: Yea, he dyed a bloody and a moſt accurſed death, to appeaſe the wrath of God, <hi>and ſlay the enmitty.</hi> And <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 16.</note> here the Lyon becomes a Lambe; <hi>brought as a Lambe to the ſlaughter:</hi> and is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 7.</note> Lambe mentioned in the next Verſe, <hi>which ſtood in the midſt of the Elders, as it</hi>

                     <p>A ſecond buſineſſe he doth for man, is, as a Prieſt, to pray, and intercede to, and with his Father, that his Sacrifice may be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104245:50"/>
availeable, and effectuall to the ſalvation of his Church. <hi>I pray</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>for theſe with</hi> me now, <hi>and for all them alſo</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>that ſhall beleeve on me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He doth ingage to his Father, that all that the Father hath given him, ſhall beleeve. That hee will work faith in them by his Spirit, <hi>John 6. 3. All that the Father giveth</hi> me, <hi>i. e.</hi> all the Elect, <hi>ſhal come to me, i. e.</hi> they ſhall beleeve. Thus Chriſt is an agent for man with God. And in this Prieſtly office, he purchaſed his Kingdome: <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith God the Father, <hi>will I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide him a portion with the great, and he ſhal divide the ſpoyle with the ſtrong; becauſe he hath poured out his ſoule unto death; and he was numbred with the tranſgreſſors, and he bare the ſins of many, and made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors.</hi>

Now theſe rebellious hearts Chriſt muſt ſubdue, and bring into ſubjection, making them a beleeving, a loving, a willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

                     <p>Obſerve, It is the duty of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to behold the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. As Saint <hi>John</hi> the Divine is here called upon
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104245:54"/>
to behold; ſo is every one enjoyned to eye the Lyon: that is, the Lord Jeſus: <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt calls as much upon his Diſciples, <hi>to behold the Lambe of God which taketh away the ſins of the World, John</hi> 1. 29.

                     <p>Secondly, and moſt properly, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that <hi>David</hi> was the root of Chriſt: that is, Chriſt ſprang from <hi>David.</hi> God raiſed up Chriſt out of the decayed Houſe

of <hi>David,</hi> by his mighty arme. So plainly <hi>Iſa. 11. 1. There ſhall come forth a Rod out of the ſtemme of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>and a branch ſhall grow out of his roots.</hi>

                     <p>What manner of Kingdome, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt is: A Spiritual, not a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>The Conqueſt of temporall, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kings, is of Countries, Cities, Caſtles, Navies. The Conqueſt of Chriſt our King, is of the hearts of his people; he brings them into ſubjection. The Rule of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and Earthly Kings, is over the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and goods of their Subjects. But Chriſts Throne is ſet up in the Soules of his people; by his Spirit he rules in the inward man. Temporall Kingdomes are obtained, &amp; defended by force of Armes, carnall Weapons, the Arm of fleſh; but Chriſts Kingdome is won, and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Spiritual Weapons; the Word, and Spirit. <hi>For the Weapons of our Warfare are
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104245:56"/>
not carnall, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, and every high thing that exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelfe againſt the Knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt. 2. Cor.</hi> 10. 4. 5. Chriſt himſelfe renounceth all temporall, and earthly Dominion. Thus Ieſus anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pilate: My Kingdome is not of this World; if my Kingdome were of this World, then would my Servants ſight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jewes; but now is my Kingdome not from hence, Joh.</hi> 18. 36. In reſpect of Dominion, Right, and Title; all the Kingdomes of the World are the Lord Ieſus Chriſt's. He hath <hi>jus ad rem:</hi> But in regard of Poſſeſſion, and uſe, hee abdicates all. He never owned any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Poſſeſſions: <hi>When they would have come, and taken him by force, to make him King, he departed alone himſelfe, and hid himſelfe in a Mountaine, Ioh.</hi> 6. 15.</p>
                     <p>The more is their folly, that by being Subjects of Chriſts Kingdome, expect chiefly temporall good things, Riches, Honours, and Pleaſures. So the Iewes, they alwaies dreamed of a worldly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and yet expect a <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come with outward Pomp, and worldly Glory.

Yea the very Apoſtles were nibling at this. <hi>Act. 1. 6. Wilt thou at this time reſtore the Kingdome to</hi> Iſrael? And the Mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> Children lingred after this: <hi>Grant that theſe my two Sons may ſit, the one at thy right hand, and the other on thy left,</hi>

Can you endure to be plunged over head, and eares, in a flood of Afflictions? This you muſt look for in my Kingdome: Riches, and Honours, and Offices, theſe are not the good things of Chriſts Kingdome; no, no. <hi>The Kingdome of God, is not meat, and drink, but righteouſneſſe, and peace, and joy in the Holy-Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 14. 17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Againſt the Chiliaſts, or Millenaries: That the 1000 yeares reigne of the Saints upon the Earth, is but a meer dream, a falſhood, a groſſe error.

                     <p>That they ſhall all live without ſin, and without Ordinances: that they ſhall paſſe theſe 1000 years with all manner of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights, begetting many children, eating and drinking, and making merry.

I ſhall only ſpeak a word, if it may be, to ſhame the fautors of this fond fancy. What, a Saint? and ſo addicted to carnall pleaſures?

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104245:58"/>
went through this World bearing the Croſſe; and ſhall the Saints look to weare Crownes here below? The generous Lyon will not eat any dead thing, or ſtinking carcaſe, only what is living, and ſweet: he takes his prey &amp; eats it whileſt it bleeds, and trembles. Theſe earthly things, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, honors, pleaſures, are but dead things, ſtinking carkaſes. Surely all thoſe whoſe hearts and affections feed upon them, they are not right whelps of the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi>

                     <p>Then, the government of the Church is Monarchicall. This is the happineſſe of the Church: Monarchy is the beſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Chriſt is the beſt King: And no King of the Church but Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>God hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church, which is his body, Eph.</hi> 1. 22, 23.</p>
                     <p>Here at one blow, off goes the triple Crowne. The Popes Kingdome is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and the High Prieſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Univerſall Biſhop is depoſed; if the Pope be King, then there are two Kings of the Church, and Jeſus Chriſt is not THE Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the onely King.</p>

                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> grants it, that Chriſt is the onely King, and Monarch of the Church,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104245:59"/>
which doth <hi>ſpiritually</hi> and <hi>inviſibly</hi> govern it: yet ſaith he, the Church being corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and viſible, it ſtands in need of ſome one to be the viſible and higheſt judge to decide controverſies, to compoſe all ſtrifes about Religion, to ordaine all inferiour Officers, Biſhops, Paſtors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them in their duties, and keep them in unity; and the viſible government of the Church muſt be Monarchicall. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath found out other <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> beſides the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</hi> They uſually called their Popes <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> In 440. they had their <hi>Leo Magnus,</hi> and ten ſince him have borne the ſame name. But the Pope muſt change his kind, and be content to be another Beaſt. A roaring and a devouring Lyon we will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to be, who rents and teares the Saints of God. But Chriſt is the onely Lyon of <hi>Judah,</hi> the onely King of his Church.</p>
                     <p>That there is a viſible, and externall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, diſtinct from the Politicall, by the word and diſcipline we affirme: But Jeſus Chriſt hath ordained it, not Monarchicall, but Ariſtocraticall, <hi>Matth. 18. 17.

Paſtors, Teachers, Elders,</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> in the ſeverall Precincts. The whole world is too large a Dioces for any one mortall Creature to take care of. The care of all Churches is beyond the ſtrength of any one man. Onely the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> can open the Book, and read it to all Churches: Hee onely can rule, and govern all Churches. Chriſt himſelfe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to all his Churches; namely, by his Spirit, which is more to the advantage of all Churches, then his bodily preſence would be, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 7. And therefore none of the Churches ſtand in need of the Pope, to give Lawes to them, or to govern them. He is an Uſurper, and muſt down; Chriſt is <hi>the Lion,</hi> the onely King of the Church.</p>

is gone, every day is a Sabbath, no day is a Sabbath. This is the Doctrine of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and Rebels againſt Jeſus Chriſt. There is a tribute to go out of our time every day we live. There is a certain Kingdome (I remember not the name of it at preſent) in which there is ſometimes (but rarely) a Fiſh taken; which by reaſon of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and excellency, and rarity, is the Kings Right, and Royalty, and therefore called <hi>the Kings Fiſh.</hi> The King alwaies gives the bulck and body of this Fiſh to thoſe that catch it; but he reſerves to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>Capita, &amp; Caudas,</hi> the heads, and the tailes, as a tribute, and acknowledgment, that all was his, &amp; due to him.

                     <p>There are extraordinary Taxes, upon extraordinary occaſions; you are pretty well acquainted with them.

                     <p>But eſpecially he will be feirce and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible againſt them that hurt, and kill his Whelps. But who are the Whelps of this Lyon?

But can they prevaile againſt the Lyon of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> whoſe Whelps they have injured and killed? Let me tell theſe deceitfull and bloody men, two or three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there is no creature more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their young ones, then the Lyon: the Lyon will defend his Whelps from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury till he fall downe dead; I have read ſo much in approved Authors.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let me tell them, they are indeed Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themſelves, baſe ſavage Lyons of the Foreſt. <hi>Davids</hi> cruell Perſecutors were <hi>gaping, ravening, and roaring Lyons. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro was a Lyon,</hi> and ſuch are all Tyrants. <note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 13. 2 Tim. 4. 17.</note> But the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> is ſtronger then they: <hi>Hee is the ſtrongeſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Lyons: <hi>and a King againſt whom there is no riſing up, Prov.</hi> 30. 30, 31. He is a foole <hi>that will contend with one that is mightier then himſelfe, Eccleſ.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let me tell them yet further; the Lyon may ſeem to ſleepe a while, even whileſt his Whelps ſuffer; but hee will rouſe up and roare. Some write, that the Lyon never ſleeps, but often ſeemes to ſleep when he is moſt awake. I am ſure <hi>the Lyon of the Tribe of Judah doth neither</hi>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104245:70"/>
but <hi>hee will awake as one out of ſleep, and like a mighty man that ſhouteth by reaſon of Wine: And he will ſmite his Enemies in the hinder parts; he will put them to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall reproach, Pſal.</hi> 78. 65, 66</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And laſtly, let me tell them a Story which I have read in a learned and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">Geſner de Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</note> Author, which he relates, and affirms to be true: his end is to prove, as the ſtrength, ſo the wiſedome of the Lyon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other creatures.</p>
                     <p>A Lyon and a Lyoneſſe, having Whelps, went both out to hunt for prey: In their abſence a Beare entred their Den, tore and killed the young Lyons, not able to defend themſelves; ſoon after the old Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the Lyoneſſe, returned to their Den, and finding their young ones ſlaine, they were filled with bitter grief and great rage: out they go together to finde out the Enemy, and be revenged; they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſpyed the Beare, yet bloody, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued it: The Bear, to eſcape their fury, climbed up into a tree, and ſo got out of their reach for the preſent: The Lyon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſtood ſtill at the root of the tree: the other Lyon went away, and ranged up, and downe in the Mountaines; till at laſt, he came where a man was hewing of wood.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104245:71"/>
He makes to the man; the poore man in feare let fall his Hatchet, and began to run away; after haſtens the Lyon, gets to him, caſts his tayle round about him like a Girdle, embraced him and licked him; and by the ſtrength of his tayle pulled him (led him, ſayes my Author) whither hee would or no: Firſt he brought him to his Hatchet, and pointed to it with his foot, to have the man take it up: he underſtood not the Lyons language: the Lyon then took up the Hatchet in his owne mouth, and ſo carryed it, leading the man into his Den. There he layd downe the Hatchet a while, looked upon the man, and then looked upon his murdered Whelps, made piteous moane, and then wound his tayle about the man againe, tooke up the Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet in his mouth, and (having ſhewed him that dolefull ſight) led him directly to the tree where the Bear was on the top, and the Lyoneſſe ſtanding at the root. The Lyon looks up, ſhewed him the Bear; and then the man began to ſuſpect, that it was the Beare that had done the wrong to the Lyon: He takes his Axe, heweth the tree, downe falls the Beare, and the Lyon and his mate fall upon him, and tare him to peices: that done, the Lyon carryed the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104245:71"/>
man, with the Hatchet, juſt to the place where he found him, and there left him unhurt, to hew wood againe.</p>
                     <p>This is credibly related: I will not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Story to be Goſpel, but I will warrant the application to be no leſſe. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and Perſecutors, that murder the <hi>Whelps of the Lyon of the tribe of Judah,</hi> that maſſacre the Saints of Chriſt, are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually called Bears in holy Writ. <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 5.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>For their ſecurity and ſafety they climbe up their tree; and their towre is the arme of fleſh: their greatneſſe, their multitudes, their amunitions, their military skill, their riches, their freinds <hi>The rich mans wealth is his ſtrong City, and as a high wall in his owne conceite, Prov</hi> 18. 11. They think in their ruffe and gallantry, that none can pluck them down; they vaunt, who ſhall us controule! How ſoon can the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> fetch Hewers out of the Mountaines, and hew down their Tree wherein they truſted, and teare them in peices, when there ſhall be none to help? Jeſus Chriſt can ſoon call in <hi>Carpenters,</hi> to <note place="margin">Zech. 1. 20. <hi>Verſs.</hi> 1</note> cut and ſaw of the hornes <hi>which have ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Judah, Iſraell, and Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And he will certainly do it. I will paſſe their doom (yet not I, but the Lord) and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104245:72"/>
ſo leave them. <hi>Therefore the Lord will bee unto them as a Lyon, as a Leopard by the way he will obſerve them: He will meet them as a Beare that is bereaved of her Whelps, and will rent the Caule of their heart, and there will he devoure them like a Lyon, the wild Beaſt ſhall teare them.

                     <p>Not in all things, I pray, take heed of that. In ſome reſpects, you muſt ſtrive to be unlike to Lyons, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Lyon hath a faire out-ſide. His Coat is <hi>Or</hi> continually, of yellow colour, and ſhines like Gold; but what's his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide?

                     <p n="2">2. The Lyon is ſtately, Majeſtical, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his fore-parts, but he degenerates to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104245:76"/>
his hinder parts; the more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the more uncomely. So Magiſtrates ordinarily, in the former part of their yeare, their Government is comely, very commendable, they ſhew ſome zeale for God; they roare againſt the Sins, and Scandals of the City: againſt Ale-houſes, prophanation of the Lords day, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the word: but the hinder part of their yeare is often very ugly; they are remiſſe in puniſhing ſin, and in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Juſtice. They may be ſaid to be like the Month of <hi>March:</hi> they come in like a Lyon, and go out like a Lamb; they are juſt like the yeare; when the Sun enters into <hi>Leo,</hi> in <hi>July,</hi> then the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is hot, and vigorous, but afterwards the yeare declines altogether, to an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne firſt, and then to a cold Winter. Even ſo, too too many Magiſtrates, at their firſt comming to a place, they ſhew ſome heat of zeale for the beſt things, but in a little time they decline in all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I have ſeen ſome Magiſtrates at their firſt coming into the place, have roared as Lyons againſt ſcandalous Miniſters; and ſilly dumb, or at leaſt unprofitable Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and have threatned to caſt them out of the City, and to get able, and godly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104245:76"/>
Miniſters into their room. But I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the end of the yeare, and what then? Truely ſome of the moſt godly, and able Miniſters, they have worried, but the ſcandalous, and unprofitable, ſtill continued in their places, <hi>as they were.</hi> Well, ſome Magiſtrates, if they be Lyons, they are like that Lyon, in the 1 <hi>King. Chap. 13. verſe</hi> 28. The Lyon ſlew the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet indeed, but had not eaten the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe, <note place="margin">1 King. 5.</note> nor ſlain the Aſſe.

Are theſe <note place="margin">Leonem larva ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</note> Lyons, that will bee ſcared with Vizards, and Hobgoblins? Theſe are the baſtard brood of Lyons. Harts, and Hares, timourous above other Creatures. The generous Lyon hath ſharp teeth,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104245:83"/>
crooked, and ſharp Tallons. But as for theſe they will neither bite, nor ſcratch. In one reſpect your City Armes do very well befit you. It is a Lyon with a Caſtle over it. Many of you can be Lyons, very Couragious, ſo long as you have a Caſtle over you, protection, and countenance; but take away the Caſtle, and who will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelfe to danger? What a ſordid thing is this? There is a Lyon couchant, indeed, but that is not the poſture of feare, but of triumph; having conquered firſt, and now lyeth down by the Prey. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet did I read of a Lyon <hi>Crouchant,</hi> or <hi>current.</hi> It is worthy the obſerving in the generous Lyon, that he will run apace through the Woods, and range ſwiftly through the foreſt after the prey; but when he is purſued &amp; chaſed by hunters, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth himſelfe, and is paſſant altogether, keeping his pace, and turneth not his head a ſide for any, but walks on, as ſcorning, and contemning all danger.

And herein, give me leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to walke as the Lyon walkes. How is that? Firſt, in regard of your whole Converſation; let your going be ſtately, not with proud phantaſticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, but humbly (an humble gate is a ſtately gate) ſoberly, holily, with all Gravity: walk as <hi>the Lyon of the Tribe of Judah:</hi> be you holy, as he is holy. Only (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul) Let your Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ſuch as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And as I call upon you, to walk as the Lyon, ſtately, gravely, and holily in your whole courſe of life: So let me exhort you, without offence, more particularly, to walk as Lyons, even in regard of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate, and pomp. The Lyon is the King of Beaſts, and is of a comely, and ſtately preſence, adorned with ſhaggy locks, buſhy haire, a golden and bright ſhining Mane which crownes his head,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104245:84"/>
and as Robes do cloath his neck, back, ſhoulders, and legs: and truely the Lyon would be a great deale more contemptible, if he were barbe'rd, and ſhaven. I ſay, be Lyons; Keep your haire, and skin; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your power, and ſtate, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of your Authority. King <hi>Agrippa</hi> came to the Judgment Seat with great <note place="margin">Act. 25. 23.</note> Pomp. And there is good uſe of theſe trappings to the common people, <hi>Ad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum phaleras.</hi> Theſe procure ſome reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, awe, and terrour in the people. And I do the rather inſiſt upon this, becauſe I ſee there is an Anabaptiſticall, Enthuſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, levelling Generation, ſtart up; who attempt very ſubtlely, <hi>Leonem rade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> to barb, and ſhave the Lyon: to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all Magiſtracy. And they do not go about directly, but ſlily, and with wiles. They would perſwade you at firſt, only to lay aſide your Robes, and your Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as either being ſuperſtitious, or elſe not agreeable to the ſimplicity of the Goſpell. Have you not lately been prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out of your Scarlet Gownes? and have you not very obediently left them off many times? Do they not inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all manner of Solemnity upon this very day of Inauguration: well, what will
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104245:85"/>
the end be? If they can but once ſhave off the Lyons majeſtick haire, and flay of his skin: it wil be a poor contemptible Carkaſs that is left. I dare ſay, though outward ſtate, and Pomp be but a Complement, yet take that quite away, and the very Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy will ſoone follow. Maintain your State and Power. It is obſervable in the Lyon, that when he walkes upon ſtony, rocky, and rough places, that he contracts and pulls up his Tallons, to preſerve them; for if they ſhould be broken, he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after ſeize upon his Prey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Your Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Enſignes of your Authority, are your Tallons: be carefull to preſerve them, elſe evill doers will contemne you; and you will never be able to give them ſo much as a ſcratch.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Know where your ſtrength lyeth. The Lyons ſtrength is in his head, and in his breaſt chiefly. And there lyeth your ſtrength, a good head, and a good heart, make a good Magiſtrate. Labour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for a good head; for knowledge, and a good underſtanding. Hearken to the word of the Lord: <hi>This book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt meditate therein day, and night; that thou mayſt obſerve to do according to all that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104245:85"/>
is written therein; for then thou ſhalt make thy way proſperous, and then ſhalt thou have good ſucceſſe.</hi> And above all, labour to have a good heart, an honeſt heart, a ſanctified heart, an obedient heart. Such a heart as <hi>David</hi> had; even an heart <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods own heart.</hi> Which that you <note place="margin">1 Sam. 13, 14.</note> may attain unto, do as <hi>Solomon</hi> did, pray, pray. Go unto the Lord, and ſay, <hi>And now oh Lord, my God, I thy Servant am in the midſt of thy people, which thou haſt cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, a great people: Give therefore thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant an underſtanding heart, to judge thy people, that I may diſcern between good, and bad: For who is able to judge this thy ſo great a people? 1 Kin.</hi> 3. 8. 9.</p>
                     <p>Beare away with you theſe few words of Exhortation; and that you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remember them, I ſhall preſent all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eies in a little Embleme. I am Gods Herauld, and I wil give you a Coat of Armes, an Eſcoucheon, which if you will own, you will ſhew your ſelfe a generous Lyon.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall beare, not <hi>Or,</hi> or <hi>argent:</hi> No no; you muſt not be carried away with Silver, or Gold, or ſuch earthly, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory things; but you ſhall beare Azure, blew, caeleſtiall: Have your Converſation in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:104245:86"/>
Let your charge be a Lyon: Now, as for the poſture of your Lyon, I have ſpent ſome ſerious thoughts.</p>
                     <p>It muſt not be <hi>a Lyon dormant.</hi> I beſeech you do not ſleep, neither at the Church, nor on the Bench.</p>
                     <p>It were a ſhame to have it, either <hi>crouchant,</hi> or <hi>fugient.</hi> Never yet was ſeen ſuch a Coat, as a <hi>Lyon current.</hi> To flee is a reproach: do not flee away, do not turn your back on Gods truth, on Gods cauſe, and Gods people; and all for cowardly feare: ſtand to <hi>the Lion of the Tribe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> to the laſt drop of blood.</p>
                     <p>Neither ſhould the Lyon be over-<hi>ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant: Rampant</hi> ſheweth his geſture in ſeizing on the Prey. The Prey that a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate purſueth, are evill doers. Purſue this Prey, be <hi>rampant,</hi> but not over-<hi>ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant,</hi> not over-rigorous; mingle mercy with Juſtice in your Government. <hi>Be not righteous over-much, Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 16.</p>
                     <p>I had thought a Lyon <hi>paſſant</hi> might have done well. The <hi>paſſant Lyon</hi> ſheweth but halfe his face as he paſſeth by: this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ſheweth much confidence, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: It ſheweth alſo much moderation. Be you <hi>paſſant</hi> towards the faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Servants of God: if for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104245:86"/>
and pure conſcience, they cannot ſwallow all things impoſed by the <hi>State,</hi> paſſe by it, connive; do not turn your head aſide to teare, and deſtroy a man, that is precious in Gods ſight; onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not ſin againſt his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The Prelates were Lyons indeed, but not <hi>paſſant:</hi> and therefore the Lord hath paſſed over them, even <hi>over their faire</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hoſ. 10. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>neck,</hi> and brought them low.</p>
                     <p>The Lyon therefore which I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you, and charge your Shield with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, is <hi>paſſant guardant:</hi> The Lyon <hi>paſſant guardant</hi> ſhewes his whole face; which notes not only Courage, and Reſolution, but Vigilancy alſo, and circumſpection. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Lyon is a flame of fire: behind him an empty Charriot, the wheels ratling: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his head a white Cock, with a great red Comb, and crowing: under him Dogs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening their mouths againſt him, and barking. Yet he keeps on his way undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not changing his pace, or turning his head aſide for feare of any. And the word,</p>

                     <p>Be vigilant in your great Office, not <hi>dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant;</hi> be <hi>ſalient,</hi> nimble, active, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious.

                     <p>Be mercifull in giving, and in forgiving. And to the Conſcientious, that cannot ſwallow every Impoſition, be <hi>paſſant,</hi> go by and let them alone.</p>

The Lyon is the moſt gratefull Creature in the world: And here give me leave to inſert a Story, both for the remarkable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, and alſo for the aptneſſe of it. (as I apprehend) to our preſent purpoſe: <hi>A. Gell. Noct. Att.</hi> Relates the ſtory from <hi>Appion Polyhiſter:</hi> Who did affirm to him, that in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> he ſaw the thing with his own eyes, he was a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. There were in <hi>Rome</hi> many monſtrous and ſavage Beaſts: Above all the reſt there was one Lyon, who for vaſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, incredible ſtrength, dreadfull roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, long, and buſhy haire waving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his head, neck, back, and legs, was terrible to behold, and ſtrook the Behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with amazement. A Conſul's Servant, whoſe name was <hi>Androdus</hi> for an offence was brought forth to this Lyon, either to fight with him, and conquer him, or elſe to be torn in peeces by the Lyon, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104245:101"/>
elſe could be expected. When this fierce Lyon ſaw <hi>Androdus</hi> afar off, hee made a ſudden ſtand, as it were in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! afterwards by little, and little hee comes on to the man, <hi>tanquam noſcitabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus:</hi> as if he thought he knew him, and were deſirous to know him more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Then he wags his taile after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a fawning Dog, rubs his body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the body of <hi>Androdus</hi> (who was almoſt dead for feare) and gently ſtrokes his thighs and hands with his tongue: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this kindneſſe of the Lyon, <hi>Androdus</hi> begins to recover his Spirit, and fixing his eyes upon the Lyon, he, and the Lyon, as knowing one another, began to renew ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and rejoyce, and play toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>Hereupon there was a ſtrange admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhout. <hi>Androdus</hi> was called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and the cauſe enquired why the moſt fierce, and barbarous of all the Lyons, ſhould ſpare him, and none elſe. Then <hi>Androdus</hi> gave a full account of the whole matter. I was a Servant, ſayes hee, to a <hi>Proconſul,</hi> a Lord-deputy in <hi>Africa;</hi> there having hard uſe, and continuall ſtripes from my Maſter. I was forced to run away. Wandring in ſolitudes, that I
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104245:102"/>
might not be found again by my Maſter: about Noon-tide in a hot ſcortching day, I enter'd a Cave for coolneſſe; preſently after, this very Lyon came into the ſame Den with a halting, and bloody foot, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and moaning, and as begging pity. At the firſt ſight of the Lyon I was terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but the Lyon ſoon eſpying me in a corner of his Den, came towards me in a peaceable manner, held up his wounded foot, ſhewed it me as craving my helpe: I pulled out of the plant of his foot, a great <note place="margin">Stirpem ingentem.</note> thorne, or ſhiver that ſtuck in it, nipped out the blood and corruption, cleanſed the wound, and healed it. The Lyon find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſe, and cure by my induſtry, reſted his foot in my hand. And from that day I lived three yeares in that Den, with this Lyon: and we had the ſame dyet. For when the Lyon had hunted, and caught his Prey, he would bring the fatteſt, and lovelieſt peeces to me; and becauſe I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fire, I roſted them againſt the Sun, dryed them, and eat them. But growing weary of that kind of life with the wilde Beaſt; when on a day, the Lyon was gon out after Prey, I left the Den, and ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: and after ſome three daies wand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, I was taken by the Souldiers, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104245:102"/>
brought to <hi>Rome</hi> to my Maſter; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently condemned me to be thrown to this Lyon. And I underſtand, that as ſoon as ever I was parted from the Lyon, the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo was taken in his ranging abroad, and brought to <hi>Rome:</hi> and now ſhewes me this kindneſſe for his cure. <hi>Appion</hi> ſaid, he heard <hi>Androdus</hi> make this relation. It was ſoon publiſhed abroad: and all the men petitioned <hi>Caeſar</hi> that the man might be pardon'd, and ſet free, and that the Lyon might be given to him. And upon the requeſt of the people, it was granted. Afterwards, ſaith <hi>Appion,</hi> we ſaw <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> leading the Lyon about the City by a ſmall Cord, from Tavern to Tavern: the people gave him money, and all as they met him, would ſay, <hi>Hic eſt Leo, hoſpes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, Hic eſt homo, medicus Leonis.</hi> Here is the Lyon the mans Land-Lord, and here is the man, the Lyons Surgeon.</p>
                        <p>The Story hath been ſomething long, I will give you the Application ſhort and quick: The man plucked a thorne out of the Lyons foot, the Lyon gave the man his life for a reward: And will not <hi>the Lyon of the Tribe of Judah</hi> do more then a Lyon of the Forreſt? Doſt thou ſee in any of Chriſt poor Members, a thorne? a thorn
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104245:103"/>
of extream poverty, and want? a thorn of miſery, that they are ready to periſh? Pull out the thorn, eaſe them, help them, refreſh their bowels: Chriſt will give you life, even eternall life for your reward. He will feed and protect you here, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie you hereafter.</p>
