            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Reformation of
Poetry, and Restoring
the <hi>Muses</hi> to the Service of
the Temple, is a Glorious
Work, and requires a Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
whose transcendent
Quality and Virtues can give
<pb facs="tcp:93150:3"/>
Sanction to what she is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to favour.</p>
            <p>'Twas therefore my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as well as Ambition, to
present these pious Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
to your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness's
Protection; which,
like an Altar, should only

Piety, Madam, has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in all your Actions
and Deportment, with such
prevailing Charms, as have
engaged many to become
her Votaries, even in so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd
an Age as This.</p>
            <p>Your Royal Brest is the
Sacred Court where the

'twould be Presumption for

            <p>THE Publishing an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Miscellany of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems,</hi>
on <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi>
Subjects, can displease no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who have any respect for
Virtue; and She has few <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest</hi>
Enemies.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
are capable of all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellishments
of <hi>Poetry,</hi> has been
confirmed by the Suffrage and
Performance of best <hi>Poets</hi> in
all Ages.</p>

'Tis there the Muses breath
their <hi>native</hi> Air. After all
their Prodigal persuits of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
'Tis thither they must
come, to recover Strength and
Beauty, to appear like Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in a Dress that is suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their Quality.</p>
            <p>Those are only to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
legitimate Off-springs of
Wit, which are useful to the
World, or, at least, Inoffensive.
For such Births which the
<hi>Muse</hi> that conceiv'd them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
look upon with <hi>Satisfaction,</hi>
should be excluded the Favour
and Patronage of <hi>noble</hi> Minds.

            <p>Perhaps there is no Talent
or Genius more capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
serviceable to Mankind,
than That of <hi>Poetry.</hi> But 'tis
the Misfortune of that generous
Soil to be over-run with poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Weeds,</hi> and thin stockt
with wholsome Plants. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
I had not inserted in this
Collection any of my own Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says.
Neither will I pretend
those from other Hands to be,
All of 'em, choicest in their Kind.
<pb facs="tcp:93150:7"/>
However, they had, generally,
the private Approbation, and
many of them the <hi>Applause</hi> of
able Iudges. Some of 'em car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
their Sanction in the Names
of their Authors; such as Dr.
<hi>Jeremy Taylor, Dr. Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Roscommon,</hi>
and Others. Several also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Anonymous</hi> will
approve themselves to come
from Eminent Hands. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which the Ladies may
have the Entertainment to find,
that our Age and Country have
produc'd more than One <hi>Orin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93150:7"/>
In so good a <hi>Design,</hi> 'tis
hop'd, the Ingenious will time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
supply a second <hi>Freight,</hi> and
Pardon what they think de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in this <hi>first</hi> Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Youthful Minds will have
their <hi>Diversions,</hi> where Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
comes in for no small
Share. 'Tis therefore a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Service to furnish them
with such as may be instructive,
and entertain their <hi>Fancy,</hi>
without viciating their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</hi>
For which Reason the
Encouraging a <hi>Book</hi> of this
<pb facs="tcp:93150:8"/>
Nature is the Interest of all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and Masters of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
who are best Obey'd, in
Both Capacities, when their
Children and Servants have
a Sense of <hi>Piety.</hi> Nay, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Poetry may be one Means
of reclaiming even profligate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
by its insinuating <hi>Charms,</hi>
in the Sweetness of its Streins,
and Harmony of its Numbers,
according to that of our divine
<hi>Herbert,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>A <hi>Verse</hi> may take him who a <hi>Sermon</hi>
flies,</l>
                  <l>And turn <hi>Delight</hi> into a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93150:8"/>
If Verse has such Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they will doubtless exert
themselves most happily on <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
and <hi>Moral</hi> Subjects, which
naturally excite all the innocent
<hi>Passions</hi> of our Minds. Nothing
furnishes the <hi>Fancy</hi> with more
charming <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>Imagry.</hi>
No other Topicks or Occasions
suggest such exalted <hi>Notions</hi>
and <hi>Sentiments;</hi> nor is any
Thing capable of nobler Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression:
Which, (I think)
are all the Requisites a Poet
can desire. He will certainly
find the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> his
best Magazine, of which Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

Thou seest my conscious Fears,</l>
               <l>Therefore, kind Planet, let thy Ev'ning Beams,</l>
               <l>Before they sink in Western Streams,</l>
               <l>Set first in my Repenting <hi>Tears</hi>

               <l>To chear my Soul a fairer Dawn</l>
               <l>And brighter Sun of Righteousness may Rise:</l>
               <l>The Sun, who only can send forth a Ray,</l>

You, that carve Virtue deckt with ev'ry Grace,</l>

               <l>The first Original <hi>Statue</hi> of a Prayer!</l>
               <l>Heaven took thee up when it beheld thee down;</l>
               <l>So Princes kneel when they receive a Crown.</l>
               <l>Nor did Heav'ns sudden Summons Thee surprise,</l>
               <l>It scarce could ever find thee otherwise,</l>
               <l>Thy pious Soul in Consecrated Clay,</l>
               <l>(For 'twas a Temple) never ceas'd to pray.</l>
               <l>Thy oft repeated Storms Heaven's Gates assail'd,</l>
               <l>Whose sacred Violence at last prevail'd;</l>
               <l>Heaven kindly yielding sent a Message down,</l>

               <l>One Period ends thy Combat and thy Breath,</l>

               <l>No Walls so high, but may be scal'd by Pray'r</l>
               <l>New Stratagems by Piety are found,</l>

               <l>That could discern the Spirit from the Prayer.</l>
               <l>Enjoy blest Shade what thou hast bravely won,</l>
               <l>Possess that Heaven which thou hadst here
begun;</l>
               <l>Heaven doth to us thy prostrate Body grant,</l>
               <l>The precious Reliques of so great a Saint,</l>

               <l>A welcome Present, as thy Soul to Heaven:</l>
               <l>Whilst this here prays below, that sings on high,</l>

                  <l>A Sullen Planet frown'd upon my Birth,</l>
                  <l>Nor to this Hour allows one Minute's
Mirth;</l>
                  <l>Yet still I'm flatter'd with deceitful Air,</l>
                  <l>That always says to Morrow shall be fair.</l>
                  <l>No Morrow yet has darted one kind Ray,</l>
                  <l>But still proves darker than the former Day.</l>
                  <l>The ruffling Winds oftimes disturb the Main,</l>
                  <l>But soon the Billows grow compos'd again;</l>
                  <l>No Leaves in Winter on the Grove are seen,</l>
                  <l>Which yet the next Spring Cloaths with fresher
Green.</l>
                  <l>When sudden Storms eclipse the Morning's
Light,</l>

bright.</l>

My gloomy Thoughts no Interval can find,</l>
                  <l>The Tempest always rages in my Mind.</l>
                  <l>My Sighs are all the Musick I employ,</l>
                  <l>My Sighs are all the Musick I enjoy;</l>
                  <l>With these I pass the tedious Night away,</l>
                  <l>With these I pass the yet more tedious Day.</l>
                  <l>My Friends, 'tis true, their Counsel oft address,</l>
                  <l>Advise me oft to make my Sorrows less.</l>
                  <l>I took their Council, gave to Mirth the Rein;</l>
                  <l>Mirth only brought more sharp <hi>Returns</hi> of Pain.</l>

                  <l>Tempestuous Sighs destroy'd the Infant Smile.</l>
                  <l>And when I try to Sleep my Griefs to Rest,</l>
                  <l>Their Crys fright from my Door the gentle
Guest.</l>
                  <l>Ye Streams and Groves, my long frequented
Seats,</l>
                  <l>Ye Rocks &amp; Caves, my Sorrows last Retreats!</l>
                  <l>You know, how oft my Groans in vain <hi>supprest,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Have with recoiling Fury torn my Breast.</l>
                  <l>While Eccho, gentle sharer of my Woe,</l>
                  <l>Returns a Sigh to ev'ry Sigh I throw.</l>

Each in her Turn renews the doleful Strain,</l>

                  <l>Tell him that I with long Desires decay,</l>

An humble Fortune kindly does deny</l>
                  <l>Th' Incentives of our Pride and Luxury.</l>
                  <l>My weaker Vertue may be here secure,</l>

                  <l>So little Vessels may securely ride</l>
                  <l>On a small River's smooth and gentle Tide;</l>
                  <l>Where weaker Winds with soft and easy Gales</l>
                  <l>Scarce heave the Bosom of their humble Sails.</l>
                  <l>But if they put to Sea, too late they find</l>
                  <l>Their Sail unequal for a fiercer Wind.</l>
                  <l>Hopeless they're with impetuous Fury born,</l>
                  <l>Split on the Rocks, or with the Tempest torn.</l>

                  <l>What must it be with Wealth's incumbring
Load?</l>

                  <l>And all Temptations with such ease repell,</l>
                  <l>That my Ambition any harder Task</l>

That I with <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Toil</hi> should purchase Foes,</l>

                  <l>Are those I cannot shun so few or slight,</l>

                  <l>I'm born for Heav'n, and shall I chuse to stray,</l>

                  <l>Through Roads more troublesome, and less

                  <l>The greatest danger that my fear should move,</l>
                  <l>Is, lest the World should too obliging prove.</l>
                  <l>She's then most dang'rous when her smiling Art,</l>
                  <l>And splendid Dress invite my yielding heart.</l>
