            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THat the seasoning of Youth with Truth and the pure genuine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christianity is a business of mighty consequence, cannot be in the least doubted by any that observe (as who may not?) that the lamentable <hi>ignorance</hi> of the generality of those who are honoured with the name <hi>Christians,</hi> and the gross <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneousness</hi> and <hi>Misunderstanding</hi> of the Gospel, that multitudes, which yet make a great profession of it, are manifestly guilty of, are to be imputed to no one thing so much as to the neglect of that duty: And that the want of pious education hath more than any other thing whatsoever rendred ineffectual the industrious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb facs="tcp:93031:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of faithful Ministers for the good of Souls.</p>
            <p>First, this is apparently the grand and fundamental Cause of so many peoples gross <hi>Ignorance</hi> of that Religion which they are baptized into, and have all their days lived under the preaching of; and 'tis not to be denied that those whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings gain none, or but very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable improvement by hearing the Holy Scriptures read, and the Doctrines they contain, explained in the <hi>Church,</hi> are almost universally such as whose Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or those that had the charge of them, took none or very little care to instruct at <hi>home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And who doth not see also, that the strange proneness of people to be <hi>misled,</hi> and turned about with every wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, is nothing so much to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to their want of good <hi>Preaching,</hi> as to their not being prepossessed and <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> anticipated with the <hi>wholesom words of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> their not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>timely</hi> antidoted with the <hi>Doctrine that is according to godliness,</hi> against
<pb facs="tcp:93031:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the poysonous Principles of the many <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers</hi> that are entred into the world, and make such sad <hi>Havock</hi> of souls among our selves.</p>
            <p>And as the constant experience of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind assureth us, that there is no such time for improving in other <hi>Sciences</hi> or <hi>Mysteries,</hi> as <hi>Youth,</hi> and that few be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very considerable in any profession, who have not studied it in their <hi>younger</hi> years, so 'tis rare to find any that have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to but a <hi>competent</hi> proficiency in the <hi>great Mystery of Godliness,</hi> in whom the grounds of it have not been laid in <hi>that</hi> age. Therefore the <hi>wise man</hi> adviseth <hi>to remember our Creator in the days of our youth,</hi> and <hi>to train up a Child in the way that he should go,</hi> adding that <hi>when he is old, he will not</hi> then <hi>depart from it.</hi> And as S. <hi>Paul</hi> told <hi>Timothy,</hi> who had a religious Mother and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, that <hi>from a Child he had known the Scriptures, which are able to make him wise to salvation,</hi> so hath it always been the practice of truly pious Parents and Governours of Youth, to
<pb facs="tcp:93031:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
take care that God and the good things of his Law may get the first possession of their Childrens hearts; and not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the well principling of them till they arrive at a mature and settledjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: as well knowing that <hi>Young</hi> ones are ordinarily as much more docile and tractable than those of <hi>Ripe</hi> years, as is a <hi>Twig</hi> more lithe and yielding than the body of a <hi>Grown Tree;</hi> and that 'tis far easier to prevent the fixing of evil habits in their Souls, than to extirpate them being fixed.</p>
            <p>Now in order to the better instructing of <hi>Youth,</hi> the way of learning them <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisms,</hi> or Books containing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the Substance of Religion by <hi>Questions</hi> and <hi>Answers,</hi> is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>General</hi> and very <hi>Ancient</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church of God; but it must be acknowledged that through the too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent and unskilful composure of most <hi>Catechisms,</hi> this way hath not proved so successful, as it might (with the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God) have been, had due care and judgment been used about them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93031:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>'Tis easie to shew how much there is of <hi>mistake</hi> and <hi>men</hi> in them; and that, whereas God commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to teach their Children <hi>his Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> not any notions of their <hi>own,</hi> they are generally too faulty in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: And by this means have become greater propagators of some <hi>uncertain Speculations,</hi> and even <hi>dangerous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> than furtherances of useful and necessary knowledge; and possessed the <hi>Learners</hi> of them both with a wrong no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Christianity</hi> in general, and such particular opinions as tend to enervate and make insignificant the wholsome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine taught by them.</p>
            <p>This great abuse hath very much been complained of by <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> men; and it was the affecting sense that the most pious and worthy Person, our <hi>Authour,</hi> had of it that prevail'd with him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this <hi>Catechism:</hi> of whom (by the way) I cannot forbear (notwithstanding the extremely narrow room I am here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to) to give this general and very short Account, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93031:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>That as he was highly valued (by men capable of understanding the worth of that accomplishment) for his excellent Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so all <hi>Good</hi> men that had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of knowing him could do no other than greatly love and honour him for the incomparably more noble endowment of a <hi>divine</hi> temper and most <hi>Christ-like</hi> spirit that appeared in him. Among other, there were no vertues he was more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be an Example of, than a <hi>Dove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like innocence</hi> and <hi>simplicity,</hi> a <hi>Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like meekness, humility</hi> and <hi>peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> the greatest <hi>benignity, candor</hi> and <hi>ingenuity,</hi> the most <hi>Christian</hi> (that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited and universal) <hi>charity;</hi> (in which those that dissented from him in matters of Religion (which is rare in these days) had not only a <hi>real</hi> but <hi>great</hi> interest) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <hi>self-resignation</hi> to the will of God, &amp; a very <hi>devout</hi> temper of mind towards him. And those must needs conclude that he loved God and the souls of men in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degree, that observed how very <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick spirited</hi> he was, and wonderfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious in contriving and promoting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
<pb facs="tcp:93031:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the bettering of the World, and in exciting others to do the like.</p>
            <p>To omit other <hi>lasting</hi> Monuments of his pious industry, Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s most elaborate Discourses, by him collected and published in one great Volume, will <hi>perpetuate</hi> his memory. All that know what he hath <hi>there</hi> alone performed will pronounce him a most indefatigable pains taker for the publick good.</p>
            <p>And I presume that those that shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the following <hi>Catechism</hi> will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it a no less <hi>laborious</hi> than <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> work, and consequently that it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other very singular instance of his solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous concern for their better part: And as I said, that the sense he had of the ill services that too many Catechisms do in the world, was the occasion of his composing <hi>this,</hi> so I verily believe that a more effectual course cannot well be taken for remedying of that mischief.</p>
            <p>For, first, that so it may neither be too <hi>large</hi> nor yet defective, he hath with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent judgment made it to consist of all the most necessary and important points of Religion, and of none other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That so all Christians of what denomination so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may have no temptation to suspect the truth of
<pb facs="tcp:93031:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, he hath composed it of Texis of <hi>Scripture;</hi> and not taken liberty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press any one Doctrine, whether relating to <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Manners,</hi> in words of his own invention: nor hath he any where made use of such Scriptural Phrases as to men of competent understandings are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure or ambiguous; or so much as <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi> misapplied any: but all he useth are very pertinent to his purpose, according to the apparent sence of them; as, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise my self, all persons not grosly silly or prejudic'd will bear me witness.</p>
            <p>And whereas several phrases are briefly explained in other words, it is done on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the sake of the most ignorant, and to render them at first sight intelligible to the very lowest capacities: Nor are any of those explications such as, I can see, may be called in question with any shadow of reason. But besides, that no man may think his judgment imposed upon by them, taking notice that they are not to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed as a part of the <hi>Catechism;</hi> and that so it may readily be read without them, they are all markt to be printed
<pb facs="tcp:93031:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in a distinct Character, and moreover inclosed with two stroaks as Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>In short, the Reader may reap these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing advantages, by the careful perusal of this <hi>Catechism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> He may be instructed thereby in the main body and substance of <hi>simple pure Christianity,</hi> without the adulterations and spurious mixtures (to borrow a phrase from a very excellent Doctor) of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made Divinity.</hi>

And I may hereto apply the well known Verse,

            <p>I shall now make two humble and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest requests, and then conclude my alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too long Preface.</p>
            <p>First, That Parents and others that have the charge of Youth, will be pleased to instruct them thoroughly in this Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism; I mean after they have well learnt and digested <hi>that</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> hath set forth for them: concerning which I must

needs say, that as it is very well adapted to the capacities of young ones, so (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever too many do think of it) it is an excellently good foundation to superstruct upon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That those that are more than Children, either in <hi>age</hi> or <hi>understanding,</hi> will not disdain (because this is a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism) frequently to read it and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atively to weigh and ponder it. I have said enough to perswade my Readers not to deny me these requests.</p>
            <p>Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting Covenant, make us perfect in every good work to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, (<hi>by blessing to us</hi> this <hi>and all those many other excellent helps he hath graciously afforded us for that purpose</hi>) to whom be glory for ever and ever.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The duty towards <hi>man</hi> which I learn from the consideration of God's goodness and mercy is this, that we should be patient towards all men, not rendring evil for evil to any man <note n="a" place="parend">1 Thes. 5. 14, 15.</note>, but do good to all <note n="b" place="parend">Gal. 6. 10.</note>, even to them that hate us <note n="c" place="parend">Mat. 5. 44.</note> and to be merciful as our Father also is merciful, and kind to the unthankful and to the evil <note n="d" place="parend">Luke 6. 35, 36.</note>, and forgive one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven us <note n="e" place="parend">Eph. 4 32.

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In this was manifested the love of God to us, in that he sent his only begotten Son into the world, to be the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world, that we might live through him. <note place="parend">1 John 4. 9, 10. &amp; 2 2. &amp; 4. 14.</note>

            <p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> Having seen what is meant by Faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Lord Jesus Christ, let us see what is meant by Repentance, which is also necessary to qualifie and fit us to receive pardon of sin and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Jesus Christ: What is it therefore truly and savingly to Repent?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Truly and savingly to Repent is, with a godly sorrow <note n="a" place="parend">2 Cor. 7. 9, 10.</note> and shame <note n="b" place="parend">Ezek. 36. 31, 32.

               <hi>Q.</hi> You cannot think that good purposes and resolutions of amendment are sufficient to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, by no means, but we must through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amend our ways and doings <note n="a" place="parend">Jer. 7. 5.</note>, we must do works meet for Repentance <note n="b" place="parend">Acts 26. 20.</note>, and bring forth fruits answerable to amendment of life <note n="c" place="parend">Mat. 3. 8.</note>: for every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen down and cast into the fire <note n="d" place="parend">Mat. 3. 10. 7. 19.</note>.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> Having seen the nature of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, tell me, what is meant by New and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Obedience, which is also absolutely necessary to Salvation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By new and Spiritual Obedience is meant, that we must make us a new spirit <note n="a" place="parend">Ezek. 18. 31.</note>, (<hi>that is, do our best endeavour for it</hi>) and walk in newness of life <note n="b" place="parend">Rom. 6. 4.</note>; that we must put off as to the former conversation the old man which is corrupt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spirit of our mind; and put on the new man which after God is created in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and true holiness <note n="c" place="parend">Eph. 4. 22, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How is this new and spiritual Obedience farther explained in Scripture?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is thus farther explained, namely, That
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93031:22"/>
we should not walk nor live after the flesh, but after the spirit (<hi>or according to the spiritual Precepts of the Gospel</hi>) <note n="a" place="parend">Rom. 8. 1, 12.</note> that we should not any longer live to the lusts of men, but to the will of God <note n="b" place="parend">1 Pet. 4. 2.</note>: that we should yield our selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God <note n="c" place="parend">Rom. 6. 13.</note>: and that as we have yielded our members servants to uncleanness and to ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity unto iniquity, even so now we should yield our members servants to righteousness unto holiness <note n="d" place="parend">Rom. 6. 19.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> By what arguments and motives doth the Scripture inforoe, and press us to, this new and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Obedience?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> One ground and argument in Scripture for spiritual obedience is this, That if any man be in Christ (<hi>or a true Christian</hi>) he is a new creature <note n="a" place="parend">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note>, and if we are new Creatures, and God's workmanship, we are created in Christ Jesus unto good works, to the which God hath before prepared us that we should walk in them <note n="b" place="parend">Eph. 2. 10.</note>, and therefore they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts <note n="c" place="parend">Gal. 5. 24.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What other argument or motive do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in Scripture for spiritual Obedience?</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:93031:23"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> A second argument is this, That Christ his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, to the end that we, being dead unto sin, should live unto righteousness <note n="a" place="parend">1 Pet. 2. 24.</note>; and he gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himself a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people zealous of good works <note n="b" place="parend">Titus 2. 14.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What other argument or motive in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture can you rehearse for spiritual Obedience?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> A third argument is this, That Christ hath said, if we love him, and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, he will love us, and manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unto us <note n="a" place="parend">John 14. 15, 21.</note>, and also that his Father will love us, &amp; they both will make their abode with us <note n="b" place="parend">v. 23.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What other argument or motive in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture can youthink on for spiritual Obedience?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> A fourth argument is this, That if we live after the flesh we shall die, but if we through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body we shall live <note n="a" place="parend">Rom. 8. 13.</note>; If we sow to the flesh, we shall of the flesh reap corruption, but if we sow to the spirit, we shall of the spirit, reap life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting <note n="b" place="parend">Gal. 6. 8.</note>; That being become the servants of God we shall have our fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life <note n="c" place="parend">Rom. 6. 22.</note>; That great peace have they that love God's law <note n="d" place="parend">Psal. 119. 165.</note>, and in Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93031:23"/>
thereof there is great reward <note n="e" place="parend">Psal. 19. 11.</note>. And (<hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>) blessed are they that do his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note n="f" place="parend">Rev. 22. 14.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What are the works of the flesh which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Christian is to crucifie?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, sornication, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murthers, drunkenness, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellings and such like; and they that do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God. <note place="parend">Gal. 5. 19. &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What are the fruits of the Spirit that every Christian is to bring forth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The fruits of the Spirit are Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, temperance, &amp; against such there is no law. <note place="parend">Gal. 5. 22, 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Will not outward privileges or respects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail us any thing to justification and salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this new and spiritual obedience?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcifion, but a new creature <note n="a" place="parend">Gal. 6. 15.</note>, &amp; the keeping of the commandments of God <note n="b" place="parend">1 Cor. 7. 19.</note>; and not every one that saith, Lord, Lord, shall enter

into the Kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will of his Father which is in heaven <note n="c" place="parend">Mat. 7. 21.</note>; For why call ye me Lord, Lord, (<hi>saith our Saviour</hi>) and do not the things which I say <note n="d" place="parend">Luke 6. 46.</note>? The hearers of the Law are not just before God, but the doers of the Law shall be justified <note n="e" place="parend">Rom. 2. 13.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> May it not suffice to keep some of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, but must we obey all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We must have respect unto all God's commandments <note n="a" place="parend">Psal. 119. 6.</note>, and hate every false way <note n="b" place="parend">Psal. 119. 104.</note>; for whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet (<hi>wilfully</hi>) offend in one point, he is guilty of all <note n="c" place="parend">James 2. 10.</note>; (<hi>or liable to the punishment due to the breach of all,</hi> viz. <hi>Eternal death.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Will God accept at our hands nothing short of absolutely perfect Obedience?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him; for he knoweth our frame, he remembreth that we are but dust <note n="a" place="parend">Psal. 103. 13, 14.</note>, and if there be a willing mind it is accepted, according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not <note n="b" place="parend">2 Cor. 8. 12.</note>. (<hi>That is, it is accepted, if we demonstrate that we are reallywilling, by our acting in a good suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Do you think that you can deserve forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sin and eternal Salvation at God's hands by obeying his commandments?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, by no means; but when we have done all those things that are commanded us, we must say that we are unprofitable servants, we have done <hi>but</hi> that which was our duty to do <note n="a" place="parend">Luke <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Q.</hi> Seeing we cannot merit at God's hands by any thing we can do, and that we are pardoned and saved purely by the free Grace of God in Christ, how comes obedience to his commandments to be indispensably necessary to our being so?</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Obedience to God's commandments is therefore indispensably necessary to our being pardoned and saved, because that the righteous Lord loveth righteousness <note n="a" place="parend">Psal. 11. 7.</note>, but hateth wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness <note n="b" place="parend">Psal. 45. 7.</note>, and all the workers of iniquity <note n="c" place="parend">Psal. 5. 5.</note>, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch

               <hi>A.</hi> God spake all these words, saying, I am the Lord thy God, which hath brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of Bondage.</p>

3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy: Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt not do any work, thou nor thy Son nor thy Daughter, thy Man-servant, nor thy Maid-servant, nor thy cattel, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> How are these ten Commandments abridged by our Saviour Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He hath reduced them all to these two; Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind and with all thy strength. This is the first Commandment (<hi>or the first Table</hi>) And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self. <note place="parend">Mark 12. 30, 31.</note>
            </p>

            <p>

            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen <note n="a" place="parend">1 John 4. 20.</note>? and whoso

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Hath not Christ given a new commandment concerning the loving of our brethren?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> A new commandment he hath given to us, That we love one another, as he hath loved us that we also love one another <note n="a" place="parend">John 13. 34.</note>. And as hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us; so we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren <note n="b" place="parend">1 John 3. 16.</note>.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> Are the commandments of Christ impossible or difficult to be obeyed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> His commandments are not grievous <note n="a" place="parend">1 John 5. 3.</note>, but his yoke is easie and his burthen is light <note n="b" place="parend">Mat. 11. 30.</note>.

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We are not sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our selves, but our sufficiency is of God <note n="a" place="parend">2 Cor. 3. 5.</note>, whose grace is sufficient for us <note n="b" place="parend">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note>.

to do of his good pleasure <note n="c" place="parend">Phil. 2. 13.</note>; but as without Christ we can do nothing <note n="d" place="parend">John 15. 5.</note>, so we can do all things through Christ which strengthneth us <note n="e" place="parend">Phil. 4. 13.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Are we therefore to lie idle, and only to live in expectation of power from above to work in us both to will and to do what is required of us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No verily, but we are to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is God which worketh in us both to will and to do: (<hi>that is, because we are enabl ed by the concurrence of God's grace with our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours both to resolve firmly to do well, and to perform accordingly.</hi>) <note place="parend">Phil. 2. 12, 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Seeing we are unable without the supply of God's grace and Spirit to keep his commandments, and therefore it cannot but be absolutely necessary for us to pray to him that we may be strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with might by his Spirit in the inward man, what encouragement have we to hope for spiritual strength upon our praying for it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We are encouraged from those words of Christ; Ask and it shall be given you: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you, &amp;c. If ye being evil know how to give good gifts unto your

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We are further encouraged from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of the new Covenant, which is this; I will put (<hi>saith God</hi>) my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts <note n="a" place="parend">Heb. 8. 10</note>; I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh, and I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and do them <note n="b" place="parend">Ezek. 36. 26, 27. &amp; 11. 19.</note> (<hi>Which Promises suppose that we must not be wilfully or carelesly wanting to our selves in the use of means</hi>) [as is manifest by comparing these texts with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 31. and <hi>James</hi> 4. 8. and many such like.]</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are these three: 1. Prayer: 2. The holy Scriptures or Word of God: 3. The Sacraments.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Prayer'is the making known our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests to God <note n="a" place="parend">Phil. 4. 6.</note>, and the pouring out our hearts before him <note n="b" place="parend">Psal. 62. 8.

               <hi>A.</hi> The sufferings and death of Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in this Sacrament shew unto us the evil and heynousness of sin, in that we are not redeemed from it but with the precious Blood of Christ <note n="a" place="parend">1 Pet. 1. 18, 19.</note>, his soul was exceeding sorrowful even unto death <note n="b" place="parend">Mat. 26. 38.</note>, it pleased the Lord to bruise him and to put him to grief <note n="c" place="parend">Isa. 53. 10.</note>, and to lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the iniquities of us all <note n="d" place="parend">ver. 6.</note>.

               <hi>A.</hi> The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper engageth us to love each other, in that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of that one bread <note n="a" place="parend">1.

Heaven encourageth us to run the race that is set before us with patience <note n="a" place="parend">Heb. 12. 1, 2.</note>, because we rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us <note n="b" place="parend">Rom. 8. 18.</note>: Nay, when men shall revile and persecute us, and shall say all manner of evil against us falsly for Christ's sake, we are to rejoice and to be exceeding glad <note n="c" place="parend">Mat. 5. 11, 12.</note>, and <hi>even</hi> leap for joy, because that great is our reward in Heaven <note n="d" place="parend">Luke 6. 23.</note>; and our light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory <note n="e" place="parend">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note>.</p>

               <p>MOst Great and Gracious Lord God, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort: Thou art worthy to receive all thanks and praise for all thy mercies and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours towards me. — Blessed be thy name for preserving me the night past from all danger and evil, for refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with comfortable sleep, and raising me up to see the light of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day. — In thee I live and have my being: Thy mercies are new every

Teach me to know thy will, and enable me to do it; that I may not sin against thee at any time. — Keep me this day from all evil, and preserve me from all danger. O Lord, preserve my going out and my coming in, from this time forth and for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. And give me grace, I beseech thee, to serve thee in holiness and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness all the days of my life, and to do that which is well pleasing in thy sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
