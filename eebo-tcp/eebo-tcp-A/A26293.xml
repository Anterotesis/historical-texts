            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NEITHER the considerable Posts, to which your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have formerly advanced you in Armies abroad in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, nor those which by your Experience in Military Affairs, you have justly gained at home in your Own, could ever be able to hinder you from delighting your self with Books. Those are your

Companions, as well in your Tent, as your House; wherein your <hi>Genius</hi> hath faithfully guided you in the true Paths of Honour; <hi>Pallas</hi> being the Goddess both of Arms and Learning. The <hi>Greek Hero</hi> could not sleep without <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s <hi>Iliads</hi> under his Pillow. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides whom, you have two others for your Pattern, the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished Gentlemen, and Men admirable in your Profession, the World could ever boast of, I mean the famous <hi>Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> both equally addicted to Arts and Arms.</p>
            <p>I confess I know your Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lead you to things of more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Learning, yet guessing that a
<pb facs="tcp:62747:3"/>
Variety may not be unpleasant, I have ventured to Dedicate this to you, hoping it may serve your Diversion when tyred with Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, or your more serious Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. In this Piece there is a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Subjects as well as of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, some of which, I presume, may give you the Satisfaction, I wish, in their Perusal; For I can justly boast that the Translations, are from many of the most admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Poets both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, in their several Languages extant, which of themselves would need no Apology for their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in public, were it not for the Blemishes they may have received in passing thrô my hands; And

none of these having been English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Ingenious Translators of our late published <hi>Miscellanies,</hi> as I ever heard, may possibly appear new to you.</p>
            <p>Sir, I hope you will pardon the Liberty I have taken, in shewing, by so slight a Present, the Respect, and Honour I justly bear you, I being glad to lay hold on any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to declare to the World that I am,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>EVery Product of a Man's Wit now-a-days, had need be like that of <hi>Jove</hi>'s Brain, at least in its coming out armed, that it might immediately be in a Condition of defence against the furious Assaults of Criticks, some of which are ready to run down a Book when they have scarce read the Title-page: Of these I expect not a few that will be carping, and first perchance at my Title, Why <hi>Lyric Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems</hi>? I having in most of them exceeded the proper measure, which in strictness should not reach to the <hi>Heroick.</hi> To these I say, that I have herein followed the modern <hi>Italian, Spanish,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Poets, who always call <hi>Lyrics,</hi> all such Sonnets, and other small Poems, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be set to Music, without restraining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to any particular Length of Verse. And our grand Master of <hi>Lyrics,</hi> even <hi>Horace</hi> himself, has sometimes inserted the <hi>Heroic</hi> amongst his:
<pb facs="tcp:62747:5"/>
This also his great Imitator <hi>Casimire</hi> the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> has often done: And the ingenious Mr. <hi>Gibbs</hi> or <hi>Gibbesius</hi> our Countrey-man at <hi>Rome</hi> takes the same liberty; which yet, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, the <hi>Greeks</hi> would never allow of. If any quarrel at the Oeconomy, or Structure of these Poems, many of them being Sonnets, Canzons, Madrigals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> objecting that none of our great Men, either Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> whom it was most proper to have followed, have ever stoop'd to any thing of this sort; I shall very readily acknowledge, that being sensible of my own Weakness and Inability of ever attaining to the performance of one thing equal to the worst piece of theirs, it easily disswaded me from that attempt, and put me on this; which is not without President; For many eminent Persons have published several things of this nature, and in this method, both Translations and Poems o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> be boasted of; and thô I have little reason after it
<pb facs="tcp:62747:5"/>
to expect Credit from these my slight Miscellanies, yet has it not discouraged me from adventuring on what my Genius prompted me to. As for those Pieces which I have translated from the modern Poets, I may presume to say, I have taken them from the most celebrated in each Language: The <hi>Italians</hi> were, <hi>Fra. Petrarca, Cav. Marino, Girolamo Preti, Cav. Guarini, Allessandro Tassoni,</hi> and others; The <hi>Spaniards, Garci Lasso de la Vega, Don Francisco de Quevedo, Don Luis de Gongora,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueses, Luis de Camoens,</hi> &amp;c. But for the <hi>French</hi> I could scarce find any thing amongst them of this sort, worth my pains of translating. The <hi>Latine</hi> Authors are so well known, I need say nothing of them. Some of the small <hi>Greek</hi> Poets I have endeavoured to render as close to the sense of the Original as I could: with others I have taken the liberty of paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on them: or being but Fragments, have only taken Hints from them; the like I have done with many of the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Poets. Nor can I deny, but that I have purposely omitted the names of some of the Authors, not acknowledging them
<pb facs="tcp:62747:6"/>
to be Translations: Either because I was not willing my own things should be distinguished from the rest; Or indeed because most of those name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Pieces may more properly be said to be mine, than the Authors, from whom I only took the Hints of them. Now if any accuse me of Injustice for it, I have this to say, that there were but few of the Old <hi>Latine</hi> Poets, to whom it might not be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that they have often assisted themselves, by such Hints, and almost entire Translations from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or Imitations of one another. So did <hi>Terence</hi> from <hi>Menander, Seneca</hi> from <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> is not content to walk in the Footsteps of <hi>Homer,</hi> but also to have followed, and considerably borrowed from <hi>Hesiod, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus, Euripides,</hi> and amongst the Latines, from <hi>Ennius, Pacuvius, Lucretius,</hi> and others, of which I could give many instances. There is a learned Italian, one <hi>Fulvio Ursini,</hi> who composed a Book of the Thefts of <hi>Virgil,</hi> which thô I call Thefts, deserve not the Name, for in that manner which he has used them, they are rather an Honour than a Discredit to him; and 'tis reported <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e himself, when it was alledged to him by some of
<pb facs="tcp:62747:6"/>
his Detractors, that he had stoln his Poem from <hi>Homer,</hi> answered, <hi>Magnarum esse virium, Herculi Clavam extorquere de manu.</hi> Meaning, That as it was a great matter to wrest <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Club out of his hand, and keep it; so was it to take <hi>Homer</hi>'s Verses, and make them his own. This is an Art, which to perform it very well, but few attain to the Skill, and is not only allowed of, but commended by <hi>Horace</hi> in his <hi>Art of Poetry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I should be blamed for thus exposing my self, when so many of our Ingenious Poets have of late published their Works with such general Applause, I hope I may be allowed, without being thought arrogant, to say, as some of those might, with <hi>Theognis,</hi>
