            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFter five years residence at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> in service of the Embassy of the Earl of <hi>Winchilsea</hi> (my ever honoured Lord) and this my second journey from thence by land into my own Country, I judged it a point of my Duty, and of my Religion too, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this following Treatise, as the fruits of my Travels, Negotiations, and leisure in those remote parts, to the Noble Person of your Lordship; as that <hi>Votiva Tabula,</hi> which many both in ancient and in the modern times, after some signal deliverance, or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py arrival at their desired Port, use to offer to their Gods, their Saints, or their Patrons: And truly, my Lord, this Discourse treating chiefly of the Turkish Policy, Government, and Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of State, seems naturally to appertain to the Patronage of your Lordship, whose faculties of Wisdom and Vertue have given you the Blessing of your Princes Favour, and the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as well abroad as at home, of an Eminent and Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Minister of State.</p>
            <p>It were a great Presumption in me to offer any Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my own in the Courts of Christian Princes to the test of your Lordships Experience and Judgment, who not only is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Customs and Manners, but penetrates into the Designs, and knows the Cabinet Councels of Neighbouring Principalities, with whom our divided world may possibly be concerned; but perhaps without disparagement to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships profound Wisdom, or over-value of my own abilities, I may confidently draw a rude Scheme before your Lordship, of the Turkish Government, Policies, and Customs; a Subject which Travellers have rather represented to their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to supply them with discourse and admiration, than as a matter worthythe consideration, or concernment of our Kings or our Governors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55345:3"/>It hath been the happy fortune of the Turk to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted barbarous and ignorant; for upon this perswasion Christian Princes have laid themselves open and unguarded to their greatest danger; contending together for one Palm of land, whilst this puissant Enemy hath made himself master of whole Provinces, and largely shared in the rich and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant possessions of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This contempt of the Turk on one side, caused the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to be so backward in opposing that torrent of the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Force, which in the first year of the late War broke in upon him; and the suspition of designs from <hi>France</hi> on the other, altered the Resolutions and Councels of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for prosecution of the War, which then running favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably on the Christian part, was no less than with the asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the whole world, and of the Turks themselves, on a sudden understood to be clapt up with Articles of a disadvantageous Peace; admiring to see the Emperour give a stop to the current of his Victories, and relinquish the Game with a lucky hand. But this will seem no riddle to those who penetrate Affairs with the same judgment that your Lordship doth, and consider the unfirm condition the House of <hi>Austria</hi> was in, by a daily expectation of the death or fall of so main a Basis of it, as the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the division amongst the Princes of the Empire, the League of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the French practices to make the Duke of <hi>Enguyen</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the extravagant demands of the French and Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish League for Winter quarters, and places of strength, not only in <hi>Hungary,</hi> but also in <hi>Styria</hi> and the adjacent places; and at the same time look on the Factions in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and a considerable Army of French in the bowels of <hi>Germany,</hi> who were supposed in those parts to have rather come with design to over-awe the next Diet, and force the German Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to elect the French King for King of the Romans, than with sincere and simple intentions of opposing themselves to the Enemy of the Faith: for then it will appear, that the best use the Emperor could make of his good success, was moderation in Victory, and reconciliation with his powerful Enemy. And hereupon Earl <hi>Leisle</hi> being dispatched for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Embassador from his Imperial Majesty, to the Grand Signior; though the <hi>Turk</hi> was elevated with the thoughts of the necessity the Christians had of a Peace, did
<pb facs="tcp:55345:3"/>
yet so happily manage his Charge and Employment, as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Turks an extraordinary reverence towards his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and obtained such Honours and Treatments from them, as the Turkish Court never bestowed before on the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, or any other Christian Embassador; extorting this Complement from the great Vizier, That he was more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Emperor had sent so brave and illustrious a person, than if he had sought to reconcile his Affections with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Dollars more of Present. And to do justice to this worthy Person, he hath brought a reputation to the British Nation, above any in our age, whose vertues and industry have acquired the highest Trusts and Preferments in Forreign Parts; and done the same honour to his King, under whom he was born a Subject, as to the present Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and his Ancestors, under whom he is, and hath alwaies been a faithful Minister: having deserved so eminently for saving the whole German Empire from the Treason of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestein,</hi> by his own single act of bravery (a story notoriously known to all the world) as can never in gratitude be forgot by that Nation, nor want its due Record and place in the History of that Country.</p>
            <p>The speculation of what is contained in this following Discourse may seem unworthy of your Lordships precious hours, in regard of that notion of Barbarity with which this Empire is stiled; yet the knowledge hereof will be like a <hi>Turquoise,</hi> or some other Jewel set within the Rose of those many Gems of your Lordships Wisdom and Vertues.</p>
            <p>This Present, which I thus humbly consecrate to your Lordship, may be termed barbarous, as all things are, which are differenced from us by diversity of Manners and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, and are not dressed in <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e mode and fashion of our times and Countries; for we contract prejudice from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and want of familiarity. But your Lordship, who exactly ponderates the weight of humane Actions, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges reason in all its habits, and draws not the measures of Oeconomy or Policy from external appearances or effects, but from the fundamental and original Constitutions; so that your Lordship will conclude, that a People, as the Turks are, men of the same composition with us, cannot be so savage and rude as they are generally described; for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and grossness is the effect of Poverty, not incident to
<pb facs="tcp:55345:4"/>
happy men, whose spirits are elevated with Spoils and Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of so many Nations.</p>
            <p>Knowing (My Lord) that this work which I have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is liable to common censure, I have chosen to shrowd my name under the patronage of your Lordship, to protect me from the ill-understanding and mis-conceptions of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, both at home and abroad: against which I doubt not but to be sufficiently armed in all parts where I travel, when the countenance your Lordship affords me, is joined to the authority of his Excellency the Earl of <hi>Winchilsea,</hi> his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Embassador Extraordinary, now actually resident at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> my ever honoured Lord; to whom I read, a long time before publish'd to the World, the greatest part of this following Treatise; and as I received his favourable approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and assent to the verity of most matters herein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; so I must ingenuously confess to have been beholding to that quick and refined Genius of his, who often rectified my mistakes, supplyed me with matter, and remembred me of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny material points, which I might otherwise have most unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly omitted: And his Excellency knowing that in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence this Book might want a favourable Patron, left me to my self to seek out one, who might concur with him in the same innocent defence. And as (My Lord) you are a publick person, and under our Gracious Sovereign, are one of those generous spirits which have espoused the common interest of the Nation; so I presume on this present occasion not to want your protection also in a single capacity: for which excess of favours I shall ever pray for the exaltation of the greater glory of your Lordship, and for ever acknowledge my self,</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Present thee here with a true Systeme or Model of theTurkish Government and Religion; not in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as certain ingenious Travellers have done, who have set down their Observations as they have obvionsly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in their Journeys; which being collected for the most part from Relations, and Discourses of such who casually intervene in company of Passengers, are consequently subject to many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and mistakes: But having been an Inhabitant my self at the Imperial City for the space of five years, and assisted by the advantage of considerable Journeys I have made through divers parts of <hi>Turky,</hi> and qualified by the Office I hold of Secretary to the Earl of <hi>Winchilsea</hi> Lord Embassador, I had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by the constant access and practice with the Chief Ministers of State, and variety of Negotiations which passed through my hands in the Turkish Court, to penetrate farther into the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this Politie, which appear so strange and barbarous to us, than hasty Travellers could do, who are forced to content themselves with a superficial knowledge.</p>
            <p>The Computations I have made of the value of their Offices, of the strength and number of their Souldiery, according as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry City and Country is rated, are deduced from their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters and Records. The Observations I have made of their Politie, are either Maxims received from the Mouth and Argument of confiderable Ministers, or Conclusions arising from my own Experience and Considerations. The Articles of their Faith and Constitutions of Religion, I have set down as pronounced from the mouth of some of the most learned Doctors and Preachers of their Law, with whom for Money or Presents
<pb facs="tcp:55345:5"/>
I gained a familiarity and appearance of friendship. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and Education of their Youth, with divers other matters of Custom and Rule, were transmitted to me by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sober Persons, trained up with the best Education of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Learning; and particularly, by an understanding <hi>Polonian,</hi> who had spent nineteen years in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court.</p>
            <p>If (Reader) the superstition, vanity, and ill foundation of the Mahometan Religion seem fabulous, as a Dream, or the fancies of a distracted and wild Brain, thank God that thou wert born a Christian, and within the Pale of an Holy and an Orthodox Church. If the Tyranny, Oppression, and Cruelty of that State, wherein Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son stands in no competition with the pride and lust of an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Minister, seem strange to thy Liberty and Happiness, thank God that thou art born in a Country the most free and just in all the World; and a Subject to the most indulgent, the most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of all the Princes of the Universe; That thy Wife, thy Children, and the fruits of thy labour can be called thine own, and protected by the valiant Arm of thy fortunate King: And thus learn to know and prize thy own Freedom, by comparison with Forreign Servitude, that thou mayst ever bless God and thy King, and make thy Happiness breed thy Content, without degenerating into wantonness, or desire of revolution.</p>

               <p>I Have begun a Work which seems very full of difficulty and labour; for to trace the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of <hi>Government</hi> in the best formed and moulded <hi>Common-wealths</hi> (such as are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with <hi>Reason</hi> and with <hi>Religion</hi>) is no less then to unriddle and resolve a Mystery. For as a Common-wealth, by many Authors,<note place="margin">O navis refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But there must be yet certain Rules in every Government, which are the foundations and pillars of it; not subject to the alteration of time, or any other accident; and so essential to it, that they admit of no change, untill the whole model of Politie suffer a Convulsion, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55345:8"/>
be shaken into some other form; which is either effected by the new laws of a Conqueror, or by intestine and civil revolutions. Of such Maxims as these, (obvious to all who have had any practice in the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Court</hi>) I have made a collection, subjoining to every head some reflections and considerations of my own, which at my leisure hours I have weighed and examined, bringing them (according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of my weak judgement and ability) to the measure and test of reason and virtue; as also to a similitude, and congruity with the Maxims of other Empires, to which God hath given the largest extent of Dominion.</p>
               <p>But indeed when I have considered seriously the contexture of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Government, the absoluteness of an Emperour without reason, without virtue, whose speeches may be irrational, and yet must be laws; whose actions irregular, and yet examples; whose sentence and judgement, if in matters of the Imperial concernment, are most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupt, and yet decrees irresistible: When I consider what little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards there are for vertue, and no punishment for profitable and thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vice; how men are raised at once by adulation, chance, and the sole favour of the Prince, without any title of noble blood, or the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of previous deserts, or former testimonies and experience of parts or abilities, to the weightiest, the richest, and most honourable charges of the Empire; when I consider how short their continuance is in them, how with one frown of their Prince they are cut off; with what greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness above all people in the world, they thirst and haste to be rich, and yet know their treasure is but their snare; what they labour for is but as slaves for their great Patron and Master, and what will inevitably effect their ruine and destruction, though they have all the arguments of faithfulness, virtue, and moral honesty (which are rare in a <hi>Turk</hi>) to be their advocates, and plead for them. When I consider many other things of like nature, (which may more at large hereafter be discoursed of) one might admire the long continuance of this great and vast Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and attribute the stability thereof without change within its self, and the increase of Dominions and constant progress of its arms, rather to some super-natural cause, then to the ordinary Maximes of State, or wisdom of the Governours, as if the Divine will of the all-knowing Creator, had chosen for the good of his Church, and chastisement of the sins and vices of Christians, to raise and support this potent people. <hi>Mihi quanto plura  recentium seu veterum revolvo, tanto magis ludibria re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacit. l. 3. An.</note> 
                  <hi>mortalium cunctis in negotiis observantur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which cements all breaches, and cures all those wounds in this body politick, is the quickness and severity of their justice, which not considering much the strict division and parts of <hi>distributive</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative,</hi> makes almost every crime equal, and punishes it with the last and extreamest chastisement, which is death; I mean those which have relation to the Government, and are of common and publick inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest. Without this remedy, which I lay down as a principal preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the greatest disorders, this mighty body would burst with the poyson of its own ill humors, and soon divide it self into several Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as the ambition and power of the Governours most remote from the Imperial Seat adminstred them hopes and security of becoming ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:55345:8"/>In this Government, severity, violence, and cruelty are natural to it; and it were as great an errour to begin to loose the reins, and ease the people of that oppression to which they and their fore-fathers have since their first original been accustomed, as it would be in a nation free-born, and used to live under the protection of good laws, and the clemency of a virtuous and Christian Prince, to exercise a Tyrannical power over their estates and lives, and change their liberty into servitude and sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. The <hi>Turks</hi> had the original of their Civil Government founded in the time of war: for when they first came out of <hi>Scythia,</hi> and took arms in their hands, and submitted unto one General, it is to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that they had no Laws but what were Arbitrary and Martial, and most agreeable to the enterprise and design they had then in hand, when <hi>Tangrolipix</hi> overthrew the <hi>Persian Sultan;</hi> possessed himself of his Dominions and Power, and called and opened the way for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions out of <hi>Armenia;</hi> when <hi>Cutlumuses</hi> revolted from him, and made a distinct kingdom in <hi>Arabia:</hi> when other Princes of the <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuccian</hi> family in the infancy of the Turkish power had by wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, or by Testament made division of their possessions; when (<hi>Anno</hi> 1300) <hi>Ottoman,</hi> by strange fortunes, and from small be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings swallowed up all the other Governments into the <hi>Ogusian</hi> Tribe, and united them under one head, untill at last it arrived to that greatness and power it now enjoys.

                  </note> this people was but a continued state of war; wherefore it is not strange, if their laws are severe, and in most things arbitrary; that the Emperor should be absolute and above law, and that most of their customs should run in a certain channel and course most answerable to the height and unlimited power of the Governour, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the oppression and subjection of the people: and that they should thrive most by servitude, be most happy, prosperous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented under Tyranny, is as natural to them, as to a body to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished with that diet, which it had from its infancy or birth been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. But not only is Tyranny requisite for this people, and a stiff rein to curb them, lest by an unknown liberty they grow mutinous and unruly, but likewise the large territories and remote parts of the Empire require speedy preventions, without processes of law, or formal indictment: jealousie and suspition of mis-government being license and authority enough for the Emperour to inflict his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest punishments: all which depends upon the absoluteness of the Prince; which because it is that whereby the <hi>Turks</hi> are principally supported in their greatness, and is the prime Maxim and Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their State, we shall make it the discourse and subject of the following Chapter.</p>

Grand Signior, in his sole disposal and gift they remain, whose posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and right they are; only to lands dedicated to religious uses, the Grand Signior disclaims all right or claim; and this he so piously observes (to the shame of our Sectaries in <hi>England,</hi> who violate the <hi>penetralia</hi> of the Sanctuary) that when a Bashaw, though afterwards convicted of Treason, bestows any lands or rents on any certain Mosch or Temple, that grant or gift is good and exempted from any disposal or power of the Grand Signior. The lands being thus originally in the Grand Signior, after the Conquests were made, and the Country se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and in condition to be distributed, divisions were made of the houses, mannors, and farms among the Soldiery, whom they call <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars,</hi> as the reward and recompence of their valour and labour; in consideration of which, every one proportionably to his revenue and possession, is obliged to maintain horse and men to be always ready when the Grand Signior shall call him forth to serve him in the wars; by which means the whole Country being in the hand of the Souldiery, all places are the better strengthned, and the conquered people more easily kept from Mutiny and Rebellion; not much unlike our tenure of Knights-service in <hi>England,</hi> and lands held of the Crown, but with this difference, that we enjoy them by the title of a fixed and setled Law, never to be forfeited but upon Treason and Rebellion; they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them also by inheritance derived from the Father to the Son, but yet as usufructuary during the pleasure of the Emperour, in whom the propriety is always reserved, and who doth often as his humour and fancy leads him to please and gratifie a stranger, dispossess an ancient possessor, whose family hath for many generations enjoyed that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. Sometimes I have heard with the sighes of some, and the curse of others, how the Grand Signior heated in his hunting, and pleased with the refreshment of a little cool and chrystal water, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him by a poor Paisant; hath in recompence thereof freed the Tenant from the rent of his Landlord, and by his sole word confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him the Cottage he lived in, the Woods, Gardens and Fields he manured, with as sound a title, as our long deeds and conveyances secure our purchases and inheritances in <hi>England;</hi> and this the former Master dares not name injustice, because this Tenant is now made proprietor by the will of the Grand Signior, which was the same title and claim with his; preseription, tenant-right, and custom availing nothing in this case. For if the inheritance hath been anciently deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Father to Son; the more is the goodness and bounty of the Emperour to be acknowledged, that hath permitted so long a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his favours to run in one family, in whose power it was to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to others.</p>
               <p>The absolute and unlimited power of this Prince is more evident by the titles they give him, as <hi>God on earth, the shadow of God, Brother to the Sun and Moon, the giver of all earthly Crowns, &amp;c.</hi> And though they do not build and erect Altars to him, as was done to the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, when that people degenerated into a fashion of deformed adulation, wherein <hi>Italy</hi> is at present corrupted; yet the conception they have of his power, the Ray they conceive to be in him of divine illumination, is a kind of imagery, and idolatrous fancy they frame of his divinity. It is an ordinary saying among the <hi>Turkish Cadees</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55345:10"/>
Lawyers, That <hi>the Grand Signior is above the Law;</hi> that is, whatsoever law is written, is controllable, and may be contradicted by him: his mouth is the law it self, and the power of an infallible interpretation is in him; and though the <hi>Mufti</hi> is many times, for custome, formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and satisfaction of the people consulted with, yet when his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences have not been agreeable to the designs intended, I have known him in an instant thrown from his office to make room for another oracle better prepared for the purpose of his Master. Some maintain that the very oaths and promises of the Grand Signior are always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable, when the performance of his vow is a restriction to the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power of the Empire. And I remember when my Lord Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor hath sometimes complained of the breach of our capitulations, and pleaded that the Grand Signior had no power by simple commands to infringe articles of peace, to which he had obliged himself by so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn oaths and vows; the Interpreters have very gently touched that point, and been as nice to question how far the power of the Grand Signior extended, as we ought to be in the subtile points of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Omnipotence, but rather in contemplation of the Grand Signiors justice, wisdom, faith, and clemency, insinuated arguments of honour, convenience, and justice in maintaining the league inviolate with the King of <hi>England.</hi> It was <hi>Justinians</hi> rule concerning the Prerogative of Princes, <hi>Etsi legibus soluti sumus, tamen legibus vivimus.</hi> That is, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Majesty of Princes, and the necessity of having a supream head in all governments, did free and priviledge them from all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and exempt them from the censure and correction of law, that no earthly power could call them to account for their errours or disorders in this world; yet it is necessary to the Being of an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarch, to be a severe executioner of the Laws of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and it is more his interest and security, then to act without rule, and always to make use of the power of absolute dominion, which is to be applied like Physick, when the ordinary force of nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remove the malignancy of some peccant humours. The Grand Signior himself is also restrained by laws, but without impeachment to his absolute jurisdiction. For when there is a new Emperour, it is the custom to conduct him with great pomp and triumph to a place in the Suburbs of <hi>Constantinople</hi> called <hi>Job,</hi> where is an ancient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of some certain Prophet, or Holy man, whom the <hi>Turks</hi> for want of knowledge in Antiquity and History, stile that <hi>Job,</hi> who was recorded for the mirrour of constancy and patience. For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all History in Chronology, saying that <hi>Job</hi> was <hi>Solomons</hi> judge of the Court, and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, Captain of his army. At this place Solemn Prayers are made, that God would prosper and infuse wisdom into him, who is to manage so great a charge. Then the <hi>Mufti</hi> embracing him, bestows his benediction, and the Grand Signior swears and promises solemnly to maintain the Musleman Faith, and laws of the Prophet <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and then the Visiers of the Bench, and other Bashaws, with profound reverence and humility, kissing the ground first, and then the hemme of his vest, acknowledge him their lawful and undoubted Emperour: and after this form of inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, he returns with the like solemnity and magnificence to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> (which is always the seat of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperours.) And thus
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55345:10"/>
the Gr. Sig. retains, and obliges himself to govern within the compass of Laws, but they give him so large a latitude, that he can no more be said to be bound or limited, than a man who hath the world to rove in can be termed a prisoner, because he cannot exceed the Inclosure of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. For though he be obliged to the execution of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law, yet that Law calls the Emperour the Mouth and Interpreter of it, and endues him with power to alter and annul the most setled and fixed Rules, at least to wave and dispense with them when they are an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle to his Government, and contradict (as we said before) any great design of the Empire. But the lea<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed Doctors among the <hi>Turks</hi> more clearly restrain the Imperial power only to the observation of that which is Religious in the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law, saying, That in matters which are Civil his Law is Arbitrary, and needs no other Judge or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislator than his own will. Hence it is that they say, the Grand Signior can never be deposed or made accountable to any for his crimes, whilst he destroys causelesly of his Subjects under the number of 1000 a day; and in like manner hence it is, that though the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law determines the testimony of two Witnesses of that Faith to be valid for the determination of all cases of difference; yet by our Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it is provided, that no <hi>Turkish</hi> Witnesses of what number or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity soever can avail against any of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, by reason that the case being Civil is dispensable by the Imperial power; but I doubt, were any matter in question Criminal, (as we have never, God be praised, had occasion to put it to trial) the Capitulations would be forced to yield to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law, as being Religious and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, with which the Sultan hath no power to dispense. Of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence and benefit this absolute power hath been to the <hi>Turks,</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the extent of their Empire and success of their Arms. For if the Sultan pleases the Souldiery, no matter how the people in this constitution is contented; and this was the conclusion of <hi>Machiavel</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Government, in the 19. Chapter of his Book <hi>del Prencipe.</hi> And it must needs be a great advantage to a Commander, when the <hi>Utile</hi> and <hi>Justum</hi> are reconciled and made the same, and that he meets no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction or opposition at home, which may retard or cross the great designs abroad. The Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> had doubtless sooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred the <hi>Turks,</hi> and given a stop to his free entrance the first year of the late War into <hi>Hungary,</hi> had he been absolute of the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and not necessitated to expect the consent of his several Princes, and the result of a Diet, when the <hi>Turks</hi> were even ready to enter <hi>Germany.</hi> For when many heads or hands are required, all business moves slowly, and more time is spent in agreement of the manner of action, in arguments and debates, (which are most commonly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by faction) than in the most difficult point of execution. It would seem a great clog to the Grand Signior to be obliged to depend on the bounty of his Subjects when he would make a War, or on the judgment of a Lawyer that should contradict and censure the actions of his Prince as irregular, and exceeding the priviledges of his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. It is very difficult to understand how it is possible with these fetters for any Country or City ever to arrive to that height, as to be termed the Mistress of a great Empire, or a Prince be said to have a long arm, or embrace a large compass of the Globe, who is pinioned
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55345:11"/>
with the bands of his own Laws. But I confess it is a blessing and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful happiness of a people, to be Subjects of a gracious Prince, who hath prescribed his power within the compass of wholesom Laws, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd a right of possession and propriety of Estate as well in his Subjects as himself, who doth not punish the innocent with the guilty, nor oppress without distinction, nor act the part of that King whom God gives in his wrath. But then they must content themselves with their own borders, or some neighbouring conquest, and this is better, and a greater glory and content, than the honour of being Slaves to the lust of a Monarch, whose Titles c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Lesson of Obedience to their Emperour is taught by the <hi>Turks,</hi> as a Principle of Religion rather than of State.</head>
               <p>THE absolute power in the Prince implies an exact obedience in the Subjects; and to instill and confirm that Principle no art or indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry is wanting, in the education of those who are placed in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> with design of preferment to Offices and great Charges; so that even the Oath of Obedience which Friers and other Religious men vow to their Superiors at their first initiation into Ecclesiastical Orders, is not more exactly or devoutly observed or professed by them, than this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of submission to the will of their great master is carefully taught to his young Scholars, who stand Probationers and Candidates for all the Governments of the Empire. To die by the hand or command of the Grand Signior, when the blow is submitted to, with entire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, is taught to be the highest point of Martyrdom; and whose good fortune it is so to suffer is immediately transported to Paradise. <hi>Kara Mustapha Passaw</hi> (a great Visier) after he had been so successeful in all matters of his charge, and proved so excellent an Instrument of victories and services to his Master, that he was applauded by all to be a most happy and fortunate Minister, was so sensible of his own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the favour of his Prince, that he confessed he was now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the greatest glory and perfection he could in this life aspire to, and only wanted the holy Martyrdom, to die by the order and sentence of the Grand Signior as the reward of his faithfulness, and the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all his Honours.</p>
               <p>Such as receive any wages or pay coming from the Exchequer, or any Office depending on the Crown, have the title of <hi>Kul,</hi> which is, the Grand Signiors <hi>Slave:</hi> such is the great Visier and all the Pashaws of the Empire, and it is more honourable than the condition and name of <hi>Subject;</hi> for they have a privilege over these, and can revile, beat and abuse them with authority; but the <hi>Subject</hi> cannot offer the least injury to the <hi>Slave</hi> without danger of severe punishment. <hi>Slavery</hi> among the <hi>Turks</hi> denotes a condition of entire resignation to the will and command of the Emperour, to perform whatsoever he signifies; or if possible, what he conceives: though he command whole Armies of them to precipitate themselves from a Rock, or build a Bridge with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55345:11"/>
piles of their bodies for him to pass Rivers, or to kill one another to afford him pastime and pleasure. They that have been where they have seen and known the manner of this blind obedience, may well cry out, <hi>O homines ad servitutem paratos!</hi> And doubtless the flattery used in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> towards the Prince by those that are near his person, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to this condition of slavery they profess, and cannot but fancy a strange kind of projected baseness in all the deportment within the Walls of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> when there appears so much condescension abroad to all the lusts and evil inclinations of their Master; so that a<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Qui liberta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem publicam noollet, cum profota servin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium patintiae tedebat.</hi> Tac.</note> generous Prince (as some have been found among the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours) though he desired not the publick liberty, would yet be weary of this slavish compliance, and seek other counsel and means to inform himself of the true state of his own and other Kings Dominions, then such as proceed from men unexperienced in any other Court or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try then that they live in. This flattery and immoderate subjection hath doubtless been the cause of the decay of the <hi>Turkish</hi> discipline in the time of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> when Women governed, and now in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age of Sultan <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whose counsels are given chiefly by his Mother, <hi>Negroes,</hi> Eunuchs, and some handsome young Mosayp or Favourite; seldom any from without being permitted, or have their spirits emboldened to declare a truth, or are called to give their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel in matters of greatest importance. So that this obedience which brave and wise Emperours have made use of in the advancement of noble exploits, and enlargement of their Empire, is with effeminate Princes (delighted with flattery) the snare of their own greatness, and occasion of weak counsels and means in the management of great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs. If a man seriously consider the whole com psition of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Court, he will find it to be a Prison and Banniard of Slaves, differing from that where the Galley-slaves are immured, only by the ornaments and glittering outside and appearances: here their chains are made of Iron, and there of gold, and the difference is only in a painted shining servitude, from that which is a squalid, sordid, and a noisome slavery. For the youths educated in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> (which we shall have occasion to discourse of in the next Chapter) are kept as it were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a prison, under a strange severity of discipline, some for 20, 30, others 40. years, others the whole time of the age of man, and grow gray under the correction of their <hi>Hogiaes</hi> or Tutors. The two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of this present Grand Signior, are also imprisoned here, restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a faithful and careful guard, and perhaps are sometimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted out of grace and favour into the presence of their Brother, to kiss His Vest, and to perform the offices of duty and humility before their Prince. The Ladys also of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> have their faithful keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the black guard to attend them, and can only have the liberty of enjoying the air which passes through grates and lattices, unlesse sometime they obtain license to sport and recreate themselves in the Garden, separated from the sight of men by walls higher then those of any Nunnery.</p>
               <p>Nay, if a man considers the contexture of the whole <hi>Turkish</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he will find it such a Fabrick of slavery, that it is a wonder if any amongst them should be born of a free ingenuous spirit. The Grand Signior is born of a slave, the Mother of the present being a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55345:12"/>
                  <hi>Circhasian,</hi> taken perhaps by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> in their incursions into that Country. The Visiers themselves are not always free born by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother; for the <hi>Turks</hi> get more children by their slaves then by their wives, and the continual supply of slaves sent in by the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> taken from different Nations, by way of the black sea, (as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after we shall have occasion to speak more fully) fills <hi>Constantinople</hi> with such a strange race, mixture, and medly of different sorts of blood, that it is hard to find many that can derive a clear line from ingenious Parents: So that it is no wonder that amongst the <hi>Turks</hi> a disposition be found fitted and disposed for servitude, and that is better governed with a severe and tyrannous hand, then with sweetness and lenity, unknown to them and their fore-fathers: as <hi>Grotius</hi> takes this Maxime out of <hi>Aristotle, Quosdam homines naturâ esse servos;</hi> i. e. <hi>ad servitutem aptos; &amp; ita populi quidem, eo sunt ingenio ut regi quam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere norint rectius.</hi> But since it appears that submission and subjection are so incident to the nature of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and obedience taught, and so carefully instilled into them with their first Rudiments; it may be a pertinent question, how it comes to pass, that there are so many mutinies and rebellions as are seen and known amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> and those commonly the most insolent, violent, and desperate that we read of in story. To let pass the mutinies of former times in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Camp, and the usual, though short rebellions of ancient days: I shall instance in the causes and beginnings of two notorious disturbances, or rather madnesses of the Souldiery not mentioned in any History, which being passages of our age, deserve greatly to be recorded.</p>
               <p>This obedience then that is so diligently taught and instilled into the Turkish Militia (as to the <hi>Spahees</hi> in their <hi>Seraglios,</hi> or <hi>Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Spahees</hi> the Turkish horse.</note> the <hi>Janizaries</hi> in their chambers) sometimes is forgot when the passions and animosities of the Court (by which inferiour affections are most commonly regulated) corrupt that Discipline, which its reason and sobriety instituted. For the affections of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are indued with a general influence, when two powerful parties aspiring both to greatness and authority, allure the Souldiers to their respective factions, and engage them in a civil war amongst themselves; and hence proceed seditions, destruction of Empires, the overthrow of Common-wealths, and the violent death of great Ministers of State.</p>
               <p>And so it hapned when ill government and unprosperous successes of war, caused disobedience in the Souldiery, which some emulous of the greatness of those that were in power, nourished and raised to make place for themselves or their party. For in the time of <hi>Sultan Mahomet,</hi> the present Grand Signior, when the whole government of the Empire rested in the hands of one <hi>Mulki Kadin,</hi> a young auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious woman, by the extraordinary favour and love of the Queen Mother (who, as it was divulged, exercised an unnatural kind of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality with the said Queen) so that nothing was left to the counsel and order of the Visier and grave Seniors, but was first to receive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and authority from her; the black <hi>Eunuchs</hi> and <hi>Negroes</hi> gave laws to all, and the cabinet councels were held in the secret appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the women; and there were proscriptions made, Officers discharged, or ordained as were most proper to advance the interest
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55345:12"/>
of this Feminine Government. But at length, the souldiery (not used to the tyranny of women) no longer supporting this kind of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, in a moment resolved on a remedy, and in great tumults came to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where commanding the Grand Signior himself to the <hi>Kiosch,</hi> or banquetting-house, demanded without further prologue the heads of the favourite <hi>Eunuchs;</hi> there was no argument or Rhetorick to be opposed to this unreasonable multitude, nor time given for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, or consultation; but every one of the accused, as he was entred into the souldiers roll or catalogue, and required, being first strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, was afterwards thrown head-long from the wall of the Garden, and committed to the farther satisfaction of their enemies revenge, by whom from thence they were dragged to the <hi>Hyppodromo,</hi> and before the new <hi>Mosque</hi> cut into small pieces, and their flesh roasted and eaten by them. The day following, they apprehended <hi>Mulki,</hi> and her husband <hi>Schaban Kalfa,</hi> both whom they put to death; nor ended this tumult here, until by means of dissention between the <hi>Spahees</hi> and <hi>Janizaries,</hi> the principal Ministers found means and opportunity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose their power; and having executed several of the <hi>Spahees,</hi> and performed other exemplary parts of Justice, reduced matters to some kind of quietness and composure; and thus order results often from confusion, and tumults in corrupted Commonwealths have operated good effects to the redress of several evils. But besides this insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or mutiny of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> have succeeded divers other; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there hath been no disorder amongst them so notorious and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable, as that which occasioned the death of <hi>Kiosem,</hi> Grand-mother to the present <hi>Sultan,</hi> we have thought fit to record the certain particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of it to all posterity.</p>

               <p>AFter the murder of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> by conspiracy of the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Sultan Mahomet</hi> (eldest son of the late deceased Emperour, a child of nine years old) succeeded in the throne of his father; and the tuition of him, and administration of the Government (during his minority) was committed to the old Queen, the Grand-mother, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Kiosem;</hi> a Lady, who through her long experience, and practice in affairs, was able, and proper for so considerable an office; and so the young <hi>Sultan</hi> was conducted to the <hi>Mosch</hi> of <hi>Eiub,</hi> where with the accustomed Ceremonies, his sword was girt to his side, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Emperour through all the Kingdoms and Provinces of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
               <p>For some time this old Queen governed all things according to her pleasure, until the Mother of this young <hi>Sultan</hi> (as yet trembling with the thoughts of the horrid death of her Lord; and fearing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55345:13"/>
lest the subtle and old Polititian the Grandmother (who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed the death of her husband) should likewise contrive the Murder of her Son, grew hourly more jealous of his life and safety; which su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition of hers was augmented by the knowledge she had of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and haughty spirit of the Grand-mother, and the private trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and secret correspondence she held with the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> which compelled her to a resolution of making a faction likewise with the <hi>Spahees,</hi> and <hi>Pashaws,</hi> and <hi>Beyes,</hi> who had received their Education in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> being a party alwaies opposite to the <hi>Janizaries.</hi> These she Courted by Letters, and Messages, complaining of the death and Murder of the <hi>Sultan</hi> her Husband, the Pride and Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the <hi>Janizaries;</hi> and small esteem was had of her Son, their undoubted Prince; adding, that if they provided not for their own safety, the Old Queen would abolish both the name and order of <hi>Spahees.</hi> The <hi>Asiatick Spahees</hi> awakened hereat, with a considerable Army marched to <hi>Scutari</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Gurgi Nebi,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the heads of those who had been the traytors and conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors against the sacred Life of their late Soveraign; all which were then under the protection of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and supported by the powerful Authority of the Queen Regent. Upon this Alarum, the Grand Visier, (called <hi>Morat Pashaw</hi>) who had had his Education amongst the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries,</hi> being adored by them as an Oracle, and engaged with them in the late Treason against the <hi>Sultan,</hi> speedily passed over from <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> to <hi>Scutari,</hi> with an Army of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and others of his favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and followers, transporting likewise Artillery and all necessaries for entrenchment; some skirmishes passed between the Van-guard of the <hi>Spahees</hi> and the <hi>Deli</hi> (which are the Visiers Guard) and thereby had engaged both the Armies; but that the two Chief Justices of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> interposing with their grave and religious countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, preached to them of the danger and impiety there was in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of <hi>Musselmins</hi> or believers bloud; and that, had they any just pretences, their plea should be heard, and all differences decided by the Law. These, and such like perswasions made impression on <hi>Gurgi Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi</hi> and other <hi>Spahees;</hi> and the posture they found their Adversaries in, to give them battel, made them inclinable to hearken to proposals for accomodation; but especially their courages were abated by what the Justices had declared, that in case they repaired not to their own homes, the Visier was resolved to burn all the Rolls, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a general <hi>Nesiraum</hi> through the whole Empire: (which is an Edict of the King and <hi>Mufti,</hi> commanding all the <hi>Turks</hi> of his Kingdoms from seven years old and upward to arm and follow him to the war.)</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spahees</hi> hereupon dispersed themselves; and from their retreat encreased the Pride of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> faction, and of their chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, <hi>viz. Bectas Aga,</hi> highly favoured by the Queen Regent; <hi>Kul Kiahia</hi> Lieutenant of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and <hi>Kara Chiaus</hi> a follower of <hi>Bectas,</hi> who now esteemed themselves absolute Masters of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. These three now governed all matters, contriving in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Councils the destruction of the <hi>Spahees;</hi> especially those famed for riches and valour; and as one of the first rank, gave order to the <hi>Pasha</hi> of <hi>Anatolia</hi> to take away the life of <hi>Gurgi Nebi,</hi> whom accordingly he one day assaulted in his quarters, and being abandoned by his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55345:13"/>
Souldiers shot him with a Pistol, and sent his head to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Spahees</hi> exasperated hereat, entred into private Councils and Conspiracies in <hi>Anatolia</hi> against the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> drawing to their party several <hi>Beyes</hi> and <hi>Pashaws</hi> of <hi>Asia</hi> (and particularly one <hi>Ipsir</hi> a <hi>Circasian</hi> born, but educated in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> a Person of a couragious spirit, and powerful in men and treasure) assaulted many quarters of the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> and cutting off their arms and noses, miserably slaughtered as many as fell into their hands.</p>
               <p>On the other party <hi>Bectas Aga,</hi> secure in his condition, amassed wealth with both hands by new impositions, rapine, and other arts; causing to be coined at <hi>Belgrade</hi> 300 thousand Aspers, one third silver, and two of tinne; these Aspers he dispersed amongst the Tradesmen and <hi>Artisans,</hi> forcing others to exchange his false metal for Gold, at the value of 160 Aspers for the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Ducat. The people sensible of the cheat, begun a mutiny in the quarter of the <hi>Sadlers</hi> at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> which encreased so fast, that the whole City was immediately in a general uproar: this tumult was violently carried to the place of the <hi>Mufti,</hi> whom they forced with the <hi>Seigh</hi> (who is the Grand Signiors Preacher) and the <hi>Nakib Esref,</hi> or Primate of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Race, to accompany them to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where at the inward gate of the Royal Lodgings, with clamours and out-cries they made their complaint. In this danger the Grand Signior was advised by the <hi>Capi Agasi,</hi> and <hi>Solyman Aga,</hi> the <hi>Kuzlir Aga</hi> or chief Eunuch of the Women, that this happy conjuncture was to be embraced for the destruction of <hi>Bectas</hi> and his complices; but fear, and too much caution hindered that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign for the present; only it was judged fit, for satisfaction of the multitude, that <hi>Metek Ahmet Pashaw</hi> (then Prime Visier, and yet a slave to the lusts of the <hi>Janizaries</hi>) should be deprived his office; which was immediately effected; and the Seal taken from him was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to <hi>Siaus Pashaw,</hi> a Stout and Valiant person. This Visier being jealous of his own honour, and jealous for the safety of the Empire, cast about all ways to suppress the arrogance of <hi>Bectas</hi> and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents; lest the like shame, and misfortune should befall him, as did to <hi>Murad Pasha</hi> one of his late Predecessors in the Office of Visier, who for dissenting from <hi>Bectas</hi> in opinion, had lost his life, had he not escaped his fury by flying into <hi>Greece.</hi> The times were also trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and full of danger; the <hi>Janizaries</hi> kept guard in the streets, not suffering so much as two Citizens to walk together, for prevention of secret consultations; many <hi>Artisans,</hi> or handy-crafts-men were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned, as principal in the late tumult, against the consent and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the new Visier; the Court was also divided; The <hi>Sultans</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty contrived to surprize and kill the rebellious Commanders of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and that the day following, the Lieutenant of the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagees,</hi> or Hatchet-men, should encounter <hi>Kul-chiachia</hi> as he came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to custom to the <hi>Divan,</hi> and slay him; but the Old Queen being of a contrary faction, with threats and menaces frighted that Officer from his design. The two Queens were exasperated highly against each other; one to maintain the Authority of her Son, and the other her own; in the City the confusion grew greater; the <hi>Janizaries</hi> were not pleased with the election of <hi>Siaus Passa,</hi> knowing him to be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55345:14"/>
averse to their faction; but yet considering the state of the times, they endeavoured with fair promises to allure him to their party. The Old Queen by Letters advised <hi>Bectos</hi> of all matters that were discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> intimating that the Young Queen was Author of all these disturbances, and that therefore as a remedy of all these evils, it was necessary, that <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> should be deposed, and his younger Brother <hi>Solyman</hi> placed in his stead, who having a Mother, would be absolutely subject to her tuition: she added likewise that <hi>Solyman</hi> was a lusty youth, corpulent and Majestical, whereas <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> was lean, weakly, and unable for the Crown. <hi>Bectas</hi> having received this message from the Queen Regent, assembled a Council at <hi>Orta-giami,</hi> (that is the <hi>Janizaries Moseh</hi>) where was great and solemn appearance both of the Souldiery and Lawyers, (which latter are of the spiritual function among them) some out of friendship to their party, and others for fear of their power; only the Visier was wanting, whom they sent to invite, out of an opinion that he might be drawn to their side, and in case they found him opposite, then not to suffer him to escape alive from their Councils. It was then two hours in the night, when this message came to the Visier; and though it was against the state, and gravity of a Visier to go to any, but his Master; yet he thought it now time to dissemble, and overcome the greatness of his mind; and so with a private retinue went to the <hi>Mosch,</hi> where the first he encountred was a Guard of ten thousand <hi>Janizaries</hi> armed with their Muskets and Matches lighted, which at first so dismayed him that he had some thoughts of returning; but afterward recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself, and taking courage, resolved to proceed; and coming to the <hi>Mosch, Bectas</hi> vouchsafed not to meet him, but sent another to perform that Ceremony; at which neglect though the greatness of his spirit could scarce contain it self; yet suppressing his choler, addressed himself to the feet of <hi>Bectas,</hi> who scarce arising gave him a faint well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com; and setting him on his left hand, (which is the upper hand with the <hi>Turkish</hi> Souldiery) began to propound to him his new designs, and first that it was necessary, that the present King should be deposed, and <hi>Solyman</hi> Crowned in his place; that the Canons of the Imperial <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi> should be reformed; and that whereas the Children of divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were yearly collected for the service of the Grand Signior, none should for the future have admission there, but the Sons of <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:</hi> The Visier consented to all that was proposed, professing a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere affection and reality to them, and their party, swearing upon the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> with the most horrid imprecations on himself, and his family, if he were not faithful to them and their designs; which gave <hi>Bectas</hi> that satisfaction that he began to perswade himself, that the Visier was really a confiding person, and one affectionate to their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; and so partly from this consideration, and partly out of a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his own strength, and inability of the Visier to hurt him, fairly took his leave of him, and so dismissed his <hi>Kalaba Divan,</hi> or his confused Council. But the <hi>Chiachia Bei</hi> (or Lieutenant General of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and <hi>Kara-Chians</hi> reproved very much <hi>Bectas</hi> for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Visier to escape with his life, saying, he had done ill in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the bird to escape out of the Cage; that he had released one, and permitted him to carry his head on his shoulders, who would shortly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55345:14"/>
take off theirs, with many words of the like effect. But <hi>Bectas</hi> slighted their reproof, as proceeding from want of courage, and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their own power; and that the time until morning was so short, that should the Visier intend to countermine them, he was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unable, being unprovided both of Power and Councel. The Visier being got free, went apace to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> with two men only, thanking God as he walked, that he was freed from the hands of those Tyrants and Villains; and coming to the Iron gate, intending to pass through the Garden, he found it open contrary to the custom, and enquiring of the <hi>Bostangees</hi> or Gardiners the reason, he could learn nothing farther from them, then that it was the order of the Old Queen; who (as it appeared afterwards) expected her Confidents who might withdraw her that night into some retirement where she might remain secure from the dangers of the ensuing day. The Visier being entred, went softly to the <hi>Sultans</hi> apartments, and in his way by good chance met with the <hi>Kuzlir-Agasi Solyman Aga,</hi> the chief Eunuch of the Women, who in the dark was making his rounds about the old Queens Lodgings; by the Visiers voice <hi>Solyman</hi> knew who he was, but was amazed at his unseasonable Visit, yet understanding the business, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for his Vigilance; adding, that he had also observed that the Old Queen contrary to her custom, was not yet gone to bed, who did at other times at two hours in the night dispose her self to rest, only this Evening she had entertained her self in company of her Eunuchs, and Favourites, with Musick, Singing and other unusual delights. Wherefore after some short deliberation, the Visier, <hi>Solyman Aga,</hi> and others of the Kings Eunuchs went to the quarters of the Old Queen, and offering to enter forcibly, were repulsed by the Queens Eunuchs; but <hi>Solyman Aga</hi> being a stout man drew his Dagger and struck the chief Chamberlain <hi>Bash Kapa Oglar</hi> on the face, upon which the other Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs who accompanied <hi>Solyman</hi> entred furiously with their Daggers, at which the Eunuchs of the Queen flying, she remained alone in the Chamber, where she was committed to the Custody of the Kings Eunuchs. The fugitive Eunuchs would immediately have escaped out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> but the Gates were first shut by order of <hi>Solyman Aga,</hi> so that they with all other favourites of the said Queen were taken and secured in safe hands. This Victory was so secretly obtained, that they received no alarum in the Royal Lodgings, though near adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; so that the Visier and <hi>Solyman Aga</hi> went to the Chamber where the King slept, and lifting up the Antiport, made a sign of silence to the Ladies of the Guard, commanding by dumb motions that the Young Queen should be awakened (for it is the custom in the Grand Signiors Court to speak by signs, to prevent noise, and as if there were some point in it of Majesty and decency, they have practised this mute language so fully, that they are able to recount stories in it) The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies hereupon gently rubbing the Queens feet, raised her out of her sleep, and gave her to understand that <hi>Solyman Aga</hi> would speak with her; whereat the Queen surprised, leapt from her bed to speak with him, and was scarce informed of the business before she became so affrighted, that she could not contain her self within the bounds of moderation or silence, but with a great cry ran to take her Son as one distracted, and catching him up in her armes, cryed out, O Son, you and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55345:15"/>
I are dead; the Grand Signior likewise as a Child bewailed himself, and falling at the feet of <hi>Solyman Aga,</hi> said, <hi>Lala, Lala Kurtar-beni;</hi> which is Tutor, Tutor save me: He not without tears took his Lord into his arms, and with the Visier encouraged the Child and his Mother, protesting that they would rather die, then live to behold so horrid a ruine; and so accompanied him (some Ladies carrying before Torches lighted in their hands, to the <hi>Hozoda,</hi> which is the Presence Chamber or place where the Principal Officers of the Court attend) Upon the approach of the Torches, the Guard which watched in this Chamber was amazed, and walking towards the light to discover what there was, perceived that the Grand Signior was coming thither, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon rerurned again with all haste to awaken their companions, and calling them immediately to repair to their due service. The Grand Signior being seated on a Throne, which is alwayes remaining in the Presence Chamber; the Officers hereof (which are in number forty) presented themselves before him, desiring to know if His Majesty had any thing wherein to employ their Fidelity and Service. Hereat <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman Aga</hi> said, <hi>He that eats the Kings Bread, should apply himself to the Kings service; we suffered the Traitots to destroy</hi> Sultan Ibrahim, <hi>and now they would also take this out of our hands; To you it belongs, who are His Majesties Principal Servitors, to afford him your utmost assistance. Eigiuse Mussapha Passa</hi> Sword-bearer to the Grand Signior, and chief of the Presence Chamber, a man of a Lions Heart and undaunted resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, understood something formerly of the bad inclinations of the old Queen to wards the King, readily replyed, Great Master be not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, tomorrow you shall see (God willing) the Heads of your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at your feet. The Visier and others in the mean time after a short Consult, fell to act, the exigencie of their Affairs admitting no delays; and in the first place, Pen and Ink being brought, an Order was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Grand Signior to be subscribed for arresting the <hi>Bossangi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Pasha</hi> as a Traitor, for having against the rule of the night kept open the Gate of the Kings Garden. This was done in an instant, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from his Office and another constituted in his place, and at the same time the Oath of Allegiance was administred to him, who calling together the Gardiners in number about 500. caused them also all to swear faithful obedience to the Grand Signior, and to remain all that night, keeping good Guard at the Gates and Walls of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. In the next place the <hi>Ichoglans</hi> were called up (who are the Grand Signiors Pages) and to proceed with the more privacy and least confusion, they went first to the Chamber of the <hi>Capa Agasi</hi> (who by his Office is over all the Youth of the <hi>Seraglio</hi>) and knocking gently at the Window, the Guards came at the noise, and demanded what the matter was? they answered, Awake the <hi>Capa Aga,</hi> and let him speak to us at the Window. But the <hi>Capa Aga</hi> would first know who they were that would speak with him: and when it was told him that it was the Visier and the <hi>Kuslir Aga,</hi> he answered, I am indisposed and cannot rise, but utter what you have to say at the Window; so they said, by His Majesties Order go and raise all the <hi>Ichoglans</hi> in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> upon an important occasion; and yet the <hi>Capa Agasi</hi> would not stir, so that some believed him confederate in the Conspiracy; but the truth was, he was an ancient Man of 90 years, and unhealthful in his body. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55345:15"/>
                  <hi>Solyman Aga</hi> cried out with a loud voice, <hi>Aga</hi> raise the <hi>Ichoglans, Our King is ready to be taken out of our hands;</hi> but the <hi>Capa Agasi</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted that he would not raise the <hi>Ichoglans</hi> or Pages, unless he brought a Command in writing from the King. In the Interim the Servants of the <hi>Capa Aga</hi> awakened, and hearing his discourse, could not contain themselves, but without farther order run to both the greater and lesser Chamber of the Pages; the <hi>Butler</hi> came to that which is called the greater Chamber; it was then five hours in the night when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in, and running to the middle of the Chamber which was 80 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in length, he made a stop and clapped his hands together; (To make such a noise in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> at night is a high misdemeanor) at which some being awakened, raised up their heads, and startled at such an unusual alarum, enquired the reason of it; at which he again clapping his hands, and crying out, Arise, the Grand Signior is like to be taken out of our hands, the whole Chamber was raised; so that you might have seen all the <hi>Ichoglans</hi> in number above 600. to rise and run in a confused manner, some without Cloaths, some without Arms to fight, some to fly, supposing the <hi>Janizaries</hi> were already entred the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> In this amaze came a Guard of Black and White Eunuchs to the door, advising them to arm themselves with what weapons were next at hand, and there to remain until they received farther Orders. All the other Chambers of Pages and Officers were in the same confusion, and were commanded in the like manner to arm themselves. The Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior all this time fearing he should be put to Death as his Father was, could not be pacified until <hi>Mustapha Pasha</hi> his Sword-bearer taking him by the hand, shewed him his Attendants all armed, and ready at his command; and passing by one of the Windows of the Lodgings, was descryed by a young man, who cryed out with a loud Voice (God grant our King ten thousand years of life) at which all the Chamber shouted, <note n="*" place="margin">A shout used by the <hi>Turks</hi> when they fight.</note> 
                  <hi>Allah, Allah;</hi> this acclamation rang through all the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> so that it reached the more remote quarters of the <hi>Drogists, Cooks, Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axe-men, Faulconers</hi> and others; who being ready and armed as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, answered with the like shout.</p>
               <p>These preparations were not only in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> but likewise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; for the Visier had given order to all the <hi>Pashaws</hi> and <hi>Beglerbegs</hi> and other his Friends, that without delay they should repair to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> with all the force they could make, bringing with them three days provisions, obliging them under pain of Death to this Duty. In a short space so great was this concourse, that all the Gardens of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> the outward Courts and all the adjoyning streets were filled with armed men: from <hi>Galata</hi> and <hi>Tophana</hi> came Boats and Barges loaden with Powder and Ammunition and other necessaries; so that in the Morning by Break of day appeared such an Army of Horse and Foot in the Streets, and Ships and Gallies on the Sea, as administred no small terrour to the <hi>Janizaries;</hi> of which being advised and seeing the concourse of the people run to the assistance of the King, they thought it high time to bestir themselves; and therefore armed a great Company of <hi>Albaneses, Greeks</hi> and other Christians, to whom they offered Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the Titles and Priviledges of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> promising to free them from <hi>Harach,</hi> or Impositions paid by the Christians; which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments were so prevalent, that most taking Arms, you might see the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55345:16"/>
Court and City divided, and ready to enter into a most dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of a Civil War.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Seraglio</hi> all things were in good order, the Morning Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being finished, the <hi>Baltagees</hi> (who are a Guard that carry Poleaxes) called to the Pages to joyn with them, and accompany them to the Presence Chamber. These <hi>Baltagees</hi> were in number about 200 strong, of large stature, and of admirable agility; at whose beck the Pages ran with all alacrity to the door of the Chamber, where they at first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a repulse from the Master of the Chamber who was an Eunuch, and one faithful to the Old Queens interest, who to yield all possible furtherance towards the protection of her Person, reproved the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Rout in coming so boisterously to the Royal Lodgings: to which they unanimously answered that they would speak to His Majesty, and that it was their desire to have the Old Queen (Enemy to the King, and the <hi>Mahometane</hi> Faith) put to Death; at which words he being enraged, and relying on his Authority, reproved them with terms of Rebels and Traitors to their Master. <hi>What have you to do with the Queen</hi> (said he)? <hi>Are you worthy to open your mouths against her Serene Name?</hi> He reiterating these and the like words, one of this Rabble said, Kill that Cuckold, for he also is an Enemy of the Faith; and whilst one lifted up his hand to strike him, he fled by the way of the <hi>Tarras</hi> into the Garden, whither being pursued by five or six of them, he was overtaken, and catching him by the coller would have cut his throat, but that at his earnest entreaty they gave him so much liberty as first to cast himself at the feet of the <hi>Sultan:</hi> whither being dragged, he delivered to the King a Seal and a Key of Secret Treasure, and being about to say somthing in his own behalf and defence of his life, a bold youth of these <hi>Baltagees</hi> called <hi>Jalch-Leferli</hi> struck him on the head with his axe, and cleft it into two pieces; the others seeing this first blow given him, fell on him with their Symitters and cut him to pieces: his blood and brains were dashed on the rich Carpets, which moved fear in many, who were secretly of the Conspiracy with the Old Queen. The Young King himself ignorant of the good intentions of his Servants, at the sight of blood-shed, being yet tender-hearted, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and closely embraced the <hi>Selihtar</hi> who then held him in his arms; but upon the removal of the Corps out of his sight and some smooth words, as that it was a sacrifice of love to him, and the like, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish tears were soon wiped away. In this interim the new created <hi>Mufti</hi> and <hi>Kenan Pasha</hi> one of the Visiers of the Bench, and <hi>Balyzade Efendi,</hi> who was formerly Lord Chief Justice, and well affected to the <hi>Spahees</hi> party, entring the <hi>Hazoda</hi> or Presence Chamber, perceiving a tumult in His Majesties Presence with different voices and languages, for some cryed in <hi>Georgian,</hi> others <hi>Albanian, Bosnian, Mengrelian, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> remained in great confusion how to proceed with order and reason in this important affair; For the <hi>Mufti</hi> and others were of opinion that the sentence against the Old Queen was not rashly to be pronounced, and so the matter might calmly be debated, and if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, an expedient might be found for saving her life, and securing the <hi>Sultan:</hi> But the Rabble impatient of delay, cryed out, defer not the sentence; for otherwise we shall esteem thee as one of her adherents. By this time news was come to the Young Queen, that there had been
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55345:16"/>
a fight in the Streets; who as yet doubtful of the success, and fearing if the <hi>Janizaries</hi> should gain the advantage, <hi>Bectas</hi> would revenge the blood of the Old Queen by her death, came covered with a Vail into the Presence Chamber, saying as she passed, <hi>Is this the Reverence you owe to the King your Lord? Do you know the place where you are? What would you have of a Woman? Why do you busie your selves in the Kings Affairs?</hi> Some presently apprehended that this was only a Plot of the Young Queen to make the World believe she would rather assist the Grand-Mother, than contrive against her, which made the Pages the more importunately to persist with the <hi>Mufti</hi> for the <hi>Fetfa</hi> or sentence against her. But one of the Pages suspecting that this Woman so veil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might be the old Queen her self, cryed out, This is she you seek for; she is in your hands, take your Revenge upon her: at which some bestirring themselves to seize her, she ran to the feet of her Son, and laying hold on him, cried out, No, no, I am not the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mother, I am the Mother of this His Majesty; and wiping the tears from the eyes of her Son with her handkerchief, made signs to keep back, which restrained the forwardness of some who pressed to lay vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent hands upon her. The <hi>Mufti,</hi> who observed the carriage of the Rout, and their earnest desires which could not be resisted, feared, if he gave not his concurrence, he himself should be killed, and the rather because he overheard the old <hi>Kenan Pasha</hi> discourse with the Visier, to the like effect. So that after some pause and Consultation with the other chief Ministers, it was resolved to supplicate His Majesty for his consent; which was done in these words; <hi>Sir, The will of God is, that you consign your Grand-Mother into the hands of Justice, if you would have these Mutinies appeased; a little mischief is better than a great one; there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Remedy; God willing, the end shall be prosperous.</hi> Pen and Ink being brought, the <hi>Mufti</hi> wrote the sentence, and the Grand Signior sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed it, which was that the Old Queen should be strangled, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cut with sword, nor bruised with blows. The writing was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into the hands of one of the Chamberlains, to whom by word of mouth it was ordered that they should carry the Queen out by <hi>Cushana</hi> (or the Gate of the Birds) so as she might not die in sight or hearing of the Grand Signior. The <hi>Ichoglans</hi> advancing the <hi>Royal Command</hi> on high with their hands, went out of the Presence with a great shout, crying, <hi>Allah, Allah,</hi> to the door of the Womens Lodgings, where they met some Black Eunuchs keeping Guard, who upon the sight of the <hi>Imperial Firme,</hi> and the command of <hi>Solyman Aga,</hi> gave them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, upon condition that twenty persons only should enter the Chambers. Those who were best armed went in, and passing through the Chambers of the Virgins, were met by the Queens <hi>Buffone</hi> with a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol in her hand, who demanding what they would have, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, the Kings Grand-Mother; she replyed, I am she, and with that offered to discharge her Pistol, but it took fire only in the Pan; with that the <hi>Ichoglans</hi> laid hold on her, supposing her to be the Queen; but being better advised by <hi>Solyman</hi> the <hi>Kuzlir-Aga,</hi> and directed to the Chamber where the Queen was; the door being opened, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Room to be dark (for the Womens quarters in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> for the most part are made obscure and close, and Lights are burnt in them day and night) and the old Queen had at the approach of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55345:17"/>
these Officers extinguished her Candles and got into a great Press, and there covered her self with Quilts and Carpets; but Torches being brought in, they looked all about, and discryed nothing; at which they were enraged against <hi>Solyman</hi> and would have killed him, saying, that he was the cause the Queen had escaped. But <hi>Solyman</hi> advising them to search more narrowly, one called <hi>Deli Dogangi,</hi> got upon the Press, and removing the Cloaths, discovered the Queen, who had thrust her self into a corner; at which she softly thus entreats him, <hi>O brave man be not cruel unto me;</hi> and promised she would give to every <hi>Ichoglan</hi> five purses a man (each purse consisting of 500 Dollars) if they would save her life. It is not the time of ransome, Traitor, said he; and taking her by the feet, drew her forth; the Queen rising up put her hand into her Pocket, and threw out handfuls of <hi>Zaichins,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that whilst they were scrambling for the Gold she might have an opportunity to escape; some of the young men gathered up the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but the <hi>Dogangi,</hi> like a Dog of the Game, left her not, and at length though she were heavy, cast her down. The others offered at her life, and particularly an <hi>Albanese</hi> called <hi>Ali Bostangi,</hi> who seeing two great Jewels at her ears, immediately catched at them and tore them thence. They were two Diamonds of the bigness of Chestnuts cut angulary, and beneath each Diamond was a Ruby to set it off. Those earings were given her by <hi>Sultan Ashmet</hi> in the time of her most flourishing Age, and his greatest affection. 'Tis said that such Jewels cannot be found in all the Great <hi>Turks</hi> Treasure, and were esteemed by the most skilful Jewellers worth a years Revenue of Grand <hi>Cairo.</hi> This <hi>Ali</hi> shewed the Jewels to his Comrade, demanding the value of them, and his Counsel whether to conceal or reveal them: but the Comrade prized them at that rate, that the stout young man could not sleep day nor night, being alwayes in fear lest the Jewels should not be kept hid; and apprehending that they became none but the Grand Signior to wear, went and delivered them to <hi>Solyman Aga,</hi> who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense thereof, presented him with 16 <hi>Zaichins</hi> which he accepted, desiring also to be admtited into the Chamber of the Treasury, which was granted him. Others also plucked her, some by the hands, others by the feet, some rifled her Cloaths, for she was furnished throughout with things of great value sewed in her Garments, and especially in her Sable Furs, which contained also certain Magick Spells, by which she conceived she had tyed the tongues of all the Emperours living in her time. The Person who gave me this relation, informed me, that he had seen a certain lock admirably made, and engraved with the Names of <hi>Murad</hi> and <hi>Sultan Ibrahim;</hi> it was made by a famous <hi>Gindgi,</hi> a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ignorant Fellow, but a Superstitious, Crafty Liar, by which Arts finding access, in short time he became a chief Favourite of <hi>Sultan Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> and from a poor Student called by the <hi>Turks</hi> a <hi>Softa,</hi> he grew so rich in two years that none in <hi>Constantinople</hi> was comparable to him.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Queen now assaulted by furious young men greedy of riches; she was in a moment despoyled of her Garments; her Furs were torn off into small pieces; and being stript of her Rings, Bracelets, Garters and other things, she was left naked without a Rag to cover her, and dragged by the feet to the <hi>Chushana:</hi> and being
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55345:17"/>
at the place of her execution, the young Officers found themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided of a Cord to strangle her, so that crying out for a Cord, one ran to the Royal Chappel, and thence took the Cord that upheld the great Antiport of the <hi>Mosch,</hi> which being twined about the Queens neck, the aforesaid <hi>Dogangi</hi> getting upon her back, pitched her neck with his hands, whilst the others drew the Cord. The Queen though she were by this time besides her senses, and worn out with Age, being above 80 years old and without Teeth: yet she with her Gumms only did bite the thumb of his left hand, which by chance came into her mouth, so hard that he could not deliver himself until with the haft of his Ponyard he struck her on the fore-head near her right eye. There were four that strangled her; but being young Executioners, laboured long to dispatch her, till at length the Queen leaving to struggle, lay stretched out and was supposed to be dead, and so crying (<hi>Uldi, Uldi</hi>) she is dead, she is dead, ran to carry the News thereof to His Majesty; but being scarce out of sight, the Queen raised her self up, and turned her head about; upon which the Executioners being again called back, the Cord was a second time applyed, and wrung so hard with the haft of a hatchet, that at length she was dispatched, and the News carried to the Royal Chamber. The Black Eunuchs immediately took up the Corps, and in a reverent manner laid it stretched forth in the Royal <hi>Mosch;</hi> which about 400 of the Queens Slaves encompassing round about with howling and lamentations, tearing the hair from their heads after their barbarous fashion, moved compassion in all the Court.</p>
               <p>This work being over, the Visier having given thanks to the <hi>Icho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glans</hi> or Pages <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

The Banner being brought forth with a rich covering, was advanced with great shouts of <hi>Allah, Allah;</hi> and carryed by the <hi>Ichoglans</hi> out of the chief Gate of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where it was shown to the people, who with wonderful admiration and Devotion beheld their glorious Standard; order was also given to proclaim through the whole City the procession of the Heavenly Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for they say that the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> brought it to <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the time of a great War made against the Christians, as an infallible sign and evidence of Victory. The opinion of this superstitious flag so prevailed, as it brought not only the young and healthful to fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, but sick, and old, and Women judged themselves obliged to run to the defence of this holy Ensign. The News hereof, and the death of the Old Queen coming to the old Chamber of the <hi>Janizaries;</hi> several of them, and those also of the Principal heads began to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, that it was now necessary to lay aside their private interests, and have a respect to their faith and their souls; for should they oppose the Heavenly Banner, they should run themselves into the State of <hi>Gaurs</hi> or Infidels, and become liable to the same censure or punishment which is inflicted upon unbelievers. But in the new Chambers <hi>Bectas</hi> endeavoured to remove this apprehension from the mind of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, by large Presents both of Gold and Silver, perswading them to uphold their Fame and Reputation; for that the Grand Signior and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55345:18"/>
his Mother were Enemies to their name and designs, and resolved to abase or destroy the order of that Militia; and with assurance of Vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctory and encouragement against a people unarmed and undisciplined, animated them to fight; and to make the business more easie, advised them to fire the City in several parts, that so the people might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and divided for safety of their own goods and dwellings. But this proposition took not with the Officers and Souldiers, who had many of them Houses and Possessions of their own in <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> but put them into great distractions and divisions in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. In this pause came an Officer from the Grand Signior (who to venture his life, had the promise of a good reward) with a Command in writing which he threw in amongst them, and galloped away as fast as he could; crying out as he rode, He that comes not under the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Prophet is a Pagan, and his Wife divorced. The Writing was taken up and carried to the Presence of the Principal Officers, which being opened and read, was to this purpose; Bectas Aga <hi>I have made</hi> Pasha <hi>of</hi> Bosna, Kara-chiaus <hi>I have made Captain General of the Sea;</hi> Kul-kahya <hi>I have made</hi> Pasha <hi>of</hi> Temiswar; <hi>and</hi> Kara Hassan Ogle <hi>I have made</hi> Ja<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>zar Agasi; <hi>and I require at sight of these Presents, that every one of you upon pain of death and ruine of his Family, repair to his duty and station.</hi> In this Instant came News that the old Chamber of <hi>Janizaries</hi> had left their station and were run under the Banner without Arms, and had refused <hi>Bectas'</hi>s Money and deserted his Cause, and that the <hi>Spahees</hi> in great Troops and the <hi>Jebegees</hi> (who command the Ordnance) approached with Artillery to beat upon their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The <hi>Spahees</hi> came thundring in upon the <hi>Janizaries</hi> in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their past injuries, and had certainly cut them off, had not the Visier with his Sword in his hand by good and bad words restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and appeased their animosity. The <hi>Janizaries</hi> of the new Chamber proclaimed their new Commander, and visited him with their usual form of Congratulation, running afterwards confusedly under the Banner. <hi>Kara-Hassan</hi> the new elected <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> went to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> to thank the Grand Signior for the honour done him, and with ten of his Principal Friends was admitted to the Grand Signiors Presence; who humbly kissing the ground, received the accustomed vests, and with some admonitions was fairly dismissed, and ordered to reduce his <hi>Janizaries</hi> to better obedience. By this time <hi>Bectas, Kul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kahya,</hi> and <hi>Kara Chiaus</hi> with some of their Favourites remained wholly abandoned, looking one upon the other, full of complaints and railings each at other for the miscarriage of the action.</p>
               <p>But since it was not now time to condole but to save their lives, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one made to his house. First <hi>Bectas</hi> fled to his home, where having ordered his Affairs, he cloathed himself in the <hi>Albanian</hi> fashion, and escaped to the house of a poor man formerly his Friend and Confident; but the next day being discovered by a youth, was taken, and being set on a Mule, was with the scorn and derision of the people conducted to the Grand Signiors <hi>Seraglio</hi> and there strangled. This person was held in so much detestation by the common people, that after his death the <hi>Cooks</hi> and inferiour sort of Servants run Spits and Pitch-forks through his body; and plucking the hairs out of his beard, sent them for Presents to their acquaintance through all <hi>Constantinople,</hi> saying,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55345:18"/>
These are the hairs of that Traitor, who gloryed, that before he would lose his Head, there should be raised a Mountain of heads as high as S<hi rend="sup">ta</hi> 
                  <hi>Sophia.</hi> But <hi>Kulkahya</hi> being come to his house, filled his Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantles with Gold and Jewels, and accompanied with sixty horse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to fly to the Mountains of <hi>Albania,</hi> places so inaccessible, that they have never yielded to the Turkish yoke: but finding himself hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursued in his journey, and that it was impossible to escape with so great a number, freely distributed a great part of his Gold upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and thanking them for their affection and good intentions, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed them all excepting one Servant, with whom he journyed with four laden horses with Gold, Jewels and other riches; and perceiving that this also was too great an incumbrance, they buryed a Treasure to the value of 600. thousand Dollars in the Country as they travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; which was afterwards found out by certain Shepherds, who disagreeing about the division thereof, the matter came to be known to the Judge of that Country, who seized upon it all and sent it to the Grand Signiors Treasury. But <hi>Kulkahya</hi> travelling still farther with his single Page, came to a Town, where wanting bread, and forced for the payment of it to exchange Gold, fell into a suspicion of being one of those Rebels lately escaped from <hi>Constantinople;</hi> which news being brought to a Captain of horse that commanded the place, he came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with some men to take him; but <hi>Kulkahya</hi> resolving not to fall into their hands alive, resisted them until he was killed by a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-shot, and so his head being severed from his body was sent to the Grand Signior. <hi>Kara Chiaus</hi> in this interim being with 200 men retired into his Garden, was assaulted by an <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Spahees</hi> (called <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maksis</hi>) with 500 men; but that this enterprise might be acquired with little blood, a Person was sent secretly to advise that party, that if they opposed the Royal Command, they should every one be put to death; at which the people fled and dispersed themselves. At that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant came in this <hi>Aga</hi> and took him, and yet comforted him with the clemency and mercy of the Grand Signior, promising also himself to intercede for him. And so bringing him to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> by the Garden gate, His Majesty had notice of it, and looking out of the Window and seeing him upon his knees begging pardon, the Grand Signior gave a sign to the Executioner to strangle him, which was accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The new <hi>Janizar Aga</hi> who knew all the Officers formerly affected to the Rebellious party, for several nights caused some or other of them to be strangled, to the number of 38 persons, which struck such a terrour into the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> that for a long time after they kept themselves within the bounds of humility and obedience. And thus concluded this Tragedy, remarkable as well for the dispatch as for the action it self, being but the work of fourteen hours. And in this manner it is apparent, how the Lessons of obedience which are so carefully taught, and instilled into the minds of all those who serve and depend upon the Grand Signior are corrupted; and by the Pride, Discord and Faction of the Governours seduced from their natural Principles.</p>
               <p>By the premisses we may consider more generally, that it hath always been the Misfortune of unlimited powers to be subject to dangers and violence, arising from the discontents and unconstancy of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55345:19"/>
for they coming to be sensible of their own strength, and knowing that the power of the Emperour is but fortified with their hands and heart, like unruly beasts throw their Riders, and shew that the Principles of obedience taught them, are easily corrupted and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by evil perswasions, or sedition in a Commander or common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. Thus we see in the time of the latter <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, who usurped a power unknown in the dayes of the pure and happy constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Common-wealth, and governed all by the Sword and their own lusts; few of them ended their dayes fortunately, or died in their beds and peace, without becoming a Sacrifice to the same power that first proclaimed them Emperours. And though the Mutinies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Militia can hardly operate any durable alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the State (as we shall more at large hereafter discourse) yet doubtless the Tyranny in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperours, had provoked the people long since to have proved the benefit of another Race, but that there is a strange kind of Devotion and Religion in their minds as to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> bloud, which having been the original of their Empire and greatness, will ever be maintained in high reverence and honour. Nor is it likely that the fair Speeches and allurements of a Rebellious slave will ever prevail to perswade this people from their Religion to this Prince, or that their arms can ever be prosperous under the Ensign and Conduct of an Usurper. And may all Christians learn this Lesson from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and adde this principle to the Fundamentals of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as to their Laws. None can more experimentally preach this Doctrine to the World than <hi>England,</hi> who no sooner threw off her Obedience and Religion to her Prince, but (as if that vertue had been the only bar to all other Enormities and Sins) she was deprived of all other Ecclesiastical and Civil Rights, and in all her capacities and relations deflowred and prophaned by impious and unhallowed hands.</p>
               <p>And thus having given a Relation of the <hi>Turks</hi> Religion and first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in order to their obedience to their Prince, let us proceed a little farther into the <hi>penetralia</hi> of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and there see what farther care is taken of the Youth, in all points of their <hi>Education,</hi> to fit and prepare them for the management and performance of the highest and weightiest Offices of State; which I judge to be one of the chiefest of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Polities, and is certainly an extraordinary support and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Empire.</p>

               <p>IT is a special point of Wisdom in Princes, to provide and prefer men of deserving Parts and Abilities to the discharge of the great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Offices of State, not such whom chance and fortune casually throws on them, because they will not take the pains of a narrow and severe scrutiny to seek men able, and fit for trust; nor such whom flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, riches, gifts, or nobility promote, but those whom the Prince by his own experience of their wisdom, virtues, and diligence, or the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Councellors, and other confidents, judges capable to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their advancement to the honour of the King, and the blessing of their Country: and not like vast Mountains which hide their heads in the clouds, and yet remain without fruit, or herbage; whose barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness<note place="margin">Balzac de la <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Some wise Princes, and great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of our modern times, have kept Rolls and Registers of the most eminent Men famed for their virtue, and knowledge in any parts, with an account of their Family linage, and conditian, out of which, (if in<note place="margin">Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>
                  </note> their own jurisdiction) they culled and elected such, proper for their occasions and vacant Offices.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turk</hi> is not less careful in the choice of his Officers, and loves to be served by his own, such as to whom he hath given breeding, and education, and are as obliged to employ those parts in his service which he hath bestowed; whose minds he hath cultivated with wisdom and virtue, as well as nourished their bodies with food, until they arrive to a Mature age, that renders the profit of his care, and expence; such as these he is served by, whom he can raise without envy, and destroy without danger.</p>
               <p>The Youths then that are designed for the great Offices of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, called by the <hi>Turks Ichoglans,</hi> must be such as are of Christian Parents, taken in War, or presented from remote parts; as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that the <hi>Algerians,</hi> alwaies amongst their other gifts, present some Youths whom they have taken by Pyracy; the Policy herein is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obvious, because the Sons of Christians will hate their Parents being educated with other Principles and Customs; or coming from distant places have contracted no acquaintance, so that starting from their Schools into Government, they will find no Relations, or Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies on their Interests then that of their great Master, to whom they are taught, and necessity compells them to be faithful. In the next place, these Youths must be of admirable features, and pleasing looks, well shaped in their bodies, and without any defects of nature; For it is conceived that a corrupt and sordid soul can scarce inhabit in a serene and ingenious Aspect; and I have observed, not only in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi>

The Eunuchs have the care of these Scholars committed unto them, whom they treat with an extraordinay severitry; for these, being the <hi>Censores morum,</hi> punish every slight omission, or fault with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream rigour. For Eunuchs are naturally cruel, whether it be out of envy to the Masculine Sex which is perfect and intire, or that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the disposition of Women, which is many times more cruel and revengeful then that of men; they will not let slip the smallest <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadillo</hi> without its due chastisement, either by blows on the soals of the feet, or long fastings, watchings, or other penance; so that he who hath run through the several Schools, Orders, and degrees of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi> must needs be an extraordinary mortified man, patient of all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, services and injunctions, which are imposed on him with a strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness beyond the discipline that religious novices are acquainted with in Monastries, or the severity of <hi>Capuchins,</hi> or holy Votaries. But yet methinks these men that have been used all their lives to servitude, and subjection, should have their spirits abased, and when licensed from the <hi>Seraglio</hi> to places of Trust and Government, should be so acquainted how to obey, as to be ignorant how to Rule, and be dazled with the light of liberty, and overjoyed with the sence of their present conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and past sufferings, passing from one extream to another, that they should lose their reasons, and forget themselves and others. But in answer hereunto, the <hi>Turks</hi> affirm, that none know so well how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, as those who have learned how to obey; though at first the sence of their freedom may distract them, yet afterwards the discipline, lectures, and morality in their younger years, will begin to operate, and recollect their scattered sences into their due and natural places. But to return from whence we have a little digressed; These young men<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Oda</hi> signifies a Chamber.</note> before they are disposed into their Schools, which are called <hi>Oda,</hi> their Names, Age, Country, and Parents are Registred in a Book, with their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55345:20"/>
allowance from the Grand Signior of four or five Aspers a day; the Copy of this book is sent to the <hi>Tefterdar,</hi> or Lord Treasurer, that so quarterly they may receive their pension.</p>
               <p>Being thus admitted they are entered into one of the two Schools,<note place="margin">The 2. <hi>Odaes.</hi>
                  </note> that is to say into the <hi>Bojuck Oda,</hi> or the <hi>Cuchuck Oda,</hi> which is the great Chamber, or the less; the former commonly contains 400, and the other about 200 or 250. these two Schools may be said to be of the same form or rank; and what is taught in one, is likewise in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; neither of them hath the precedency; all of them equally near to preferment; their first lessons are silence, reverence, humble and modest behaviour, holding their heads downwards, and their hands across before them; their Masters the <hi>Hogias</hi> instruct them in all the rights, discipline, and superstition of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, and to say their prayers, and understand them in the <hi>Arabick</hi> language, and to speak, read, and write <hi>Turkish</hi> perfectly. Afterwards having made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in the former, they proceed in the study of the <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> tongues, which may be of benefit to them if their lot chance to call them to the Government of the Eastern parts, and is a help to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their knowledge in the <hi>Turkish,</hi> which being of it self barren, is beholding to those tongues for its copiousness and enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Their Cloathing is good English Cloth and Linnen, neither fine nor<note place="margin">Cloathing and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries.</note> coorse; their Diet is chiefly Rice, and other wholsome Meats which become the Table of Scholars, where there is nothing of superfluity, as there is nothing of want: Their manners and behaviour are strictly watched by the Eunuchs their careful Guardians, so as they cannot be familiar one with another at any time without modesty, and respect to the presence they are in; if they go to perform the necessary offices of nature or to the Bath, they are never out of the eye of an Eunuch, who will admit none of their nearest relations to speak with them or see them, unless special License be obtained from the <hi>Capa Aga</hi> or chief<note place="margin">Their retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> of the Eunuchs. Their Bed-chambers are long Chambers where all<note place="margin">Bed-chambers.</note> night Lamps are kept burning; their Beds are laid in ranks one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon <hi>Safrawes</hi> or Bords raised from the ground; and between every five or six lies an Eunuch, so as conveniently to see or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear if there be any wanton or lewd behaviour or discourse amongst them.</p>
               <p>When they are arrived to some proficiency, and almost to Mans estate and strength of body, fit for manly exercises, they are trained up in handling the lance, throwing the Iron Bar, drawing the Bow, and throwing the Gerit or Dart. In all these Exercises they spend many hours, being constant in all or some of them, and are severely correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Eunuchs if they seem to be remiss or negligent therein: many of them spend much time principally in drawing the Bow, in which they proceed from a weaker to one more strong, and by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual exercise and use come at last to draw Bows of an incredible strength, more by art and custom then of pure force; and thus by constant bodily exercise they become men of great strength, health and agility, fit for the Wars, and all active employments; amongst their other exercises, Horsemanship is a principal Lesson, both to sit in a handsome posture, and to manage their Horse with dexterity; to<note place="margin">Horseman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:55345:21"/>
draw the Bow on Horse-back forwards, backwards, and on either side, which they learn with that agility and pliantness of their joynts in the full career or speed of the Horse as is admirable; They learn also to throw the Gerit or Dart out of their hands on Horse-back, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a sport and recreation the present Grand Signior delights in<note place="margin">The Dart or Gerit.</note> above all others, every one in hopes of preferment, and in emulation one of the other, endeavours to be a Master in it, and most are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so dexterous, that they will dart a stick of above three quarters of a yard long with that force, that where it hits, it will endanger breaking a bone. The Grand Signior every day passes his time with seeing his Pages exercised in this sport, in which ordinarily one knocks another from his Horse, and seldom a day passes in which some receive not bruises or desperate wounds. This <hi>Sultan</hi> doth many times appoint dayes of combat between the Black Eunuchs and some of his White Pages on Horse-back, in this manner with the Gerit; and then happens such a skirmish with such emulation, each side contending for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his colour, race and dignity, with that heat and courage, as if they contended for the Empire; this pastime seldom concluding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some blood. But it is to be noted, that none of these exercises are performed by any of those that belong to the two Chambers, unless within the Walls of the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> the other Pages who accompany the Grand Signior abroad, are such as are preferred to farther and higher Chambers, as hereafter we shall discourse. To the former Lessons of School-learning and exercise abroad, are added some other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments of a Trade, handy-craft or Mystery, in which a man may be useful to the service of the Grand Signior, as to sowe and embroider in Leather (in which the <hi>Turks</hi> exceed all other Nations) to make arrows and embroider quivers and saddles, and make all sorts of Furniture for Horses; some learn to fold up a Turbant, others to fold up, clean, and brush Vests; to wash and clean in the Bath, to keep Dogs and Hawks; others to excel in the Turkish manner of Musick, and all other services which may keep them from idleness, and wherein they may be of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture use to their great Master. And according hereunto <hi>Pashaes</hi> and great men have been denominated and surnamed after their departure from the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> to their places of Office and Trust.</p>
               <p>Such as have before made good proficiency in their Studies, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a dexterity in their bodily exercises, are transplanted to the first step of preferment, which is the washing the Grand Signiors Linen, and here they first change their Cloth for Satten Vests and Cloth of Gold, and their Pay and Salary is augmented from four or five Aspers a day to eight or more; thence they pass, as places fall, to the <hi>Hazna-Oda,</hi> or Chamber of the Treasury, or to the <hi>Kilar</hi> or Dispensatory, where the Drugs, Cordials and rich Drinks for the Grand Signiors service are kept; out of these two Chambers they are elected in order to the highest and supream place of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which is called the <hi>Haz Oda,</hi> which consists of forty Pages; these attend immediately on the Person of the Grand Signior, and amongst them twelve hold the chief Offices of the Court, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>There are also two other Officers in the Court of great respect, which are the <hi>Dogan Bashee,</hi> or chief Falconer, and the <hi>Humaungee Bashee,</hi> or chief over the Baths; but these have their offices and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings apart, and not entering into the Royal Chamber, are not capable of higher preferment.</p>
               <p>There are nine also are called <hi>Arz Agalar,</hi> who have the priviledge of presenting petitions like Masters of the Requests; of these, 4 are of the <hi>Hasoda,</hi> as the <hi>Shiletar Aga, Tchohadar Aga, Rikiabrar Aga, Tulbend Oglanij,</hi> and the others are of different offices, as the <hi>Hazna Kiahaiasi,</hi> who is the second Officer of the Treasury, <hi>Kiler Kiahaiasi,</hi> who is overseer of the provisions of <hi>Sherbets,</hi> Sugar, sweet-meats, &amp;c. <hi>Dogangi Bashi,</hi> or chief Falconer, the <hi>Hazodabaschi,</hi> or principal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Royal Chamber, and <hi>Kapa Agasi</hi> or chief Commander of the Pages; all which are first and nearest to preferment, and to be employed abroad, in the Office of <hi>Pascha,</hi> as places are void.</p>
               <p>Those that are thus through the grace and favour of the <hi>Sultan</hi> arrived to the dignity of being of the Royal Chamber, where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the honour and priviledge of being constantly in his eye and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, are often presented by him with Swords, vests, bows and the like; and are permitted to take rewards for the intercessions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications they make in behalf of others. Sometimes he sends them on message to <hi>Pashaes;</hi> sometimes for the confirmation of the Princes either in <hi>Transilvania, Moldavia,</hi> or <hi>Walachia;</hi> sometimes to carry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to the Visier and great men: in all which employments they are greatly entertained and presented both which money, jewels, and rich furniture for horses, so that very few of these forty, but in a short time gain estates of their own, fit to equippe and furnish them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into any offices of the Empire. As offices fall in order, supplies are<note place="margin">The degrees of successions greatly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> made out of these, others rising from lower chambers successively in their places; whether it be to the four most considerable Governments, which are <hi>Cairo, Aleppo, Damascus</hi> and <hi>Buda,</hi> or if none of these places be void, to be <hi>Beglerbegs</hi> of <hi>Grecia,</hi> or of <hi>Natolia,</hi> to be <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries, Spaheeler Agasee,</hi> or General of the Horse, or to some small <hi>Pashalicks</hi> or Governments scattered in several places of the Empire. But we shall not here need to discourse of the particular offices and dignities within the power and gift of the Grand Signior, intending to make a distinct Chapter of the several offices, governments, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and places, from whence the Grand Signiors profits arise, that so we may the better describe the wealth of this Empire, and the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55345:22"/>
of those offices, for discharge of which young men are educated with the care before mentioned.</p>
               <p>But before the conclusion of this Chapter, it will be necessary to adde, that none unless by special grace, are advanced from the <hi>Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> until the age of about 40 years, by which time they are ripe and mature for Government, and the wantonness and heat of youth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed. Before their departure to their places of trust, they are court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and honoured by all with presents; the Queen Mother, the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanaes,</hi> the rich Eunuchs, the Great Visier, and Officers abroad concur all to adorn them with gifts and riches at their advancement, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted consequents of the Grand Signiors favour. And at the fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, with much submission they visit the <hi>Capa Aga,</hi> or chief of the Eunuchs, and other principal officers of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> recommending themselves in the time of their absence to their good grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, desiring to live in their good opinion and friendship; and this is done with as much ceremony and complement as is exercised in the most civil parts of Christendome. For though the <hi>Turks</hi> out of pride and scorn, comport themselves to Christians with a strange kind of barbarous haughtiness, and neglect, they are yet among themselves as courtly and precise in their own rules of complement and civility, as they are at <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other parts of the civilized world.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the method of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Studies and Learning in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE have rather shewed in the foregoing Chapter, the education of those young Scholars, in reference to exercise of body, and dexterity in arms, then the method of their studies and speculations, according to the manner of our Seminaries and Colledges, which more respect the cultivation of the mind with the principles of vertue and morality, and the notions of sublime reason, then in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of the body by assiduity of exercise, which makes them become active, and begets an agility in the management of arms. And though the latter is a business most attended to by sprightly and ingenious spirits, who know preferments in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court have always depended and still do on the virtue of the Sword; yet spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation and knowledge in Sciences are not wholly estranged from their Schools, which we shall in brief touch upon to satisfie the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of our Academies, who I know would gladly be resolved what sort of Physical or Moral Philosophy, what Tongues and Sciences fall within the contemplation of that barbarous ignorance of the <hi>Turks.</hi> To dilucide which the most clearly that I can, according to the best information of the learned <hi>Turks;</hi> It is reported by the <hi>Kalfaes</hi> or <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogues</hi> of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> that their chief design is to instruct their Scholars in reading and writing, so as they may have some inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the books of their Law and Religion; especially the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> whereby may be produced in their minds a greater reverence to them. For being once passed from the first form of their A. B. C. and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55345:22"/>
Syllables, they are then instructed in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Tongue, wherein all the secrets and treasure of their Religion and Laws are contained, and is a necessary accomplishment of a <hi>Pasha,</hi> or any great Minister in relation to the better discharge of his office, being thereby enabled to have an inspection into the writings and sentences of the <hi>Kadees,</hi> or other Officers of the Law within his jurisdiction, as well as furnished with knowledge and matter of discourse concerning religion. And to adorn these young <hi>Candidates</hi> of the Grand Signiors favour, with more polite and ingenious endowments, the next lesson is the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Tongue, which fits them with quaint words and eloquence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Court of their Prince, and corrects the grossness, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches the barrenness of the <hi>Turkish</hi> tongue, which in it self is void both of expression and sweetness of accent. It teaches them also a handsome and gentle deportment, instructs them in Romances, raises their thoughts to aspire to the generous and virtuous actions they read of in the <hi>Persian</hi> Novellaries, and endues them with a kind of <hi>Platonick</hi> love each to other, which is accompanied with a true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship amongst some few, and with as much gallantry as is exercised in any part of the world. But for their Amours to Women, the restraint and strictness of Discipline, makes them altogether strangers to that Sex; for want of conversation with them, they burn in lust one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, and the amorous disposition of youth wanting more natural objects of affection, is transported to a most passionate admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of beauty wheresoever it finds it, which because it is much talked of by the <hi>Turks,</hi> we will make it a distinct discourse by it self. The books they read commonly in the <hi>Persian</hi> language, are, <hi>Danisten, Schahidi, Pend-attar, Giulistin, Bostan Hafiz,</hi> and the <hi>Turkish</hi> books called <hi>Mulemma,</hi> or a mixture of the <hi>Arabian</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> words both in prose and verse, facetious and full of quick and lively expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. Of these sorts of books those most commonly read are called <hi>Kirkwizir, Humaiunname,</hi> or <hi>delile we Kemine, El fulecale, Seidbatal,</hi> and various other Romances: these are usually the study of the most aiery and ingenious spirits amongst them. Those others who are of a complexion more melancholick and inclinable to contemplation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with more patience of method, and are more exact in their studies, intending to become Masters of their Pen, and by that means to arrive to honour and office either of <hi>Rest Efendi,</hi> or Secretary of State, Lord Treasurer, or Secretary of the Treasury, or Dispensatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or else to be <hi>Emaums</hi> or Parish Priests of some principal Moschs of Royal foundation, in which they pass an easie, quiet and secure life, with a considerable competency of livelyhood. Others aim in their studies to become <hi>Hazifizi,</hi> which signifies a Conserver of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> who get the whole <hi>Alchoran</hi> by heart, and for that reason are held in great esteem, and their persons as sacred as the place which is the Repository of the Law.</p>
               <p>Those who are observed to be more addicted to their Books then others, are named by them <hi>Talibulilmi,</hi> or lovers of Philosophy; though very few amongst them arrive to any learning really so called, yet they attain to the degree of <hi>Giuzehon</hi> or Readers of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> for benefit and relief of the souls of those departed, who for that end hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed them Legacies. At certain houses they read Books that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55345:23"/>
treat of the matters of their Faith, and render them out of <hi>Arabick</hi> into <hi>Turkish,</hi> and these Books are <hi>Schurut, Salat, Mukad, Multeka, Hidaie, &amp;c.</hi> which they descant upon in an Expository manner; instructing the more ignorant and of lower form, by way of Catechism. They have also some Books of Poetry written both in <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Arabick,</hi> which run in Rhime and Meeter, like the Golden Verses of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> containining excellent sentences of Morality, being directions for a godly life, and contemplations of the miseries and fallacies of this world, which many of them commit to memory, and repeat occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they fall into discourse. For other Sciences as Logick, Physick, Metaphsick, Mathematicks, and other out University Learning, they are wholly ignorant; unless in the latter, as far as Musick is a part of Mathematicks, whereof there is a School apart in the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> Only some that live in <hi>Constantinople</hi> have learned some certain rules of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, which they exercise upon all occasions, and busie themselves in Prophesies of future contingencies of the Affairs of the Empire, and the unconstant estate of great Ministers, in which their predictions seldom divine grateful or pleasiing stories. Neither have the wisest and most active Ministers or Souldiers amongst them, the least inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Geography, whereby to be acquainted with the situation of Countreys or disposition of the Globe, though they themselves enjoy the possession of so large a proportion of the universe. Their Seamen, who seldom venture beyound sight of Land (unless they be those of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> who are <hi>Renegadoes</hi> and practised in the Christian Arts of Nava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation) have certain <hi>Sea-carts</hi> ill framed, and the Capes and head-lands so ill laid down, that in their Voyages from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Alaxan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> the richest place of their Trade, they trust more to their eye and experience, then the direction of their Maps; nor could I ever see any Cart of the black Sea made either by <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> which could give the least light to a knowing Seaman, so as to encourage him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of Art, to lay any confidence theron in his Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p>The Art of Printing (a matter disputable, whether it hath brought more of benefit or mischief to the world) is absolutely prohibited amongst them, because it may give a beginning to that sublety of Learning which is inconsistent with, as well as dangerous to the grosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Government, and a means to deprive many of their lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, who gain their bread only by their Pen, and occasion the loss of that singular Art of fair Writing, wherein they excel or equal most Nations: the effect of which is evident amongst the Western people where Printing hath taken footing. And though there be few Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians among them who have any knowledge of past-times, or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other Empires before the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> mixing all stories in confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on together (as we have said before) without distinction of Persons, or respect of Chronology; yet as to the successes and progress of Affairs in their own dominions, they keep most strict Registers and Records, which serve them as presidents and rules for the present Government of their Affairs.</p>
               <p>And thus the Reader may sound the depth of the <hi>Turks</hi> Philosophy, who though they reach not those contemplations of our profound <hi>Sophies,</hi> have yet so much knowledge as neither to be over-reached in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55345:23"/>
their Treaties with the wits of the World, nor for want of good Conduct of Affairs lose one inch of their Empire.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Affection and Friendship the Pages in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> bear each other.</head>
               <p>SINCE in the fore-going Chapter we have made mention of the amorous disposition that is to be found among these youths each to other, it will not be from our purpose to acquaint the Reader, that the Doctrine of Platonick love hath found Disciples in the Schools of the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they call it a passion very laudable and virtuous, and a step to that perfect love of God, whereof mankind is only capable, proceeding by way of love and admiration of his image and beauty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamped on the creature. This is the colour of virtue, they paint over the deformity, of their depraved inclinations; but in reality this love of theirs, is nothing but libidinous flames each to other, with which they burn so violently, that banishment and death have not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples sufficient to deter them from making demonstrations of such like addresses; so that in their Chambers, though watched by their Eunuchs, they learn a certain language with the motion of their eyes, their gestures and their fingers, to express their amours; and this passion hath boiled sometimes to that heat, that jealousies and rivalties have broken forth in their Chambers without respect to the severity of their Guardians, and good orders have been brought into confusion, and have not been again redressed, until some of them have been expelled the <hi>Seraglio</hi> with the Tippets of their Vests cut off, banished into the Islands, and beaten almost to death.</p>
               <p>Nor is this passion only amongst the young men each to other; but Persons of eminent degree in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> become inveigled in this sort of love, watching occasions to have a sight of the young Pages that they fancy, either at the Windows of their Chamber, or as they go to the <hi>Mosque,</hi> or to their washings or baths; offer them service and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, and so engage them as to induce them to desire to be made of the retinue of him that uses this Courtship towards them, which they many times obtain, and being entertained in the service of a Master who so highly fancies and admires them, they become often sharers with him in his riches and fortune.</p>
               <p>The Grand Signiors themselves have also been slaves to this inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate passion. For <hi>Sultan Morat</hi> became so enamoured of an <hi>Armenian</hi> Boy called <hi>Musa</hi> as betrayed him, though otherwise a discreet Prince, to a thousand follies; and at another time preferred a youth for his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty only from the Novitiate of <hi>Galata,</hi> to be one of the Pages of his <hi>Haz-Oda</hi> or Chamber of his Royal Presence, and in a short time made him <hi>Silahtar Aga</hi> or Sword-bearer, one of the greatest Offices in the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> And this present <hi>Sultan</hi> became so enamoured of a <hi>Canstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitan</hi> youth, one of the Pages of his <hi>Musitians</hi> School, called <hi>Kulogli,</hi> or Son of a slave, that he made him his chief Favourite, never could content himself without his Company, Clothed him like himself,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55345:24"/>
made him ride by his side, commanded all to present and honour him, in the same manner as if he had made him Companion of the Empire.</p>
               <p>This passion likewise reigns in the Society of Women; they die with amorous affections one to the other; especially the old Women court the young, present them with rich Garments, Jewels, Mony, even to their own impoverishment and ruine, and these darts of <hi>Cupid</hi> are shot through all the Empire, especially <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the Grand Signior, and the apartments of the <hi>Sultans.</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55345:24"/>
made up of several signs in which by custom they can discourse and fully express themselves; not only to signifie their sense in familiar que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, but to recount stories, understand the Fables of their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Laws and Precepts of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> the name of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and what else may be capable of being expressed by the Tongue. The most ancient amongst them, to the numder of about eight or nine, are called the Favourite <hi>Mutes,</hi> and are admitted to attendance in the <hi>Haz-Oda;</hi> who only serve in the place of <hi>Buffones</hi> for the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior to sport with, whom he sometimes kicks, sometimes throws in the cisterns of water, sometimes makes fight together like the combat of <hi>Clinias</hi> and <hi>Dametas.</hi> But this language of the <hi>Mutes</hi> is so much in fashion in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, that none almost but can deliver his sense in it, and is of much use to those who attend the Presence of the Grand Signior, before whom it is not reverent or seemly so much as to whisper.</p>
               <p>The Dwarfs are called <hi>Giuge;</hi> these also have their quarters amongst the Pages of the two Chambers, until they have learned with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and humility to stand in the Presence of the Grand Signior. And if one of these have that benefit, as by natures fortunate error to be both a Dwarf, and dumb, and afterwards by the help of Art to be castrated and made an Eunuch, he is much more esteemed, then if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Art had concurred together to have made him the perfectest creature in the world; one of this sort was presented by a certain <hi>Pasha,</hi> to the Grand Signior, who was so acceptable to him and the Queen Mother that he attired him immediately in Cloth of Gold, and gave him liberty though all the Gates of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>

                  <p>ANd since I have brought my Reader into the quarters of these Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs, which are the Black guard of the sequestred Ladies of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> he may chance to take it unkindly, should I leave him at the door, and not introduce him into those apartments, where the Grand Signiors Mistresses are lodged: And though I ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess my acquaintance there (as all other my conversation with Women in <hi>Turky</hi>) is but strange and unfamiliar; yet not to be guilty of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courtesie, I shall to the best of my information write a short account of these Captivated Ladies, how they are treated, immured, educated and prepared for the great atchivements of the <hi>Sultans</hi> affection; and as in other stories the Knight consumes himself with combats, watching and penance to acquire the love of one fair Damsel; here an army of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins make it the only study and business of their life to obtain the single nod of invitation to the Bed of their great Master.</p>
                  <p>The Reader then must know that this Assembly of fair Women (for it is probable there is no other in the <hi>Seraglio</hi>) are commonly prizes of the Sword, taken at Sea and at Land, as far fetched as the <hi>Turk</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or the wandring <hi>Tartar</hi> makes his excursions, composed almost
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55345:26"/>
of as many Nations as there are Countries of the world; none of which are esteemed worthy of this Preferment, unless beautiful and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Virgins.</p>
                  <p>As the Pages before mentioned are divided into two Chambers, so likewise are these maids into two <hi>Odaes,</hi> where they are to work, sow, and embroider, and are there lodged on <hi>Safawes,</hi> every one with her bed apart, between every five of which is a <hi>Kadun</hi> or grave Matron laid to oversee and hear what actions or discourse passes either immodest or undecent; Besides this School they have their Chambers for Musick and Dancing, for acquiring a handsome air in their carriage and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, to which they are most diligent and intent, as that which opens the door of the <hi>Sultans</hi> affections, and introduces them into Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment and Esteem.</p>
                  <p>Out of these, the Queen Mother chooses her Court, and orderly draws from the Schools such as she marks out for the most beauteous, facetious, or most corresponding with the harmony of her own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and prefers them to a near attendance on her Person, or to other Offices of her Court. These are always richly attired and adorned with all sorts of precious stones, fit to receive the adresses and amours of the <hi>Sultan:</hi> over them is placed the <hi>Kadun Kahia</hi> or Mother of the Maids, who is carefull to correct any immodest or light behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our amongst them, and instructs them in all the Rules and Orders of the Court.</p>
                  <p>When the Grand Signior is pleased to dally with a certain number of these Ladies in the Garden; <hi>Helvet</hi> is cryed, which rings through all the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> at which word all people withdraw themselves at a distance, and Eunuchs are placed at every avenue, it being at that time death to approach near those walls. Here the Women strive with their Dances, Songs and Discourse to make themselves Mistresses of the Grand Signiors affection, and then let themfelves loose to all kind of lasciviousness and wanton carriage, acquitting themselves as much of all respect to Majesty as they do to modesty.</p>
                  <p>When the Grand Signior resolves to choose himfelf a Bed-fellow, he retires into the Lodgings of his Women, where (according to the story in every place reported, when the Turkish <hi>Seraglio</hi> falls into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) the Damsels being ranged in order by the Mother of the Maids, he throws his handkerchief to her, where his eye and fancy best directs, it being a token of her election to his bed. The surprized Virgin snatches at this prize and good fortune with that eagerness, that she is ravished with the joy before she is defloured by the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and kneeling down first kisses the handkerchief, and then puts it in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, when immediately she is congratulated by all the Ladies of the Court, for the great honour and favour she hath received. And after she hath been first washed, bathed and perfumed, she is adorned with Jewels, and what other attire can make her appear glorious and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; she is conducted at night, with Musick and Songs of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions chanting before her to the Bed-chamber of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> at the door of which attends some Favourite Eunuch, who upon her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching gives advice to the Grand Signior, and permission being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her to enter in, she comes running and kneels before him, and sometimes enters in at the feet of the Bed, according to the ancient ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55345:27"/>
or otherwise as he chances to like her, is taken in a neare way with the Embraces of the Grand Signior.</p>
                  <p>This private entertainment being ended, she is delivered to the care of the <hi>Kadan Kahia</hi> or Mother of the Maids, by whom she is again conducted back with the same Musick as before, and having first wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bathed, hath afterwards the lodging and attendance that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to <hi>Hunkiar Asa-kisi,</hi> that is, the Royal Concubine; if it be her good fortune to conceive and bring forth a Son, she is called <hi>Hasaki Sultana,</hi> and is honoured with a solemn Coronation, and Crowned with a small Coronet of Gold beset with precious Stones. Other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies who produce like fruits from the Grand Signiors bed, have not yet the like honour, but only the name of <hi>Bash Hasaki, Inkingi Hasaki,</hi> the first and second Concubine, and so forward.</p>
                  <p>The Daughters that are born from the Grand Signior, are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at four or five years of Age wedded to some great <hi>Pasha</hi> or <hi>Begler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> with all the Pomp and solemnities of Marriage, who from that time hath care of her Education; to provide a Palace for her Court, and to maintain her with that state and honour as becomes the dignity of a Daughter to <hi>Sultan.</hi> At this tenderness of Age, <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> Father of the present Grand Signior, Married three of his Daughters; one of which called <hi>Gheaher Han Sultan,</hi> hath had already five Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and yet as is reported by the World, remains a Virgin; the last Husband deceased was <hi>Ishmael Pasha,</hi> who was slain in the passage of the River <hi>Raab;</hi> and is now again Married to <hi>Gurgi Mahomet Pasha</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> a man of 90 years of Age, but rich and able to maintain the greatness of her Court, though not to comply with the youthfulness of her bed, to which he is a stranger, like the rest of her preceding Husbands.</p>
                  <p>After the Death of the Grand Signior, the Mothers of Daughters have liberty to come forth from the <hi>Seraglio</hi> and marry with any person of Quality; but those who have brought forth Sons, are transplanted to the old <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where they pass a retired life without redemption; unless the Son of any of those Mothers by death of the first heir suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, release his Mother from that restraint, and make her sharer with him in all his happiness and glory.</p>

Their Lodgings are under several Pent-houses or sheds, built un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the walls of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> their Diet is flesh and rice, sufficient though not luxurious. Out of these belonging to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> none are drawn out for <hi>Janizaries,</hi> but are sometimes preferred to service of <hi>Pashas</hi> for their fidelity or good deserts, and by those Masters arise to considerable riches, and commodious manner of livelihood; others of these in great numbers are made use of for attendance on the Grand Signiors Tents, when he goes to the Wars, and in other journies are useful for the management of the Grand Signiors carriages and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing necessaries. Such <hi>Agiamoglans</hi> (as we have said before) that are distributed into other quarters besides the Royal <hi>Seraglio,</hi> are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally designed as they grow ripe, and of strength of body to be made <hi>Janizaries</hi> in the place of the deceased; so that their principal educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in order thereunto, of whom we shall speak more largely when we treat of the Militia.</p>
               <p>The names of the <hi>Agiamoglans</hi> are written in a book with the places where they are distributed, their several Payes of two, three, or five Aspers a day, which book is under-written by the Grand Signior, and consigned to the <hi>Tefterdar</hi> or Lord Treasurer, who pays their Salaries every three months, being obliged at that time to enquire who is dead or removed, and so accordingly to make a true report to the Grand Signior.</p>
               <p>And thus I have given you a brief account of the Grand Signiors <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi> and the Regiment of it, which if well considered and weighed, is one of the most Politick constitutions in the world, and none of the meanest supports of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; which relation I had from the mouth of one who had spent nineteen years in the Schools of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> I must confess I have not treated so amply thereof as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject might require, because the rules and oeconomy observed among the Women, Mutes, Eunuchs and other of the retired apartments, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be a kind of digression from my purpose, my intention being principally to describe the Government, Maxims and Policies of the <hi>Turk.</hi> And therefore I proceed to treat of the diversities of Offices and Places of great Riches and Trust, which remain in the power of the <hi>Sultan</hi> to confer on those Favourites, Minions, and Creatures, whom thus at his own charge he hath nourished like a Father from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <head>The Prime Vizier</head>
               </figure>
               <p>THe prime Visier called in <hi>Turkish</hi> Visier <hi>Azem,</hi> is as much as chief Councellour; he is somtimes termed the Grand Signiors Deputy or Representative, or <hi>Vicarius Imperii,</hi> because to him all the power of the <hi>Sultan</hi> is immediately devolved; there is no other solemnity, as I know of, in the creating a Visier then the delivery of the Grand Signiors Seal, which he alwayes carries about him in his bosom, on which is engraven the Emperours name, by which he becomes invested in all the power of the Empire, and can without the formality and process of Law remove all obstacles and impediments which hinder the free sway of his Government. It hath alwayes been the policy of the great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the East, to erect one as Superintendent over all the rest of their Ministers; so <hi>Daniel</hi> was constituted by <hi>Darius</hi> over the Presidents and<note place="margin">Dan. c. 6.</note> Princes, because of the admirable spirit and wisdom that was in him: and <hi>Joseph</hi> was made chief Governour and absolute Commander over all <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by this means those Princes who gave themselves much
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55345:29"/>
over to softness and luxury, could with more ease demand account of miscarriages in the rule of their Empire, it being their Policy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute one on whom all the blame of miscarriages in Government might be thrown.</p>
               <p>The first constitution that we meet with in History of the first Visier, was in the time of <hi>Amurath</hi> the third King of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who passing into <hi>Europe</hi> with his Tutor called <hi>Lala Schabin,</hi> he made him his chief Councellour and committed to him the charge of his Army, with which he won <hi>Adrianople</hi> formerly called <hi>Orestias,</hi> and ever since the Grand Signior hath continued to maintain that Office of Visier, using that common appellation of <hi>Lala,</hi> which signifies Tutor, whensoever in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar discourse he speaks to him.</p>
               <p>There are besides the first, commonly six other Visiers who are called Visiers of the Bench, that have no power nor authority in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but only are grave men, that have perhaps had Charges and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and are knowing in the Laws, and sit together with the first Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier in the <hi>Divan</hi> or Court where causes are tryed, but are mute and cannot give their sentence or opinion in any matter unless the first Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier please to demand their Councel or judgment in point of Law; which he seldom does, not to disparage his own reason and experience. Their pay proceeds from the Grand Signiors Treasury, and is not above 2000 Dollars a year: any of these six can write the Grand Signiors Firme or Autogra upon all commands or decrees that are sent abroad; and because their riches are but moderate, and the Office they are in treats not much with the dangerous parts of State, they live long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out envy or emulation, or being subject to that inconstancy of fortune and alteration, to which greater degrees of place are exposed. And yet when any great matter is in Consult, and of considerable impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, these six with the first Visier, the <hi>Mufti</hi> and <hi>Caddeelescheers</hi> or Lords chief Justices, are admitted into the Cabinet Councel, and are often permitted freedom to deliver their opinions on the matter of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p>The state and greatness the Prime Visier lives in is agreeable to the honour of him whom he represents, having commonly in his Court about 2000 Officers and Servants; when he appears in any solemnity or publick show, he carries on his Turbant before two Feathers, as the Grand Signior wears three set on with a handle of Diamonds and other rich Stones, and before him are carryed three horse tails called the tugh upon a long staffe, upon the top of which is a gilded knob; the like distinction of honour is permitted only to the three other principal <hi>Pashaes</hi> within their jurisdiction, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Pasha</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> and of <hi>Buda;</hi> the other inferiour <hi>Pashaes</hi> have only one horse tail carryed before them without other distinction or badge of Authority; and these three forementioned <hi>Pashaes</hi> have a right to be Visiers of the Bench, and can take their places in the <hi>Divan</hi> when the time of their Offices are expired, and any of them found at the Court in entire grace and favour.</p>
               <p>The Prime Visier as he is the representative of the Grand Signior, so he is the head or mouth of the Law; to him appeals may be made, and any one may decline the ordinary course of justice, to have his case decided by his determination; unless the Visier through the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55345:29"/>
of his affairs, and the small consideration of the case, thinks fit to refer it to the Law. And that he may evidence his care of the publick good, he is alwayes present at the <hi>Divan</hi> four times a week; that is, <hi>Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,</hi> and the other dayes (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting <hi>Friday</hi>) keeps <hi>Divan</hi> in his own house, so diligent and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are these men to discharge the Acts of Justice, and their own Office.</p>
               <p>He is attended to the <hi>Divan,</hi> which is a Chamber of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> by a great number of <hi>Chiauses</hi> and their Commanders in chief, who are a sort of Pursevants and other Officers who only serve to attend him to the <hi>Divan</hi> called <hi>Muta faraca,</hi> and may be termed Serjeants or Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staffes; as he descends from his horse and enters the <hi>Divan,</hi> or upon his return goes into his house, he is with a loud voice of his Attendants prayed for, and wished all happiness and long life, not unlike the salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers used to their Emperours; <hi>Cum sub auspiciis Caesaris omnia prospera &amp; felicia precabantur.</hi> When he is set upon the Bench, all causes are brought before the <hi>Caddeelescheer</hi> who is Lord chief Justice, and by him all judgments pass, unless the Prime Visier shall think the cause proper for his cognisance, or shall disapprove at any time the sentence of the judge; and then by virtue of his unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted power he can reverse the Verdict and determine as he pleases. All officers in the <hi>Divan</hi> wear a strange sort of dress upon their heads called in <hi>Turkish Mugevezee,</hi> which for the most lively description, is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated before you.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:55345:30"/>
And this shall in short serve for what is necessary to speak of the <hi>Divan</hi> in this place, in regard we only touch upon it for the better explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Visiers office.</p>
               <p>The Prime Visier hath his power as ample as his Master who gives it him, except only that he cannot (though he is the Elder Brother of all <hi>Pashaes</hi>) take off any of their heads without the Imperial signature or immediate hand-writing of the Grand Signior, nor can he punish a <hi>Spahee</hi> or <hi>Janizary,</hi> or any other Souldier but by means of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders: the Militia having reserved themselves that priviledge, which secures them from several oppressions: in other matters he is wholly absolute, and hath so great a power with the Grand Signior, that whomsoever he shall think fit of all the Officers in the Empire to proscribe, he can speedily obtain the Imperial hand to put it in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever petitions and addresses are made, in what business so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ought first to pass through the hands of the Visier: but yet when a party hath suffered some notorious injury, in which the Visier is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined, or hath refused him justice, he hath liberty then to appeal to the Grand Signior himself, which is permitted by an ancient custom; the aggrieved person putting fire on his head enters the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> runs in haste, and can be stopt by no body until he comes to the presence of the Grand Signior, to whom he hath license to declare his wrong. The like was done by Sir <hi>Thomas Bendysh</hi> when Embassadour at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> putting pots of fire at the Yard arms of some English Ships then in Port, and came to Anchor near the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> The reason thereof was, the violent seizure of the Merchants goods, as soon as arrived in Port, for the service of the Grand Signior, without bargain or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, which being taken up by those Officers and great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who were out of the reach of Law, forced the worthy Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour at that time Resident to represent his grievances with much reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, signifying them to the Grand Signior by fire on the Yards of eleven English Ships then in Port, which were drawn off from the scale, where they usually lay, to the side of the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> which coming to be discovered first to the Visier, before the grand Signior had notice thereof, he immediately extinguished those fires by a fair accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before they burst into a more dangerous flame, by the knowledge of the Grand Signior, who might justly destroy him for suffering such notorious injustice to run to that publick and known extremity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> in like cases put on a Vest of White Paper, signifying the aggravation of their injury is not to be described in as much Paper as can cover their bodies.</p>
               <p>This great Office of Charge and Trust, as it is the highest, so it is the nearest to <hi>Joves</hi> Thunderbolt, and most exposed to envy and emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; strange stories are read and confirmed by eye-witnesses in our dayes, concerning the unexpected rise and ascent of unworthy men on a suddain without degrees, steps or approaches to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For either the Prince delights to exercise his power in debasing some, and advancing others, or hath bestowed so largely, that his bounty is at a stop, and begins to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with heaping of favours, as the other is glutted and satiated with receiving them; <hi>Fato potentiae raro sempiternae, an satias capit aut illos cum omnia tribuerunt, aut hos quod nihil reliquum est quod capiant.</hi> Tac. Lib. 3.

               </p>
               <p>But it doth not alwaies happen that the Prime Visier because he is deprived of his Office, should therefore lose his life; for many times, especially if he be a man whose disposition is not greatly suspected of Malice or Revenge to the contrivers of his fall, or be not of a generous spirit, and great abilities and popularity, whereby he may he venterous and capable of raising Rebellion or Mutiny, he is permitted calmly to retire, and quietly to descend from his high Throne of honour, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the lower Region and air of a small and petty Government of a <hi>Pasha;</hi> as not many years past the Predecessours of <hi>Kiuperli</hi> Father of this present Visier being degraded, had the <hi>Pashalick</hi> of <hi>Kanisia</hi> (which is accounted one of the meanest of all the Governments which are subject to a <hi>Pasha</hi>) conferred on him, and here I cannot tell whether such a Visier hath not more reason to bless and congratulate his fortune then accuse it; for in this condition he is more free from cares and dangers, and much more happy if his ambition and greatness of spirit render not his repose and ease less pleasing, because it is not in the highest Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Honour and Command. But it is seldom so among the <hi>Turks;</hi> for with them it is esteemed no disgrace to be transplanted from the Mountains to the Vallies; they know their original, and composition partakes not much of Heavenly fire, and that the Clay they are framed of, is but of common Earth, which is in the hand of the Grand Signior as the Pot, to frame and mould, as is most agreeable to his pleasure and will. And as it is no disparagement to decline and go backward in Honour amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> so it is no new thing, or absurdity in their Politicks, to see men rise like Mushromes in a night, and from the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55345:31"/>
meanest and most abject Offices, without degrees or convenient ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, at once leap into the Seat and Quality of the Prime Visier; I shall instance in one example worthy of Record, which was of late dayes, and as yet that I know of, hath had no place in History. It happened that in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> there was either great scarcity of flesh, or the negligence of the Butchers had made it so; so that they who were not so early abroad as to watch their usual time of making their dayes provision, or came any thing late, were necessitated to pass that day with a Lenten diet; among those who had missed one morning their common proportion of flesh, was one <hi>Dervise</hi> a Cook of a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Janizaries;</hi> this man knew the blows and punishment he was to suffer from the chief of the Chamber; that through his sloth and want of care, the whole Company should that day pass without their Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which caused him in great passion with loud exclamations as he passed the streets to accuse the ill Government, and little care was had to rectifie these common abuses: it fortuned that at that time that <hi>Dervise</hi> was lamenting his case to all the world, and cursing the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Officers, that the Grand Signior in disguise passed by, and seeing a man in such a disorder of mind, came in a courteous manner to demand the reason of his passion; to whom the <hi>Dervise</hi> replyed, <hi>It was in vain for him to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But it happened quite contrary, for the Grand Signior encouraging him to lay aside his fear, told him <hi>he was resolved to make him first Vister, to try an Experiment whether he was able to amend those abuses he complained of;</hi> and that herein he might not transgress the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees whereby he was gradually to pass, he first made him chief of his Chamber, the next day Captain, the day following <hi>Aga</hi> or General of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and thence with one step to be Great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

of the like nature are frequent among the <hi>Turks,</hi> yet this may serve at present to shew in part the fortune and fate by which men are raised, and the unconstancy of greatness and glory amongst the <hi>Turks</hi> above any other part of the world besides.</p>
               <p>It was a hard Problem in the <hi>Turkish Policy,</hi> which as a wise Prime Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier proposed to certain <hi>Pashaes</hi> amongst other questions, What courses were possible to be found out for a first Visier to maintain and continue his office, and acquit this so dangerous charge from the hazard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty to which it is liable; for you see Brothers, said he, how few enjoy or grow old herein; their virtue, their care, and their innocence are no protection; some remain a day, a week, a month, others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the thred to a year or two, but at length they are (to use our own Proverb) like the <hi>Ant</hi> to whom God gives wings for their speedier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. The <hi>Pashaes</hi> were for a while all silent, not knowing what reply to make, or how to resolve so difficult and knotty a point, until <hi>Kuperli</hi> (who was then the most ancient and perhaps the wisest <hi>Pasha,</hi> as the actions of his following life have sufficiently testified) first reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that in his opinion, the only and most probable means for a tottering Visier to secure himself, is to divert the minds of the Grand Signior and other working brains, upon some forreign War; for Peace is that which corrupts the dispositions of men, and sets them on work to raise themselves with intestine and civil evils; when War busies their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and employes them to gain renown and glory by Martial actions, by which means Plots and Treachery are droven from our own homes; <hi>Consiliis &amp; astu res externas moliri, arma <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>And yet for all this doubtful estate of the Prime Visiers, some have been known to manage this office 18 or 19 years, and afterwards wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with care and pains, to acquit it by a natural death; from whence this question may arise, whether the favour or displeasure of the Prince depends on the destiny or fortune we are born to, or whether humane Councel can assign a way between contumaciousness and flattery, wherein to steer free from danger and ambition? <hi>Unde dubitare cogor, fato &amp; sorte nasoendi, ut caetera, ita Principum inclinatio in hos, offensio in illos, an sit aliquid in nostris consiliis, liceat<expan>

For no <hi>Bassaw</hi> or Minister of trust enters his place without his Present and offering to the first Visier, to obtain his consent, and purchase a continuance of his favour. Those that have Governments abroad, have alwaies their Agents at Court, who with gifts continually mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie the Visiers mind, entreating him to represent their service to the Grand Signior in an acceptable and grateful manner. And though at the Equinoctial in the Spring, all <hi>Pashaes</hi> and any that have Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of note, are obliged to make their Presents to the Grand Signior of considerable value, at which time the first Visier neither will not want his own acknowledgments, he is yet farther treated by all Perfons with sums of money, as the nature of their business is, which is not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, but boldly and confidently demanded, and the bargain beaten as in matters of Merchandize, and Trade; and justice and Favours made as Vendible and set as publick to sale, as Wares and Commodites are in the Shops and places of common Mart; so that if the first Visier proves covetous (as commonly they do who are raised from nothing, and used alwaies to thrist) and resolves to lose nothing of what he may get, his income is incredible, and may equal that which is the Rent of the Grand Signior, and in a few years amasse an immense riches and wealth. But of this the Prince and the <hi>Turkish</hi> Policy is not ignorant, and accordingly provides remedies to drain the inundations of the Visiers Coffers; at first by extorting great sums of money from him at his entrance to the charge; then under colour of Friendship and Favour the Grand Signior makes him Visits, in requital whereof rich Presents are made him, as Gratitude for so much Honour; next he many times sends to him for a gift of 100000 Dollars, for Jewels, Horses and other things of a great value; and in this manner several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances are used to turn these Rivulets to pay their Tribute to the great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But the ways and means by which the Grand Signior comes in the end to be possessed of the gains and profits collected by his Visier, and other officers, requires a particular discourse apart, which shall in its due time and place be treated of; and this shall for the present suffice to have spoken concerning the Prime Visier and his office.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> The Offices, Dignities, and several Governments of the Empire.</head>
               <p>HE that will describe the Policies of a Country, must endeavour especially in the most exact and punctual manner possible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the several Offices, Dignities and Riches of it, that so a more easie computation may be calculated of its strength, numbers of Men, Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, Forces by Sea, where best defended, and where most easily vulnerable and exposed.</p>
               <p>The next to the Visier <hi>Azem</hi> or the first Visier, are the several <hi>Begler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begs</hi> (which may not unaptly be compared to Arch-Dukes in some parts of Christendom) having under their jurisdiction many <hi>Sangiacks</hi> or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, <hi>Beyes, Agaes</hi> and others; To every one of these the Grand Signior in honour bestows three Ensigns (called in Turkish <hi>Tugh</hi>) which are staves trimmed with the tail of a Horse with a golden Ball upon the top, and this is to distinguish them from <hi>Bashaws</hi> who have two Ensigns; and the <hi>Sangiak-beg,</hi> who hath also the name of <hi>Pascha,</hi> and hath but one. When a <hi>Pascha</hi> is made, the Solemnity used at the conferring his office, is a Flag or Banner carryed before him, and accompanied with Musick and Songs by the <hi>Mirialem,</hi> who is an Officer for this purpose only, for investiture of <hi>Pashaes</hi> in their office.</p>
               <p>The Government of <hi>Beglerbegs,</hi> who have several Provinces called <hi>Sangiacks</hi> under their Command, are of two sorts; the first is called <hi>Has ile Beglerbeglik,</hi> which hath a certain Rent assigned out of the Cities, Countries and Signories allotted to the Principality; the second is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Saliane Beglerbeglik,</hi> for maintenance of which is annexed a certain Salary or Rent, collected by the Grand Signiors Officers with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the whole Government, out of which are paid also the <hi>Sangiack Beglers,</hi> that is, the Lords of the several Counties, Towns or Cities, and the Militia of the Country.</p>
               <p>It is impossible exactly to describe the Wealth and wayes of Gains exercised by these Potent Governours to enrich themselves; for a <hi>Turk</hi> is ingenious to get Wealth, and hasty to grow rich; howsoever we will succinctly set down the certain sums of Revenue which are granted them by Commission from the Grand Signior, assigned them out of every particular place of their Government; besides which they have the Profits of all Wests and Strays, Goods of Felons, sale of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Church-Offices, Salves, Horses and Cattel, which by Mortality or other accidents have no certain Master; to which may be added the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their <hi>Avanias</hi> or false Accusations, whereby they invade the Right and Estates of their Subjects; as also of the Robberies of their people and strangers, by their own Slaves and Servants, whom they send abroad with that design; and having committed the Robberies themselves, under pretence of discovery of the Crime and doing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, they seize the innocent people, torture and imprison them, and perhaps put some to death for expiation of their own offences. To come nearer then to this purpose. The <hi>Beglerbegs</hi> of the first sort are in number 22, who have their Revenue allotted them in the places that they govern, collected by their own Officers according to Commission,

               </p>
               <p>The use of the particular Catalogue fore-going, is to demonstrate the greatness and power of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, which hath so many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Governments and Principalities in its possession, wherewith to encourage and excite the endeavours of Heroick spirits to an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of great and noble Enterprises, whereby to merit the Rewards which remain in the power of the <hi>Sultan</hi> to gratifie them with. And also to help in the just computation of the number of men the <hi>Turk</hi> can bring into the Field, every <hi>Pascha</hi> being obliged for every 5000 Aspers Rent to bring a Souldier to the War: though notwithstanding, they often appear for Ostentation and gain of the Grand Signiors favour with more men then their due complement; as in the last War with <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> of <hi>Romania</hi> brought 10000 effective men into the Field.</p>
               <p>Of these <hi>Beglerbegs</hi> five have the Title of Visiers, which signifies as much as Councellor, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Paschas</hi> of <hi>Anatolia, Babylon, Cairo, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania,</hi> and <hi>Buda;</hi> which are charges of the greatest riches, power, and fame; the others have their pre-eminence, rank, or order according to the Priority of Conquest, and Antiquity in the possession of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are all the great Governments of the Empire, in whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective jurisdictions are alwaies three principal Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> the <hi>Reis Efendi,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Reis Kitab,</hi> which is Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour or Secretary of State, or rather those two offices united into one; and the third is <hi>Tefterdar Pashaw,</hi> or Lord Treasurer. These three officers are near Councellors and attendants on their <hi>

               <p>Of the <hi>Mufti</hi> we shall speak in due place. The <hi>Reis Efendi,</hi> which signifies chief of the Writers or Book-men; (for the <hi>Turks</hi> call alwaies men of the Law, and Professors of the Pen, and Parochial Priests by the Title of <hi>Efendi</hi>) is alwaies present and attending on the Visier, for passing Orders, Decrees, Patents and Commissions into all parts of the Empire; which are daily dispatched in those numbers into all places, as is incredible; for the <hi>Turks</hi> governing more by their Arbitrary power, and according to the exigences of affairs, then by a set rule, or form, every business requires its distinct order; and the very Courts of Justice are moderated according to the commands and directions
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55345:35"/>
they receive from above; by which means the <hi>Reis Efendi's</hi> hand are filled with such a multitude of business, as employs great numbers of Writers; and consequently brings in riches flowing to his Coffers; some in which Office, who by their parts, industry, and courage have gained authority and respect, have amassed wealth, which might compare with the riches and treasure of Princes: We shall here instance in one of late years, famous in <hi>Turky</hi> for his knowledge and riches, called <hi>Samozade;</hi> one who had piled those heaps of all things that were rich and curious, as wear too tedious and long to insert in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue in this place. It may suffice, that being executed in the time of the last Wars against the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> for some conspiracy against the Great Visier, such a Treasure was found appertaining to him (all which was confiscated to the Grand Signior) as was sufficient to have enriched and raised his Prince, had he been impoverished, and in a declining condition.</p>
               <p>The other Great Officer, is the <hi>Tefterdar</hi> or Lord Treasurer, who receives the Revenue of the Grand Signior, and payes the Souldiery, and makes other publick disbursements; this Office is different from the Treasurer of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> (of whom we have already spoken) who attends to nothing else but the expences of the Court, and to gather in the accidental profits and presents paid to the Grand Signior; which is so considerable, that every <hi>Sultan</hi> (for the most part) amasses a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular treasure of his own, which after his death is inclosed in a certain Chamber, and shut with an Iron gate, and the Key-hole stopped with Lead, and over the Port is writ in Golden Letters, The Treasure of such a <hi>Sultan.</hi> And this shall suffice to have spoken of the Offices and Dignities of the Empire.</p>

               <p>But yet these people are esteemed as Brothers, or near allies with the <hi>Turk,</hi> to whom for want of heirs-male in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Line, the Empire is by ancient compact to desend; the expectation of which though afar off, and but almost imaginary, doth yet conserve the <hi>Tartar</hi> in as much observance to the <hi>Turk,</hi> as the hopes of an Estate doth a young <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Such of their slaves as in the journey are wounded and infirme, and not able to accompany the Camp, they kill; those which they bring safe into their own Country they sell to the <hi>Turks,</hi> who come thither to Trade for this Merchandize, which is the most profitable commodity that <hi>Tartary</hi> affords.

               <p>And as the men are nourished with a Diet of raw flesh, herbs and roots, or such as the Earth naturally produces without the concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Fire to prepare it for their stomachs; so also their Horses are of a hardy temperament, patient of hunger and cold, and in the sharp Winter of those Countries, when the ground is covered with Snow, nourish themselves with the Barks of Trees, and such herbage as they can find at the bottom of the deep Snow. Their Towns or Villages consist of huts rather then houses, or hurdles made of sticks and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a course hair Cloth; of which Villages there are accounted two hundred thousand, so that taking one man out of every Village (as their custom is when they go to the War) they speedily form an Army

of two hundred thousand fighting men. But now having carryed great riches out of <hi>Poland,</hi> and gained a considerable wealth by the Market of their slaves, some of them throw off their homely Plads to wear Sables, and some more frugal, employ their money for building Houses; the riotous and dissolute are addicted to strong Waters, and a drink called <hi>Boza</hi> made of a certain seed (which drank in a great quantity doth intoxicate, and is now much in use among the <hi>Turks</hi>) and give themselves up to a gluttony, as brutish as that which is natural unto Swine, having no art of sauces to provoke their appetite, but rest delighted with the meer contentment of idleness and a full stomach.</p>

But yet <hi>Transilvania</hi> is more tenderly and more honourably treated then the other two Provinces, their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute being much less, and their Princes chosen for the most part more regularly from the ancient Line, or at least from the honourable hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Boyars or Nobility, who have an affinity or alliance with the true blood of the former <hi>Vayvods.</hi> Their ancient tribute was only 6000 <hi>Zechins</hi> yearly, but afterwards were added 9000 more annually, for acknowledgement of certain Castles which <hi>Rogotzki</hi> had taken from <hi>Poland,</hi> which the <hi>Turk</hi> demanding to have resigned into his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, were for that sum redeemed, and still detained in the hands of the <hi>Transilvanians;</hi> over and above which they only pay 300 Dollars and two Silver bowls to the seven Visiers of the Bench: And this is all the acknowledgment they make to the <hi>Turk,</hi> who demonstrates more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect always to this Prince and his Messages, then those of the neighbour Provinces, by reason that that Country is not totally in his power (certain strong fortresses being in the hand of the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi>) for whose sake this people is more gently dealt with, lest too much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>This petty Republick hath always supported it self by submission, and addresses for favour and defence to divers powerful Princes, courting the favour of every one, never offering injuries, and when they receive them patiently support them; which is the cause the <hi>Italians</hi> call them <hi>le sette bandiere,</hi> or the seven Banners, signifying that for their being and maintenance of the name of a free Republick, they are contented to become slaves to all parts of the world.

These people in former times were great Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into the Western parts of the world; and it is said, that those vast <hi>Carracks</hi> called <hi>Argosies,</hi> which are so much famed for the vastness of their burthen and bulk, were corruptly so denominated from <hi>Ragosies,</hi> and from the name of this City, whose Port is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> The Desolation and Ruine which the <hi>Turks</hi> make of their own Countries in <hi>Asia,</hi> and the parts most remote from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Seat, esteemed one cause of the conservation of their Empire.</head>
               <p>THis position will appear a Paradox at first sight to most men who have read and considerd the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquest, whose jurisdiction and Dominions were far larger then this present Empire; and yet we do not finde that they so studiously endeavoured to dispeople, and lay waste the Nations they subdued; but rather encouraged industry in plantations, gave priviledges to Cities meanly stored, invited people to inhabit them, endeavoured to improve Countries rude and uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate with good Husbandry, and Maritine Towns with Traffick and Commerce; made Citizens of their confederates, and conferred on their conquered subjects oftentimes greater benefits then they could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect or hope for under their true and natural Princes; and certainly the <hi>Romans</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and were richer and more powerful by their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and therefore why the <hi>Turk</hi> might not proceed in the same manner, and yet with the same advantage, is worth our consideration.</p>
               <p>For the solution of which difficulty, it will be necessary to consider that these two Empires being compared, there will be found a vast difference <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the original, foundation, progress and maximes each of other. For the <hi>Romans</hi> built their City in peace, made Laws by which the arbitrary will of the Prince was corrected; and afterward as their Arms succeeded, and their Dominions were extended, they accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves often to present necessities and humours, and constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the people they had conquered, and accordingly made provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and used proper Arts to keep them in obedience; and next, by their generosity and wisdom won those Nations to admire and imitate their vertues, and to be contented in their subjection. But the <hi>Turks</hi> have but one sole means to maintain their Countries, which is the same by which they were gained, and that is the cruelty of the sword in the most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> way of execution, by killing, consuming and laying desolate the Countries, and transplanting the people unto parts where
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55345:41"/>
they are nearest under the command and age of a Governour; being wholly destitute and ignorant of other refined Arts, which more civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized. Nations have in part made serve in the place of violence. And yet the <hi>Turks</hi> have made this course alone answer to all the intents and ends of their Government.</p>
               <p>For the subjects of this Empire being governed better by Tyranny then Gentleness, it is necessary, that courses should be taken whereby these people may remain more within compass and reach of Authority; which they would hardly be, were every part of this Empire so well inhabited as to afford entertainment within the Fortifications of its vast Mountains and Woods, to the many unquiet and discontented spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that live in it. And this may be one cause, that so rarely Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions arise amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> though in the remotest parts of <hi>Asia;</hi> and when they do, are easily suppressed: This also is one cause, why Great men so easily resign themselves up to the will of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior to punishment and death, whether the sentence be according to Law, or only Arbitrary: this is the reason that fugitives and homicides cannot escape; for having no place for flight, neither the inhabited Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are immediately under the eye of a vigilant Commander will afford them refuge, nor can the desolate Countries entertain them; and Christendom is so abhorred by them, that they will never take it for their Sanctuary. And thus deprived of all means of safety, they whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attend to please and serve their Great Master, in whose favour and hands alone is the reward and punishment.</p>
               <p>Another advantage, and that not inconsiderable, that this manner of dispeopling the Country brings to this Empire, is the difficulty an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would finde in their March, should they with a Land-Army attempt to penetrate far into the Country; for without great quantities of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision they could not possibly be sustained; from the Country none can be expected; what little it affords, the Inhabitants will conceal or carry away, and leave all places as naked and barren of Food for man, as the Sea it self.</p>
               <p>And though it is known often, that in <hi>Asia</hi> the Troops of some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented <hi>Bei</hi> or <hi>Aga,</hi> to the number of three or four hundred men, in the summer-time having their retirements in the Woods and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, assault <hi>Caravans,</hi> and rob all Passengers from whom there is any hope of booty; yet in the Winter they are dispersed, because they have no quarters against the weather, nor Provisions for humane suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, every one shifting for himself in some place where his condition is the least known or suspected.</p>
               <p>And it may not be here from our purpose to admonish the Reader, that as the <hi>Turks</hi> account it one good part of their policy, to lay a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of their Empire desolate; so on the contrary, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in their new Conquests to fortifie, strengthen and confirm what they have gained, by numbers of people, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>HAving formerly entred into discourse of the several great Officers of State, it will be necessary to declare what care the <hi>Turks</hi> take to preserve the body of their Empire free of Faction and Rebellion; for there being many Provinces in the <hi>Sultans</hi> gift, which are remote, rich and powerful, and so administer temptation to the Governours to throw off the yoak of their dependance, and make themselves and their Posterity absolute; great care is taken to prevent this mischief by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Arts, none of which hath been more effectual amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> nor more sedulously practised, then the destruction of an ancient Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and admitting no succession to Offices or Riches, but only in the direct <hi>Ottoman</hi> Line, as my Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> says, <hi>Essay</hi> 14. <hi>A Monarchy where there is no Nobility at all, is ever pure and absolute Tyranny, as that of the</hi> Turks; <hi>for Nobility attempers Soveraignty, and draws the people somewhat aside from the Line Royal.</hi> By which means it comes to pass, that <hi>

from the <hi>Sultans</hi> anger; nor is it imaginable it can be otherwise; for these men are but strangers and forraigners in the Countries they ruled, have no relations there or kindred to second or revenge their quarrel, have no ancient bloud or possessions which might entitle their heirs to the succession, or out of affection or pity move their subjects to interest themselves in their behalf; but being cut off themselves, all falls with them, which affords the strangest spectacle, and example of fortunes unconstancy in the world; for a <hi>Turk</hi> is never reverenced but for his office, that is made the sole measure and rule of his greatness and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, without other considerations of Vertue or Nobility.

The Eunuch takes up his Slippers and lays them over the Door (which is a sign of his good reception) then he bows with all reverence before her to the ground, and retires a few paces back, making some brief Oration to her full of Complement and Admiration of her Worth and Honour; and remaining afterwards a while silent, in an humble posture, bowing forward with his hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, until the <hi>Soltana</hi> commands him to bring her water, which he readily obeys, taking a Pot of water provided for that purpose, and kneeling before her, delivers it to her hand; then she takes off her red veil from before her face, embroidered with Gold and Silver Flowers, and so drinks; in the mean time her Serving-maids bring in a low Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, on which are set a pair of Pigeons roasted, and a plate of Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candy; the Bridegroom then invites his coy Spouse to the Collation, which she refuses until other Presents are brought her, which lie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the outward room; with which her modesty being overcome and her stomach brought down, she is perswaded to the Table, and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down, receives a Leg of a Pigeon from the hand of her Bridegroom; tasts a little, and then puts a piece of the Sugar-candy into his mouth; and so rising up returns to her place; all the Attendants then retire and leave the Bridegroom alone with his <hi>Soltana</hi> for the space of an hour to court her singly; that time being past, the Musick sounding, he is invited forth by his Friends to an outward room, where having passed most of the night with songs and sports, at the approach of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the <hi>Soltana</hi> weary of her pastime retires to her bed, which is rich adorned and perfumed, fit to entertain Nuptial Joyes: The Bridegroom advised hereof by the nod of the Eunuch, creeps silently into the Bride-chamber, where stripping himself of his upper Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he kneels a while at the feet of the Bed, and then by little and little turning up the Cloaths, gently rubs her feet with his hand, and kissing of them, ascends higher to the embraces of his Spouse, which she willingly admits him to, and wishes her self and him a happy Bedding: in the morning betimes the Bridegroom is called by his Friends to the Bath; at whose call a rising, he is presented by the Bride with all sorts of Linnen to be used in Bathing; after these Ceremonies are past, they are better acquainted, yet in publick she keeps him at a distance, wears her Haniarre or Dagger by her side in token of her Superiority; and so frequently commands gifts and riches from him, until she hath exhausted him to the bottom of all his wealth. Nor is this esteemed sufficient to mortifie these poor slaves by a Womans Tyranny, but they are always put forward upon desperate attempts, as lately <hi>Ishmael Pashaw,</hi> who was killed passing the River <hi>Raab,</hi> in the overthrow given the <hi>Turks</hi> by the Emperors Forces under <hi>Montecuculi;</hi> and others I could name in the like manner; lest the honour of their Marriage in the Royal Family without the crosses and mortifications which attend it, should puff them up with the ambition and proud thoughts, which is not lawful for them to imagine.</p>

               <p>Nor hath hereditary succession and long continuance in authority been only avoided amongst the <hi>Turks;</hi> but we finde that the <hi>Romans</hi> often changed their Governours, and never suffered them to continue long in one Province; and so the King of <hi>Spain</hi> doth at present in the Government of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the <hi>Indies,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> and other parts, the space of three years being commonly allotted them for their residence. But amongst the <hi>Turks</hi> there is no fixed term of time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to their <hi>Pashaws,</hi> but only they remain as Tenants at Will of the Grand Signior; who according to his pleasure, and as he sees reason cuts them off, recals them, or transplants them to another Province; only the <hi>Pashaw</hi> of Grand <hi>Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> hath a certain space of three years appointed, to which his Government is confined; and there may be very good reason for it; for it being a place of great trust, riches and power, in which <hi>Pashaws</hi> grow in a short time vastly wealthy, it cannot be wisdom to continue them long there; the revenue of which we have had occasion already to discourse of.

The story of <hi>Selymus</hi> and <hi>Bajazet,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, is a perfect experiment of the feud and dissention which is bred in the desires of barbarous Princes; so that when they arrive to any maturity of age, they are always transplanted to different <hi>Seraglios</hi> abroad, where they keep their Courts distinct, and cannot enter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Walls of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> during the life of their Father, lest by interview with each other, their minds should be moved with emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or inhabiting in the imperial City, should be provided with means before their time to attempt the Throne of their Father. And for this very reason the Grand Signior hath scarce performed the ceremonies of his inauguration before he hath seasoned his entrance to his Throne with the bloud of his Brothers; which barbarous custom began in the time of <hi>Sultan Bajazet.</hi> But if the Brothers are but few, and the Grand Signior of a disposition more naturally inclined to clemency then cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, he secures them in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> under the tuition of Masters, and care of a faithful guard; differing nothing from imprisonment, but in the name, prohibiting them the society and conversation of all: and thus the two Brothers of this present <hi>Sultan Mahomet,</hi> live in as much obscurity and forgetfulness, as if they had never been born, or having past a private life, were departed to the place where all things are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
               <p>It is no great digression from our purpose here to take notice of two sorts of Government purely popular; the one hath already had his period, and the other is of late beginning, and at present flourishes; and those are the Common-wealths in <hi>Egypt</hi> under the <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> and the other in our days in the Dominions of <hi>Algier:</hi> The first not only deposed the whole Family of their Prince from having power in the Government, and from all succession, but also made it an immutable law, that the Sons of the <hi>Mamalukes</hi> might succeed their Fathers in the inheritance of their estates, as lands and goods, but could not assume the title or Government of a <hi>Mamaluke;</hi> nor not only so, but that all that were born in the <hi>Mahometan</hi> or <hi>Jewish</hi> Faith, were uncapable <hi>ipso facto</hi> of the Order of a <hi>Mamaluke;</hi> and only such preferred thereunto, who had been Sons of Christians and become Slaves, instructed and educated in the <hi>Mahometan</hi> superstition; or else men of maturer age, who having abjured God and their Country, were come thither to seek preferment in that Kingdom of darkness.

               <p>HE that is an eye-witness and strict observer of the various changes and chances in greatness, honours and riches of the <hi>Turks,</hi> hath a lively Embleme of contemplation before him, of the unconstancy and mutability of humane affairs; fortune so strangely sports with this people, that a Comedy or Tragedy on the Stage with all its Scenes, is scarce sooner opened and ended, then the fate of divers great men, who in the day-time being exhaled to high sublimity, by the powerful rayes of the <hi>Sultans</hi> favour, in the night fall, or vanish like a Meteor. The reason hereof, if duly considered, may be of great use as things stand here, that is, to the power of the Grand Signior; for in this constitution the health and benefit of the Emperour is consulted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the welfare of the people: And the power of the Emperour is in no action more exercised and evidenced, then by withdrawing and conferring his favours; for by these means, having many whom he hath educated and prepared for offices, and stand candidates to receive them, his power would seem to be at a <hi>Nonplus,</hi> and appear like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate Father, who had spent more mony in the breeding of his Sons, then the Patrimony amounted to he had to bestow upon them: and therefore the Grand Signior to imitate the Sun, benights some parts of the world to enlighten others, that so by a general influence and communication of his Beams, he may be acknowledged the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Parent of them all.</p>
               <p>And this course doth not only evidence the power of the Grand Signior, but likewise increases it; for none are advanced in these times to office, but pay the Grand Signior vast sums of mony for it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the riches and expectations of profit from the charge; some pay, as the <hi>Pashaws</hi> of Grand <hi>Cairo</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> 3 or 4 hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Dollars upon passing the Commission; others one, others two hundred thousand, some fifty thousand, as their places are more or less considerable: and this mony is most commonly taken up at Interest, at 40 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And in times of the best Emperours, when vertue and deserts were considered, and the Empire flourished and encreased, men had offices conferred for their merits, and good services were rewarded freely and with bounty, without sums of money and payments to be a foyl to the lustre of their better parts: But now it is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and all matters run out of course; a manifest token in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the declension and decay of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, as <hi>Livy</hi> saith; <hi>Omnia prospera sequentibus Deos, adversa autem spernentibus.</hi> Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in part this serves the great end of the Empire; for <hi>Pashaws</hi> and great men having a kind of a necessity upon them to oppress their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the people thereby lose their courages; and by continual Taxes and seisures on what they gain, poverty subdues their spirits, and makes them more patiently suffer all kind of injustice and violence that can be offered them, without thoughts or motion to Rebellion; and so the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> says in his <hi>Essayes,</hi> that it is impossible for a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">Essay 29.</note> overladen with Taxes, ever to become Martial or Valiant; for no Nation can be the Lyons Whelp, and the Ass between burthens: by which means the <hi>Turk</hi> preserves so many different sort of people as lie hath conquered in due obedience, using no other help then a severe hand joyned to all kind of oppression; but such as are <hi>Turks,</hi> and bear any name of office or degree in the service of the Empire, feel but part of this oppression, and live with all freedom, having their spirits raised by a license they attain to insult over others that dare not resist them.</p>
               <p>But the issue and conclusion of the spoils these great men make on subjects is very remarkable; for as if God were pleased to evidence his just punishment more evidently and plainly here, then in other sins; scarce any of all those <hi>Pashaws</hi> who have made haste to be rich, have escaped the Grand Signiors hands, but he either wholly devests them of all, or will share the best part of the prey with them. Amongst which I have observed none passes so hardly as the <hi>Pashaws</hi> of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> because it is the richest and most powerful of all the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Empire; and so either in his journey home, or after his return, he loses his life by publick command, or at least is rifled of his goods as ill-got, which are condemned to the Grand Signiors treasury: And it is strange to see yet with what heat these men labour to amass riches, which they know by often experiences have proved but col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections for their Master; and only the Odium and Curses which the oppressed wretches have vented against their Rapine, remain to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; <hi>rebus secundis avidi, adversis autem incauti, Tac.</hi> And this is like the policy that <hi>Caesar Borgia</hi> used, otherwise called <hi>il Duca Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> who the better to reduce <hi>Romagna,</hi> lately subdued to obedience, made one <hi>Messer Romiro d'Orco</hi> his Deputy, a man of a cruel and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical disposition, who by rigour and force reduced affairs to the will and order of his Prince: and the work now done, and the people remaining extraordinary discontented, the Duke thought it time to purge the minds of his people of the ill apprehension they had of his Government, by demonstrating that the former hard usage proceeded from the bad inclination of his Minister; commanded the same <hi>Romiro d'Orco</hi> at <hi>Cesenna,</hi> to be cut in pieces, and exposed to the publick view of the people, with a piece of wood, and a bloudy knife by his side.

               <p>And to make more room for the multitude of officers who crowd for Preferments, and to act the cruel Edicts of the Empire with the least noise; oftentimes when a great Personage is removed from his place of Trust, and sent with a new Commission to the charge perhaps of a greater Government; and though he depart from the Regal Seat with all fair demonstrations of favour, before he hath advanced three days in his journey, triumphing in the multitude of his Servants, and his late hopes, the fatal command overtakes him; and without any accusation or cause other then the will of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> he is barbarously put to death, and his body thrown into the dirt of a Forreign and unknown Country, without solemnity of Funeral or Monument; that he is no sooner in the Grave, then his Memory is forgotten. And this methinks is somewhat agreeable to the crafty policy of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who sometimes would Commissionate men for Government of Provinces, to whom before-hand he had designed not to permit license to depart the City; <hi>Postremò eò provect us est, ut mandaverit quibusdam provincias quos e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredi urbe non erat passurus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence are apparent the causes of the decay of Arts amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> of the neglect, want of care in manuring and cultivating their Lands; why their Houses and private Buildings are made slight, not durable for more then ten or twenty years; why you finde no delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Orchards and pleasant Gardens and Plantations; and why in those Countries where Nature hath contributed so much on her part, there are no additional labours of Art to complete all, and turn it to a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; for men knowing no certain heir, nor who shall succeed them in their labours, contrive only for a few years enjoyment. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, men are fearful of shewing too much ostentation or magnificence in their Palaces, or ingenuity in the pleasures of their Gardens, lest they should bring on them the same fate, that <hi>Nabals</hi> Vineyard occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned to his Master: and therefore men neglect all application to the Studies of Arts and Sciences, but only such as are necessary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the meer course of living; for the very fear and crime of being known to be rich, makes them appear outwardly poor, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come naturally Stoicks and Philosophers in all the points of a reserved and cautious life. And here I am at a stand, and cannot conclude this

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> The several Arts the <hi>Turks</hi> use to encrease their People, is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Policy, without which the greatness of their Empire can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not continue nor be encreased.</head>
               <p>THere was never any people that laid Foundations and Designs of a great Empire, but first thought how to make it populous, and by which means they might best supply them with people; not only suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the sacrifice and slaughter of the War, but for the Plantation of Colonies, Possession and security of what the Sword hath conquered. We never understood how one people alone that was Martial, and by successes in War had framed a large Empire, was able from the meer original of its own Stock, to abound with issue of natural subjects, to bear proportion with the stronger Nations; nor how a handful of people with the greatest policy and courage in the world was able to embrace a large extent of Dominion and Empire: It is true, that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> did with an Army, for the most part, composed of <hi>Macedonians,</hi> as it were in a rank make a Conquest of the best part of the Eastern world; but this Empire, like a Ship that had much Sail and no Ballast, or a fair Tree over-charged with boughs too heavy for its stem, became a windsal on a sndden.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> therefore, during the continuance of their Empire, have not been ignorant of this Truth; for no people in the world have ever been more open to receive all sorts of Nations to them, then they, nor have used more arts to encrease the number of those that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Turks;</hi> and it is strange to consider, that from all parts of the world, some of the most dissolute and desperate in wickedness, should flock to these Dominions, to become members and professors of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> superstition; in that manner that at present, the bloud of the <hi>Turks</hi> is so mixed with that of all sorts of Languages and Nations, that none of them can derive his lineage from the ancient bloud of the <hi>Saracens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> who well knew the benefit of receiving strangers into their bosome, called this freedom they gave <hi>Jus civitatis,</hi> whereby forreigners became as lawful possessors of Estates and Inheritance, and had as much right to the common priviledges, as any that was born in the Walls of <hi>Rome;</hi> and this <hi>Jus civitatis</hi> was given to whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; so that as Sir <hi>F.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55345:47"/>
for they joyning with it a point of Religion, not only the proffers of the goods of this world, but also of delights in the world to come, make the allurements and arguments the more prevalent; and it being an opinion amongst them, as over all the world, that it is a meritorious work to create Proselytes, scarce any who hath money to purchase a slave, but will procure one young and fit for any impression, whom he may name his Convert, and gain reputation amongst his neighbours of having added to the number of the faithful: Of all this number, which yearly are added to the Professors of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> none can retreat on lower terms then Death and Martyrdom for Christ; which causes many whose consciences, though touched with a sense of the denial of their Saviour, yet having not the grace or courage to assert their faith on so hard a Lesson, grow desperate or careless, and dye in their sin. This sort of people become really <hi>Turks,</hi> and some through custom and their own lusts, are really perswaded of the truth of this profession, and have proved more inveterate and fatal enemies to Christianity, then the natural <hi>Turks;</hi> which will appear, if we consider that all the successes they have had, and exploits they have done at Sea, have been performed by such who have denyed the Christian Faith, as namely <hi>Chigal, Ogli,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>It was the custom formerly amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> every five years to take away the Christians Children, and Educate them in the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> superstition; by which means they encreased their own people, and diminished and enfeebled the force of the Christians; but now that custom in a great part is grown out of use, through the abundance of <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Jews,</hi> and all Nations where the Iron Rod of the <hi>Turks</hi> Tyranny extends, who flock in to enjoy the imaginary honour and priviledge of a <hi>Turk.</hi> And indeed it is no wonder to humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that considers the oppression and contempt that poor Christians are exposed to, and the ignorance in their Churches, occasioned through poverty in the Clergy, that many should be found who retreat from the Faith; but it is rather a Miracle, and a true verification of those words of Christ, <hi>That the Gates of Hell shall not be able to prevail against his Church,</hi> that there is conserved still amidst so much opposition, and in despight of all Tyranny and Arts contrived against it, an open and publick Profession of the Christian Faith; which next to Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, considering the stupid ignorance in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Churches, the conservation of their Faith is not to be attributed to any instance more, then to the strict observation of the Feasts and Fasts of their Churches; for having rarely the helps of Catechism or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, they learn yet from these outward Ceremonies some confused No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Precepts of Religion, and exercise with severity and rigour this sort of Devotion, when through custom, confusion and scarcity of knowing guides, all other service is become obsolete and forgotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have another extraordinary supply of people from the Black Sea, sent them in by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who with their light bodies of Horse make incursions into the Territories of the neighbouring Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and carry with them a booty of whole Cities and Countries of people, most of which they send to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to be sold, and is the chief Trade and Commodity of their Country (as we have already
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55345:47"/>
discoursed.) It is sad to see what numbers of <hi>Saykes,</hi> or <hi>Turkish</hi> vessels, come sailing through the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> fraighted with poor Christian Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of both Sexes, and all Ages, carrying on the Main-top a Flag, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a Note of Triumph, or else as a Mark of the Ware and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise they carry. The number of the Slaves brought yearly to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> is uncertain; for sometimes it is more, and sometimes less, according to the Wars and success of the <hi>Tartars;</hi> but as it is apparent in the Registers of the customs at <hi>Constantinople</hi> only, one year with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother at the least 20000 are yearly imported; amongst which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part being Women and Children, with easie perswasions, and fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises become <hi>Turks;</hi> the men being ignorant, and generally of the <hi>Russian</hi> or <hi>Moscovite</hi> Nation (who are reported not to be over-devout, or of famed constancy and perseverance in Religion) partly by mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and fear, partly by good words and allurements of reward, despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of liberty, and return to their own Country, renounce all interest in the Christian Faith. Of this sort of Mettle most of the <hi>Turks</hi> are in these days composed, and by the fecundity of this generation, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of this Empire flow; for the <hi>Turks</hi> of themselves, though they have the liberty of <hi>Polygame,</hi> and freer use of divers Women allowed them by their Law, then the severity of Christian Religion doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, are yet observed to be less fruitful in Children, then those who confine themselves to the chaste embraces of one Wife. It is true, we have heard how in former times there have been particular men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> that have severally been Fathers to a hundred Sons; but now through that abominable vice of <hi>Sodomie,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> pretend to have learned from the <hi>Italians,</hi> and is now the common and profesled shame of that people, few fecundious Families are found amongst them; especially amongst the Persons of the greater Quality, who have means and time to act and contrive their filthiness with the most deformity. And in this manner, the natural use of the Women being neglected amongst them, and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Men burning in</hi>

                  <hi>lust one towards another;</hi> so little is mankind propagated, that many think, were it not for the abundant supplies of Slaves, which daily come from the Black Sea (as before we have declared) considering the Summer-slaughters of the Plague, and destructions of War, the <hi>Turk</hi> would have little cause to boast of the vast numbers of his people: and that a principal means to begin the ruine of this Empire, were to prevent the taking of so many Captives, or intercept those numbers of Slaves which are daily transported to nourish and feed the body of this great <hi>Babylon;</hi> by which means in time they would not only find a want of Servants, but a decay and scarcity of Masters; since as it is before mentioned, these Slaves becoming <hi>Turks,</hi> are capable of all priviledges, and being commonly Manumised by their Patrons, through the help of Fortune, arrive equally to Preferments with those who are of the ancient <hi>Mahometane</hi> Race: this is the true reason, the <hi>Turk</hi> can spend so many people in his Wars, and values not the lives of ten thousand men to win him but a span of ground, and yet almost without any sensible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of his people; and on the contrary, the invention of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, and the distinction between <hi>Christianos vieios,</hi> and <hi>Nuevos</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> have caused that decay and scarcity of people in those Countries, as hath laid the best part of those fruitful Soyls

desolate, and forced them both to a necessity of entertaining a mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Souldiery.</p>
               <p>It is no small inducement to the vulgar people, who is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly won with outward allurements, to become <hi>Turks;</hi> that when they are so, by a white Turbant, or such a particular Note of honour, they shall be distinguished from other like Sects (all people amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> being known by their heads, of what Religion or Quality they are) and so may the better be directed where they may have a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to Domineer and injure with the most impunity. If we consider how delightful the Mode is in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> especially to those that are of a vain and gay humor, and that nothing seems handsome or comely, but what is dressed in the fashion and air of the times; we shall not wonder, if the ignorant and vain amongst Christians, born and Educated in those Countries, should be catched and entrapt with the fancy and enticement of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Mode, and be contented to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoil themselves of the garment of Christian vertues, to assume a dress more Courtly and pleasing to the eyes of the world; for so the <hi>Britains,</hi> and other Nations, after Conquered by the <hi>Romans,</hi> began to delight themselves in their Language and Habit, their Bankets and Buildings, which they accounted to be humanity and refinement of their manners; but <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith, <hi>Pars servitutis er at,</hi> a signal symptom<note place="margin">

               <p>And it is worth a Wisemans observation, how gladly the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Christians imitate the <hi>Turkish</hi> Habit, and come as neer to it as they dare; and how proud they are, when they are priviledged upon some extraordinary occasion to appear without their Christian distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And thus the <hi>Turk</hi> makes his very Habit a bait to draw some to his Superstition; Riches, to allure the covetous; rewards and hopes, to rule the ambitious; fears and terrours of death, the cowardly and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and by all means works on the dispositions and humours of men, to make additions to his Kingdom: Such as adhere to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, the <hi>Turk</hi> makes no account of, and values no otherwise in the place of subjects, then a man doth of his Ox or Ass, meerly to carry the burthens, and to be useful in servile and slavish Offices: they are oppressed, and are subject to all advantages and pretences; and their Goods and Estates gained with labour, and the sweat of their brows, liable to the Rapine of every great man; they are disarmed, and never exercised in War, by which means they become Effeminate, and less dangerous in Rebellion: only the people of <hi>Transilvania, Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia,</hi> under the conduct of their respective Princes that the Grand Signior sets over them, serve him in their persons in the War, and are the first thrust forward in all desperate enterprises; so that the oppression of the poor Christians under the <hi>Turk,</hi> is worthy our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, how poor they are become, how their former wealth is exhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how the fatness of their rich soil is drained, and made barren by poisonous suckers; so that it is evident that the <hi>Turks</hi> design is no other, then by impoverishment and enfeebling the interest of Christianity, to draw Proselytes and strength to his own Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Wherefore some sort of poor Christians, either actually subjects to the <hi>Turkish Tyranny,</hi> or borderers on them, who often feel the misery of their incursions, being fearsul of their own constancy in the faith,

The greatest honour they show to any forreign Minister, is to him who comes from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, because his confines are contiguous with theirs, and have had occasion more frequently, then with other Christian Princes, to try the power of the imperial Sword. An Embassadour coming from the Emperour, as soon as he enters within the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Dominions, hath his charges defrayed by the <hi>Sultan,</hi> according to the importance of the business and negotiation he is designed to, until the time of his return; and a Resident continuing in ordinary, hath in like manner his constant allowance. As it hath always been a custom amongst the Eastern Princes to send presents each to other, as tokens of friendship and amity; so the Emperour is by an ancient custom and agreement obliged to accompany his Embassadour to this Court with presents and gifts, as offerings of peace: and on the contrary, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour may not remain with the disadvantage, the Grand Signior is bound to recompence the Embassy with another from himself, and adorn it with presents of equal value, with those that were sent him. But Embassadours and Representatives from other Princes, who have their Dominions more remote, and whose principal design is esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the promotion of Trade and Commerce, as the <hi>English, French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> are always admitted with their presents, which the <hi>Turk</hi> by custom calls his right, and judges not himself obliged to return the

like, esteeming his Capitulations and Articles he makes with those Princes, priviledges and immunities granted their subjects.</p>
               <p>The ceremonies they use at the audience of every Embassadour are acted (as in all parts of the world) most to set off the glory of the Empire; and represented with such advantages, as may best afford a Theme for an Embasiadours pen to describe the riches, magnificence and terrour of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> power. The Audience with the Grand Signior (having first passed a complement with the Prime Visier) is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly contrived on days appointed for payment of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> which is every three moneths; and with that occasion, the Order and Discipline of the Militia, the Mony and Stipends that are issued forth, are there exposed to the observation of the publick Minister. The mony is brought into the <hi>Divan,</hi> and there piled in heaps, where the Embassadour is first introduced, and seated on a Stool covered with Crimson-velvet, placed neer the first Visier, and other Visiers of the Bench: as soon as the money is paid out of the chief of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In the same room are two other Tables for the principal attendants of the Embassadour, and other personages amongst the <hi>Turks</hi> of chief note and quality; the dishes are served in by one at a time, which as soon as touched or tasted, are taken off to make room for another; and thus there is a succession of threescore or fourscore Services, all the dishes being of <hi>China,</hi> worth about 150 Dollars a piece; which are reported to have a virtue contrary to poison, and to break with the least infusion thereof, and for that reason esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more useful for the service of the Grand Signior.</p>

The Throne where the Grand Signior sits, is raised a small height from the ground, supported with four Pillars plated with Gold: the roof is richly guilded, from which hang balls, that seem to be of gold; the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions he leaned upon, as also those which lay by, were richly embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Gold and Jewels: In this Chamber with this occasion remains no other attendance besides the first Visier, who stands at the right hand of the Grand Signior with modesty and reverence.

For when a War is proclaimed, the Embassadour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately is either committed to close imprisonment, or at least to the custody of a careful guard, confined within the limits of his own house: in this manner, the Representative of <hi>Venice,</hi> called there the <hi>Bailo,</hi> by name <hi>Sorenzo,</hi> in a streight Chamber of a Castle situated on the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> endured a severe imprisonment, having his Interpreter strangled, for no other cause then performing his office in the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of his Masters sence: afterwards this <hi>Bailo</hi> (for so they call there the Embassadors from <hi>Venice</hi>) was removed to another pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where he continued some years; and in fine, by force of presents mollifying the <hi>Turks</hi> with mony (with which their nature is easily made gentle and pliable) he obtained liberty to remain in the house appropriated to the Representatives of <hi>Venice,</hi> but under a guard, whose office was to secure him from escape, and observe his actions; and yet with liberality and presents, which overcome the <hi>Turks</hi> more then any consideration in the world, he enjoyed as he pleased, license for his health to take the fresh air, and use what freedom was reasonable.</p>
               <p>Nor less injurious to the Law of Nations, have been the examples of violence and rage, acted on the persons of the French Embassadours; first on the <hi>Sieur Sensi,</hi> accused upon suspition of having contrived the escape of <hi>Konispolski,</hi> General of the <hi>Polish</hi> Army, taken captive in a Fight, and sent Prisoner to the abovesaid Castle on the <hi>Bosphorus;</hi> the means was by a Silken cord sent in a Pye, with Limes and Files to cut the Iron bars; and having first secured his guard with the strength of wine, in the dead of the night, let him down by the cord from the highest Tower, where finding Horses ready, he got safe into <hi>Poland:</hi> the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of this stratagem, and the instruments of the escape, was laid to the charge of the <hi>French</hi> Embassadour; who was committed for that reason to the Prison of the seven Towers, where he remained for the space of four months, until his mony, and the <hi>French</hi> King his Master mediated for him, promising to send another speedily to succeed him; he was delivered from his imprisonment, and returned home by the way of <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The successor of this Embassadour was the Count <hi>Cesi</hi> a man too generous and splendid to live amongst covetous and craving <hi>Turks;</hi> exhausted most of his wealth in gifts and presents; to which adding a vanity and ambition to court the Grand Signiors Mistresses in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi> (as is said) he paid such vast sums of mony to the Eunuchs for his admittance, that in a few years he became so indebted, and importuned with the clamours of his Creditors, as wholly discredited, and lost the Honour and Authority of his Embassy; so that the <hi>French</hi> King thinking it dishonourable to continue his Minister in that charge, who was failed and undone in the reputation of the world, sent his Letter of Revocation to recal him home; but the <hi>Turks</hi> gave a stop to his return, pretending that their Law which was indulgent to the persons

of Embassadours, did not yet acquit them from payment of their debts, or priviledge them with impunity to rob the Believers and other subjects of the Grand Siguior, contrary to that rule of <hi>Grotius,</hi> who not only exempts the Persons, but the Servants and moveables of Embassadours from attachments; and no Law can compel him to the satisfaction of debts by force, but by friendly perswasion only, till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to his own Country, and put off the quality of a publick person, he becomes liable to common process; <hi>Si quid ergo debiti con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traxit,</hi>

               <p>Nor less remarkeable was the barbarous usage of the <hi>Sieur la Haye,</hi> Embassadour also for the <hi>French</hi> King to the Port, under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great Visier <hi>Kuperli.</hi> The Court being then at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and the Treaty in hand between the Grand Signior and the Republick of <hi>Venice;</hi> through the mediation of the <hi>French</hi> Embassadour, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and command of his Master, certain Letters of his wrote in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters were intercepted by the <hi>Turks;</hi> by what means, and upon what information, the matter was too evident then, to be apprehended other then an <hi>Italian</hi> contrivance: the Cypher, as containing matter preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the State, was carried to <hi>Adrianople;</hi> and being known by examination and confession of the Messenger, to have been delivered to him by the Secretary of the <hi>French</hi> affairs; immediately in all haste the Embassador then at <hi>Constantinople</hi> was cited to appear at Court; but being ancient, and indisposed in his health with the Gout and Stone, dispatched his Son as his Procurator, with instructions and orders how to answer what might be objected; hoping by that means to excuse the inconvenience of a Winters journey.</p>
               <p>The Son being there arrived, immediately was called to Audience, accompanied with the Chancellor, or Secretary for the Merchants (for the other Secretary of the private affairs of the Embassie, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the fury and injustice of the <hi>Turks,</hi> had timely secured himself by flight.) Discourse was first had concerning the Contents of the Characters; the <hi>Turks</hi> insolent in their Speeches, provoked this <hi>Sieur la Haye</hi> the younger, to utter something tending towards a contempt of that power the <hi>Turks</hi> had over him, encouraging himself with the thoughts of the protection of the King his Master; who was soon sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and moved with the least injuries offered his Ministers. The <hi>Turks,</hi> who can endure nothing less then menaces, and <hi>Kuperlee</hi> through natural cruelty and choler of old age, and particular malice against the <hi>French</hi> Nation, moved with this reply, commanded the <hi>Caousbashee,</hi> who is chief of the Pursivants, to strike him in the mouth; which he did with that force, being a rude robustious fellow, that with a few blows of his Fist, he strook out two of his Teeth before, and in a most undecent and barbarous manner dragged him with the Secretary for the Merchants, to a Dungeon so loathsome and moist, that the ill vapours oft-times extinguished the Candle. The old Ambassadour the Father, was with like <hi>Turkish</hi> fury sent for, the <hi>Turks</hi> executing all they do with strange haste and violence; <hi>Barbaris contatio servilis, statim exequire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium</hi>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55345:51"/>
as the Son, until the space of two Months passing with presents and sollicitations, they both obtained their liberty, and returned again to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> where scarce were they arrived, before news coming of a <hi>French</hi> Ship, which had loaden Goods of <hi>Turks,</hi> and run away with his Cargason, the Embassadour was again committed to another Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> called the seven Towers, where he remained, until with Gifts and Money, the anger of the <hi>Turks</hi> was abated. And still the malice of <hi>Kuperlee</hi> persecuted this <hi>Sieur la Haye,</hi> until after his Embassie of 25 years continuance, unfortuante only at the conclusion, he was dispatched home obscurely and in disgrace, without Letters of revocation from his Master, or other intimation to the Grand Signior, which might signifie the desire of this Embassadours return.</p>
               <p>The reason of this irreverent carriage in the <hi>Turks</hi> towards the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Embassadours, contrary to the custom of the ancient <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>,</hi> and other gallant and civilized people, is an apprehension and Maxime they have received, that an Embassadour is indued with two qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; one of representing to the Grand Signior the desires of his Prince, the breach of Articles or League, the aggrievances and abuses of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants trading in his Dominions; that so satisfaction and amendment may be made: And the other, that he remains in nature of a Hostage, called by themselves <hi>Mahapous</hi> or pledge; by which he becomes respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for what is acted by his Prince contrary to the Capitulations of Peace, and remains for a pawn for the faithful and sincere carriage of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as security to insure what goods belonging to <hi>Turks</hi> are loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on their Vessels. As the Resident for <hi>Holland</hi> was in the year 1663, imprisoned at <hi>Adrianople</hi> for miscarriages of a Ship belonging to his Nation, taken by <hi>Maltese</hi> men of War, whereon at <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> were goods loaden belonging to the Grand Signior, and other conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable persons of State, and was not released, until he engaged to eighty five thousand Dollars, in the space of one hundred and twenty days, which was the full import of the Turkish interest.</p>
               <p>Nor hath this Law of Nations, to the sacred esteem of Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, found better observation towards the Representatives of the <hi>German</hi> Emperour, who have upon all conjunctures of Discord and Breaches of Peace between those two powerful Princes, been subject to confinements and custody of a Guard, nothing differing from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal imprisonment; or else, as it happened to the <hi>German</hi> Resident in the last War, are transported from place to place, according to the <note place="margin">1663</note> motion of the Armies, as a barbarous Trophy in the time of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous successes, and as a means at hand to reconcile and mediate when evil Fortune compels them to composition.</p>
               <p>What ill fate soever hath attended the Ministers of other Princes in this Court, the Embassadours from his His Majesty of great <hi>Britain,</hi> our Sacred King, have never incurred this dishonour and violation of their Office; the negotiations and differences since the English Trade hath been opened in <hi>Turkie,</hi> have been various and considerable, and matters as to the security of the Embassadour and Merchants, have been often reduced to a doubtful condition, as far as words and rude speeches full of menaces and choler, might make a sober man suspitious of a greater ruine: And yet through the constancy, prudence and good fortune of Embassadours, the Turkish rashness hath not drawn upon
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55345:51"/>
themselves the guilt of violating their persons, but have either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented troubles in the beginning, or wisely compounded them before they made too far a breach.</p>
               <p>It is worth observation, that the <hi>Turks</hi> make no difference in the name between an Embassadour, Resident, Agent, or any petty Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sent or residing upon a publick Affair; the name <hi>Elchi,</hi> serves them to express all: and though the <hi>Turks</hi> on occasion of Ruptures and other Discontents lose their respect towards the person of Embassadours; yet still it is commendable in them, that they commonly abstain from the spoil and plunder of the Merchants estates, with whose Prince they are at enmity; for they look on Merchants as men, whose profession is best advanced by Peace; and as their own comparison is, like to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Bee which brings Honey to the Hive, and is innocent, industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and profitable; and therefore an object of their compassion and defence.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> How Embassadours and publick Ministers govern themselves in their Negotiations and Residence amongst the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>EMbassadours in this Country have need both of courage and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection, wisdom to dissemble with honour, and discreet pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, seemingly to take no notice of Affronts and Contempts, from which this uncivilized people cannot temperate their Tongues, even when they would seem to put on the most courteous deportment and respect towards Christians. The <hi>French</hi> Embassadour, <hi>Mounsieur la Haye,</hi> sent once to advise the great Visier <hi>Kuperlee,</hi> that his Master had taken the strong City of <hi>Arras</hi> from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and had obtained other Victories in <hi>Flanders,</hi> supposing that the <hi>Turk</hi> would outwardly have evidenced some signs of joy, and return an answer of congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the reply the Visier gave, was no other then this (VVhat matters it to me whether the Dog worries the Hog, or the Hog the Dog, so my Masters head be but safe!) intimating that he had no other esteem of Christians, then as Salvages or Beasts; and with no other answer then this, due to an officious Courtship towards a <hi>Turk,</hi> the Messenger returned. There is no doubt, but of all those means, wherewith Kingdoms and States are supported, there are two more principal and chief of all others: The one is the substantial and real strength and force of the Prince, which consists in his Armies and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; and the other is the honour and reputation he gains abroad, which hath sometimes proved of that Authority and consequence, as to make the State of the weaker Prince to appear more considerable; or at least, equal to the greater forces of the other. This reputation is principally maintained by a prudent manner of negotiation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the discretion of the Representative, in which for many years the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> had great advantages in the Turkish Court, through the caution and policy of their Ministers, who nourished in the <hi>Turks</hi> an opinion of their strength of Arms, and force of Wisdom, beyond the reality thereof; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> before the War broke forth, no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55345:52"/>
in amity with the <hi>Turk,</hi> had their affairs treated with more honour and respect then this Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>An Embassadour in this Court ought to be circumspect and careful to avoid the occasion of having his honour blemished, or of incurring the least violation of his person; for afterward, as one baffled in his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he becomes scorned, loses his power and interest, and all esteem of his worth and wisdom; for having endured one affront, their insolence soon presumes farther to trespass on his patience: for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Turks</hi> of all Nations in the world, are most apt to crush and trample on those that lye under their feet; as on the contrary, those who have a reputation with them, may make the best and most advantageous treats of any part of the world, according to that of <hi>Busbequius, Ep.</hi> 1. <hi>Sunt Turci in utram<expan>

                     </expan> partem nimii sive indulgentia, cum pro amicis se probare volunt, sive acerbitate cum irati sunt.</hi> To reply according to the Pride and Ignorance of a <hi>Turk,</hi> is properly to blow up fire into a flame; to support with submission and a pusillanimous spirit, his affronts and indignities, by negotiating faintly or coldly, is to add fuel and wood to the burning piles; but solid reason and discourse, accompanied with chearful expressions, vivacity and courage in argument, is the only manner of dealing and treating with the <hi>Turks.</hi> That which is called good nature or flexible disposition, is of little use to a publick Minister in his treaty with <hi>Turks:</hi> a punctual adherence to former customs and examples even to obstinacy, is the best and safest rule; for the concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one point serves to embolden them to demand another, and then a third; and so their hopes increases with the success, having no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty nor wisdom to terminate their desires; one act or two of favour is enough afterwards to introduce a custom (which is the chiefest part of their Law) and to make that which is meerly voluntary, and of grace, to become of obligation. But a principal matter, which a publick Minister ought to look to, is to provide himself of spirited, eloquent and intelligent Interpreters; spirited, I say, because many times the presence is great they appear before, and the looks big and soure of a barbarous Tyrant; and it hath been known, that the Embassadour hath been forced to interpose his own Person, between the fury of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier and his Interpreter, whose offence was only a delivery of the words of his Master; some of whom have notwithstanding been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned, or executed for this cause, as we have partly intimated in the foregoing Chapter: The reason of which Tyranny and presumption in these prime Officers over the Interpreters, is because they are most commonly born subjects of the Grand Signior, and therefore ill sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the least word mis-placed, or savouring of contest from them, not distinguishing between the sense of the Embassadour, and the explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Interpreter; and therefore it were very useful to breed up a Seminary of young Englishmen, of sprightly and ingenious parts, to be qualified for that Office; who may with less danger to themselves, honour to their Master, and advantage to the publick, express boldly without the usual mincing and submission of other Interpreters, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is commanded and declared by their Master.</p>
               <p>It is certainly a good Maxime for an Embassadour in this Country, not to be over-studious in procuring a familiar friendship with <hi>Turks;</hi> a fair comportment towards all in a moderate way, is cheap and secure;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55345:52"/>
for a <hi>Turk</hi> is not capable of real friendship towards a Christian; and to have him called only, and thought a friend who is in power, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence without profit; for in great emergencies, and times of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when their assistance is most useful, he must be bought again, and his friendship renewed with presents, and farther expectations: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, this way of negotiation by presents and gratuities, is so much in custom amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> that to speak truely, scarce any thing can be obtained without it; but it is the wisdom of the Minister, to dispose and place them with honour, decency and advantage: For there are, and have been always, two or three powerful persons in this Court, which in all times carry the principal sway, and command of all; these must necessarily be treated with respect, and often sweetned with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuities: he that hath mony may doubtless make friends when he needs them, and with that secure his capitulation and his priviledge, purchase justice, and if his stock will hold out, act any thing that can reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be imagined; yet it is the most profitable and prudent way to refer something to friendship and good correspondence, and not all to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> How Forreign Princes in particular stand in the esteem and opinion of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe <hi>Turks,</hi> as we have occasionally instanced before, are naturally a proud and insolent people, confident, and conceited of their own vertue, valour and forces, which proceeds from their ignorance of the strength and constitution of other Countries; so that when the danger which may arise from the Conjunction and Union of Christian Princes to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Interest, is discoursed of, they compare the Grand Signior to the Lyon, and other Kings to little Dogs, which may serve (as they say) to rouse and discompose the quiet and Majesty of the Lyon, but can never bite him, but with their utmost peril. They say farther, as by an ingenuous confession, that they are unable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the Christians at Sea, to whom God hath given that unstable element for Dominion and Possession; but that the earth is the lot and inheritance of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which is demonstrable by that great circuit of Empire, obedient to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Arms. These are the thoughts and apprehensions of the Commonalty concerning Christendom in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral (which I have heard often discoursed amongst them) but the opinion and esteem which knowing men and Ministers frame of Forreign King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and States distinctly, is for the most part according to these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars.</p>
               <p>Of all the Princes so far remote as <hi>England,</hi> none amongst this people stands in better account then His Majesty of <hi>Great Braitain,</hi> not onely for the convenience of the Trade, which provides this Empire with many necessary commodities; but for the fame of his Shipping, and power at Sea, which makes him, though divided from all parts of the world, yet a borderer on every Country, where the Ocean extends: And this esteem and honour the <hi>Sultan</hi> bears towards His Majesty,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55345:53"/>
hath been evidenced in several particulars, and by none more then by the security and freedom his Merchants live in, in these Dominions, and a readiness always in every reasonable request, to gratifie His Majesties Embassadours.</p>
               <p>As for the Emperour, the <hi>Turk</hi> knows that his own proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar force in its self, is inconsiderable, but that with the conjunction and assistance of the <hi>German</hi> Princes, they are assured, and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it to their experience in the year 1664, that his strength is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> power; but yet they are not ignorant, that the diversity of Religions and Sects in <hi>Germany,</hi> abate much of that heat and coalition amongst themselves, which is requisite to the vigorous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of so potent an enemy. And it is evident, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours unseasonable severity against the Protestants in <hi>Hungary,</hi> diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging his whole Dominion there, by depriving them of their Churches, and exercising other courses for suppression of the reformed Religion, ripened the <hi>Turks</hi> design of War first laid in the year 1663; conceiving that in that conjuncture, holding forth the specious pretence of liberty in Religion and Conscience, the <hi>Hungarians</hi> would either wholly desert the Emperour, or very coldly and faintly apply themselves to his succour; the effect of which was in the succeeding Wars plainly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and known that the <hi>Hungarians</hi> were not only sparing in their contribution and supplies of men in the service of the Emperour, but held secret Juntoes and Councels, whether it were not better to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>Turks</hi> soveraignty, on the conditions proposed, with liberty of their Religion, rather then to continue in Allegiance to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; who neither afforded them freedom of conscience, which is the destruction of their spiritual estate, nor was able to withstand the <hi>Turk,</hi> which argued insufficiency to yeild them protection in their temporal. The Emperour sends his Embassadour to the <hi>Turk,</hi> under notion of the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> because at his instalment as Emperour, he swears to make a perpetual War with the <hi>Turk;</hi> and indeed their peace is little better then a War, considering their frequent incursions into each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Territories; and that to skirmish or fight in bodies under the number of 5000, not taking Forts, or bringing Cannons into the Field, is no breach of the capitulations.</p>
               <p>The French King, though the first Christian Prince, that having no confines bordering on these Dominions, entred into capitulations with the <hi>Turk</hi> for a free and open Commerce and Traffick; and obtained the Title of <hi>Podeshaw,</hi> which signifies as much as Emperour, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to all other Christian Kings, and even to the <hi>Germane</hi> Emperour himself, being judged an honour amongst the <hi>Turks</hi> proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar only to the Grand Signior: yet their esteem of the <hi>French</hi> is not so great as some would perswade the world it is, having (as we have at large declared in the foregoing Chapter) given ample testimonies in the persons of the Embassadours, their scorn and neglect of the Prince he represented. I have heard the wise Lord Chancellour <hi>Samosade</hi> say, that the <hi>French</hi> gained that Title of <hi>Podeshaw</hi> to their King by craft and subtilty, and was never fully examined nor considered; and in that business there is a strange <hi>Romance</hi> told of a fair <hi>French</hi> Lady, preferred to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> whom the <hi>Turks</hi> were willing to receive for a Princess, and thence challenging affinity with the King of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:55345:53"/>
was the more profuse in the honour of his titles: It is true, there was a time when the <hi>French</hi> Embassadour was called to secret Councels, and admitted within the Walls of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> to private meetings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of the <hi>Turk;</hi> but it was when the <hi>French</hi> plotted, and openly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in transportation of the <hi>Turks,</hi> for the invasion of <hi>Italy;</hi> but since that time, and especially in the year 1664, through the force given the Emperour, and the Bravado upon <hi>Barbary,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> hath always (and that not without some reason) gone declining in the good opinion and esteem in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> is more esteemed, as a Prince able to blow the coals, and excite other Princes to the damage of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> State, rather then by his own power or force to effect any thing himself; and having no confines bordering on the <hi>Turks,</hi> his riches, power or greatness sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom falls as a subject for their consideration.</p>
               <p>As little account would they make of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> but that the <hi>Granadin Turks,</hi> of which there remains in <hi>Constantinople</hi> a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number since their expulsion, through an extream affection na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inherent in them to <hi>Spain,</hi> discourse of it with a passion, not altogether free os a little <hi>Rodomontado,</hi> and vain-glory, vices incident to their Country; whereby they create in the <hi>Turks</hi> a conceit of the greatness, riches and force of <hi>Spain,</hi> according as it flourished in the time that the <hi>Moors</hi> possessed their seat and habitation there. But yet the <hi>Turks,</hi> though a people incurious and negligent of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate state of other places, besides their own, are not altogether ignorant of the decay of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Wars in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the menaces from <hi>France,</hi> which makes them aim at one of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ports in <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> to have the better prospect and easier passage unto <hi>Sicily,</hi> or the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The esteem the <hi>Venetians</hi> are in at this time amongst them, is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then when the War first began; for then they entertained an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their force much inferiour to the real estimation thereof; as they do now the contrary byond their true strength, making always calculates from the effect and success of things. Yet the <hi>Turk</hi> knows, that the <hi>Venetian</hi> power is not comparable to his by land, and that nothing but <hi>Friuli</hi> stands between him and the mastery of <hi>Venice;</hi> which makes him ashamed and angry, that after so many years Wars, no greater additions should be acquired to the Empire, then his footing in <hi>Candy,</hi> the whole possession of which was imagined at the beginning of the war, would upon a bare demand been quietly presented as the price and purchase of the peace.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> is none of the least amongst the Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces esteemed at the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, by reason of his great power, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting chiefly in Horse, which in opinion of the <hi>Turks</hi> is the most war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; and look on that people as martial, and with much difficulty brought under their subjection. But by reason of the great combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and intestine troubles of that Country, the <hi>Polanders</hi> apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with much dexterity and caution in their treaties with the <hi>Turks;</hi> and especially, being borderers with them, and subject to their incursions and robberies of Men and Cattel, they endeavour all means of fair and reasonable complyance. And on the other side, the <hi>Turk</hi> is well inclined to the <hi>Polander,</hi> and desires his prosperity beyond others of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55345:54"/>
his neighbour-Princes; because he looks on him, as the only curb up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions of the <hi>Moscovites,</hi> and whom they may make use of, to give some stop and arrest unto the progress of his Arms.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moscovite</hi> hath yet a greater fame and renown with the <hi>Turks,</hi> being reported able to make a hundred and fifty thousand Horse; so that he treats with the <hi>Turk</hi> on equal terms, and fills his Letters with high threats and Hyperbolical expressions of his power, and with as swelling titles as the <hi>Turk.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> have also an inclination to the <hi>Moscovite</hi> beyond any other Christian Prince, as being of their Rites and Religion, terming him their Emperour and Protector; from whom, according to ancient prophesies and modern predictions, they expect delivery and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>But above all the great Potentates of the world, the King of <hi>

                  </hi> was most feared and esteemed by the <hi>Turk,</hi> not only by reason of his great force, and that the borders of his Dominions run a long space on the confines of the <hi>Turks;</hi> but because it is almost impossible, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the vast Deserts, and uninhabited places, to carry the War into his Country, without the cumbersome carriages of all necessary provisions, which with how much difficulty and incommodity were performed in the last <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> between these two great Princes, the History sufficiently relates; but since the conquest of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and decay of their riches, they are now the subjects of the Turkish scorn and contempt. The neerness of their Faith, though derived from the same Founder, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards receiving some difference by the interpretation of <hi>Haly,</hi> is in no wise a reconcilement of their affections; but rather a ground and matter of their fear and jealousie, lest at any time waging a War against the <hi>Persian,</hi> that Heresie should begin to be set on foot amongst the people, which like a spark that causes the conflagration of a whole City, may breed those intestine civil distractions, which may prove of more danger and ruine then the former War. It will not be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to speak much of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> in regard, that though they have a Resident there, are scarce taken notice of as a Nation different, but depending on the <hi>English.</hi> And these are all the Nations considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with whom the Turk hath occasion to treat, or that follow under his cognisance or business.</p>

                  </gap> Arms and Force of other parts contemptible in respect of theirs.</p>
               <p>Upon these considerations of the vileness of Christianity, and scorn of their power, they assume this into a Maxime, that they ought not to regard the Leagues they have with any Prince, or the reasons and ground of a quarrel; whilst the breach tends to the enlargement of their Empire, which consequently infers the propagation of their Faith. Many and various are the examples and stories in all Ages, since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and increase of the Turkish power, of the perfidiousness and treachery of this people; that it may be a question, whether their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and force hath prevailed more in the time of War, or the little care of their faith and maintenance of their Leagues hath availed them in the time of Peace. Thus <hi>Didymotichum</hi> in the time of Peace, under <hi>Amurath,</hi> third King of the <hi>Turks,</hi> whilst the Walls and Fortifications were Building, was by the <hi>Asian</hi> labourers, which were entertained in the work, and the help of other <hi>Turks</hi> which lay near in ambush, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised and taken; so also <hi>Rhodestum</hi> in time of Peace by command of <hi>Amurath,</hi> was by <hi>Eurenoses</hi> assaulted and taken by stratagem; so <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It is an old and practised subtilty of the <hi>Turks,</hi> immediately after some notable Misfortune to entreat of Peace, by which means they may gain time to recollect their Forces and Provisions to prosecute the War. It is notable and worthy of Record, the treachery of the Treaty used in the year 1604. Begun in the time of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the third, and broken off by <hi>Achmat</hi> his Successor. The overtures for a Treaty were first propounded by the <hi>Turks;</hi> and Commissioners from the Emperour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and met the <hi>Turks</hi> at <hi>Buda;</hi> twelve days truce were conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for consideration of the Articles, and Presents sent by the <hi>Turks</hi> to the Emperour, to perswade him of the reality of their intentions. <hi>Mahomet</hi> dying, <hi>Sultan Achmat</hi> renews his Commission to the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> to continue the Treaty; whereupon the Christian and <hi>Turks</hi> Commissioners have another Meeting at <hi>Pesth;</hi> where whilst the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were courteously.

and advantage follow the example and Doctrine of their Master; for the like <hi>Mahomet</hi> did when overthrown, and repulsed at the siege of <hi>Mecha,</hi> made a firm League with the Inhabitants of strict Peace and Amity: but the next Summer, having again recruited his Forces, easily surprised and took the City, whilst that people relying on the late a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, suspected nothing less then the Prophets treachery. And that such perfideousness as this might not be Chronicled in future Ages, in disparagement of his Sanctity; he made it lawful for his Believers, in cases of like nature, when the matter concerned those who were Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and of a different perswasion, neither to regard Promises, Leagues, or other Engagements; and this is read in the Book of the institutions of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law, called <hi>Kitab Hadaia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the usual form and custom, when a noble advantage is espyed on any Country, with which they have not sufficient ground of quarrel, to demand the opinion of the <hi>Muftee,</hi> for the lawfnlness of War; who without consulting other consideration and judgement of the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble occasions, then the utility of the Empire, in conformity to the foregoing president of his Prophet, passes his <hi>Fetfa</hi> or sentence; by which the War becomes warrantable, and the cause justifyed and allowed.</p>
               <p>It is not to be denyed, but even amongst Christian Princes and other the most gallant people of the world, advantages have been taken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Leagues, and Faith, and Wars commenced upon frivolous and slight pretences; and States have never wanted reasons for the breach of Leagues, though confirmed by Oaths and all the Rites of Religious Vows: We know it is controverted in the Schools, whether Faith is to be maintained with Infidels, with Hereticks, and wicked men; which in my opinion were more honourable to be out of question.</p>
               <p>But we never read that perfidiousness by Act and Proclamation was allowable, or that it was holy to be faithless, until the Doctors of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law, by the example of their Prophet recorded and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded this Lesson, as a beneficial and useful Axiome to their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but wonder at what I have heard and read in some Books of the Honesty and Justice of the <hi>Turks,</hi> extolling and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding them, as men accomplished with all the vertues of a moral life; thence seeming to infer that Christianity it self imposes none of those engagements of goodness on mens natures, as the Professors of it do imagine. But such men I believe, have neither read the Histories, nor consulted the rules of their Religion, nor practised their conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in all points being ignorant of the truth of the <hi>Turks</hi> deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, it is not strange, if through a charitable opinion of what they know not, they erre in the apprehension and Character they pass up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>

And though this Policie was a Fiction of some, who first founded cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Governments, as <hi>Numa Pompilius, Solon,</hi> and the like, to put the greater engagements and ties on men, as well of conscience, as through fear of punishment; yet in the general that proposition is true, that all Laws which respect Right and Justice, and are tending to a foundation of good and honest Government, are of God; <hi>For there is no power but</hi>

               <p>WHen <hi>Mahometanism</hi> was first weak, and therefore put on a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Countenance and plausible Aspect to deceive mankind, it found a great part of the World illuminated with Christianity, endued with active Graces, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

that <hi>Mahometanism</hi> coming then on the disadvantage, and having a hard game to play, either by the lustre of graces, and good examples of a strict life to out-shine Christianity; or by a looseness and indulgence to corrupt manners, to pervert men dedicated to Gods service; or by cruelty or menaces to gain those who accounted Martyrdom their greatest glory, and were now also defended by the power of their own Princes; judges it best policy to make proffers of truce and peace between the Christian and its own profession: and therefore in all places where its arms were prevalent and prosperous, proclaimed a free toleration to all Religions; but especially in outward appearance, courted and favoured the Christian, drawing its Tenents and Doctrines in some conformity to that rule, confessing Christ to be a Prophet, and greater then <hi>Moses;</hi> that he was born of a Virgin; that <hi>Mary</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the smell of a Rose; that the blessed Virgin was free from origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal sin, and the temptations of the Devil; that Christ was the Word of God, and is so styled in the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and cured diseases, raised the dead, and worked many miracles; and by his power, his Disciples did the like: and I have heard some speak of him with much reverence, and with heat to deny Christs passion; saying, it were an impiety to believe that God who loved, and had conferred so much power, and so many graces on Christ, should so far dishonour him, as to deliver him into the hands of the Jews, who were the worst and most scorned of men; or to the death of the Cross, which was the most infamous and vile of all punishments.</p>
               <p>In this manner they seemed to make a league with Christianity, to be charitable, modest, and well wishers to its professors; and <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> himself says in his <hi>Alchoran</hi> thus: O Infidels, I do not adore what you adore, and you do not adore what I worship; observe you your law, and I will observe mine: And for a farther assurance of his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of Christianity, and evidence to the world, that his intention was neither to persecute nor extirpate their Religion; he made this following Compact, the original of which was found in the Monastery of Fryars on Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> neer Mount <hi>Libanus</hi> (which is within one days journey of <hi>Mecha,</hi> and is the place where the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims make their <hi>Corban</hi> or Sacrifice before they enter that City, as we shall hereafter have occasion to speak of more at large) and, as it is said, was transported to the Kings Library in <hi>France;</hi> which because it is ancient, and of curiosity, it will not be impertinent to be inserted here.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55345:57"/>
By this agreement, whereby I have obliged my self, and which the Christians have required of me, and in my Name, and in the name of all my Disciples, to enter into a Covenant of God with them, and League and Testament of the Prophets, Apostles elect, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Saints, and blessed of times past and to come. By this Covenant, I say, and Testament of mine (which I will have maintained with as much Religion, as a Prophet Missionary, or as an Angel next to the Divine Majesty, is strict in his obedience towards God, and in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance to his Law and Covenant) I promise to defend their Judges in my Provinces, with my Horse and Foot, Auxiliaries, and other my faithful followers; and to preserve them from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whether remote or neer, and secure them both in peace and war: and to protect their Churches, Temples, Oratories, Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and places of Pilgrimage, wheresoever scituated, whether in Mountain or Valley, Cavern or House, a Plain, or upon the Sand, or in what sort of edifice soever: also to preserve their Religion and their goods in what part soever they are, whether at Land or Sea, East or West, even as I keep my self and my Scepter, and the faithful believers of my own people. Likewise, to receive them into my protection from all harm, vexation, offence and hurt. Moreover, to repel those enemies which are offensive to them and me, and stoutly to oppose them both in my own person, by my servants, and all others of my people and Nation. For since I am set over them, I ought to preserve and defend them from all adversity, and that no evil touch them before it first afflict mine, who labour in the same work. I promise farther to free them from those burthens which confederates suffer, either by lones of mony or impositions; so that they shall be obliged to pay nothing but what they please, and no molestation or injury shall be offered them herein. A Bishop shall not be removed from his Diocess, or a Christian compelled to renounce his faith, or a Monk his profession, or a Pilgrim disturbed in his Pilgrimage, or a Religious man in his Cell: Nor shall their Churches be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or converted into Mosques: for whosoever doth so break this Covenant of God, opposes the Messenger of God, and frustrates the Divine Testament. No imposition shall be laid upon Fryars or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, nor any of them who are not lyable to Taxes, unless it be with their own consent. And the Tax which shall be required from rich Merchants, and from Fishermen of their Pearl, from Miners of their Precious Stones, Gold and Silver; and all other rich and opulent Christians, shall not exceed above 12 shillings yearly; and it shall also be from them who are constant inhabitants of the place, and not from Travellers, and Men of an uncertain aboad; for they shall not be subject to impositions or contributions, unless they are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors of inheritance of Land or Estate; for he which is lawfully subject to pay mony to the Emperour, shall pay as much as another, and not more; nor more required from him, above his faculty and strength. In like manner, he that is taxed for his Land, Houses or Revenue, shall not be burthened immoderately, nor oppressed with greater Taxes then any others that pay contribution: Nor shall the confederates be obliged to go to War with the <hi>Mosselmans</hi> against their enemies, either to fight or discover their Armies, because it is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55345:57"/>
not of duty to a confederate, to be employed in Military affairs; but rather this Compact is made with them, that they may be the less oppressed; but rather the <hi>Mosselmans</hi> shall watch, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them: And therefore, that they be not compelled to go forth to fight, or encounter the enemy, or find Horse or Arms, unless they voluntarily furnish them; and he who shall thus willingly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, shall be recompensed and rewarded. No <hi>Mosselman</hi> shall infest the Christians, nor contend with them in any thing but in kindness, but treat them with all courtesie, and abstain from all oppression or violence towards them. If any Christian commit a crime or fault, it shall be the part of the <hi>Mosselman</hi> to assist him, intercede and give caution for him, and compound for his miscarriage; liberty shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be given him to redeem his life, nor shall he be forsaken, nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of help, because of the Divine Covenant which is with them, that they should enjoy what the <hi>Mosselmans</hi> enjoy, and suffer what they suffer: and on the other side, that the <hi>Mosselmans</hi> enjoy what they enjoy, and suffer what they suffer. And according to this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which is by the Christians just request, and according to that endeavour which is so required for confirmation of its Authority, you are obliged to protect them from all calamity, and perform all offices of good will towards them, so that the <hi>Mosselmans</hi> may be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers with them in prosperity and adversity. Moreover, all care ought to be had, that no violence be offered to them, as to matters relating to marriage, <hi>viz.</hi> That they compel not the Parents to match their Daughters with <hi>Mosselmans:</hi> Nor shall they be molested for refusal, either to give a Bridegroom or a Bride; for this is an act wholly vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, depending on their free-well and pleasure. But if it happen that a Christian Woman shall joyn with a <hi>Mosselman,</hi> he is obliged to give her liberty of conscience in her Religion, that she may obey her Ghostly Father, and be instructed in the Doctrines of her Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impediment; therefore he shall not disquiet her, either by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning divorce, or by sollicitations to forsake her Faith: but is he shall be contrary hereunto, and molest her herein, he despises the Covenant of God, rebels against the Compact of the Messenger of God, and is entred into the number of lyars. Moreover, when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians would repair their Churches or Convents, or any thing else ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining unto their Worship, and have need of the liberality and assistance of the <hi>Mosselmans</hi> hereunto, they ought to contribute, and freely to bestow according to their ability; not with intention to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it again, but <hi>gratis;</hi> and as a good will towards their Faith, and to fulfil the Covenant of the Messenger of God, considering the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation they have to perform the Covenant of God, and the compact of the Messenger of God. Nor shall they oppress any of them living amongst the <hi>Mosselmans,</hi> nor hate them, nor compel them to carry Letters, or shew the way, or any other manner force them: for he which exercises any manner of this Tyranny against them, is an oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, and an adversary to the Messenger of God, and refractory to his Precepts. These are the Covenants agreed between <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Messenger of God, and Christians. But the conditions on which I bind these Covenants on their Consciences, are these: That no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian give any entertainment to a Souldier, enemy to the <hi>Mosselmans,</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:55345:58"/>
or receive him in his house publickly or privately; that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none of the enemies of the <hi>Mosselmans,</hi> as sojourners into their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

To any <hi>Mosselman</hi> and his Beasts, they shall give three days enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment with variety of Meat; and moreover, shall endeavour to defend them from all misfortune and trouble; so that if any <hi>Mossel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> shall be desirous, or be compelled to conceal himself in any of their houses or habitations, they shall friendly hide him, and deliver him from the danger he is in, and not betray him to his enemy: and in this manner the Christians performing Faith on their side, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever violates any of these conditions, and doth contrarily, shall be deprived of the benefits contained in the Covenant of God and his Messenger; nor shall he deserve to enjoy these priviledges indulged to Bishops and Christian Monks, and to the believers of the contents of the <hi>Alchoran.</hi> Wherefore I do conjure my people by God and his Prophet to maintain these things faithfully, and fulfil them, in what part soever of the world they are. And the Messenger of God shall recompence them for the same; the perpetual observation of which he seriously recommends to them, until the day of judgement, and dissolution of the world. Of these conditions which <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Messenger of God hath agreed with the Christians, and hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, the witnesses were

               <p>This Covenant or Articles with Christians (howsoever denyed by the <hi>Turks</hi> to have been the act and agreement of <hi>Mahomet</hi>) is yet by very good Authors taken for real, and to have been at that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed when his Kingdom was weak, and in its infancy, and when he Warred with the <hi>Arabians:</hi> and fearing likewise the enmity of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians (not to be assaulted by two enemies at once) secured himself by this religious League, made in the Monastery of <hi>Fryars,</hi> in Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> from whence that strict Order have their denomination. But mark how well <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the sequel observed this Law: As soon as his Government increased, and that by Arms and bad Arts he had secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Kingdom, he writes his Chapter of the Sword, called so perhaps because the first words of it are often engraved on the <hi>Turks</hi> Cymeters made at <hi>Damascus,</hi> and on their Bucklers and other sorts of Arms: And another Chapter in the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> called the Chapter of Battel (which is always read by the <hi>Turks</hi> before they go to fight) and therein his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dests words (if you adore not what I adore, let your Religion be to you, and mine to me) and other promises of toleration and indulgence to the Christian Religion, were changed to a harsher note; and his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55345:58"/>
Edicts were then for bloud and ruine, and enslavement of Christians: When you meet with Infidels, saith he, cut off their heads, kill them, take them prisoners, bind them, until either you think fit to give them liberty, or pay their ransom; and forbear not to persecute them, until they have laid down their Arms and submitted. And this is that sort of toleration the <hi>Turks</hi> give to the Christian Religion; they know they cannot force mens Wills, nor captivate their Consciences, as well as their bodies; but what means may be used to render them contemptible, to make them poor, their lives uncomfortable, and the interest of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion weak and despicable, are practised with divers Arts and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that their toleration of Christianity is rather to afflict and persecute it, then any grant of favour or dispensation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion tolerates Christian Churches and Houses of Devotion, in places where they have been anciently founded, but admits not of holy Buildings on new foundations; they may repair the old Coverings and Roofs, but cannot lay a stone in a new place Consecrated to Divine Service; nor if Fire, or any accident destroy the Superstructure, may a new strength be added to the foundation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to under-prop it for another Building; so that at last the Christian Churches in those Dominions must necessarily come to ruine, as many already have submitted to the common fate of time. And as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the great and notable Fires of <hi>Galata</hi> first, and then of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> in the year 1660, that many of the Christian Churches and Chappels were brought to Ashes; and afterwards by the Piety and Zeal of Christians scarce re-edified, before by publick order they were thrown down again into their former heaps, being adjudged contrary to the Turkish Law, to permit Churches again to be restored, of which no more remained then the meer foundation.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Turks,</hi> though they offer the specious out-side of the foregoing toleration, yet by their Law are Authorized to enforce mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences to the profession of their Faith; and that is done by various arts and niceties of Religion: For if a man turn <hi>Turk,</hi> his Children under the age of fourteen years, though Educated with other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, must be forced to the same perswasion. Men that speak against the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law, that have rashly promised at a time of distraction or drunkenness to become <hi>Turks,</hi> or have had carnal knowledge of a Turkish Woman, must either become Martyrs or Apostates; besides many other subtilties they have to entrap the souls of Christians within the entanglements of their Law.</p>
               <p>It is another Policie wherewith the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Sect hath been encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the accounting it a principle of Religion, not to deliver a City or Fortress by consent or voluntary surrender, where <hi>Mosques</hi> have been once built, and <hi>Mahometanism</hi> professed. And therefore the <hi>Turk</hi> no sooner enters a Town by Conquest, but immediately lays foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for his Temples, thereby imposing an obligation of an obstinate
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55345:59"/>
and constant resolution on the conscience of the defendants, which many times hath been found to have been more forcible and prevalent on the spirits of men, then all the terrors and miseries of Famine, Sword or other calamities.</p>
               <p>It is well enough known upon what different interests Christianity and <hi>Mahometanism</hi> were introduced into the world; the first had no other enforcements, then the perswasions and Sermons of a few poor Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, verified with Miracles, Signs and inspiration of the holy Ghost; carrying before it the promises of another life, and considerations of a glorified spirituality in a state of separation; but the way to it was obstructed with the opposition of Emperours and Kings, with scorn and contempt, with persecution and death; and this was all the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement proposed to mankind to embrace this Faith: But <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanism</hi> made its way with the Sword; what knots of Argument he could not unty, he cut, and made his spiritual power as large as his temporal; made his precepts easie and pleasant, and acceptable to the fancy and appetite, as well as to the capacity of the vulgar: repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting heaven to them, not in a spiritual manner, or with delights un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible, and ravishments known only in part to illuminated souls; but with gross conceptions of the beauty of Women with great eyes, of the duration of one act of carnal copulation for the space of sixty years, and of the beastly satisfaction of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> glottonous palate; things ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and ridiculous to wise and knowing men; but yet capable to draw multitudes of professors, and carnal defenders of its verity. And this Doctrine being irrational to the better sort of judgements, causes the Lawyers, who are men of the subtilest capacities amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> to mistrust much of the truth of the Doctrine of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> especially the assertions relating to the condition of the other life. For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of the delights of the next world, in a corporeal and sensual manner, being inconsistent with their reason, leads them to doubt the truth of that point; and so wavering with one scruple, proceed to a mistrust of the whole system of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> faith. One would think that in such men a way were prepared for the entertainment of a Religion, erected on more solid principles and foundations; and that the Jews might gain such Proselytes to their Law, from which a great part of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> superstition was borrowed; or that the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans might take advantage in so well-disposed subjects, to produce some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Mysterie of Godliness: But the first are a people so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to scorn and contempt, esteemed by the <hi>Turks</hi> to be the scum of the world, and the worst of men; that it is not probable their Doctrine can gain a reputation with those, to whom their very persons and bloud are vile and detestable; nor is it likely the Christians will ever be received by them with greater Authority, and more favourable inclination, until they acquit themselves of the scandal of Idolatry, which the Images and Pictures in their Churches seem to accusethem of in the eyes and judgement of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are not versed in the subtile distinctions of Schoolmen, in the limitations and restrictions of that worship, and the evasions of their Doctors, matters not only sufficient to puzzle and distract the gross heads of <hi>Turks,</hi> but to strain the wits of learned Christians to clear them from that imputation.</p>
               <p>But to return to our purpose. The propagation of the <hi>Mahometan</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:55345:59"/>
faith having been promoted wholy by the Sword; that perswasion and principle in their Catechism, that the souls of those who die in the Wars against the Christians, without the help of previous acts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their Law, or other works, are immediately transported to Paradise, must necessarily whet the Swords and raise the spirits of the Souldiers; which is the reason that such Multitudes of them (as we read in History) run evidently to their own slaughter, esteeming their lives and bodies at no greater price then the value of stones and rubbish to fill Rivulets and Ditches, that they may but erect a Bridge or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage for their fellows to assault their enemies.</p>
               <p>The success of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> arms produced another argument for the confirmation of their faith, and made it a principle; That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever prospers, hath God for the Author; and by how much more suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesseful have been their Wars, by so much the more hath God been an owner of their cause and Religion. And the same argument (if I am not mistaken) in the times of the late Rebellion in <hi>England,</hi> was made use of by many, to intitle God to their cause, and make him the Author of their thriving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, because their wickedness prospered, and could trample on all holy and humane rights with impunity. And I have known that the <hi>Romanists</hi> have judged the afflictions and almost sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be a token of Gods desertion and disclaim of her profession, forgetting the Persecutions and Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Primitive Saints, and that the Church of God is built in sorrow and established with patience and passive graces; but these men rather then want an argument, their malice will use the weapons of Infidels to oppugn the truth. And on this ground, the <hi>Turks</hi> so horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly detest and abhor the Jews, calling them the forsaken of God, because they are Vagabonds over all the world, and have no Temporal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to protect them: And though according to the best enquiry I could make, that report is not true, That they permit not a Jew to become a <hi>Turk,</hi> but by turning a Christian first, as a nearer step and previous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the <hi>Mussulman,</hi> saith; yet it is certain they will not receive the Corps of a Renegado Jew into their Cymetaries or places of burial; and the Jews on the other side disowning any share or part in him, his loathed Carcass is thrown into some Grave distant from other Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, as unworthy the Society of all mankind.</p>

                  </hi> sentence; for the nature of man reposes more security in innocence and actions of justice, then in the absolute and uncontrouleable power of the Sword. And the Grand Signior, though he himself is above the Law, and is the Oracle and Fountain of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, yet it is seldome that he proceeds so irregularly to contemn that Authority wherein their Religion hath placed an ultimate power of decision in all their controversies.</p>
               <p>But sometimes perhaps Quaeries are sent from the Grand Signior to the <hi>Mufti,</hi> which he cannot resolve with satisfaction of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and the ends of the <hi>Sultan;</hi> by which means affairs important to the well being of the State, meet delays and impediment; In this case the <hi>Mufti</hi> is fairly dismissed from his infallible office, and another Oracle introduced, who may resolve the difficult demands with a more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable sentence; if not, he is degraded like the former, and so the next, untill one is found apt to prophesie according to what may best agree with the interest of his Master. This Office was in past-times esteemed more sacred by the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes then at present; for no War was undertaken, or great Enterprize set on foot, but first like the Oracle or <hi>Augur,</hi> his determination with great reverence was required as that without which no blessing or success could be expected; but in these dayes they are more remiss in this manner of consultation; sometimes it is done for formality; but most commonly the Prime Visier conceited of his own judgment and Authority assumes the power to himself, and perhaps first does the thing, and afterwards demands the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by the sence of the Law.</p>
               <p>And herein the <hi>Mufti</hi> hath a spacious Field for his Interpretations; for it is agreed that their Law is temporary, and admits of expositions according to times and state of things: And though they preach to the people the perfection of their <hi>Alchoran;</hi> yet the wiser men hold, that the <hi>Mufti</hi> hath an expository power of the Law to improve and better it, according to the state of things, times and conveniencies of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; for that their Law was never designed to be a clog or confinement to the propagation of Faith, but an advancement thereof, and therefore
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55345:60"/>
to be interpreted in the largest and farthest fetched sense, when the strict words will not reach the design intended.</p>
               <p>So it was once propounded to the <hi>Mufti,</hi> what rule should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the devotion of a <hi>Turk</hi> carryed Salve into the Northern parts of the world, where in Winter is but one hour of day, how he might possibly comply with his obligation of making prayers five times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the twenty four hours; <hi>viz.</hi> Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Sunset, and at an hour and half in the Night; when the whole day being but of one hour admitted of none of these distinctions; for resolution of which, the <hi>Mufti</hi> answered, that God commanded not things difficult as it is in the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and that matters ought to be ordered in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to time and place, and making short prayers once before day, then twice in the hour of light, and twice after it is dark, the duty is complyed with.</p>
               <p>Another question of the same nature was proposed to the <hi>Mufti,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Kiblah</hi> or holy place of <hi>Mecha,</hi> to which they are obliged to turn their faces in their prayers; how at Sea where they had no mark, especially such bad Geographers as commonly the <hi>Turks</hi> are, it is possible to comply with that necessary formality required in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; the <hi>Mufti</hi> resolved this doubt almost like the former, prescribing a kind of circular motion in prayers, by which means they cannot miss of having at some time their faces towards the Holy City, which in a case of so much difficulty is a sufficient compliance with the duty.</p>
               <p>Many cases of this nature are proposed to the <hi>Mufti;</hi> and many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular rules of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> required, one of which is remarkable, that <hi>Busbequius</hi> relates, that occurred in his time during the Wars between the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Sultan Solyman:</hi> whether a few Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians taken Captives by the Grand Signior, might be exchanged with many <hi>Turks</hi> in the hand of the Emperour. It seems the <hi>Mufti</hi> was greatly perplexed and puzzeled in the resolution; for sometimes it seemed a disesteem to the value of a <hi>Turk</hi> to be rated under the price of a Christian; on the other side, it appeared want of charity and care of the interest of the <hi>Mosselmans</hi> to neglect real terms of advantage on such aery and subtle points of formality. In fine he consulted his Books, and declared that he found two different Authors of great authority of contradictory opinions in this controversie; and therefore his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to incline to that which had most of favour &amp; mercy in it. The <hi>Mufti</hi> whilst qualified with that title, is rarely put to death, but first degraded, and then becomes liable to the stroak of the Executioner; but in cases of notorious crimes or conviction of Treason, he is put into a Mortar for that intent remaining in the Prison called the seven Towers at <hi>

               <p>The next office to the <hi>Mufti</hi> is <hi>Kadeleschere</hi> or Judge of the Militia, otherwise Judge Advocate, who hath yet power of determination in any other Law Suits whatsorver; for this priviledge the Souldiery of this Country enjoys, to have a power extensive over all other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of people, but to be only subject themselves to the Government of their own Officers; this office a <hi>Mufti</hi> must necessarily pass through, and discharge with approbation before he ascends the top and height of his Preferment.</p>

               <p>The principal <hi>Muschs</hi> and those of richest endowment (as in all reason ought) are those of Royal Foundations, called in <hi>Turkish, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin Giameleri;</hi> over which the Prime Superintendent is the <hi>Kuzlir Aga,</hi> or the chief Black Eunuck of the <hi>Sultans</hi> Woman; and in his power it is to distribute all considerable offices of Ecclesiastical Preferment rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Royal <hi>Moschs,</hi> which office makes a considerable addition to his other power and Revenue: for there are many of those <hi>Moschs</hi> in divers places of the Empire; but especially where the <hi>Sultans</hi> do or have resided as <hi>Prusa, Adrianople</hi> and <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Royal <hi>Moschs</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> are <hi>Santa Sophia, Sultan Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> who Conquered this City. <hi>Sultan Bajazet, Sultan Selin, Sultan Soylman, Schezade</hi> or the Son of <hi>Sultan Soylman, Sultan Ahmet,</hi> and three other <hi>Moschs</hi> built by the Queen Mothers, one of which was lately erected and richly indowed by the Mother of this present <hi>Sultan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall scarce adventure to acquaint my Reader with the particular Revenue belonging to all these Royal Edifices; but certain it is they have Rents as noble and splendid as their Founders; for example of which, I shall instance only in that of <hi>Santa Sophia,</hi> built by <hi>Justinian</hi> the Emperour, and re-built by <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and was the Metropolis of old <hi>Bizantium,</hi> and the Mother Church belonging to the Patriarchal See of <hi>Greece,</hi> is still conserved sacred and separated for use of Divine Service; of the Revenue of which <hi>Mahometan</hi> Barbarism and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath made no Sacrilegious Robbery, but maintained and improved and added to it, in that manner that the in-come may equal any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious foundation of Christendom; for when I had the curosity of procuring from the Registers of that Church, distinctly all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Gifts, Benefices, Lands, Monies at interest, and other endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments belonging thereunto, and offered according to my ability some thing considerable, to have a true Copy of the riches and annual Rent of the place; the Keepers of those Lists would perswade me (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of ostentation, or scruple of sin to make one of my faith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the particulars of their Religious offerings) that the Wealth, rent and account of all those Royal endowments are so many, that as they are distinctly set down, fill a Volume, and the knowledge of them is the study alone of those who are designed to this service: but in general I am given to understand, by those who magnifie not matters beyond their due computation: That the Revenue amounts to about one hundred thousand <hi>Zechins</hi> a year; which proceeds not from any Lands or Duties raised without the Walls of the City, but all from within; the <hi>Sultan</hi> himself being a Tenant to that place, paying or acknowledging a Rent of one thousand and one Aspers a day for the ground on which the <hi>Seraglio</hi> stands on, being in times of the Christian Emperours some part of the Sanctuary or Gardens dedicated to the use of that stately Temple, which the <hi>Turks</hi> esteemed Sacrilegious to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate entirely from the holy Service to which it was assigned; though the admirable situation thereof rendred it unfit for other habitation, then the enjoyment of the <hi>Sultan;</hi> did therefore think fit to oblige the Land to a Rent, adding the odde Asper as a signification, that the thousand Aspers were not a sufficient consideration for the use of the Church Lands; and might therefore be augmented as the piety
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55345:64"/>
and devotion of succeeding Emperours should move them.</p>
               <p>It is reported by the <hi>Turks,</hi> that <hi>Constantinople</hi> was taken upon a <hi>Wednesday;</hi> and that on the <hi>Friday</hi> following (which is their <hi>Sunday</hi> or <hi>Sabbath</hi> as we may call it) the victorious <hi>Sultan</hi> then first entituled Emperour, went with all Magnificent Pomp and Solemnity to pay his Thansgiving and Devotions at the Church of <hi>Sancta Sophia;</hi> the Magnificence of which so pleased him, that he immediately added a yearly Rent of 10000 <hi>Zechins</hi> to the former endowments; for the maintenance of <hi>Imams</hi> or Priests, Doctors of their Law, <hi>Talismans</hi> and others, who continually attend there for the Education of youth, teaching them to read and write, instructing them also in the principles of their Law and Religion.</p>
               <p>Other Emperours have since that time, errected near unto it their <hi>Turbe</hi> or Chappels of burial, in one of which lies <hi>Sultan Selim,</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Sarhose,</hi> or the drunken, with his hundred Children; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with have conferred a maintenance of Oyl for Lamps and Candles which burn day and night, and a provision for those who attend there in prayer for their souls departed; to which opinion the <hi>Turks</hi> (as I have said already) are generally inclinable, though not preached or inforced on any mans belief as an Article of Faith. Over and above this expence, there is daily provision made for relief of a multitude of poor, who at certain hours appear at the Gates of this Temple, and receive their daily sustenance; whatsoever advances as yearly great summes are laid up in the Treasury, is numbred with the riches of the <hi>Mosch,</hi> and remains for the service of that place, as for the reparation, or building thereof, in case of fire or other accidents.</p>
               <p>Besides the sumptuous Edifices of the body of the Royal <hi>Moschs,</hi> there are annexed unto them certain Colledges for Students in the Law called <hi>Tehmele,</hi> out-houses for Kitchins, where the poors Meat is dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, Hospitals called <hi>Timarhanelar, Hans,</hi> or Houses of Lodging for Strangers or Travellers, publick Fountains, shops for Artizans, and whole Streets of low Cottages for habitation of the poor, whose stock reaches not to a higher Rent.</p>
               <p>All these appendages bring some Revenue to the <hi>Mosch,</hi> which is constantly paid in to the Rector or President thereof, called <hi>Mutevelli;</hi> but because this is not a sufficient maintenance, there are divers Lands, Villages, Mountains, Woods and whole Countries assigned to this use called <hi>Wakfi,</hi> which are hired out at certain Rents for the behoof and benefit of the <hi>Moschs;</hi> some rents being paid in Corn, others in Oyl, and all sorts of Provisions; and out of every new Conquered Country, some part thereof is assigned to the use of <hi>Moschs</hi> of modern Fabrick; as now from the Country gained lately about <hi>Newhausell</hi> (which as I am informed from those who gave in the account to the Grand Signior, there are two thousand Villages which pay Contribution to the <hi>Turk</hi>) are assigned certain Lands for encrease of the rent of the <hi>Moschs</hi> built at <hi>Constantinople</hi> by this present Queen Mother: which rents are sometimes raised by the way of Tenths or Tithes, not that the <hi>Turks</hi> make Tithes a duty or rule for the maintenance of persons, places and things consecrated to Divine Service, but as they find it a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and equal expedient in some Countries for leviation of their rents.

               <p>According to this Doctrine, none ought to avoid or fear the Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Plague; <hi>Mahomets</hi> precepts being not to abandon the City<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house where Infection rages, because God hath numbred their dayes and predestinated their fate; And upon this belief, they as familiarly attend the Beds and frequent the company of Pestilential persons, as we do those that are affected with the Gout, Stone or Ague. And though they evidently see that Christians, who fly into better Airs, and from infected habitations, survive the fury of the years Pestilence, when whole Cities of them perish and are depopulated with the Disease; yet so far is this opinion rooted amongst them, that they scruple not to strip the contagious shirt from the dead body, and to put it on their own, nor can they remove their aboad from the Chambers of the sick; it being the custom in the Families of great men to lodge many Servants on different Palets in the same room, where the diseased and healthful lie promiscuously together, from whence it hath happened ofter, that three parts of a <hi>Pashaws</hi> Family, which perhaps hath consisted of two hundred men, most youthful and lusty, have perished in the heat of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Augusts</hi> Pestilence. And in the same manner many whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies every Summer have perished, and not one surviver left to claim the inheritance of the house; for want of which the Grand Signior hath become the proprietor.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law obliges them not to abandon the City, nor their houses, nor avoid the conversation of men infected with the Pestilence where their business or calling employs them; yet they are counselled not to frequent a contagious habitation, where they have no lawful affair to invite them. But yet I have observed, in the time of an extraordinary Plague, that the <hi>Turks</hi> have not confided so much to the precept of their Prophet, as to have courage enough to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the dread and terrour of that slaughter the sickness hath made; but have under other excuses fled to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>THere is no consideration more abstruse and full of distraction, then the contemplation of the strange variety of Religions in the world: how it is possible that from the rational soul of man, which in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is of little difference in it self, and from that one principle, which is the adoration of a Diety, should proceed such diversities of Faiths, such figments and Ideas of God, that all Ages and all Countries have abounded with superstitions of different natures; And it is strange to consider, that Nations who have been admirably wise, judicious and profound in the Maximes of their Government, should yet in matters of Religion give themselves over to believe the Tales of an old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a <hi>Pythoness,</hi> or the dreams and imaginations of a melancholy <hi>Hermite.</hi> And it is as strange that men who embrace the same princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Religion, and have the same true and infallible Foundation, should yet raise such different and disproportionate Fabricks, that most should make their superstructure of Straw and Stubble, and but few of a substantial and durable Building, without uniformity, harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or agreement each to other. For resolution of which difficulties, nothing can be said more then that the god of this world hath blinded the hearts of them that believe not, <hi>Lest the light of the glorious Gospel</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. v. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>of Christ who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion is also one of the prodigious products of Reasons superfaetations, which hath brought forth nothing good, nor rational in this production, more then the confession of one God. And yet even herein also are diversities of Sects, Opinions and Orders, which are maintained in opposition each to other, with emulation and zeal by the professours, with heats, disputes and separations, terming the contrary parties prophane and unholy; the particulars of which Sects and diversity in their Tenents, I shall as far as I have seen or could learn, set down and describe, having with the more curiosity and diligence made the stricter enquiry, because I have not read any Author which hath giving a satisfactory account of such Sects as are sprung up amongst them in these latter and modern times.</p>
               <p>It is a common opinion, that there are seventy two Sects amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> but it is probable there are many more, if the matter were exactly known and scanned. The <hi>Turkish</hi> Doctors fancy that the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Nations which they call (<hi>

In this manner they account seventy different Sects amongst the Jews, seventy one amongst the Christians, and to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> they assign one more, as being
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55345:66"/>
the last and ultimate Religion, in which, as all fulness of true Doctrine is completed, so the Mystery of iniquity, and the deviation of mans judgment, by many paths from the right rule, is here terminated and confined.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have amongst themselves as well as in other Religions, Sects and Heresies of dangerous consequence, which daily encrease mixing together with them many of the Christian Doctrines (which shall in their due place be described) and in former times also a sort of phanatick <hi>Mahometans</hi> which at first met only in Congregations under pretence of Sermons and Religion, appeared afterwards in Troops armed against the Government of the Empire.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Turk</hi> also accuses the <hi>Persian</hi> of corrupting the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> that they have altered words, misplaced the Comma's and Stops, that many places admit of a doubtful and ambiguous sense, so that those <hi>

               </p>
               <p>If you had (sayes he) no other Heresie then the rejection of those elevated familiars of <hi>Mahomet, viz. Omar, Osman</hi> and <hi>Ebbubecher,</hi> your crime would notwithstanding be so great as were not expiable by a thousand years of prayer or pilgrimage in the sight of God; but you would be condemned to the bottomless Abisse of Hell, and deprived for ever of Celestial Bliss; and this sentence of mine is confirmed by the same opinion of the four <hi>Imams,</hi> viz. <hi>Imam Azem, Imam Schafi, Imam Malick,</hi> and <hi>Imam Hambeli;</hi> and therefore I friendly admonish you to correct this errour in your selves; and likewise in your Schollar King <hi>Abbas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor are you contented to pass with this single errour, whereby you have gained the name of <hi>Kyzilbaschi,</hi> that is, <hi>Persian</hi> Hereticks, but you are become as abominable as the <hi>Durzi</hi> (a people that lives about Mount <hi>Libanus</hi>) of bad esteem and reputation, corrupted in all points of Doctrine and manners; so that I cannot but pass this black sentence upon you, that it is lawfull in a Godly zeal to kill and destroy you for the Service of God; your Tenents being refuted by <hi>Giafer Efendi,</hi> who hath branded the <hi>Persians</hi> for <hi>Pagans,</hi> and in seventy several places of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and the very words of <hi>Mahomet</hi> demonstrated the clearness of their errour.</p>
               <p>If the Christian only for saying there is a Trinity in God is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for Life and Estate, why should the <hi>Persian</hi> expect better quarter, who is stigmatized for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of the first rank is,</p>
               <p>That you esteem your selves obliged to assemble at the <hi>Moschs,</hi> but not to prayers: for what signifies your meeting, if not to prayers? <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself sayes, that he who repaires to the Congregation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a design of prayer, is a Hypocrite and a Dissembler, is accursed of God, nor shall be blessed in his House or Estate, the good Angels shall abandon him, the Devils shall attend him, nor shall he ever prosper in this world, or in the world to come.</p>
               <p>In answer hereunto you say, that the antient Order of Priests is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, that you have none whose pious lives enable to preach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct you, or to be your leader to holy prayer in the Publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Do there want pious and holy persons of the race of <hi>Mahomet?</hi> if there do not, why do not you imitate and follow them? but you are enemies, and in open Hostility to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Family, and excuse your selves from the use of Priests or <hi>Imams,</hi> because their innocence cannot equal that of Infants. In this point (it is true) you have something of reason; for your <hi>Imams</hi> are not only Insidels in Doctrine, but defiled in their conversation; and your king who is your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Priest, frequents Stews and the Styes of deformed Lust, ravishing fair

               <p>Why do not you ask your Pilgrims who come from <hi>Mecha,</hi> what mean these four Altars in the <hi>Mosch,</hi> which are the places of prayer designed to the four several Orthodox Sects? why take you not exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from these? but you are still perverse and obstinate, haters of God and his Prophet; What will you answer at the day of judgement before <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his four Friends? who long since being dead, you revive their Ashes with ignominie, erecting their Statues at your Marriages in Sugar, and afterwards in contempt hew them down to yield pastime and occasion of laughter to the Spouses and their Guests.</p>

               <p>We shall not insist here to multiply many of these Sects, who have almost as many diversitiesamongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> as there are Schools and Masters; every <hi>Hogia</hi> that is but a form above a meer Pedagogue, and reads a few Books of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Fables, esteems himself of mean ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, if by some singular opinion which he instills into his Disciples, he distinguishes not his Gymnasion from the common and inferiour Schools. But these men in framing their particular fancies, and vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their follies have a special care that none of their principies op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne those five points of practice, and one of faith, mentioned in the first Chapter of this Book, which are the essential points that consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a <hi>Mahometan;</hi> or derogate from the Authority of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or produce factions or disturbances in the State.</p>
               <p>But these Modern times have produced other Sects amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> some of which seem in part dangerous, and apt to make a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable rupture in their long continued union; when time changes and revolutions of State shall animate some turbulent spirits, to gather Souldiers and followers under these Doctrines and other specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>

that the Heavens, Sun, Moon and Stars have thence their Original and motion, and that man himself rises and fades like the grass or flower; It is strange to consider, what quantities there are of men that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this principle in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> most of which are <hi>Kaddees</hi> and learned men in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Legends, and others are Renegadoes from the Christian faith, who conscious of the sin of their Apostacy, and therefore desirous that all things may conclude with this world, are the more apt to entertain those opinions which come nearest to their wishes. One of this Sect called <hi>Mahomet Effendi,</hi> a rich man, Educated in the knowledge of the Eastern Learning, I remember, was in my time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted for impudently proclaiming his blasphemies against the being of a Diety; making it in his ordinary discourse, an argument against the being of a God, for that either there was none at all, or else not so wise as the Doctors preached he was, in suffering him to live who was the greatest enemy and scorner of a Divine essence that ever came into the world. And it is observable, that this man might notwithstanding his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation have saved his life, would he but have confessed his errour, and promised for the future an assent to the principles of a better: but he persisted still in his blasphemies, saying, That though there were no reward, yet the love of truth obliged him to dye a Martyr. I must confess untill now, I never could believe that their was a formal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism in the world, concluding that the principle (of the being of a God) was demonstrable by the light of nature; but it is evident now how far some men have extinguished this light and lamp in their souls.</p>
               <p>This poisonous Doctrine is so Infectious, that it is crept into the Chambers of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> into the apartments of the Ladies and Eunuchs, and found entertainment with the <hi>Pasha's</hi> and their whole Court; this sort of people are great favourers and lovers of their own Sect, courteous and hospitable to each other, and if any by chance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a Guest within his Gates of their own judgement, besides his Diet and Fare with much freedom, he is accommodated with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Bed-fellow of which Sex he most delights: they are very frank and liberal and excessive in their readiness to do each other service; It is said, that <hi>Sultan Morat</hi> was a great favourer of this opinion in his Court and Militia, desirous withall to propagate that of <hi>Kadizadeli</hi> amongst the vulgar, that they being a severe, morose and covetous people, might grow rich, and spare for the benefit of his Exchequer; for the Sect of <hi>Kadizadeli</hi> before mentioned, is of a melancholy and Stoical temper, admitting of no Musick, chearful or light discourses, but confine themselves to a set Gravity; in publick as well as private they make a continual mention of God, by a never wearied repetition of these words, <hi>Ilahe ila Ellah;</hi> that is, I profess there is one God: there are some of these that will sit whole nights bending their bodies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Earth, reciting those words with a most doleful and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Note: they are exact and most punctual in the observation of the rules of Religion, and generally addict themselves to the study of their Civil Law, in which they use constant exercises in arguing, opposing and answering, whereby to leave no point undiscovered or not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed. In short, they are highly Pharisaical in all their comportment, great admirers of themselves, and scorners of others that conform not

to their Tenets, scarce affording them a salutation or common commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; they refuse to marry their Sons with those of a different rite, but amongst themselves they observe a certain policy; they admonish and correct the disorderly; and such who are not bettered by their perswasions they reject and excommunicate from their Society. These are for the most part Tradesmen, whose sedentary life affords opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and nutriment to a Melancholly, and distempred fancy.</p>
               <p>But those of this Sect who strangely mix Christianity and <hi>Mahometa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi> together, are many of the Souldiers that live on the confines of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bosna;</hi> reading the Gospel in the <hi>Sclavonian</hi> tongue with which they are supplyed out of <hi>Moravia,</hi> and the neighbouring City of <hi>Ragusa;</hi> besides which, they are curious to learn the Mysteries of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and the Law of <hi>Arabick</hi> tongue; and not to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rude and illiterate they affect the Courtly <hi>Persian.</hi> They drink wine in the month of Fast called the <hi>Ramazan,</hi> but to take of the scandal they refuse Cinnamon or other Spices in it, and then call it <hi>Hardali,</hi> and passes currant for lawful liquor.

               <p>Another subtil point about the Divine Attributes hath begot a Sect amongst the <hi>Jenizaries,</hi> called <hi>Bektaschi</hi> from one <hi>Becktash,</hi> which seems an improper subject so deep in the Metaphysical speculation to trouble such gross heads as theirs; they began (as it is said) in the time of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, and are called by some <hi>Zerari;</hi> that is, those who have Copulation with their own kindred, and by the vulgar, <hi>Mumsconduren,</hi> or extinguishers of the Candle. This Sect observe the Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> in Divine Worship, with a strictness and superstition above any of the Precisions of that Religion: but hold it unlawful to adjoyn any attributes to God by saying, that God is great or God is merciful, by reason that the nature of God being infinite and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible, cannot fall under the weak and imperfect conceptions of mans understanding, which can imagine nothing applicable to his nature. Of this Sect there was a famous Poet amongst the <hi>Turks</hi> called <hi>Nemisi,</hi> that was flead alive, for saying, when the <hi>Emaum</hi> called the people to prayers at the ordinary hours from the Steeple with the usual word, <hi>Allah Ek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> God is one, that he lyed upon the supposition that no Epithite can be predicated of the Divine Essence. Amongst the <hi>Jenizarites</hi> are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent many principal Commanders of this Sect; but formerly were more in the time of <hi>Becktash Aga, Kul Kahya, Mahomet Aga,</hi> and others, who for their Rebellion in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> (as we related before) were put to death under the Historical Pillar in the time of this present Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Minority.

Copulation promiscuously with their own Kindred, the Fathers mixing with their Sons and Daughters, without respect to proximity of bloud or nearness in the degrees of relation, suffering themselves to be transported contrary to the abhorrency of Nature, by a weak and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical comparison of the lawfulness and reason, that he who engraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Tree, and planted the Vine should rather taste of the Fruit, then resign the benefit of his labours to the enjoyment of others; and in this Argument act against the inclination of innate modesty, according to that of <hi>Seneca.</hi>

               <p>These people are easily induced to give false witness or testimony in the favour of their Sect, without consideration of Equity or reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of their cause; by which means invading the right of others they became rich and powerful, untill they were debased by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of <hi>Becktashes</hi> Authority and Power of other potent favourers of their Sect: and though afterwards upheld by <hi>Sudgi Beker,</hi> a Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard Bearer of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> a rich and learned man, they received a second blow by his death, be executed by a Visier <hi>Kupriuli Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> for his diversity in Religion and Wealth together; but farther animosity against this Sect was dissembled at that time, by reason of the multitude of those professors in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and because reason of State saw it at that time necessary to draw bloud in many parts of the Empire for other causes, then for Errours in Religion.</p>
               <p>The Sect called <hi>Sabin,</hi> though <hi>Mahometans</hi> in profession seem yet to run contrary to the stream and general consent of all its professors who give themselves commonly the Title of Enemies and Confounders of Idolatry, and yet these notwithstanding seem from the influence, the Sun and Moon have on sublunary bodies, of all living sensative crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do conclude a certain Divinity in those common lights of the world.

They are not apt to believe the immortality of the soul, nor the reward of Vertue, or punishment of Vice in the next world; nor prone to vindicate themselves from inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, reproachful language, or other evil actions of men, but regarding them as the natural effects of the Celestial influences, are no more provoked by them than we are with a shower of Rain for wetting us, or the intense heat of the Sun in the Summer Solstice.</p>

This happening at the same time that the Funerals of a <hi>Mufti</hi> called <hi>Behai Efend,</hi> were then so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing, afforded an occasion of Discourse concerning the soul of the <hi>Mufti</hi> and Dog together; the Dorgist demanding the opinion of his Guest, whether he conceived the soul of that <hi>Mufti</hi> was predestinated to remain within the confines of the Grave, untill the day of Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection? in the knowledge of which question <hi>Albertus</hi> seeming wholly ignorant, and desirous to understand the solution from him; the Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist began freely to declare that the souls of men deceased enter into the bodies of Beasts, which are in temperament most agreeable to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of those whom before they animated; as the soul of the glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton enters into the Swine, the soul of the lascivious into the Goat, of the generous into the Horse, of the vigilant into a Dog, and so the like; in proof of which he produced a Book treating of all the distinctions of nature, and the proper assignments for their habitation after death: adding moreover, that of this opinion it was pitty there was so few in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> some there were, and those all of his own Trade and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, but that at <hi>Gran Cairo</hi> were great numbers, strict adherers to this Doctrine; that for his part he prayed to God with the rest of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the same Trade, that their souls may hereafter be so honoured as to inform the body of the <hi>Camel;</hi> because they are Beasts that are laborious, abstemious, patient and meek, and bring their Dorges from the remotest parts of the East: and that he did not doubt but after the Circle of 3365. years, that his soul had travelled for several Ages through the world, and wandred from the body of one <hi>Camel</hi> to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate another; it should with the vicissitude of time return again to a humane body, more purifyed and refined than in its first principles.

This man both extrinsecally as to appearance in the world, and intrinsecally as to his devout soul, was famous and renowned for the Miracles he worked; on which Fabrick <hi>Sultan Selim</hi> afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed a fountain of water.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Ebrbuhar</hi> Schollar of <hi>Nacsbende,</hi> taking into his Company the assistance of <hi>Abdullah</hi> and <hi>Ilahi</hi> and <hi>

               <p>Their actions were governed with Meekness, Gravity and Silence, and laying aside all Superstitious Worships, they exercise themselves in pious actions; their discourses amongst themselves were nothing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the things of the world, but of Matters relating to a future life.</p>

               <p>As to the Holy <hi>Emir Ebrbuhar,</hi> whose Mysterious life may God san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie to us; was nourished with Bread made of Barley, Oil of Olives, Honey and Grapes, and abstained from all things of a strong scent or savour, he eat but three times a year, giving himself continually to Fasting and Prayer; he was a man of great Sanctity, full of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, his attractive vertue was grateful to all, to his Feet from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Countries were many diseased persons brought, which afterwards returned sound and healthful to their own homes; all which is the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Doctor and great admirer of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion.</p>

they would excuse the courtesie of due Hospitality, stretching his arms first towards Heaven, and then bowed down and gathered a Rose leafe which he laid on the water, which before had filled the dish: by which piece of ingenuity, he not only confuted the parable of the Churlish <hi>Babylonians,</hi> but also so took with them, that they registred it as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of wisdom, and bringing him into their City with triumph, made him the Superiour of all their Orders.</p>

               <p>The Religious of this Order wear on their heads white Caps of several pieces with Turbants of Wool, twisted in the fashion of a Rope, they observe constantly the hours of prayer, which they perform in their own Assemblies; they go Cloathed in White, and praise the Unity of God, crying, <hi>Hu</hi>

(which is, may be live) and by these means obtain the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Santone</hi> hath many millions of Disciples and Followers; now all the <hi>Janizaries</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port are professors of the same Religion.

               <p>IN the time of <hi>Orchanes</hi> the second King of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who Governed thirty five years and Reigned eighty three, and dyed in the <hi>Hegira</hi> of <hi>Mahomet</hi> seven hundred and sixteen, there lived in <hi>Prusa,</hi> then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Seat, a famous <hi>Santone</hi> called <hi>Herewi,</hi> who used to walk up and down, and as an act of charity to buy the Livers and Lights of Beasts to feed Cats and Dogs; he professed poverty and severe mortification with Tears and Sighs, which he acted with that fervency that the Angels
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55345:82"/>
leaving heaven, came to be witness of his holy penance. The fame of which moved <hi>Sultan Orchanes</hi> to discourse with him, and to know the story of his past life; which he smiling began to recount, and told him, that he formerly was a King derived from the Line of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> had compassed with his arms the Rivers of <hi>Nilus, Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris,</hi> had governed Provinces with his Sword and Scepter, had been gloriously and triumphantly adorned with precious Stones and glittering Arms, and had made the world tremble at the very mention of his name. But at last considering the vanity of this world, he resolved on a solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life, and to renounce all the follies and small satisfactions of riches and empty honours. At which saying, <hi>Sultan Orchanas</hi> was amazed, and said, We ought not to despise those who under the guise and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of mad and distracted persons wander through the world; for their vertues are rare; and in this man particularly I discover so much of sanctity that I judge my self unworthy the name of one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And this is the reason, why Fools and Frantick people have ever since been had in Honour and Reverence amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> as those whom Revelations and Enthusiasms transported out of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary temperament of humanity.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Herewi</hi> was very Learned and Experienced in Chymistry; and to those who professed his Order and entred into the regular life of his Religion, instead of Aspers he bestowed Gold; he wore a Green Vest; and lived very abstemiously; he mended his own Cloaths, and dressed the Dyet for his Convent. He endowed many <hi>Moschs</hi> and several Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals of Charity at <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> His Sepulcher is at <hi>Prusa,</hi> which is greatly visited by Pilgrims, and adorned by the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Munificence of those who reverence the Memory of this holy <hi>Santone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the best relation I could procure from one of the <hi>Sheighs</hi> or Preachers, and one that was Prior of this Order, whose example, as the original Copy, others of this Order imitate. They have a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as all the others before mentioned, besides which in this Capital City, nor in any parts of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Dominions in Europe, have I observed any <hi>Teke</hi> or Monastery, where <hi>Turks</hi> profess to lead a Religious life, but is one of the Orders before mentioned; some others there may be about <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and remotest parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> whose names and constitutions I have not repeated here, who have (as I am informed) somewhat more of ridiculous and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worship amongst them then I have declared in the account I have given of those I have been acquainted with in the parts I have travelled; yet it is observable they all of them pretend to poverty, as the nearest way to arrive the happiness of Paradise; but with their poverty (as I have seen in some of their <hi>Tekes</hi> where I have been, especially those removed from Cities) they mix so much negligence in their living, not caring for neatness in their Houses, but leave all things in a disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and confused manner, as testifies their laziness as well as poverty; And are not like the Cells of <hi>Capuchins,</hi> who having nothing to attend to besides their Prayers and Gardens, improve all things with that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as graces Poverty, and convinces the World that in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate enjoyment of it there is more satisfaction, then in those vexations which attend the disposal and government of heaps of riches, and the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55345:82"/>
satiety of opulency and plenty. It is worth nothing also; that on the Monuments of <hi>Santones</hi> and in the Gardens, or before the Gates of these Religious, there is alwayes some ridiculous adornment such as agrees with the fancy of Bedlams; as Crowning the Hearse of the dead with Beads, and Horns, and Ribbonds, and pieces of Tinsel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their doors with the like; accounting it a chief disposition to Divine Service to have a mind endued with an humour inclining to the fancy of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriacal or distracted heads, so that I shall not enlarge farther in this Discourse, nor to glut my Reader with so Insipid and Fulsome a subject.</p>

The Woman is not there present, but appears by her Father or some of her nearest Relations, and is afterwards by a great attendance of Women brought covered, sitting a stride on Horse-back under a Canopy to the Habitation of her Bridegroom, who remains at the Gate with open arms to receive her; there is great Rejoycing and Feasting hereat, the night before she is brought to the Company of her Husband; but when the precedent Ceremonies to the Marriage are performed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, the House is all silent, and she is brought into the Bride-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by an Eunuch (if she be of Quality) if not, by some Women of near Relation, and delivered to her Husband, who is himself to untie her Drawers, and undress her for his bed, not unlike the custom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Romans</hi> of <hi>Zonam solvere.</hi>

               <p>This restraint of the number of their Wives is certainly no Precept of their Religion, but a rule superinduced upon some politick conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as too great a charge and weakning to mens Estates, every one that takes a Wife being obliged to make her a Kabin or Dowry, as we have said before; or else for better Regulation of the oeconomies, and to prevent and abate somewhat of the Jealousies, Strifes and Embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a Family, which must necessarily arise between so many Rivals in the affection of one Husband who is obliged by Law and Covenants, to deal and bestow his benevolence and conjugal kindness in an exact proportion of equality. And least this consinement to a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Wives, should seem a restriction and impeachment of that liberty and free use of Women which they say, God hath frankly bestowed on man; every one may freely serve himself of his Women Slaves, with as much variety as he is able to buy or maintain; and this kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubinage is no wayes envyed or condemned by the Wives, so long as they can enjoy their due maintenance, and have some reasonable share in the Husbands bed, which once a week is their due by the Law; for if any of them hath been neglected the whole week before, she challenges <hi>Thursday</hi> night as her due, and hath remedy in that case against her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band by the Law; and if she be so modest as not to sue him for one weeks default, she is yet so ingenious to contrive a supply of her wants: And whereas these Women are Educated with much retiredness from

the conversation of men; and consequently with greater inclinations towards them, and with no principles of virtue of moral honesty or Religion, as to a future state relating to the rewards or punishments of their good or bad actions; they are accounted the most lascivious and immodest of all Women, and excel in the most refined and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious subtilties to steal their pleasures; And as in Christendom the Husband bears the disgrace and scandal of his Wives incontinency; here the Horns are by the vulgar adjudged to the Father, Brothers, and Kindred; the Bloud of her Family is tainted and dishonoured, and the Husband obtaining a Divorce, quits himself of his Wife and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor together.</p>
               <p>No question but the first Institutor of this easie Religion, next to the satisfaction of his own carnal and effeminate inclination, and this taking freedom amongst his Disciples; his main consideration was the encrease of his people by <hi>Polygamie,</hi> knowing that the greatness of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and Princes consists more in the numbers and multitudes of their people, than the compass or large extent of their dominions. This freedom (if it may be called so) was granted at the beginning of the world for the propagation and encrease of mankind; and the Jews had that permission and indulgence to their loose and wandring affections, and we read that the Eastern parts of the world have abounded with Children of divers Mothers, and but one Father; and that ordinarily a Great Personage in <hi>Egypt</hi> hath been attended with a hundred lusty Sons in the field, proceeding from his own Loins, well Armed, and daring in all attempts of War. But yet this course thrives not so well amongst the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> as formerly; whether it be thought their accursed Vice of <hi>Sodomie,</hi> or that God blesses not so much this state of life, as when the paucity of Mankind induced a sort of a necessity and plea for it.</p>
               <p>But chiefly through the irreconcileable Emulation and Rivalry which is amongst many Wives, those Witchcrafts and Sorceries (which in this Country are very frequent) are prepared against the envyed fruitfulness each of other, that either they make an Abortive Birth, or otherwise their Children pine and macerate away with secret and hidden charms, by which means they are now observed not to be so fruitful and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as is the Marriage-bed of a single Wife; nor is the Family so well regulated, and orderly as under the Conduct and good Huswifery of one Woman, but contrarily, filled with noise, brawls and dissentions, as passes the wisdom of the Husband to become an equal Umpire and Arbitrator of their differences, which consideration restrains many, though otherwise inclineable enough to gratifie their Appetites, from incumbring themselves with so great an inconvenience; and I have known some though childless, have adhered to a single Wife, and preferred Quiet and Repose, before the contentment of their Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring.</p>
               <p>The Children they have by their Slaves, are equally esteemed with those they have by their Wives; <hi>Neque vero Turcae minus honoris defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt natis ex concubinis aut pellicibus quam ex uxoribus, neque illi minus in bona paterna juris habent,</hi> Busbeq. Ep. 1.</p>
               <p>But yet with this difference in esteem of the Law, that unless the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Manumisses them by his Testament, and confers a livelihood upon
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55345:84"/>
them by Legacy, they remain to the Charity of their Elder Brother that is born from the VVife, and are his Slaves, and he their Lord and Master; and it is with them, as in the Civil Law, <hi>Partus ventrem sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi> So that from the Loins of the same Father, may proceed Sons of a servile and ingenious condition.</p>
               <p>There is also another sort of half Marriage amongst them, which is called Kabin, when a man takes a VVife for a Month, or for a certain limited time: and an agreement is made for the price before the <hi>

                  </hi> or Judge: and this Strangers oftentimes use, who have not the gift of Continency, and are desirous to find a VVife in all places where they travel, and is the same which they term in <hi>Spain</hi> to be <hi>Emancibado,</hi> or <hi>Casado de Media Carta,</hi> only the act there is not made allowable by the Laws as in <hi>Turky.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another sort of Marriages commonly used amongst the <hi>Turks</hi> (if we may give it that honourable Title) which is the conjunction of an Eunuch with a VVoman; such I mean as are wholy disarmed of all parts of virility, do notwithstanding take many VVives, and exercise Lusts of an unknown and prodigious nature.</p>
               <p>There is also one point or restriction of Matrimony in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Religion which is observable; that is, a <hi>

               <p>And here the <hi>Turks</hi> upon occasional discourses of the severity and strictness of the Christian Discipline in matters of Concupiscence, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that no Copulation is allowable but in the Marriage Bed, and that restrained and confined to one Wife, without the additions of Slaves to satisfie with variety the corrupted fancy; that the very thoughts of Lust and Concupisence pollute the purity of the soul; <hi>And that whosoever looks on a Woman to Lust after her, commits adultery in his heart;</hi> They presently deride these our Preceps and our Laws, which Christians not only by their actions and corrupted lives contemn and invalid, but Authority it self not by a simple connivance only, but by indulgence and priviledges, foments and encourages persons walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to that which is confessed to be an indispensable Law.

This disuse of Marriage in the <hi>Sultan,</hi> hath been a Maxime of State, and reckoned amongst the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, Inter Arcana Imperii,</hi> from the time of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> untill this very Age: the reasons hereof are diversly related. <hi>Busbequius</hi> saith, That <hi>Bajazet</hi> after the great Victory obtained against him by <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> to his other great Misfortues and Disgraces, had this one added, of having his Wife <hi>Despina</hi> whom he dearly loved, to fall into the hands of the Conquerour, whose ignominious and undecent treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be fore the eyes of her Husband, was a matter of more dishonour and sorrow, than all the rest of his afflictions: so that ever since that time, the <hi>Sultans</hi> to free themselves from being capable of that disgrace, on occasion of like fortune, take no feminine companion of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in whom they may be more concerned than as in Slaves, or the loss of Goods, Riches or Estate. But in my opinion, this pollicy is of a deeper reach and design, than the consideration of matters so meerly possible; for as I have heard, the only sign and ceremony of a <hi>Sulans</hi> making a Wife, is the endowing her with Riches agreeable to her condition and quality, not called Kabin, which is <hi>Dowry,</hi> but <hi>Pashmaluck</hi> or money for her Shooes; which besides Presents, Jewels and Rich Garments for her self, and great attendance, her Revenue ought to be equal to that of a <hi>Valede</hi> or Mother of the Grand Signior, which is four or five hundred thousand Dollars yearly Rent; so that were this custom in use, and meeting with the disposition of some Prince that are Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Prodigal, the chief Revenue of the Empire would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in the Chambers of Women, and diverted from the true Channels in which the Treasure ought to run for nourishment of the Politick body of the Common-wealth. Besides were it the custom for <hi>Sultans</hi> to take wives, it would contract that main principle of Policy amongst them, of avoiding Alliances and far Relations of the Grand Signior abroad. And this was the principle reason of the murder of <hi>Sultan Osman,</hi> tenth Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> contrived
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55345:85"/>
by the Rebellion and Toleration of the Souldiery; it being objected that he had Marryed a <hi>Soltana,</hi> whereby he had contracted Alliances, contrary to the Fundamental Constitutions of the Empire.</p>
               <p>The tye and solemnity of Marriage, and the nature thereof amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> is as before related: from which the Woman hath no ways to unloose her self, whilst the Husband maintains her with Bread, Butter, Rice, Wood, and Flax to spin for her Cloathing; the Law sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses her so industrious a Huswife as with her own labour to supply her self: there are some other points pleadable in Law for Divorce in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Woman, as impotency or frigidity in the Husband, and the like; but the man hath divers means to acquit himself, and can do it by several allegations; and may upon as easie terms, and on as slight grounds iue out his Divorce, as was permitted to the Jews in cases of dislike, or that she found no favour in his eyes.</p>
               <p>There are amongst the <hi>Turks</hi> three degrees of Divorce, every one of which is made before the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> or Justice, and by him drawn out and registred. The first separates the Man and Wife only from the same House and Bed, the maintenance of a Wife being still continued; The second not only divides them in that manner, but the husband is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to make her good her Kabin, which is a Joynture or Dowry promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at her Marriage, so as to have no interest either in him or his Estate, and to remain in a free condition to Marry another. The third sort of Divorce which is called (<hi>Ouch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi>) is made in a solemn and more serious manner, with more rigorous terms of separation, and in this case, the Husband repenting of his Divorce, and desirous to re-take his Wife, cannot by the Law be admitted to her without first consenting, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himself to see another man enjoy her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> as a punishment of the Husbands lightness and inconstancy, and as an evidence to shew that though the <hi>Turkish</hi> Law is very indulgent and open in the free choice and enjoyment of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet that it punishes such as unadvisedly frustrate the solomn points thereof, with remarkable notes of infamy and disgrace. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing some afterwards repenting of their Divorce, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the condition, and have chosen some handsome youth to enter into the Bed of their Wife. It is a Merry Story that is told of one, who in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> being put to a great strait, resolved to call the first man he conveniently met to this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

There are but few amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> though some are found, who so heartily repent of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, and so fond of their separated Wives, as to be contented to take them with the foregoing condition: for it is reputed a kind of an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; and when they would signifie any matter far alienated, or estranged, they all call it (<hi>Ouch Talac</hi>) some thing so divided and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated as to be a Sin and prophanation so much as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>CIrcumcision is not reckoned amongst one of the five points which constitute a true <hi>Mahometan</hi> believer, but is only (as we have said before) proposed as a tryal and proof of mans obedience to the more necessary parts of the Law.

In this Month to drink Wine is esteemed an inexpiable Crime; and such who give themselves that liberty at other times, do yet, not to give scandal, abstain from it fourteen days before the beginning of this Month; and Women and other of the more superstitious sort, begin fifteen days their Fast before it is enjoyned by the Precept of their Prophet. Put such as are sick, or have any infirmity, or are travellers in their journey, have a permission to eat; but with that condition, as to remain obliged at other times of their health and convenience to make good those days of the <hi>Ramazan,</hi> of which they remain indebted to the performance of their Law.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Bairam</hi> is the Feast of the <hi>Turks,</hi> of which there are two in the year; one immediately following the Fast of <hi>Ramazan,</hi> as our Easter doth the Lent, which is called the great <hi>Bairam;</hi> the other is the little <hi>Bairam,</hi> which happens about seventy dayes after the former; at which time the people for three days cease from their labour, present one the other, rejoyce and take a greater liberty then at other times; which no question but was invented by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> for relaxation of the bodies and minds of his followers, as well as in imitation of the Christian Feasts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bairam</hi> is then conceived to begin at the first appearance of the new Moon after the <hi>Ramazan;</hi> which is sometime deferred a days time, if the weather prove Cloudy, that the Moon is not visible; if longer the Sky be obscured, according to the course of nature, it is presumed that the Moon is begun, and so their Feast begins also; which is published at <hi>Constantinople</hi> by the discharge of great Guns at the point of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi> upon the Sea-shoare, at which time the Lights or Lamps on the Steeples of the <hi>Moschs</hi> are extinguished or omitted to be lighted, and Drums and Trumpets are sounded in all publick places of the City and Courts of great Persons: so that every one betakes himself to Mirth and Pastime, as his own inclination or convenience leads him.</p>
               <p>But that which will be most curious to the observation of the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader, is, the relation of the Ceremonies used in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> at this Feast by the several officers of State to the Grand Signior, and to one and other; which are so formal, precise and constant to the least motion of every Member of the body, as will clear the <hi>

               <p>I may well be observed from the premises, how generally the world is mistaken in the opinion is conceived of the Courtship used amongst

the <hi>Turks,</hi> commonly reputed by Travellers to be rude, coming much short of that quaintness, bowings, cringings and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> postures used in Christendom. It is true the <hi>Turks</hi> deportment even in the most vile and mechanick vulgar, though never so mean, is carryed with a strange kind of barbarity and rudeness towards the best of Christians in those parts; which proceeds rather from a sort of pride and detestation taught them by their Religion, then from any want of being instructed in their duty of due reverence to their Superiours; For in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage one towards the other, they observe the rules and niceties of Complement with as much variety and exactness, as is exercised in <hi>Rome,</hi> or the most civilized Courts of Christendom; and amongst the chief Ministers there is much preciseness and caution used not to exceed the limits of that Ceremony which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> owe the Superiours, least they should disparage their own quality, or give occasion to the world to believe their disorderly submission to be a part of adulation. And therefore it is worthy the study of Christian Ministers employed in Embassies in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, to be well informed in the rules and manner of their carriage in presence of the chief Ministers of State; for uncovering the head, as in Christendom is amongst them esteemed ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and affrontive, and the manner of little bowings, and often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the body, taken as acknowledgments of the great distance there is between the Masters they represent; and therefore a little Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony at the entrance, and the like at departure, with a steddy and constant behaviour at the time of the treaty or discourse, is the best rule for a Christian Minister; which is interpreted amongst <hi>Turks</hi> as the effect of gravity and estimation of themselves; It being certain, that the contrary hath caused many Christian Ministers to fall lower in the reputation of the <hi>Turks,</hi> then they had deserved for their wisdom and dexterity in the management of the more substantial points of affairs.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> Of the prohibition of Swines flesh and Wine.</head>
               <p>THe five foregoing principles already treated of are (as we have said before) the essential points required towards the constitution of a true <hi>Mahometan;</hi> other matters are proofs and tryals of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; amongst which none is more enjoyned then the prohibition of Swines flesh and Wine: which are called <hi>Haram,</hi> things abominable and forbidden. The first is in reality abhorred by them, and as displeasing as the flesh of a man to civilized people, or a Dogs thigh to such as have been used to delicacies and wholsome viands. But Wine of late years, though forbidden by the Law, hath gained a better reputation, and though accursed by them, is yet accounted of so strong a temptation, that the sin is the more excusable. And though the <hi>Alchoran</hi> positively inhibits the use thereof, and the expositors of the Law have so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved it from all possibility of becoming lawful, that they have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that if Wine be spilt on the ground, and in that place grass grows, and with that Pasture a Sheep or an Ox is nourished, those Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel become <hi>Haram,</hi> and are as abominable as the flesh of Swine.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding the severe prohibitions hereof by their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Wine is so commonly used, that it is publickly drank without cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or fear of giving scandal; the great men, because in office, are more careful how the world discovers the delight they take in that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, least the miscarriages of their office should be attributed to the excess of Wine; or the knowledge of their use of that which deprives them of their reason, render them uncapable of their trust and dignity. For the <hi>Turks</hi> account it impossible to drink Wine with moderation, and are ignorant of the benefit of it for correction of crude humours and indisgestions of the stomach; and wonder to see it by <hi>English, French</hi> or <hi>Italians</hi> tempered with water; for unless they may drink it with full-bowls, and have sufficient thereof, to give them their <hi>Kaif</hi> (as they call it) that is to transport them into a dissolute Mirth, or the ridiculous actions of drunkenness, or to a surfeit or a vomit, they esteem it not worth the drinking, and a provocation to the appetite and palate to remain with a desire of demanding more.</p>
               <p>But such as would appear Religious amongst them, and are supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, morose and haters of Christians, abstain wholy from Wine, and are of a Stoical pride, melancholy temper, and censorious of the whole world. These men who drink only Water and Coffee, enter into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of State Matters, censure the actions and pass Characters on the Grandees and great Officers; <hi>Assumtâ Stoicorum arrogatiâ, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>,</hi> and yet priviledged the Taverns; because the first were melancholy places where Seditions were vented, where reflexions were made on all occurrences of State, and discontents published and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated; but Wine raised the spirits of men to a gay humour, and would never operate those effects to endanger his condition, as the Councels which were contrived in the Assemblies of those who addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to a more melancholy Liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:55345:90"/>The drinking Wine in young men is esteemed amongst the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of youth, but in old men is a crime more undecent and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in a higher degree. But why <hi>Mahomet</hi> should so severely forbid the use of Wine to his Disciples is recounted in a fable on this occasion; That their Prophet being once invited by a friend to an entertainment at his house, chanced in his way thither to be detained a while at a Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Feast, where the Guests raised with the chearful spirits of the Wine, were Merry, embracing, and in a kind temper each towards other; which pleasing humour <hi>Mahomet</hi> attributing to the effect of the Wine, blessed it as a sacred thing, and so departed. But it happening that in the Evening returning again, and expecting to see the love and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> he had before blessed to be augmented, he found the house to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, full of brawls, and noise, fightings, and all confusion; which he also having understood to be another effect of the Wine, changed his former blessing into a curse, and for ever after made it <hi>Haram,</hi> or an abomination to his Disciples.</p>

               <p>THough according to the preceding discourse, the Character that may thence result from the nature and temperament of the <hi>Turks,</hi> doth not promise any long Treatise concerning their deep morality, vertues, and elevated graces: yet in the minds of all mankind though never so barbarous, God having wrote the Law of nature, and made that impression of doing right to our neighbour, which tends towards the conservation of the world; we may well expect to find the same prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the <hi>Turks;</hi> especially their Victories and Spoils abroad, having procured them conversation with other Nations, and their Wars and Treaties with Christians, having refined their minds in a good part of that rude temper they brought with them out of <hi>Scythia,</hi> it will not be strange for us to find amongst them men, whom Education hath made civil, polished in all points of vertuous deportment, and made <hi>Heroes</hi> of their Age; though I must confess I cannot applaud the generality of this people with so high Encomiums, as I have read in the Books of some ingenious travellers, and do believe without partiality that they come short of the good nature and vertues are to be found in most parts of Christendom. Howsoever, wherein they conceive a great part of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is placed, and meritorious works, it will not be unworthy nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant to consider.</p>
               <p>Aud in the first place, they esteem it a good work to build houses, though from thence they obtain a Rent, because it is a habitation for those who have no Lands or Estates, to have them of their own. But especially such as are Princes and great men, who build <hi>Chans</hi> or Inns, which are receptacles for travellers at night, are ranked in the first or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of sacred Benefactors, and are blessed and prayed for by the weary Guests, who have found repose and refreshment through their muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence: And in these buildings the <hi>Turks</hi> are extraordinary Magnificent

in most parts of the Empire, having united to many of them a stately <hi>Moschs,</hi> Baths and Shops for Artisants and Trades-men to supply all the necessities of the travellers; and some of them are so endowed, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very night the Guests are entertained at free cost with a convenient Supper, be their number more or less according as the <hi>Chan</hi> is capable to receive. The form of these buildings is for the most part according to the model of the highest and stateliest of our Halls, covered with lead, though not altogether so high-roofed; yet some I have observed for their breadth and length very Magnificent; yet by reason that they have been somewhat lower, have only in that come short of the pride of the stateliest Fabricks: though in few of them are apartments for different companies, yet every one is sufficiently retired, having at a convenient distance different Chimnies for all parties of Guests to dress their meat, and in the winter for their fire; the greatest inconvenience to men of watchful spirits, and used to quiet retirements is the want of sleep, which untill I have been over-tired with labour, and accustomed thereto by divers dayes journeyes, hath been alwayes a stranger to my eyes, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the molestation of various companies, some of which are alwayes awake, some mending their Carts, others dressing meat, others upon their departure, that in those publick places never want noise to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb those who sleep but of one ear: These stately <hi>Chans</hi> or Inns, which with the <hi>Moschs</hi> are the only durable and magnificent buildings of the Empire, are the Edifices of certain great men, who fearing to be deprived of their riches by a hasty death, should they endeavour to continue them to their family, chuse to perpetuate their names and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their conditions by these publick works.</p>
               <p>Those who would appear of a compassionate and tender nature, hold it a pious work to buy a Bird from a cage to give him his liberty; and hold it a merciful action to buy bread and feed the Dogs, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> there is a great number of diseased Curs in all streets appropriate to no Master, but are mangy and foul, and no small causes of breeding the Plague, so frequent in all the Cities of the <hi>Turks.</hi> And this care of Dogs is accounted so charitable, that there are certain Laws made for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and maintenance of them: and it is a lighter offence to deny bread to a poor Christian who is famished in his chains, then to the Dogs of their street, which are fit for nothing but to breed Infection; and some bind themselves by a vow to give such a quantity of bread a day to the Dogs of such a street, others bequeath it by Testament; for they maintain their quarters from other wandring Curs, and joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a strange manner to preserve certain limits free from others that are not whelped and bred amongst them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Camel</hi> is another sort of Beast to which the <hi>Turks</hi> bear not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a love, but a Religious reverence, accounting it a greater sin to over-burthen and tyre them with too much labour then the Horse, because it is the Beast most common to the Holy parts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and carries the <hi>Alchoran</hi> in Pilgrimage; so that I have observed those who have the government of the <hi>Camels,</hi> when they have given water to them in a Bason, to take of the foam or froth that comes from the mouth of the Beast, and with that, as if it were some rare Balsome, with a singular devotion to anoint their Beards, and thereat with a Religious sigh groan out, <hi>Hadgi Baba, Hadgi Baba,</hi> which is as much as, Oh Father Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim,

And thus having run through the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable points of the <hi>Turkish Religion,</hi> it will be now time to take a view of their Host and Militia, being that by which their Empire is more supported, then either by their Policy in Civil Government, or Profession in Religions.</p>

               <p>In like manner the insolence of the Horse and Foot is unsupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for in their marches from one Country to another, Parties of 20 or 30 are permittted to make excursions into divers parts of their own Dominions, where they not only live upon free quarter, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort money and cloaths from the poor Vassals, taking their Children to sell for slaves, especially the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> and <hi>Servians,</hi> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Bosna</hi> and <hi>Albania,</hi> which being ignorant of the Turkish tongue, are sold for <hi>Russians, Hungarians,</hi> or <hi>Moscovites,</hi> so that rather than be exposed to so much misery, and license of the Souldiery, the poor people choose to abandon their dwellings and wander into other Cities, or seek for refuge in the Mountains, or woods of the Country. In fine, though generally the Military Offices are in the same form, and the Souldiery disposed according to the ancient Rule, and Canon, yet licentiousness and negligence have so prevailed in the Officers, as to introduce that corruption which renders them whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly altered, and estranged from their first Discipline: For the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders upon every light occasion are contented to make Otoracks

or Stipendiaries, such as enjoy the pay and priviledges of a Souldier, and yet are excused from the Wars; which they easily purchase with a small sum of money, for a scratch, or a flesh-wound gained in the Wars; wholly against the Original Institution, which designed that benefit only for maimed and disabled Souldiers; so that now there is so great a number of that Souldiery lusty and healthful, under the title of dead-mens pay, as disfurnishes the Grand Signior's Treasury, and weakens his Forces.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Janizaries</hi> also marrying freely, and yet dispensed with as to the absence from their duty and Chambers, apply themselves to Trades and other Studies besides the War, by which means having Children and dependencies, they are forced by other Arts than their few Aspers of daily pay, to seek the provision and maintenance of a Family; and their minds growing estranged from the War, are sollicitous with the care and anxiety for a Wife and Children; and in my time, have so abhorred the thoughts of the War both in <hi>Candy</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> that many have offered great Presents to be excused; and so general hath been the dislike of all kind of Martial action for the reasons before mentioned, that at first the very rumours and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of War, and afterwards the reality thereof, caused so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral a discontent, as had, if not prudently prevented and timely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, burst into a Mutiny of the Militia; whose meer enquiry but into the reasons and grounds of the War, is little different from a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>Another Corruption hath the covetousness of the Officers produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for small presents and donatives, in owning many under the title and name of <hi>Spahees,</hi> and <hi>Janizaries,</hi> which have no name or place in the Rolls, or Registers of the Souldiery; by which means many Offenders, and Outlawed persons are defended by the military priviledges; and the ancient honour due to Arms is prostituted for the maintenance and protection of the rascalities and scum of the world.</p>
               <p>And this shall serve to have spoken in general of the present state of the Turkish Souldiery; we shall now proceed to the particularities of the force and numbers of the Turkish Militia, and from whence, and how they are ra<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p>IN the twelfth Chapter of the first Book we made an estimate of the Revenue and the Riches of all the <hi>Beglerbegs</hi> and <hi>Pashaws</hi> of the Empire, by which might be collected the number of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which these great men are able out of their own Families to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish unto the Wars; it will be now time to make a just computation, in its due place, of the Forces in particular, the numbers, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries from whence they are raised, the several military orders, and the true puissance of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; which is indeed so incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

                  <p>The nature of these two, and their Institution is the same; the only difference is in their Commissions or Patents, or rather we may call them the Conveyances or Evidences for their Lands, which they have from the Grand Signior: For the Rent of a <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Timariots</hi> are of two sorts; one call'd <hi>Tezkerelw,</hi> who have the Evidences for their Land from the Grand Signiors Court, whose Rent is from 5 or 6000 Aspers, to 19<hi rend="sup">m</hi>999; for then with the addition of one Asper they enter the number of <hi>Zaims:</hi> The other sort is called <hi>Tezkeretis,</hi> who hath his Patent or Writing from the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> of the Country, whose Rent is from 3000 to 6000 Aspers.</p>

as for example, one of thirty thousand Aspers is to come attended with six, one of ninety thousand with 18 Horsemen, and so propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably: every <hi>Zaim</hi> is entitled <hi>Kiilig</hi> or Sword, so that when the Turks calculate the strength or numbers that a <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> is able to bring into the field for the service of his Prince, they make a compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon so many <hi>Zaims</hi> and <hi>Timariots</hi> themselves, which they call so many swords, not numbring the people with which they come accompanied.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Timariots</hi> are obliged to serve with lesser Tents, and to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with 3 or 4 Baskets for every man that attends them, for their Office is, besides fighting, as also of the <hi>Zaims,</hi> and <hi>Spahees,</hi> to carry earth, and stones for making Batteries and Trenches, whilest the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> are in skirmish with the Enemy. And for every three thousand Aspers rent the <hi>Timariots</hi> are sessed at a man and horse, as the <hi>Zaim</hi> is for every five thousand: And both one and the other of these Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers little differ from those in <hi>England</hi> which hold their lands in <hi>Capite,</hi> or the ancient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>These two Orders of Souldiery are not only appropriated to Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service, but some also are destined to the Sea, who are called <hi>Deria Kaleminde,</hi> and are under the command of the Captain <hi>Pashaw</hi> or Admiral: but the <hi>Zaims</hi> are most commonly dispensed with as to the Sea-service in their own persons, upon the payment of so much money as they are esteemed at in the Signiors Books, out of which <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vends</hi> are raised, and enrolled in the Registers of the <hi>Arsenal;</hi> but the <hi>Timariots</hi> can never be excused from their personal duty and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with their attendance of Souldiery, according to the value of their Lands.</p>
                  <p>Neither the one nor the other of these can be dispensed with from their personal service at Land; no excuse in time of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors Wars is lawful or pleadable: if sick, they are carried in Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Litters or Beds; if Infants, in Hampers, or Baskets, and in their very Cradles accustomed to the hardship, hazard, and discipline of War.

               </head>
               <p>IT were a work of too great labour, considering the little satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and delight it would afford the Reader, to proceed accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in describing the just numbers of those which follow these <hi>Zaims</hi> and <hi>Timariots;</hi> it will be sufficient to denote, that the smallest number of a <hi>Zaim</hi> is four men, and is the greatest of a <hi>Timariot,</hi> whose lowest condition is obliged to maintain a single man, and the highest of a <hi>Zaim</hi> to serve with nineteen; so that whosoever will survey this Turkish Host, must make his Calculate a little more or less by conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and judgment.</p>
               <p>And this difficulty is the more augmented, when I consider the fraud is used by the Accomptants, Registers, and Muster-Masters of the Grand Signiors Enrolments, who are as well acquainted with the arts and sweetness of making false Musters, as they are in the most inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious places of Christendom; and perhaps Policy may afford a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance to this fraud, for the sake of a superlative face of their Armies; which they love to express by this usual similitude, <hi>Asker reml deria misal,</hi> As innumerable as the sands of the Sea shore: but in effect the noise is greater than the reality, and he that will sum up their number, may find Arithmetick to make the account, which by the vast extent of Tents, confusion of Baggage, train of Servants, and attendants of the Camp, appears infinite in the popular estimation. Besides the Turkish Army admits of great increase and decrease by the many Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopers, as we may call them, which the <hi>Zaims</hi> for their own honour introduce to fill up their numbers on a day of muster, or appearance; so that one would admire to see, in so short a time so apparent a decay in the Turkish Camp: which abuse, the great and famous Visier <hi>Mahomet Kiupruli</hi> with cruelty and extraordinary severity endeavoured to remedy upon his expedition for recovery of <hi>Tenedos</hi> and <hi>Lemnos,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of <hi>Janoua</hi> in <hi>Transilvania;</hi> but it is impossible for one man to know, and see, and remedy all disorders, and is amongst the Turks called <hi>Aain oin</hi> a secret fraud, as difficult to be totally remedied, as it is to be throughly discovered.</p>
               <p>But that which makes the principal difference and various change herein, is the death of <hi>Zaims</hi> and <hi>Timariots;</hi> some of which holding an estate only for life, and others dying without heirs of their bodies, their Lands <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

By which means, the number of the Grand Signiors Souldiery is encreased; and it is a point very observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that as other Princes lose by the fall, and death of their Subjects; the Grand Signior is the only gainer, for of the most that are slain in a day of Battel, the Estates accrue to him, in disposal again of which,

               <p>These Partitions or Divisions were first made by <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent, as the best Rule and Method for an orderly disposition of his Militia, and as the strongest nerve of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Force: but as with Time in the most exact compositions of Discipline, corruptions through covetousness and ambition of officers are introduc'd; so also in the just disposal of these Rents according to the ancient Institutions: for the <hi>Beglerbegs, Pashaws, Treasurers,</hi> and other Officers, instead of bestowing this maintenance to the Souldiers, according to their merits of Valour, or long Service, reserve it to prefer and gratifie their Servants and Pages, obliging them in recompence thereof under various Services; some that live at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or near the Sea, to defray the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of all Boats and Vessels which carry their houshold Provisions; others that live in the inland Countries agreeing with the Treasurer of the Souldiery, without regard to the true Heirs, or any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, set to sale these Rents to them who proffer most; so that in time of Harvest the <hi>Pashaw</hi> sends abroad his Officers to gather his Profits from the poor <hi>Timariots,</hi> with that oppression and violence as causes disturbances, differences, and Lawsuits amongst them, which being to be decided by Judges partly interess'd in the Quarrel, the Sentence is certainly determined on their side who have most power and most money.</p>

that in one day, upon the assaults given <hi>Serinswar,</hi> or the new Fort of Count <hi>Serini,</hi> one <hi>Timariots</hi> Farm was bestowed eight times; one being slain it was conferred on another, and so on a third, and so on the rest; all which had the misfortune to fall, until it rested on the eighth, the others dying with the title only of <hi>Timariots.</hi>

               <p>These twelve <hi>Beghs</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> are noble by bloud, enjoying an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Estate descending from the Father to the Son; which rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness joyned with the command of a powerful Army, hath rendred them so formidable and insolent, that oftentimes they take upon them an authority to imprison and depose the <hi>Pashaw</hi> from his Office, and spoil him of all the riches he hath collected in his three years Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: by which means, are always great jealousies, and enmities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Pashaw</hi> and these <hi>Beghs;</hi> dissentions and rebellions to that high degree, that many times it hath been little different from an absolute Revolt. <hi>Ibrahim Pashaw</hi> was in the year 1664 imprisoned by them, and obtained his liberty for <note n="*" place="margin">About 100000 Dollars at <hi>Cairo.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But as there is no question but a standing Army of veterane and well-disciplin'd Souldiers must be always useful and advantageous to the Interest of a Prince; so, on the contrary, negligence in the Officers, and remisness of Government, produces that licentiousness and wrestiness in the Souldiery, as betrays them to all the disorders which are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and of evil consequence to the welfare of a State.</p>
               <p>And so it hath fared with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, which rising only by the power of Arms, and established on the blood of many valiant and daring Captains, gave Priviledges, Honours, and Riches to the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, and at all times encouraged their Prowess and forwardness by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and connivance at their Crimes; by which indulgence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, these men ill-principled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

of seditious design, and to maintain it with an impudence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to the <hi>Janizaries</hi> for some Ages, which may equal the levity of the Roman Souldiery, untill they shamelesly set their Empire to sale, and forgot both their old obedience to the Senate, and reverence to their new Emperours.</p>
               <p>The death and ruine of many Grandees, and of the Sultan himself, by such like Seditions, hath at length by dear experience taught the Principal Ministers how unsafe it is to permit an Army lodged in the bowels of the capital City, of a disposition favourable to it self, envious, and impatient of any other, jealous, and always at enmity with the Court, rich and powerful with Possessions and Rents appertaining to its Commanders in <hi>Anatolia,</hi> and a Treasury of unknown sums which have descended to the Common Bank by the decease of their Generals or <hi>Janizar Agas;</hi> and therefore have by degrees, and as prudently as might be, begun to diminish the strength of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the veterane Souldiers, and ruine of their reputation, by various arts, in the estimation of the World.</p>
               <p>The particular means whereby the <hi>Janizaries</hi> have been studiously destroy'd, are by many ways evident; for first they are exposed upon every obscure Service, and drawn forth to encounter every Assault of the Empire; as the Wars of <hi>Candy</hi> have exhausted the flower of this Militia, the Battels at Sea buried vast numbers, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for times of eminent exploits and glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Which destruction of the veterane Souldiers hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted other mischiefs to this order, in point of discipline, as prejudicial as the former; for as the <hi>Agiamoglans</hi> were obliged to perform six or seven years Novitiate, now, by reason of the constant necessities to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Wars, they overskip the orderly formalities of the first Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and create them <hi>Janizaries</hi> after a year or half a years service: And others I have known educated in Mechanick Professions, and from framing Timber and carrying Burdens in the Arsenal, have at once for the Service in <hi>Candie</hi> been created <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who neither know how to manage a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, nor are otherwise disciplin'd to any exercise of Arms.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that <hi>Europe</hi> may not be dispeopled by the triennial seisure of Christian Children for the Grand Signiors Service, which in Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish is called <hi>Deuschirme,</hi> that politick Custom and principal conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the discipline of <hi>Janizaries</hi> is, as we have said before, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgotten, and instead thereof election is made of Vagabonds, that proffer themselves out of <hi>Asia,</hi> or other parts, who having passed five or six months like Novices, are afterwards made <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and being ignorant in the use of Arms, and unaccustomed to labours and sufferings, run from their Colours, and renounce their Order, which has been in times past one of the most honourable in the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The old veterane Officers, which had by degrees and steps pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Honour methodically from inferiour Souldiers, have either by their own seditious spirits, or jealousie of the Prince, been dispeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this world, and in their places the Sons of <hi>Constantinopolitan Janizaries</hi> succeeded, who have been bred up with softness and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; and their <hi>Tchorbagees</hi> or Captains have not obtained their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55345:106"/>
by time or valour, but buy their places with money and presents to the prime Officers.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And to forward the decay of this Militia, and to take off their warlike and haughty courages, the confinement to their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is not severe, but liberty given upon colour of poverty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of livelihood on their mean pay, to attend other Trades and services, whereby the exercise of Arms and thoughts of the War is converted to mechanick Arts, and an intention to ways of maintenance of themselves and Families.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Hope of reward and fear of punishment, which are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements to worthy actions, and restrictions from the vilest crimes, are rarely held up to the <hi>Janizaries</hi> in these times for their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement or terrour; for without money to the superior Officers none of them obtains preferment; nor can any worn out with age and wounds procure dismission from the War with the enjoyment of the usual stipend, who are called by the Turks <hi>Oturak,</hi> and by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines <hi>Exauctorati;</hi> and on the contrary the children of Officers born in <hi>Constantinople</hi> are often made <hi>Oturaks</hi> in their Cradles, and lusty youths are with favour and mony exempted in the flower of their age from the labours of War, and yet enjoy the benefits due to a toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Militia.</p>
               <p>And yet, as if all the connivance at these various disorders and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the good institutions of this Souldiery were not sufficient to impoverish their Spirits, to mould them into a more effeminate temper, and cause them to lose their interest and reputation; it is the common opinion that the <hi>Vizier Kupriuli</hi> laid the designs for the late War with <hi>Germany</hi> before his death, and enjoyned it to his Son to prosecute, with an intention, amongst other expectations of benefit to the Empire, to complete the final destruction of the ancient <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hees</hi> and <hi>Janizaries,</hi> so as to be able to lay a foundation of new Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which may more easily for the future restrain the Turkish Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia within the compass of better modesty and obedience: which design hath taken so severe effect in the War of <hi>Hungary,</hi> in the year 1664. that the bloudiest part of slaughter in the Battels fell on the <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spahees,</hi> and by how much more any were more bold and forward in their attempts, by so much more fatal and hasty was their ruine; so that it is reported that the valiantest Souldiers of the Confines, the veterane and best disciplined of the <hi>Spahees</hi> and <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries,</hi> and the best number of their skilful Commanders and expert Captains perished promiscuously together, to the great damage and weakning of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> power; so that now it is not probable that a new Militia succeeding, capable of receiving other Customs and Laws, and neither remembring nor concerned in former Mutinies, will adventure to follow the seditious practices of their Predecessors; for men are commonly modest at their first entrance into any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and unless debauched by corruption in government, are easily contained within the bounds of reasonable moderation.

               <p>IN the year of our Lord 1665. the Earl of <hi>Winchelsea,</hi> our Lord Embassador for certain Affairs of His Majesty and the Company or Merchants, having commanded me to meet the Great Visier in his return from the Wars in <hi>Hungary,</hi> through ill or rather uncertain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Visiers motion, I was forced to proceed as far as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade</hi> in <hi>Servia</hi> on the Confines of <hi>Hungary,</hi> 23 days journey from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> where finding a good part of the Turkish Army encamped neer that City, for better convenience and expedition of my business, I entred within the Quarters of the <hi>Spabees,</hi> and pitched my Tent as neer the Visiers and the other principal Officers as consisted with due respect; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> which place I remained seven days, untill the Army removed towards <hi>Adrianople;</hi> and not having fully compleated my business there, I marched and remained other 13 days together with the Army: in which time I had leisure to make some reflections on the Order of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Camp.</p>
               <p>In the front of the Camp are Quarter'd the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and all others destin'd to Foot-service, whose Tents encompass their <hi>Aga</hi> or General: In the body of the Camp are erected the stately Pavilions of the Visier, of his <hi>Kahija,</hi> or chief Steward, or Councellor, the <hi>Reis Effendi</hi> or Lord Chancellor, the <hi>Tefterdar Pascha</hi> or Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, and the <hi>Kapisler Kahiasee</hi> or Master of the Ceremonies; which five Pavilions take up a large extent of ground, leaving a spacious Field in the midst, in the centre of which is raised a lofty Canopy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Offendors are corrected or executed, aud serves to shelter from the Sun or Rain such as attend the <hi>Divan,</hi> or other business with the Officers of State. Within the same space of ground also is the <hi>Hasna</hi> or Treasury, in small Chests one piled on the other, in form of a circle, for guard of which 15 <hi>Spahees</hi> every night keep a Watch with their Arms in their hands. Neer these Quarters are the Tents of <hi>Pashaws, Beghs, Agaes,</hi> and Persons of Quality, who with their Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue solely make up a considerable part of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Army. In the Reer are the Quarters of the <hi>Spahees,</hi> and others that attend the Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service, as <hi>Segbans, Sarigias,</hi> and others. On the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> hand of the Visier without the Camp, are placed the Artillery and Ammunition, which in the time I was there was inconsiderable, the great Cannon remaining in <hi>Buda</hi> and in the City of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> only 40 or 45 small Field-pieces of Brass (as I reckoned them) each drawn by four Horses, marched with the Visier, more at that time for State and Ostentation than for real Service.</p>
               <p>The Pavilions of the Great Visier, and other Persons of principal Office and Quality, may rather be called Palaces than Tents being of a large extent, richly wrought within, adorned beyond their Houses, accommodated with stately Furniture, with all the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of the City and Country, and in my opinion far exceed the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55345:109"/>
magnificences the best of their Buildings; for being but for few years continuance, the maintenance of them is beyond the expence of Marble and Porphery, or the perpetual Edifices of <hi>Italy,</hi> durable to many <hi>Olympiads</hi> and <hi>Myriads</hi> of years. With these Houses and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Habitations, which with the Posts that support them are of great weight and bulk, the Turkish Army marches daily four, five, and sometimes six hours Journey; all which baggage is carried on Horses, Mules, and Camels: The great Persons are furnished with two sets of Tents, one of which as the Visier rises, is advanced the <hi>Conack</hi> or days Journey beyond; so that in the morning leaving one Tent, another is found at noon ready furnished and provided at arrival; which is the reason why the Turkish Camp abounds with such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Camels, Mules, and Horses of Burden, with so many thousand Attendants on the Baggage, which are of a vast expence, and if duly considered, is a matter of the greatest state and magnificence in the Turkish Empire.</p>
               <p>Though it is reported by those who are Souldiers, and have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the Valour of the Turks in Fight, that their Victories are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by multitudes of Men, rather than by art, or Military Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; however the Conquests they have made on the parts of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,</hi> is a demonstration undeniable of some supereminent Order in their Army, which recompences the defect of knowledge in the true Mystery of War; and this Regulation (in my opinion) proceeds from nothing more than the strict prohibition of Wine upon pain of death (two men being executed during the time of my Residence there for bringing a small quantity of it in the Field) for hereby men become sober, diligent, watchful, and obedient. In the Turkish Camp no brawls, quarrels, nor clamours are heard; no abuses are committed on the people in the march of their Army; all is bought and paid with money, as by Travellers that are Guests at an Inn; there are no complaints by Mothers of the Rape of their Virgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughters, no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

As on the contrary, the sloth of the <hi>Germans</hi> and other Nations in their Councels against the <hi>Turk,</hi> the liberty given to the Christian Souldiery, or rather the difficulty to correct it, proceeds from nothing more than intemperance of Wine, which moves in the Souldiery a lust and promptitude to all evils, and is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the horrid outrages they commit, quarrels among themselves, and disobedience to their Officers, and betrays oftentimes a whole Army to ruine by surprisal: for how can those men be watchful, whose heads are charged with the fumes of Wine, and not yield op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of sad advantages to so awakned an Enemy as the Turk? <hi>Busbequius</hi> who had been Embassadour from the Emperour to the Grand Signior in two several Embassies, and had known and seen the vigilance of the Turkish Camp, attributes much of their success against the <hi>Germans</hi> to the ancient vice of Intemperance of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: <hi>Neque verò,</hi> saith he, <hi>graviore imperio Turcae <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55345:110"/>
from it, and therefore 2 or 3 days before the Army arrives at any place, Officers are dispatched before to seal all Taverns and make proclamation against the sail of Wine: for though it be against their Law to drink Wine, yet drunkenness is now become so common a vice amongst them (as we have already declared in the second Book) that scarce one in ten but is addicted to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Camp is always clean and free from ordure and filth; there being holes digged neer every Tent, which are encompassed about with Canvas for the more privacy and accommodation in mens neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary occasions; and whensoever these places become noisome and full, they are covered with earth, and the Canvas removed; so that the whole Camp is cleer of all excrements of men, as also kept more free from other stench (which may cause putrefaction,) than the most orderly Cities of the world. If the march be in the summer-time and the weather hot, the beasts of burden and baggage begin to travel about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>And since I have discoursed something of the Turkish Camp in this their return homewards, it will not be much from my purpose to acquaint the Reader with what cheerfulness and alacrity the Army marched this way after their ill success; and also to declare the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that put a hook into the nostrils of this great Oppressor, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him for the present from the farther spoil of Christendom. After the taking of the Castle called <hi>Serinswar</hi> by the great Vizier, built by Count <hi>Serini</hi> (the which was the first Original and occasion of the war) and the defeat of the <hi>Pashaw</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> neer <hi>Lewa,</hi> by Count <hi>Susa</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Gomorra;</hi> the Vizier made many and various attempts to pass the River <hi>Raab,</hi> to make some conquests in the parts of <hi>Croatia</hi> and <hi>Siyria,</hi> but by reason of the Forts the Christians had made along the banks of the River, in every adventure lost considerable numbers of men; at which loss of men and time, and the ill success neer <hi>Lewa,</hi> the Vizier being greatly moved, made another adventure on the twenty seventh of <hi>July</hi> 1664. advancing with the gross of his Army as far as <hi>Kerment,</hi> a place between the Rivers <hi>Raab</hi> and <hi>Terne,</hi> endeavouring there to make his passage with better success; but by the valour of the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and the assistance of the General <hi>Montecuculi</hi> were repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with extraordinary slaughter.</p>
               <p>On the first of <hi>August</hi> following the Turk made another considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attempt, and passed over in one place 6000 <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and in another where the River was foordable, and not above

ten paces broad, the whole body of the Turkish Horse crouded over in vast numbers, which caused the Christians to joyn their Forces into one Army, and retreat farther into the Country, and put themselves into a posture of giving battel to the Enemy.</p>
               <p>As soon as the Turkish Army had thus waded over the water, the night following fell so much rain, and such a deluge came powring down from the mountains, that the River which was foordable the day before, did now overswell its own banks, and not passable without Floats and Bridges. As soon as the Army was thus passed the River, the great Vizier dispatched immediately Messengers to the Grand Signior to acquaint him of his progress and passage; which news he knew would come very grateful; because in all Letters from the Grand Signior he was urged by threats and positive commands to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed forward in his march, and not to suffer the impediment of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ditch to be an interruption to the whole <hi>Ottoman</hi> force, which was never before restrained by the Ocean. The Grand Signior having received this intelligence, as if the whole Victory and Triumph over the World consisted in the passage over the <hi>Raab,</hi> was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But scarce three nights of this vain dream had passed, before the Grand Signior awakened by intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, contrary to what was presaged and expected, of the defeat of the best part of his Army, shamefully commanded the lights to be extinguished; and the remaining four nights appointed for joy, to be turned to melancholy and darkness. And indeed this rash joy was the more shameful and ridiculous, by how much more fatal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive the loss was to the Turks. For they being now got over the River, and the Christians drawn up in Battalia, a most furious fight began, which from nine a clock in the morning, until four in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon continued with variable Fortune; at length the Turks assail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the extraordinary valonr of the Christians, which were now of equal number to them, began to give back and put themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a shameful flight, leaving dead upon the place about 5000 men, and the glory of the day to the Christians: the Turks who always flye disorderly, knowing not the art of a handsome retreat, croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in heaps to pass the River, the Horse trampling over the Foot, and the Foot throwing themselves headlong into the water, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the depth, or choise of places foordable after the great rains; those sinking, catching hold of others that could swim, sunk down and perished together; others both of men and horse through the rapidness of the stream were carried down the River and swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the deeper places: the water was dyed with blood, and the

This defeat though in Christendom not greatly boasted, by reason that the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Turks, which was most by water, was partly concealed to them; yet the Turks acknowledge the ruine and slaughter to have been of a far greater number than what the Christian Diaries relate, confessing that since the time that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire arrived at this greatness, no stories make mention of any slaughter or disgrace it hath suffered to be equalled to the calamity and dishonour of this.

               <p>The minds of the Souldiery after this defeat were very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed, tending more to sedition than to obedience, every one took license to speak loudly and openly his opinion, that the War was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced upon unjust and unlawful grounds; that Comets lately seen to fall were prodigies foretelling the ill success of the War; that the total eclipse of the moon, which portends always misfortunes to the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55345:111"/>
Turks, should have caused more caution in the Commanders of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the Army, until the malignancy of that influence had been over-passed; and calling to mind the solemn Oath with which the Sultan <hi>Solyman</hi> confirmed his Capitulations with the Emperor, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly vowing never to pass the <hi>Raab</hi> or places where the Turks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their defeat, without a solid or reasonable ground of War; all concluded that this Invasion was a violation of the Vow, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the sacred memory of that fortunate Sultan, and that all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises and attempts of this War would be fatal and destructive to the <hi>Musselmen</hi> or Believers, and the end dishonourable to the Empire. This opinion was rooted with much firmness and superstition in the mind of the vulgar, and the rumours in the Camp (that the Vizier had been cause of the Souldiers flight, by commanding them to retreat after they were engaged, upon a false alarm that the Enemy in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were coming to fall on the Quarters where the Viziers person re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained; and that this error was the first original of the slaughter that ensued) augmented their discontents and animosities against the Government. The Souldiery besides was greatly terrified and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest with a fear of the Christians, and amazed upon every alarm; the Asian <hi>Spabees</hi> and other Souldiers having Wives and Children and Possessions to look after, were grown poor, and desired nothing more than in peace and quietness to return to their homes; so that nothing could come more grateful to this Camp, no largesses nor hopes could pacifie the minds of the Souldiery more than the promises and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of Peace. And this was the true cause that brought on the treaty of Peace between the Emperor and the Turk, in such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant contrary to the opinion of most in the world; and gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Vizier to embrace the Propositions offered by the <hi>Heer Reninghen,</hi> then Resident for the Emperor (who was carried about according to the motions of the Turkish Camp, to be ready to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove any overtures of Peace that might be offered): the Vizier to shew his real intentions, flattered and caressed this Resident with the Present of a Horse richly furnished, a vest of Sables and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious Tent, whilest the Propositions and Condescentions on the Turkish part were dispeeded to <hi>Vienna;</hi> which were returned again with an entire assent to most of the Articles; and those wherein there might be any difference, were to be referred until the arrival of the Extraordinary Embassador, who was supposed might reach the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Court by the end of <hi>April.</hi> The Asian <hi>Spabees</hi> were overjoyed at the news <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But this Embassador missing of his time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his arrival, above a month later then he was expected, put all things into a strange combustion.

Amongst these we passed with plenty of Provision and a hearty wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; for these people called <hi>Bulgarians</hi> inhabit all that Country to the Confines of <hi>Hungary,</hi> they till all that ground, pasture vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Cattel, and are industrious and able Husbandmen, by which means and the liberty they enjoy by the small number of Turks which live amongst them, they pass their time with some reasonable comfort, and are more commodious in wealth than they suffer to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear outwardly to the envious eye of the Turks. Their Language is the old <hi>Illyrian</hi> or <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Tongue, which hath much similitude with the <hi>Russian;</hi> because this people is said to come originally from beyond the River <hi>Volga,</hi> and so by corruption are called <hi>Bulgarians</hi> or <hi>Volgarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the third of <hi>May</hi> we arrived at <hi>Philippopolis,</hi> where we were civilly entertained at the House or Monastry of the Metropolite, or Greek Bishop of that place. By this City runs the River <hi>Hebrus,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its original from the Mountain <hi>Rhodope,</hi> in sight of which we travelled towards <hi>Sophia,</hi> of which <hi>Ovid</hi> thus speaks,</p>

               </p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Philippopolis</hi> is scituate in a large and open Plain, and Level, whereon are great numbers of little round Hills, which the Inhabitants will have to be the Graves of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions slain in those Fields. A certain <hi>Greek</hi> had once the melancholy dream of much Treasure buried in one of these Hills; and this phancy so often troubled him in his sleep, that it took a strong impression in his mind whilst he was waking, and so far troubled him, that he could take no rest nor contentment until he had eased his mind to the <hi>Nasir-Aga,</hi> who is he who oversees the Water-works and places of pleasure belonging to the Grand Signior in that Country. The Turk, though he had a great mind to the Treasure, durst not yet open the ground, until he had first acquainted the Grand Signior with the mind of the Greek, who upon the first intimation dispatch'd away Officers (so apt the Turks are in matters of profit to catch even at a shadow) to open this Hill; to which work the Country Villages were summoned; and whilst they digged very deep, not well understanding the manner and art of Mining, the Earth broke from the top, and buried seventy persons in the ruines: And so the work ended, and the Greek awaked from his dream. This Town hath one part of it built on the side of a little Hill; two others are also near it, which appear like Bulwarks or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications on that side the City; all the rest of the Country therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts being a dead Plain or Level. At this place remains no other Antiquity besides the ruines of two ancient Chappels, built of Brick, in the form of a Cross; one of which the Greeks hold in great devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and report to be the place wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached often to the <hi>Philippians;</hi> and with that opinion they often resort thither, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on days of Devotion, to say their Prayers: The Walls of the City are likewise very ancient, over the Gates of which is writ some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Greek Character; but Time hath so defaced it, that to me it seemed not longer legible: And so ignorant are the Greeks also, even such as were born in that City, and are Priests and Coloires (which are the strictest sort of Religious Men amongst them) who have nothing more to do than to attend to their Office and Studies, that they cannot give any reasonable account of the original of that City, who it was built by, or any thing else of the History of it, and with much admiration they hearken to us, when we tell them any thing what our Books relate concerning it.</p>
               <p>From hence I departed towards <hi>Sophia,</hi> passing in this Journey the <hi>Montes Haemi,</hi> call'd by the Turks <hi>Capi Dervent,</hi> which is as much as the Gate of the narrow way; the ascent hereunto is rugged and sharp, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for Robbers, who there have such Caves and places of refuge, that they defie very considerable Forces that are sent against them. On the top of this Hill is a Village of <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> where the Women used to the diversity of Tavellers, are become free in their discourse, and only entertain strangers, whilst their Husbands are in the Field, or with their Cattle, or fly away for fear of some injury from the Turks. Descending hence is a very narrow inclosure, on both sides being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed

with high Mountains and Woods, which is a shady and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Journey for the space of two hours; to this place the <hi>Heidouts,</hi> or <hi>Heyducks</hi> (as that people call them) frequently resort in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers out of <hi>Transilvania, Moldavia, Hungary,</hi> and other parts, which taking the advantage of these close Woods, discharge Vollies of Shot on the strongest Caravans, and rolling stones from the Mountains in the narrowest passages, do as much execution as with Cannon; for, as I have understood, in one of those <hi>Dervents</hi> (for there are many of this nature in the Journey to <hi>Belgrade</hi>) 18 Thieves only killed above 300 Merchants, who for security united together, and their whole Baggage and Goods became a prey to the Robbers. In these places, thus fortified by Nature, the Inhabitants resisted the force of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Emperours, and killed <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> after he had subjected the City of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Amongst these <hi>Bulgarians</hi> is a sort of people which they call <hi>Paulines,</hi> who had in former times a strangely confused notion of Christianity, pretending to follow the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> used Fire in the Sacrament of Baptism, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred this Apostle before his Master Christ: But there being some Roman Priests in those parts, that observing the ignorance of these poor people, and their willingness to be instructed, took the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and reduced them all to the Roman Faith, to which now they are strict and superstitious adherers.</p>

               <p>It may seem a difficult matter to assign the true reason why and by what means the Turks come to be so decayed in their Naval Forces, who abound with so many conveniences for it, and with all sorts of materials fit for Navigation, as Cordage, Pitch, Tar, and Timber, which arise and grow in their own dominions, and are easily brought to the Imperial Gity with little or no danger of their Enemies. For Timber, the vast Woods along the Coast of the Black Sea, and parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> at the bottom of the Gulph of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> supply them: Pitch, Tar, and Tallow are brought to them from <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Wala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia;</hi> Canvas and Hemp from <hi>Grand Cairo;</hi> and Bisquet is in plenty in all parts of the Turks Dominions. Their Ports are several of them convenient for building both of Ships and Gallies; the Arsenal at <hi>Constantinople</hi> hath no less than a hundred thirty seven <hi>Voltas,</hi> or Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for Buildings, and so many Vessels may be upon the Stocks at the

same time. At <hi>Sinopolis</hi> neer <hi>Trapesond</hi> is another Arsenal: at <hi>Midia</hi> and <hi>Anchiale,</hi> Cities on the Black Sea, are the like; and in many parts of the <hi>Propontis,</hi> the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> and the <hi>Bospborus,</hi> are such Ports and conveniences for Shipping, as if all things had conspired to render <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> happy, and not only capable of being Mistress of the Earth, but formidable in all parts of the Ocean: and yet the Turk for several years, especially since the War with <hi>Candia,</hi> and their defeats at Sea, have not been able at most to Equippe a Fleet of above 100 Sail of Gallies, of which 14 are maintained and provided at the charge of the <hi>Beyes</hi> of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> for which they have certain Isles in that Sea assigned them.</p>
               <p>The Turks do neither want Slaves for to bogue at the Oars of the Gallies; for <hi>Tartary</hi> supplies them with great numbers; besides, divers persons in <hi>Constantinople</hi> make it a Trade to hire out their Slaves for the Summers Voyage for 6000 Aspers, running the hazard of the Slaves life, who returning home safe is consigned to the possession of his Patron: And if want still be of <hi>Chiurma,</hi> as the Turks call it, or Slaves for the Oar, a collection is made in several Provinces of the lustiest and stoutest Clowns, called by the Turks <hi>Azabs,</hi> but by the other Slaves <hi>Chakal;</hi> these are chosen out of certain Villages, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elected out of every twenty houses, the hire of which is 6000 Aspers, for payment whereof the other 19 Families make a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Contribution. Upon receipt of their pay they give in security not to fly, but to serve faithfully for that years Expedition: But these men unused to the Service of the Sea, unskilful at the Oar, and Sea-sick, are of little validity; and the success of their Voyage may be compared to that in the Fable of the Shepherd, who sold his Possessions on the Land, to buy Merchandise for Sea-Negotiations.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers which are destin'd to Sea-service are called <hi>Levents,</hi> who come voluntarily and enter themselves in the Registers of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Others there are also obliged to Sea-service, who are <hi>Zaims</hi> and <hi>Timariots,</hi> and hold their Lands in Sea-Tenure; but being not bound to go in person themselves, they bring or send their Servants (called in Turkish <hi>Bedel</hi>) to supply their place, every one providing one, two, or more, according to the value of his Lands, as we have before declared in the Chapter of the <hi>Zaims</hi> and <hi>Timariots.</hi> Some <hi>Janizaries</hi> are also drawn out for Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service, and some <hi>Spahees</hi> of the four inferiour Banners; and not to make too bold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Gunners of the Turkish Fleet are wholly ignorant of that art, for any person who is either English, French, Dutch, or any other Christian Nation, they design to this Office, whether he be skilful or unskilful in the management of Artillery; having an opinion that those people are naturally addicted to a certain proneness and aptitude in Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery; in which they find their error as often as they come to skirmish with their Enemy.</p>

               <p>The Turks now despairing of being equal to the Christian Forces by Sea, and to be able to stand with them the shock of a Battel, build light Vessels for robbing, burning, and destroying the Christian Coast, and afterwards to secure themselves by flight, and also to transport Souldiers, Ammunition, and Provisions for succour of <hi>Candia,</hi> and other places of their new Conquests neer the Sea shore.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arsenal</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> is so greatly esteemed by the Turks, that they seem not to desire the conquest of that place for any other reason more than the benefit of the <hi>Arsenal;</hi> as a Person of great quality amongst them said once, that had they made a Conquest of <hi>Venice,</hi> they would not inhabit there, but leave it to the Venetians, in regard that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affords not fresh water, which is necessary for the use of their
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55345:115"/>
Mosques, and their washings before Prayer; but that the <hi>Arsenal</hi> and a Tribute would satisfie the desires of the Grand Signior.</p>
               <p>But the Turks are not likely to be Masters of this Seat of <hi>Neptune,</hi> whilest they so unwillingly apply their minds to Maritime affairs, who being conscious of their former ill success at Sea, and how little use they make of those advantages they have for shipping, acknowledge their inabilities in Sea affairs, and say; <hi>That God hath given the Sea to the Christians, but the land to them.</hi> And no doubt but the large posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and riches they enjoy on the stable Element of the Earth, is that which takes of their minds from a deep attention to matters of the Sea, which is almost solely managed by Renegadoes amongst them, who have abandoned their Faith and their Country. And it is happy for Christendom that this faintness remains on the Spirits of the Turks, and aversion from all Naval employments, whose numbers and power the <hi>Great God of Hosts</hi> hath restrained by the bounds of the Ocean, as he hath limited the Ocean by the Sands of the Sea shore.</p>

            <p>BY the Discourse made in the three foregoing Books, it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear what sort of Government is exercised amongst the Turks, what their Religion is, and how formidable their Force; which ought to make the Christian World tremble, to see so great a part of it subjected to the Mahometan Power, and yet no means thought of to unite our Interests, and compose our Dissentions, which lay us open to the inundation of this flowing Empire: To which I shall add this one thing very observable, That the Grand Signior wages his Wars by Land without any charge to himself; an advantage not to be parallell'd by the policy of any Government I ever heard or read of before; for his <hi>Spahees</hi> and <hi>Janizaries</hi> are always in pay, both in War and Peace; his <hi>Zaims</hi> and <hi>Timariots</hi> have their Lands to maintain them; and other Militias enjoy the fixed Revenue from their respective Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: and yet notwithstanding through the expence of the Naval Forces, the building Gallies, and the like, matters not provided for by those who laid the first foundation of this Government, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Empire hath been bankrupted, and by the corruption of the Officers, or ill management, been sold for three years to come, until all was redeemed and restored again by the wisdom of that famous Visier <hi>

            <p>We cannot now but pity those poor Borderers in <hi>Hungary, Styria, Croatia,</hi> and other parts subject to the Incursions of this cruel enemy, since we know that in the last War not three English miles from <hi>Vienna</hi> many poor people have been surprised, and fallen into the hands of the Tartar and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This Consideration ought to move us, who are barrocado'd and fortified by the Seas from the violence of our Enemies, to bless God we are born in so happy and so secure a Country, subject to no dangers but from our selves, nor other miseries but what arise from our own freedom and two much felicity; we ought to consider it as a Blessing, that we have never felt any smart of the Rod of this great Oppressor of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, and yet have tasted of the good and benefit which hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a free and open Trade, and an amicable Correspondence and Friendship with this People; which having been maintained for the space of above eighty years, begun in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of blessed Memory, preserved by the Prudence and admirable Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a series of worthy Embassadors, and daily improved both in Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness and Reputation by the excellent Conduct and Direction of that Right Worshipful Company of the <hi>Levant</hi> Merchants, hath brought a most considerable benefit to this Kingdom, and gives employment and livelihood to many thousands of people in <hi>England;</hi> by which also His Majesty without any expence, gains a very considerable increase of His Customs.</p>
            <p>The sence of this benefit and advantage to my own Country, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any private considerations I have as a Servant to that Embassie, or
<pb facs="tcp:55345:116"/>
the obligations I have to that Worthy Company, cause me to move with the greatest sedulity and devotion possible to promote and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Interest of that Trade: And as some study several ways, and prescribe Rules by which a War may be most advantagiously ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged against the Turk; I, on the contrary, am more inclinable to give my judgment in what manner our Peace and Trade may best be secured and maintained; knowing that so considerable a welfare of our Nation depends upon it, that a few years of Trades interruption in <hi>Turkey</hi> will make all sorts of people sensible of the want of so great a vent of the Commodities of our Country. And therefore as I am obliged to pray for the Glory and Prosperity of His Majesty our gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign; so likewise, as that which conduces to it, for the continuance of the Honour of this Embassie in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and the profitable returns of the <hi>Levant</hi> Company.</p>
