            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DESCRIPTION, &amp;c.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>OF Kings Renown'd and Mighty Bards I write,</l>
               <l>Some slain by Whores, and others kill'd in Fight;</l>
               <l>Some starving liv'd, whilst others were prefer'd;</l>
               <l>But all, when dead, are in one place inter'd.</l>
               <l>A Fabrick stands by Antient Heroes built,</l>
               <l>Design'd for Holy Use t' atone their Guilt;</l>
               <l>Here sacred Urns of Majesty they keep,</l>
               <l>Here Kings and Poets most profoundly sleep;</l>
               <l>Heer Choristers in Hymns their Voices raise,</l>
               <l>And charm the dreadful Goblins from the Place.</l>
               <l>Tho throng'd with Tombs, no Specter here is found,</l>
               <l>They sing the very Devil off the Ground:</l>
               <l>No Night-Mare dances 'mongst the antient Tombs,</l>
               <l>Nor sulphurous <hi>Incubus</hi> dispenses Fumes;</l>
               <l>Nor let no subterranean Hag afright</l>
               <l>My Muse, whilst of the <hi>Funeral</hi> I write.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A Bard there was, who whilome did command,</l>
               <l>And held the Lawrel in his potent Hand;</l>
               <l>He o'er <hi>Parnassus</hi> bore Imperial Sway,</l>
               <l>Him all the little Tribes of Bards obey:</l>
               <l>But Bards and Kings, how e'er approv'd and great,</l>
               <l>Must stoop at last to the Decrees of Fate.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49680:3"/>
Fate bid him for the stroke of Death prepare,</l>
               <l>And then remov'd him to the Lord knows where.</l>
               <l>If to the Living we such Tributes owe,</l>
               <l>We on the Dead must pious Rites bestow;</l>
               <l>To our Assistance all the Wits must call,</l>
               <l>To grace the Glory of the Funeral.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Who is the first appears unto our View,</l>
               <l>But haughty, proud, imperious <hi>M—</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who cocks his Chin, and scarce affords a VVord,</l>
               <l>But looks as big as any <hi>Belgick</hi> Lord;</l>
               <l>In the best Dairies fed, grown sleek and fat,</l>
               <l>The creeping <hi>Mouse</hi> is turn'd into a <hi>Rat:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Of others brows he licks the toilsom Sweat,</l>
               <l>And by our Sins grows impudently great:</l>
               <l>As chief of VVits he does himself prefer,</l>
               <l>And with our Gold bribes ev'ry Flatterer;</l>
               <l>But Men of Sense and Honour does despise,</l>
               <l>And crushes such as would by Virtue rise,</l>
               <l>VVhilst each lewd Rakehel of the nauseous Town</l>
               <l>He fills with Coin, and does with Honours crown.</l>
               <l>The Nation's VVealth he most profusely spends,</l>
               <l>But not on such as are the Nation's Friends;</l>
               <l>But such as wrote our Country to inslave,</l>
               <l>His Kindness follows even to the Grave.</l>
               <l>He the great Bard at his own Charge Inters,</l>
               <l>And dying Vice to living VVorth prefers.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49680:3"/>
Some others too in the Affair are join'd,</l>
               <l>Alike in Morals, and alike in Mind;</l>
               <l>But these my Muse must here forbear to name,</l>
               <l>Scarce worthy Honour, or deserving Fame.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Day is come, and all the VVits must meet</l>
               <l>From <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> down to <hi>Watling-street;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>They all repair to the Physicians Dome,</l>
               <l>There lies the Corps, and there the Eagles come:</l>
               <l>No Corps an Entrance has within this Gate,</l>
               <l>None are admitted here to lie in State,</l>
               <l>But such as Fate a noted Death has carv'd,</l>
               <l>A Cutpurse hang'd, or a poor Poet starv'd;</l>
               <l>One is anatomiz'd when he is dead.</l>
               <l>The other in his Life for want of Bread.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A Troop of Stationers at first appear'd,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> the Muses Midwife, who well knows</l>

Pimps, Panders, Bullies, and Eternal Beaux,</l>
               <l>Fam'd for short VVits, loug VVigs, and gaudy Clothes;</l>
               <l>All Sons of Meter tune the Voice in praise,</l>
               <l>From lofty Strains, to humble Ekes and Ays:</l>

               <l>Some groan'd, some sob'd, and some I think there wept,</l>
               <l>And some got drunk, loll'd down, and snoar'd and slept.</l>
