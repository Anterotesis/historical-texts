         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian reader, I will take it as a great favour from thee, if in reading
this my Anſwer thou wilt judge me to be, as indeed, and in truth I
am, an adverſary of the cauſe, and not of the perſon. He who is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
reported to be the Author of the foure queſtions in hand, is one
whoſe perſon I have, from my firſt knowledge of him, dearly loved, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
and admired, for his excellent parts, profitable paines for the
publike good, and his unwearied labours, and patient ſufferings in the cauſe of Chriſt.
If he hath but once in all his life ſtumbled upon a bad cauſe, and pleaded for it, (which
is a common, and in ſome ſort a neceſſary evil, hardly to be avoided by men of his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:)
let not this blemiſh his great learning, nor his judgement, ſound in all other
points, and leaſt of all his approved piety and zeale for true religion. His name, which
was happily concealed, and not annexed to theſe foure queſtions, ſhall ever be precious
with me, and I hope with all Gods people alſo, who truly feare the Lord, long for the
peace of Zion, and unfeignedly ſeek the reformation of Christs Church, in all theſe three
Kingdomes. It is no ſmall griefe to me, that I am compelled to move my pen in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
againſt any paper, publiſhed by an hand ſo deare to me: But in the cauſe of Chriſt,
and in a point ſo prejudiciall to the peace and pure reformation of the Church, Who can
be ſilent? The neareſt relations of love which one Chriſtian can have to another in this
world, muſt not hinder us, nor ſtay our hands, tongues or pens from performance of any
duty, in which we all ſtand obliged to the Lord Chriſt our Redeemer, and to his Church
our deare mother. And wherein can we be more neceſſitated to ſhew our duty to both,
then in reſisting with all our power whatſoever tends to the common and continuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation
of the holy Sacrament of Chriſts body and blood? which cannot poſſibly be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if the power of the keys, which Chriſt hath given to his Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors,
with a promiſe to be with them to the end of the world, be taken, under any pretence, out
of the hands of the Pastors and Presbyters of the Church, and no power left unto them
to put by any ſinners, openly ſcandalous and impenitent, from the holy Communion nor
to exclude ſuch ſpirituall lepers, moſt loathſome and infections, from the ſacred meeting
at the Lords holy Table. Who doth not ſee that the maine cauſe of the Schiſmes and
ſeparations of divers godly and zealous Chriſtians from our Communion, is the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the prophane among the pious and godly, and the admiſſion of perſons openly ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
to the holy Sacrament? This is that which hath moved many out of their blinde
zeale to proclaime our Church, a whore a ſtrumpet, a Synagogue of Antichriſt; and our
faithfull Miniſters, Baals Prieſts, and limmes of the beaſt. All true Chriſtians, and
moſt of all the Miniſters of the Word, are bound to put to their hands and ſhoulders
for the removing of this ſtumbling-block and rock of offence out of the way: And I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
more then others, by reaſon of that ſingular love I bear to this deare brother er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in this point, and leaſt I ſhould offend against that commandement, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17.
Thou ſhalt not have thy brother in thine heart: thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and not ſuffer ſin upon him, or bear ſin for him. His paper is gone forth in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
private rebuke will not hinder the hurt which it may doe: It hath given ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
wounds, as cannot be cured but by a publike remedy. The Lord, the great healer of
ſoules, give a ſpeedy cure to the maladies of his Church, and all our ſoule-ſickneſſes: to
him be praiſe for ever and ever.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I did firſt meet with this paper of foure ſerious queſtions,
fleeing abroad in print into every Book-ſellers ſhop in <hi>London,</hi>
and ready upon the wing to take flight into all parts of the land;
That flying toll, which appeared to the Prophet <hi>Zecharie</hi> (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
upon my viewing of the matter and ſcope thereof) came
to my minde, which is ſaid to be a curſe going forth over the face
of the whole land, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. 3. For as that was a curſe to puniſh, cut off and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
even to the timber and ſtones of the houſes, into which it entered: So I
feared this would be a corrupting curſe in the heart, houſe and family of every
one that entertained it with approbation, and did welcome it with applauſe,
ſeeing it proclaims liberty for all ſinners, though openly ſcandalous and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
to come boldly to the Lords ſupper, and to eat and drinke their own
damnation, without controll of the Paſtors and Presbyters of the Church, whom
Chriſt hath ordained to have the rule over them, and to watch for their ſoules,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
               <p>And whereas the queſtions are by the Author profeſſed to be ſerious, and of
grand importance, propounded to the Reverend Aſſembly, for the ſetling of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
among us, in theſe divided times: Firſt, I muſt profeſſe that I am much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that any learned Chriſtian brother ſhould ſeriouſly urge ſuch arguments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſo weak, ſo fallacious, and of ſo little ſtrength, to maintaine ſo bad a cauſe as this,
even the opening of a wide gap to Libertiniſme, and prophanation of the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of Chriſts body and blood, and giving this liberty to carnall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
men, of diſſolute and ſcandalous life, that they without repulſe may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
themſelves among godly Communicants, to the juſt offence and ſcandall
of the whole Congregation: which they may have opportunity to doe at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
times, before the ſentence of Excommunication, can in a way of orderly
proceeding (eſpecially when there are appeales made to higher Conſiſtories one
after another, by obſtinate and contentious offenders) come forth againſt them,
and be put in execution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:123448:3"/>
Secondly, I hope it will be made to appeare by this, and other Anſwers of
more able brethren, that here is no matter of grand importance in theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
except encouragement of men to live in ſcandalous ſins, without feare of
ſuſpenſion from the Lords table, and to intrude boldly thereunto, which is a
power of grand tyranny, and oppreſſion of the Conſciences of Miniſters, may
in any but an evil ſenſe, be called a matter of grand importance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I wiſh with all my heart, though now too late, that theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as in the title is pretended, had firſt been propounded to the venerable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.
For I doubt not but they then ſhould have received ſuch a ſolid and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
Anſwer, as would have ſtaid the publiſhing of them in print, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the infection of the mindes of the vulgar people of weak judgement, and
ſaved us the labour of compoſing Antidotes againſt them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I pity the Author, in that he hath ſo erred from his intended ſcope
of theſe queſtions: for his handling and carriage of them, is ſo farre from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
Schiſmes, and ſetling unity among us in thoſe divided times: that on
the contrary we finde by experience to our griefe, that they worke ſtrongly in
corrupt and perverſe mindes, to the breeding, and increaſing of Schiſmes, to the
diſturbance of the deſired reformation, in a point of greateſt concernment, and
to the raiſing up of diviſions and diſſenſions, not onely among others, but alſo
betwen the Parliament and Aſſembly, which is a ſtrange practice, in a lover of
peace and truth.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Anſwer to the Preface before the queſtions.</head>
               <p n="1">1. The buſineſſe appeares plainely to be of no difficulty, unleſſe men will be
difficult, and through their owne averſeneſſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hardly perſwaded to grant and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh
that which Gods Word expreſſely holdeth forth and commendeth, and
which we hope, and humbly pray, that the Honourable Houſes of Parliament will
be willing to doe without difficulty. You your ſelfe doe quote divers texts of
Scripture which eſtabliſh Excommunication, and you preſuppoſe it, in this
your paper ſeverall times, where you ſay none is to be ſuſpended from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but ſuch as are excommunicated, and in your Excommunication (for
which you cite <hi>Tertullian,</hi> Schoolemen, and Canoniſts,) you are more rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
then any Presbyterians, whom you cloſely intimate to be indiſcreet, paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
overſevere and revengefull: which is a point of unchriſtian jealouſy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
ſurmiſe. For they dare not by excommunication exclude obſtinate
offenders from all ordinances, but ſuffer them to heare the Word, though not
in communion as members of the Church, but as infidels may doe; or elſe what
hope can we have of an illiterate perſon excommunicated, that he will ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and be reſtored? As for ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament, it is a thing more
eaſy, in it ſelfe, and may be done orderly with leſſe labour then excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and with great eaſe and facility, and more frequently, and with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
is practiſed in all the beſt reformed Churches, which alſo our late aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
liturgy did allow largely to all Paſtors and Church-wardens: and it had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:123448:3"/>
been more eaſy to them that were godly, and alſo more uſuall in our Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
if the proud Prelates, fathers of prophaneneſſe, had not taken that power
wholly to themſelves: Which intolerable uſurpation of theirs, we hope is with
themſelves quite taken away: but not the power from the Church, nor the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
exerciſe of it according to the rules of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas you make no <hi>medium</hi> between prophanation and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall
on the one ſide, and Arbitrary, tyrannicall, papall domineering over the
Conſciences and ſpirituall Priviledges of Chriſtians on the other, herein paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and partiality ſeem to blinde you: For there is a plain open way between the
two extremes, that is, the lawfull power which Chriſt hath given to Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
rulers, Paſtors and Elders in his Church, which all godly Miniſters, and all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
members of the Aſſembly ſtand, plead, and petition for, that it may be
backed and confirmed to them by civill ſanction, even power to prove and try
who are fit, and who are unworthy to come to the Lords Table, and by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the one, and puting back the other, after ſtrict triall, and due proofe and
examination, prophanation and ſcandall may eaſily be prevented, and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
tyranicall, papall domineering over the conſciences of Paſtors, and godly
Chriſtian people ſhall have no place in Gods Church; Scandalous proud impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
ſinners ſhall not come deſperately to out-face Chriſt and his Miniſters at
his own table, nor have an action againſt Miniſters, who out of tender conſcience,
and fear of God, refuſe to reach to them judgement and damnation, and ſo to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
with them in the guilt of Chriſts body and blood; The Congregation of the
godly ſhall not be ſcandalized, nor tyrannically forced either to countenance and
harden the impenitent in their open wickednes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by communicating with them, or
to ſeparate from our Congregations, and abhor the ordinance of the Lord, as men
did in old <hi>Eli's</hi> daies, when his wicked ſons made them to abhor the offering of
the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 17. But on the contrary, let ſcandalous, obſtinate ſinners have
liberty to intrude and come boldly to the Lords table, and the Paſtors and Elders
have no power to keep back from them the holy ſignes and ſcals, which belong
not to them, this is more then arbitrary, tyrannicall, papall domineering over the
conſciences of Paſtors, Elders, and godly people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But here me thinks you ſpeak very untowardly, to the great offence of all

words (<hi>If it fall into indiſcreet, over-ſevere, ambitious, paſſionate, or revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Chriſts Church are ſuch, and therefore they ought not to be truſted with power
of Suſpenſion and Excommunication; which if you do, your heart is not f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

malignity againſt their holy calling, and the Lord Chriſt, who hath truſted them,
will finde you out. Or elſe your meaning is, that, as in the daies of the Papacy and
Prelacy, ſo now it may again under Presbyteriall Church-government happen,
that ſome of the rulers Eccleſiaſticall may act with ſuch hands. What then? Do
you infer thence that all of that high calling are to be abridged of that power? A
deſperate inference, ſtriking at the prerogative and power of Parliaments, and all
civil Judges, and Courts of Juſtice. For upon the ſame grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe under
the Papacy, Parliaments made Laws for ſuppreſſing true religion, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:123448:4"/>
Idolatry and ſuperſtition, you may go about to abridge them. And under the
late domineering Prelacy and tyranny, Judges wreſted laws to take away the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
birth-right and liberty, and to maintain oppreſſion, and they made (you
know whoſe) will and luſt, law. And Lawyers ſoothed them, and you know when,
not one (in all the bunch) could be found, nor hired to plead in the juſt cauſe of an
innocent. And even then many Presbyters and Eccleſiaſticall perſons ſtood out
couragiouſly, and feared no perſecutions, bonds or loſſes, in the cauſe both of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and juſtice. Why then will you not take away all power alſo of judging from
Judges, and of pleading and expounding the Law from Lawyers, and leave all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
government in the hands of the common people? Take heed, Sir, you be not
partiall and unequall to one ſide more then another. <hi>Aretius</hi> hath given you a
very good caveat, not to ſtrive ſo earneſtly againſt this point of Chriſtian diſcipline,
in thoſe words of his by you cited (<hi>impoſſibile praeſentibus moribus colla ſubmitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
ejuſmodi diſciplinae</hi>) which words tell us, That the corrupt manners and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
lives of men deſperately bent, in theſe evil times, to continue in their lewd and
ſcandalous courſes, make it impoſſible to bring them to ſubmit their ſtiff necks to
this diſcipline of Excommunication, and Suſpenſion from the holy Communion,
which is Chriſts light yoke to tractable Chriſtians. If you proceed to take part with
ſuch refractory oppoſers (which, I hope, your religious heart will not permit you
to do) and ſpend your ſtrength in ſo unworthy a cauſe, in hope by juſtifying theſe
Queſtions, to prevail againſt the votes of your beſt friends, and moſt faithfull lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

they vehemently declaimed againſt, and cauſed to be taken quite away from the

               <p>To this I anſwer, that you utterly miſtake the matter. For they abhorre all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation

but have condemned it in the Pope and Prelates; and their humble Petition to
the Houſes of Parliament is; That none may uſurp lordly power, as the proud

                  <hi>Theſſ. 3. 14. &amp;
2 Joh. 10. 11. &amp; Joh. 3. 10. &amp; Numb. 12. 14. &amp; Deut.</hi> 23. 1. be properly meant
of Excommunication, which you take upon you to prove from Fathers, School-men
and others, to be an excluſion from all ordinances, or of Suſpenſion from
the Lords Supper onely. The firſt you hold, and we will grant it to you. The
latter you deny, and I affirm, that it is here alſo meant incluſively, but not only.
The firſt place you ſeem to weaken and enervate, by intimating that our Saviour
ſpeaks of private perſonall treſpaſſe between man and man, and not of publike
ſcandalous ſins againſt the Congregation, and that the cenſure is private not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Let him be</hi> (not to the whole Church and all others, but)
<hi>to Thee, as an Heathen man and a Publican;</hi> and you quote, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 3, 4. to
prove that ſuch private treſpaſſes muſt be forgiven, if ſeventy times ſeven: which
no man will deny, if the treſpaſſer repent, as often as he offends. But now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
be ſtand out and perſiſt in his ſin, and ſcorn private admonition; yea, when
he is convented before the Church, he will not hear nor obey publike admonition,
doe you not think that this is publike ſcandall againſt the Cong<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>egation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
Excommunication? Surely, if it were not ſo, our Saviour would not have
paſſed againſt it that dreadfull cenſure of Excommunication, ſaying, <hi>Let him be
to Thee as an Heathen man and a Publican.</hi> And if to the private perſon for his
private wrong, much more to all others in the Congregation, for publike contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
and ſcandalous obſtinacy in his ſin againſt the Church. It is a dangerous
doctrine to teach any private perſon to cenſure and judge a brother to be in the
ſtate of an Ethnike, and as a Publican, for a private treſpaſſe; if for his contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
againſt the whole Church, and obſtinacie in that ſin, the ſentence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
be not by the Church publikely given againſt him. Whereas you
make it a branch of your Queſtion. What warrant there is in Scripture for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to ſuſpend men from the Lords Supper only, and not from the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and all other publike ordinances with it. I anſwer this very eaſily: That
becauſe Suſpenſion from the Sacrament is a ſtep, yea the next degree to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
(as reaſon, and the practice of all the beſt Churches of Chriſt doe
teach us) the Scriptures which warrant Excommunication, do alſo warrant it
as a profitable and neceſſary means, either to prevent that dreadfull ſentence by
bringing the ſinner to repent and be aſhamed, or to make his impenitency more
evident and notorious, and to juſtifie the more the Excommunication of him.
But I marvell, that you ſhould thinke it ſo ſtrange and unwarrantable a
thing to ſuſpend a man from a Sacrament, who hath communion in all other
ordinances of the Church, ſeeing it was the practice of all the ancient Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
to exclude the Catechumeni from Baptiſme, till by catechiſing and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word publikely preached they were better inſtructed. And how
dare you diſpute againſt that which is reſolved in this preſent Parliament?
To wit, That ignorant, and ſome ſcandalous perſons ſhall not be admitted to the
Lords table.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:123448:5"/>
                  <hi>Q</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Your ſecond Queſtion is the ſame which you propounded laſt before as a
branch of the firſt: belike you are well pleaſed and affected with it, and have
ſome thing more to ſay in urging it. I omit what I have anſwered before; and
here I doe firſt adde, That Chriſtian compaſſion, and moderation in dealing
with perverſe men is commended and commanded in the Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.
24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25, 26. &amp; <hi>Jude</hi> 22, 23. And this is a maine point of compaſſion and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in Eccleſiaſticall rulers, to try all inferiour meanes; whereof ſuſpenſion
from the Lords Table is one; before they proceed to the laſt and greateſt cenſure
of excommunication. Though the Popes and Prelats excommunications, which
belike doe ſtill runne in your minde, were brutiſh thunderbolts thrown out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every ſmall occaſion preſently, and like the fooles dagger which is out to ſtab,
at every croſſe word, and makes but a word and a blow: yet Gods Word teacheth
godly wiſe Paſtors and Presbyters more meekneſſe and gravity, in proceeding to
the utmoſt cenſure, that is, firſt to reprove, admoniſh and rebuke, and if thoſe
more gentle meanes doe not prevaile, then to ſuſpend from the Sacrament; which
by experience is often found to humble ſtubborne offenders, and bring them to
repentance, and ſo prevent cutting off from the Congregation; And all godly
Chriſtians doe here ſee a double warrant of divine Authority. Firſt, from Gods
Word: ſecondly, from his bleſſing of this proceeding with good ſucceſſe. This is
my firſt anſwer. Secondly, to your bold aſſertion, That in the Old Teſtament we
reade of no circumciſed perſon ever debarred from the paſſeover by the Prieſts,
that was deſirous to eat it. I Anſwer, that it is as void of truth, as full of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
For <hi>Levit.</hi> 22. 3. &amp; <hi>Numb</hi> 9. 5. and divers other places. Every circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
perſon who was legally unclean, is forbiden to eate of the paſſeover, or any
holy thing, under pain of being cut off, and might not eat of it till he was clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and rightly prepared as appeares, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 3 the very chapter by you quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
according to the expreſſe words of the law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 11. And therefore much
more ought baptized perſons, now under the Goſpell, who are manifeſtly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
with the ſpirituall defilement of ſcandalous ſin, be ſuſpended from the more
holy Sacrament of Chriſts body and blood, untill he be cleanſed by repentance.
Thirdly, to the inſtance of Judas whom our Saviour knew to be a devil and a
traytour. I Anſwer firſt, that Judas was not admitted to the Sacrament, for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das
went out before the Supper was ended, immediatly upon his receiving of the
ſop, <hi>Joh</hi> 13. 30. But our Saviour did not ordaine this Sacrament till after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 20 When he had ſupped, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25. Secondly, if Judas had
been admitted, it makes nothing to the matter, for Judas profeſſed faith in Chriſt,
and in his outward converſation appeared ſo unblameable, that when our Saviour
told them, that one of them twelve ſhould betray him, they did not ſuſpect Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das
more then themſelves, but every one asked, ſaying, Maſter, is it I? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
let a man be an hypocrite, traytor or devil inwardly, the Miniſter is not to
judge of ſuch ſecret things which belong to God, but to looke to the outward
profeſſion, life and converſation, and accordingly deal with them. Fourthly,
S. <hi>Pauls</hi> admoniſhing of the Corinthians of the great danger of unworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
namely, that it was eating damnation to themſelves, and making them
guilty of Chriſts body and blood; and thereupon enjoyning a ſtrict examination
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:123448:5"/>
of every one before he eat of that bread, and drinke of that cup, doth ſufficiently
inſtruct the elders, to put back all ſuch as did outwardly appeare to be ſcandalous
impenitent ſinners, and ſo moſt unworthy to receive the holy ſignes and ſeales of
the Lords body and blood. Fifthly, To that queſtion of yours, Whether a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
hath not diſcharged his full duty and conſcience, if he doth admoniſh his
flock of the danger of unworthy receiving, and ſeriouſly dehort ſuch as he deemes
unworthy, from receiving the Sacrament, till they become more fit to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate,
under paine of eating and drinking their own damnation and other judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
I anſwer, that this is no full diſcharge, neither doe thoſe Scriptures
which you quote, <hi>Ezek, 33. 1, 2, &amp;c. Act.</hi> 20. 16. or ours and French Liturgies
prove any ſuch thing in this caſe. For they who ſuſpend ſcandalous perſons, doe
alſo admoniſh all others to examine themſelves, and mention the danger of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
receiving, that none unprepared may preſume. It is a diſcharge of a
Miniſters duty, when he admoniſheth onely of the danger of a ſin, in which
when it is committed, the party admoniſhed hath onely an hand: But here the
Miniſter is partaker of the ſin, and as much guilty by giving, as the other by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.
I pray you tell me, Sir, if you have a cup in your hand which will
poyſon and kill a ſick diſtemperd man if he drinke of it, will you give it unto
him if he deſires it? and doe you thinke it enough to admoniſh him that it is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
poyſon? and firſt dehort him from drinking of it, and then immediatly reach
it to him, with intent, that he ſhall drinke of it? I perſwade my ſelfe, that as he
ſhall periſh, ſo his blood ſhall be required at your hands, and that you ſhall as
guilty hold up your hand at the barre for it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. The third Queſtion intimates that you conceive unworthy hearing
of the Word to be as great, as dangerous, as damning a ſin, as unworthy receiving
of the Sacrament: That Miniſters are no more partakers of other mens ſins, not
more guilty of their ſins, and of giving holy things to doggs, and caſting pearles
before ſwine, by giving the Sacrament of Chriſts body and blood to unworthy
receivers who are openly ſcandalous, then by preaching the Word to unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hearers, to whom he is the favour of death unto death. And hereupon you
would inferre, that Miniſters may as well refuſe to preach the Word unto their
people, leſt it ſhould not profit them, as they may refuſe to give the Sacrament
to ſcandalous perſons, who eat their own damnation.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there is vaſt difference between theſe two, preaching the
Word to unprofitable hearers, and giving the Sacrament to perſons openly ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
impenitent and prophane receivers. Firſt a Miniſter preacheth the Word
to many that are unprofitable hearers, not knowing them to be ſuch, and
in hope to convert and profit them, if there be any ſuch in the auditorie,
and ſo alſo he gives the Sacrament to ſome unworthy receivers, unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not knowing them to be ſuch: and in ſuch caſes he is blameleſſe: but
if he gives the holy ſeales of Chriſts body and blood to ſcandalous impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
perſons, he knowes that he gives them damnation to eat and drink, and he
is halfe ſharer with them in the ſinfull act. And therefore though the ſin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
hear<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> of the Word is as dangerous and damning, as unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of the Sacrament, to the hearen and receivers: yet to the Miniſter in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:123448:6"/>
one, to weet, preaching without knowledge of the hurt which ſome receive by
it, there is no fault; but in giving to the ſcandalous receiver he wittingly acts
and partakes of the profanation of the holy ordinance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lords holy Table in the holy communion, is for the time a
place of Gods more ſpeciall preſence then the common Auditory, and there
we come neerer to God, and receive with the word and promiſes particularly
applyed to us, the ſeales of our communion with Chriſt, and of our right and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in him and all his benefits. But preaching to a common Auditory, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a generall propounding of the word and promiſes to all, not a particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of it to any, eſpecially that hear unprofitably: for that were giving holy
things to doggs: therefore there is more danger and greater ſinne in admitting
unworthy receivers to the Lords Table. A ſmall errour in ſuch an holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
doth provoke the Lord to wrath, who will be ſanctified in them that
come neere to him, as appears in <hi>Aarons</hi> two ſonnes, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, 2, 3. &amp; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Preaching the Word to ſuch as are openly knowne to be ſcorners of
the Goſpell, and perſecutours of the Preachers, and doe more rage and are harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereby, is a prophanation of an holy thing, and a caſting of pearles before
ſwine, which our Saviour expreſſely forbids, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6. &amp; <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 14. Bids
his Apoſtles turne from ſuch, and ſhake off the duſt from their feet, as a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
againſt them; and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 51.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In preaching the Word, the Miniſter of Chriſt propounds the truth
to many wicked men generally, but doth not particularly apply any word of
comfort, or promiſe of bleſſing to any but profitable hearers, and upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of repentance: But in giving the Sacrament to known impenitent perſons,
he preacheth moſt palpable lyes againſt his own conſcience, when he ſaith. The
body of Chriſt was broken for you, and his blood wasſhed for you: And therefore
the points urged in this Queſtion are very dangerous, and divers Scriptures
herein quoted, are wreſted and groſſely perverted.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. The fourth Queſtion (upon that received truth, That <hi>God only knows
the ſecrets of mens hearts,</hi> which Miniſters doe not, but miſtake hypocrites for
worthy receivers, and more honeſt ſimple weak men, for unfit Communicants)
would inferre, That Miniſters ought not to have power to judge or cenſure. I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
which reaſoning; Firſt, I finde groſſe abſurdity: for what can be more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
then to argue, that becauſe Miniſters know not ſecret things which belong to
God, therefore they know not revealed and manifeſt things, as open ſcandalous
ſins, and impenitency profeſſed in the face of the Church, and by conſequent may
not judge and cenſure them by the Word of God, which doth plainly reveal their
wickedneſſe to them and the whole Conſiſtory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Obſerve how the Scriptures, which forbid raſh judgement concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mens eſtate before God, which is ſecret, or concerning mens laſt end, and the
like, as <hi>Matth. 7. 1. Luk 6. 37. Rom.</hi> 14. 4. are wreſted to overthrow all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and cenſuring in generall, both civil and eccleſiaſticall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, How vainly the power of God is abuſed, to prove that he will in the
midſt of a profane wicked act change notorious ſinners hearts in a moment, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:123448:6"/>
if he ſhould doe, how ſhall theſe ſinners manifeſt their repentance in a moment
to the Church, which they have offended, that they may he admitted orderly, and
not raſhly without juſt ground or ſatisfaction?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The breaking of a bruiſed reed, and quenching of ſmoking flax, is
moſt miſerably applied to the ſuſpending of proud, refractorie, impenitent ſinners
from the holy Sacrament; between which two ſorts of perſons and actions there
is as vaſt a difference as between heaven and hell, light and darkneſſe. For the
bruiſed reed ſignifies men of broken heart and contrite ſpirit, groaning under the
burden of their ſins, and fleeing to Chriſt for eaſe: And ſmoking flax ſignifies
ſuch as have a weak but true faith, which like a ſpark in flax ſheweth by ſmoking
that there is fire, ſtriving to break forth, and to ſhew light of holy life. Now how
contrary theſe are to proud, ſcandalous impenitent ſinners, let reaſonable men
judge; the firſt are ſuch as the Publicans and ſinners, who came to Chriſt repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and confeſſing their ſins, and by him were received, cheriſhed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted;
the latter are like thoſe trees which brought forth no good, but bad fruit,
unto the root of which the axe was laid, to hew them down, and caſt them into
the fire. The not breaking nor quenching the firſt is a point of mercy, and a work
of Chriſt; the tolerating of the other and cheriſhing and encouraging them in
their ſcandalous ſins, by admitting them to the holy Communion of Chriſts body
and blood, is a point of great impiety, and a diabolicall act of profanation. Here
therefore the Scriptures are dangerouſly abuſed and wreſted, where ſcandalous,
impenitent and refractory perſons are confounded with humble penitent ſinners,
breathing after comfort and communion with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Here is a ſtrange ſuppoſition, that all, bearing the name of Chriſtians,
even ſcandalous, impenitent ſinners, are invited to the Sacrament, and are bound
to come and receive it under pain of ſin and contempt. I am ſure the French and
our Liturgies before cited doe admoniſh all impenitent perſons to abſtain, leſt they
eat and drink their own damnation. And the Scriptures here quoted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
&amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. do ſhew that unworthy wicked ſinners doe by unworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
count the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing. Therefore to inferre that
no Miniſter in point of conſcience can refuſe to give the Sacrament to ſuch, is to
conclude, <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet.</hi> But whereas it is added, that Miniſters may not
refuſe any Chriſtian, not actually excommunicated, the Sacrament, if he deſires
to receive it, in caſe he profeſſe ſincere repentance for ſins paſt, and promiſe new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of life for the time to come: this we embrace with all our hearts, and if he
obtrude on us no other but only ſuch, we will not be ſo uncharitable as to judge
them unworthy, neither need we fear to partake of their ſin, or ſuſpect their
unworthy receiving. For our rule is to proceed with men according to that which
manifeſtly appears, whether it be in truth or in hypocriſe; if any ſo profeſſing
doth eat unworthily, he eats damnation to himſelf, not to the Miniſters, who
therein doe nothing againſt their conſciences, but proceed according to the
judgement of charity, and he ſhall bear his own burthen. The Miniſters act of
adminiſtration to them who profeſſe ſincere repentance, is an holy and divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;
but to open ſcandalous impenitent perſons, it is a manifeſt profanation,
and they are partakers in the guilt and puniſhment.</p>

The Concluſion being the reſult of the former arguments, which are plainly
ſhewed to be weak and of no ſtrength, doth of it ſelf fall to the ground and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.
For I have ſhewed, that unworthy hearing and unworthy receiving are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
ſins in the hearers and receivers; but in the Preachers of the Word and the
givers of the Sacraments it is farre otherwiſe: the Preacher doth onely propound
the Word generally, and not falſely apply the promiſes of bleſſing and life to any
particular ſcandalous perſons, but upon condition of their beleeving repentance
and obedience. If he knows any in the auditory, who are ſcorners of the Word,
and haters and perſecutours of him and his doctrine, he denounceth a curſe from
God againſt them, and deſires them to keep away, and holds himſelf guilty of ſin,
if he ſhould caſt the pearl of the Goſpel before ſuch ſwine, when they are alone
and ſeparated from other hearers: he will not wittingly be to any the ſavour of
death unto death. But the Miniſter who gives the Sacrament to open ſcandalous
ſinners in their impenitency, doth wittingly profane Gods holy ordinance, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
againſt his conſcience in ſaying that Chriſts body was broken, and his blood
ſhed for them, and makes himſelf guilty of their blood, while he gives them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
to eat and drink their own damnation, as is before ſhewed. Whatſoever
power takes from Chriſts Miniſters the lawfull and neceſſary liberty to exclude
from the Lords table ſcandalous ſinners openly impenitent, that is ſuch a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
arbitrary, unlimited power, as lordly Prelates ſometimes exerciſed, and
no leſſe then tyrannie and oppreſſion of the conſciences both of Miniſters and
their godly people. And therefore here the Divines of the Aſſembly are charged
moſt unjuſtly and calumniouſly, who have humbly deſired, by way of Petition to
both the honourable Houſes of Parliament, that their conſciences may not have
this yoke of oppreſſion laid on them, which will force them either to profane
the Sacrament of Chriſts body and blood, by giving it to unworthy perſons,
or to decline their Miniſtery and adminiſtration of that holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
chuſing affliction rather then iniquity.</p>
