            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </gap>2. The second cause of this our continually sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, because that euery one of vs who come of <hi>Adam,</hi> are by Gods decree (manifested and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> to <hi>Adam)</hi> fallen into this heauie punishment for our

transgression in <hi>Adam, viz.</hi> vvee are tainted with originall sinne. This originall sinne is a corruption of the powers of the Soule; and that not in some, or in part, but of all and wholy: and so by this originall sin, first, wee are depriued not of some, but of all good inclination, and doe want not some, but all goodnesse: and secondly, thereby we are incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and prone, not to some, but to all euill, and not onely inclined and prone, but also naturally fruitfull, not of some, but of all sinnes; as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the seeds of all sins bred within vs: so that, although sinnes doe not breake out in all men alike, neither is any man found who putteth all sins in practise. Yet take the most ciuill and best natured man in the World, and by <hi>Nature</hi> the seeds of all sinnes are in him: but the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall restraining grace of God doth many and diuers wayes restraine all men from comming into many sins, chiefly for the good and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20506:9"/>
of his Church, and also for the maintaining and vpholding the societie of the world.

The second vnion, is a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall Union,</hi> or an vnion in person, when things in nature different are so conioyned together, that they make one person, as the body and the soule make one man, and the <hi>God-head</hi> of the sonne, and his <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> make one Christ, but Christ and the true beleeuer are not ioyned in person: for Christ is one person, and <hi>Peter</hi> a second person, and <hi>Paul</hi> a third person; and so many men as be true Christians or members of Christ, so many seuerall persons are they.

                  <p>This misticall vnion may be in some sort conceiued more plainely by the consideration of the vnion of the naturall man and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, when vvee consider how his soule sendeth forth from his head sense and motion to all his other members of his naturall body, and that although the soule cannot from the head send sense and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the other members of his naturall bodie without the meanes of <hi>Arctures</hi> and <hi>Ligaments;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the members of the naturall man are tied together, that by that meanes sense and motion may be conueyed from his head to the other members, and that yet the head and other members of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body are not so fitly coneyed

                  <p>To vvhich it may be answered, that as vvee be naturall men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee eate and drinke, and performe all other actions and vvorkes of men, vvho are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally liuing in bodily health; yet vntill by our <hi>vnion with Christ,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till by our <hi>effectuall calling,</hi> vntill by our <hi>Iustification,</hi> and vntill by our <hi>Sanctification,</hi> wee be made <hi>new Creatures in Christ, wee are dead in our sinnes,</hi> because vvee be no more able to doe any the workes of new creatures liuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in Christ, that is to say, we are no more able to doe any works acceptable vnto GOD, then the man naturally dead, is able to eate or drinke, or to doe any other worke or action of the man who is naturally liuing, because the vvhole naturall man, and euery part of him, is wholy corrupted
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20506:26"/>
with sinne, and therefore dead in sinne, for:</p>
                  <p>First, in his minde there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14. Rom. 8. 5. Ephes. 4. 18.</note> but <hi>blindnesse and ignorance, concerning heauenly matters.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, his conscience is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, being alwayes either benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 19. Tit. 4. Esay 57. 20.

                  <p>Fourthly, the affections of his <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5. Phil. 2. 13.</note> heart, as <hi>Loue, Ioy, Hope, Desire, &amp;c.</hi> are stirred and moued to that onely vvhich is euill, and neuer to that which is good.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the members of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 24. Rom. 7. 18. 19.</note> are Tooles and Instruments of his minde for the execution of sinne.</p>

                     <hi>be made new creatures by our effectual vnion with Christ,</hi> by our effectuall calling, by our Iustification and Sanctification, which foure degrees of our regeneration, howsoeuer they in nature goe one before the other, yet too make vs new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Christ, doe so concurre, that the true beleeuer or regenerate person, finding himselfe to haue the one of them, may assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hee hath them all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for,</p>
                  <p>First, the true beleeuer may assure himselfe of this vnion vvith CHRIST, when hee findeth that Christ of his loue preuenting him doth begin the vnion by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating vnto him his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, dwelling in his man hood, through the ministerie of his holy Word, and by the cooperation of the same Spirit vvith his word doth beget in him a liuely faith, by which the true beleeuer on his part, as by his onely instru ment is actually vnited vnto Christ,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20506:27"/>
but this vnion is not perceiued by the regenerate person before he be called.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, therefore the true beleeuer may assure himselfe, that he hauing a liuely faith, is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called to the knowledge of the things he beleeueth, for no man can effectually consent vnto the thing conteined in the Word, much lesse by a liuely faith beleeue the things herein conteined, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee be first by the ministery of the Word, instructed and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the knowledge thereof, <hi>to wit,</hi> by hauing his vnderstanding inlightned with the knowledge of the truth and his vvill thereunto perswaded.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the true beleeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by faith, as aforesaid, vnited vnto Christ, and called by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of the Word to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that which by a liuely faith hee beleeueth, hee may assure himselfe of his Iustification; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20506:27"/>
that the faithfull are iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before GOD, by the onely imputation of Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: for in what manner Christ was made a sinner for vs, in the same manner are wee made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by him: but Christ was made a sinner for vs by imputation of our sinnes vnto him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are made righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by imputation of his righteousnesse vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Againe, as vvee are made sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (that is) guiltie of the first <hi>Adams</hi> transgression; so are wee made not guiltie, and iustified, by the obedience of the second <hi>Adam:</hi> but wee are made guiltie of the first <hi>Adams</hi> transgression by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and therefore wee are iustified by the imputation of the obedience of the second <hi>Adam.</hi> Now the imputation of Christs righteousnesse vnto vs, doth as vpon the onely cause and reason therof depend vpon our vnion with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20506:28"/>
Christ, made on our parts by faith onely.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the true beleeuer finding himselfe vnited vnto Christ, and Called, and liuely Iustified hee may assure himselfe of his <hi>Sanctification:</hi> for <hi>a liuely faith</hi> is not of our selues, <hi>but it is of GOD.</hi> By it wee are in diuers <note place="margin">Hphes. 2. 8.</note> respects both iustified and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: by it wee are iustified, not formally, as by a <hi>meritorious ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or part of righteousnesse inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in vs,</hi> but relatiuely in respect of the Object it apprehendeth, <hi>to wit, as by it wee apply to our selues the righteousnesse inherent in Christ Iesus man-hood:</hi> which of his owne meere mercie is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto all who lay holde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon by faith: but by it wee are sanctified, as by a <hi>grace inherent in vs,</hi> as are also the graces of hope and charitie, and other sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graces, which being in the man-hood of CHRIST without

measure, are by his spirit from thence infused vnto vs in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to sanctifie vs, and make vs fit for the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: and to speake both briefely and plainely of this matter, Faith is a chiefe part of our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, being, as it vvere, the roote both of other inward gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and outward obedience which concurre to our Sanctification.</p>

whereby the Lord declareth his might and power to bring vs to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and by the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> it is accounted the wisedome of God to bring men to saluation: for (saith hee) seeing the world by wisedome knew not God in the wisedome of God (that is, by the consideration of the workemanship of the world, whereby God maketh manifest his exceeding Power and Wisedome) it pleased God by foolish preaching to saue beleeuers as if he should say, although by the wisemen of the world, the preaching of the word of God is no otherwise made recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of, then of a foolish thing: yet with God it is the greatest and chiefest wisedome to bring men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to saluation, being heard and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with due reuerence.</p>
