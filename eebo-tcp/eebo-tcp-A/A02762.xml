            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4021:5"/>
thinke it is too late, or in vaine, to vſe the meanes: or that Wraths ouerpreſſing load ſo keepeth you down in the flouds of ſorrowes, that you are not able to looke vp.</p>
            <p>Yet could I not chuſe but ſend vnto your view this little <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> which by (Gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into my hands) onely for your ſakes, did now ſee the light: wiſhing, that though (of all others) I was leaſt able to comfort you; yet, that therin you might finde a word in due time: which I know you ſhall, if you banniſh Carnall reaſon, Senſe, Curioſitie in prying into Gods Decree before you vſe the meanes; and that faſt roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted naturall Popery of the ſoule, which euer deſireth to finde ſomewhat in nature, ſome ſenſe, ſome feeling, ſome goodnes, wherewith to be worthy in ſome ſort, to lay holde of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhould exceede the limites of a ſhort Epiſtle (if I were able) to reckon vp the free proclamations of the booke of God; in all which, Chriſt in the Act of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending him, tyeth you vnto no condition, but freely to take and lay hold. It may be, you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, that he calleth onely the weary and laden, and ſo you ſay you are not: but to leaue that queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you bee laden or not, and who muſt be iudge, (ſince for the moſt part in temptation you belie your ſelues) who knoweth not that Chriſt in that place ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incourageth ſuch to come, then preciſely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that onely thoſe who feele ſuch a burden, muſt,
<pb facs="tcp:4021:5"/>
and can come and lay holde. O that you were not thus iniurious to the peace of your ſoules, ſo much to relye vpon Senſe and feeling, ſo much debaſing the ſtrength and glorie of Faith, which many times without ſenſe (and beyond all reaſon) apprehendeth CHRIST: thus offering violence vnto his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: who thus apprehended, there followeth the ſpirit of Mourning, and Compaſſion, Feeling, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces.</p>
            <p>I wonder if the Diuell can once faſten this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation vpon you, that you muſt haue ſuch and ſuch a meaſure of faith, feeling, and repentance, to lay holde of Chriſt, what meaſure his vnmeaſurable ſubtilty wil be contented with. Sure I am, if he may be vmpire, you may be diſſolued in teares and deſpaire, before he ſay hoe. Your ſtrongeſt let in laying hold of Chriſt (as may be ſeene by moſt of all your Obiections) ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from your prying into the Decree of God, to be aſſured of your election: which becauſe you cannot finde, (iudging of your ſelues, according to your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer actions, &amp; thinking God like vnto you) you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all is in vaine, you knowe you are Reprobates: there is no hope: ſo entertaining all threatnings; and reiecting the Promiſes. Of which pretended know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if you ſhould be examined by God (as <hi>Adam</hi> was) whence thus you knowe your ſelues to be naked Reprobates? I imagine your anſwere (with his) muſt needes bee, that Sathan hath deceyued and deluded
<pb facs="tcp:4021:6"/>
you ſo to thinke.</p>
            <p>And indeed the truth is, that the moſt part of you looke too much at the Decree of God; your meaſure of ſenſe and feeling, deſiring the aſſurance of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it were, at your firſt entrie into Chriſtianity: which is the glorious price and Crowne, wayting for you at the end of the race: If you ſo runne that you may obtaine.</p>
            <p>I knowe you would thinke him an vnreaſonable Souldier, who ſhould deſire to bee a Colonnell or a Generall the firſt yeare, which is not obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out long ſeruice, great valour, much watching, way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and often hazard of life: And that your ſeruant would much diſpleaſe you, in demanding his yeeres wages before he had done a weekes worke. Iuſt ſo is your caſe, when at firſt you would bee aſſured of your Election and Saluation, before you haue done a quarter or half your work; (Nay ſomtimes ſcarſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the ſame) chiefly whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you refuſe the way of life, which is, to walke in the meanes, whereby onely wee attaine the aſſurance of ſaluation.</p>
            <p>It may bee you thinke mee a miſerable comforter, thus rather to croſſe you, then powre balme into your wounds, or bewaile your hardneſſe of Heart: but would to God you were not more iniurious then I, in robbing your ſelues of the ſtrong Tower of your ſaluation: I meane, of the way to lay holde on Chriſt for your life: For indeede ſo doe I pittie all of you,
<pb facs="tcp:4021:6"/>
that if my ſoule were able, and could diſſolue it ſelfe in teares for you, your ſorrowes would haue an ende: ſince I know, ſuch and ſo great is the inſupportable terrour of Gods wrath, chiefly, if hee (leading the maine battell of his forces) fight againſt you, as <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> ſpeaketh) in anger, in wrath, and in great indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that there is no creature but muſt ſinke vnder the ſame: but it is the concluſions ſome of you draw from thence, which I ayme at, and would willingly cut downe by the roote: <hi>viz:</hi> I feele no faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue none: I neuer had faith, therefore I ſhall neuer haue any: My former actions haue bene hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall, therefore I am damned: my Feeling is loſt, therefore I ſhall neuer haue it againe: I neuer had feeling or ſenſe of Gods loue, therefore I ſhall neuer haue any: God is angry, therefore hee will neuer be appeaſed: the Sunne ſhineth not, therefore it will neuer ſhine: It is night, therefore it will neuer bee day: the heart was neuer moued, therefore it ſhall, and neuer can bee mooued: I haue thus, and thus long heard the word, and it hath not renued nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued mee no more then a ſtone, therefore it ſhall and cannot, for ſuch a heart is immoueable: I am dead in ſinne, therefore I can neuer be aliue: God is gone, therefore hee will neuer come againe: The meanes harden mee more and more, therefore I will neuer heare no more: I cannot bring my he<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

to bring words vnto God, offering outward ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue obedience: I cannot pay vnto one ten thouſand pounds which <hi>I</hi> owe him, therfore I will pay him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a penny: I cannot doe all I ſhould, therefore I will doe nothing: God neuer loued mee, therefore hee will neuer loue mee: I cannot repent, nor euer could, therefore I neither can nor ſhall: God in the terror of wrath appeareth my enemy, therefore hee will neuer haue mercie, &amp;c: with a number the like abſurdities, the very naming whereof, may bee more then confutation ſufficient to any reaſonable creature not infected with the like follie.</p>
            <p>But ſpeake now (though I graunt vnto you all your grounds, many of which for the moſt parte, are falſe lyes) Why may not you hope to eſcape, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before you? Who deliuered <hi>Dauid, Iob, Ioſeph, Moſes, Damell, &amp;c.</hi> from daungers, terrors of ſoule, the Deuill, impriſonment, drowning, and Lyons den? but you ſay, that you are in the Furnace of his wrath. And why (with the three Children) may you not bee deliuered from this fiery furnace? <hi>GOD</hi> is the ſame ſtill (who as the Prophet ſpeaketh) euen in wrath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members mercie: Therefore why may not your buſh burne, or (at leaſt) ſeeme to burne with fire, yet not be conſumed: ſince his mercies are ouer all his works? hee onely knowing what he hath decreed. And you, who are (for the preſent) bound vp in hardneſſe of heart, in the Name of <hi>GOD</hi> I beſeech you, let neuer
<pb facs="tcp:4021:7"/>
this voyce of deſperation come from you againe: (All is in vaine, there remaineth no hope:) What, is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, No hope? Is God in heauen, who is wonderfull in all his works? and doth abundantly aboue all that wee are able to thinke or ſpeake? and ſo long dare any little worme or piece of clay, (a little moate) nay not ſo much, in regard of him, who is all in all, to ſay there is no hope? Oh! there remaneth alwaies hope ſo long as we breath. For you knowe as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh: Hope that is ſeene is no hope: For how can a man hope for that which he ſeeth? ſo that hope aboue hope, is hope indeede. O hope ſtill to ſpeed as well as any hard-hearted who euer were called, as all haue beene before calling. When then after ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall calling, you looke vpon <hi>Dauids</hi> ſecure ſleepe, and <hi>Salomons</hi> ſtrange hard-hearted declining from the wayes of God, with the wonderfull and hard-harted impietie of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> before cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: and the exceeding mercies of God vnto them: and diuers in our age, with (the good Thiefe) called home at the laſt houre: O learne to haue a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of God. It was you know, the firſt thing that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the prodigall ſonne to come home vnto his Father, becauſe he had a good conceit of him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thinke you with him, the Heauenly Father hath receiued ſuch and ſuch exceeding ſinners into mercie. Though I haue run ryot, &amp; ſtraied, yet haue I not gon ſo farre as they, or if I haue, yet I will ſubmit my ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:4021:8"/>
vnto him, it may bee, hee will alſo be mercifull vnto mee. But what ſhall I ſay? It is God who muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <hi>Iaphet</hi> to dwell in the Tents of <hi>Sem.</hi> It is hee who muſt caſt downe, perſwade, inlighten, drawe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, teach, conuert, and inlarge our hearts, that wee may bee lifted vp, conſent, ſee, come, vnderſtand, bee taught, conuerted, and runne the wayes of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, which that he would haſten in his own good time to doe, my fainte, fewe, colde, and weake petitions ſhall euer (to my power) beg for you.</p>
            <p>Onely now (for concluſion) my earneſt requeſt vnto you is, that ſince it is the cuſtom of moſt of you, either in reading the Scriptures, or anie other good booke) to reade vntil you find ſomewhat (in your iudgement) againſt you, and then cloſe the booke ſuddenly, as though nothing there did belong vnto you; that you would not ſo vſe this little enſuing Treatiſe: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before you Cenſure, to reade it quite through: reiecting whatſoeuer herein you find contrary ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>Word,</hi> or experience of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: which if you ſhall doe, you ſhall bind me more then euer to remaine,</p>

               <p>Nature it ſelfe fully proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the ſame. 1. From the Creation, for if the world be without beginning ſo is it alſo without ending, and ſo it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4021:18"/>
and all therein is God, hauing made it ſelfe, which were moſt abſurd to thinke: but ſince it ſhal haue an ending (all the creatures thereof tending to corruption) hence it followeth, that it muſt needes haue a beginning, the Creator whereof, is God. 2. The excellencie of all the creatures ſhew the ſame:<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>1.1.</hi> pſal. <hi>1.24.</hi>
                  </note> ſo infinite in formes, ſhapes, colours, &amp; diuers diſpoſitions: chiefly the ſupernaturall ſpirit of man, not ſatiate with any thing in Nature. 3. Man himſelfe, ſheweth that there is a God, for one man leadeth vs to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntill by degrees we come vp to the firſt. Here I aske, where he had his beginning? Eternall he was not, which his miſerable nature ſo ſubiect to alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration &amp; change, well ſheweth, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his diſſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; (Eternitie &amp; change, like light and darknes, being ſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary.) If it be ſaid, this change came by his fall; then, I ask, whence he fell? So ſtill, all we can thinke, it muſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4021:18"/>
leade vs vnto God the Creator of all. 4. The wel ordered gouernment in the worlde: things inferiour ſeruing ſtill things ſuperiour; vntil all things ioyne in mans ſeruice; ſhewe that there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome ſupreame power, vnto which he muſt obey. 5. The harmony of contrarie Elements, whereof all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do conſiſt, ſo farre from deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, that they preſerue all and agree: prooueth a ſuperiour cauſing power. 6. The naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of all nations, (rather adoring ſtockes, ſtones, and beaſtes, then no Deitie at all) proueth the ſame. 7. The conſcience of all, being as it were a law againſt vs, in giuing both teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and iudgment, is a moſt ſtrong proofe: for it teſtifieth, neither to men nor Angels: neither feareth them. Therefore it muſt bee God himſelfe. Further, would not our reaſon tell vs by and by, if wee were in ſome faire built ruinous countrey or citie, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4021:19"/>
there had ſome people dwelt: that ſome hands had built the ſame? So may we ſay of this world, when we ſee it ſo repleniſhed with ſo many goodly creatures, that ſome great power did make the ſame, &amp; that muſt needs be God. Moreouer, the place of God, proueth that there is a God: for (as one ſaith) euery place is in regard of ſomwhat contained in the place. So the Earth is full of wormes, and ſuch like things; the ſea containeth fiſhes; faire houſes containe men &amp; women; Hell it is the place for diuels. Heauen likewiſe muſt not bee emptie, it being the goodlieſt of all the reſt: when wee looke vpon the ſame we muſt needes ſay, that there dwelles the Lord of the countrey, there dwelles God himſelfe. Laſtly (but it were too tedious) I might adde how abundantly the Scriptures ſhewe the ſame: as alſo the euent of things contrary to reaſon: Miracles, Prophecyings, continuall mercies of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4021:19"/>
fruitfull ſeaſons, &amp;c. Which <hi>Paul</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth: puniſhments in this life, with ſtrange iudgements on diuers wicked men; as <hi>Herod,</hi> &amp;c. with the wonderfull power of the ſpirit in the experience of the faithfull. Further, (as one obſerues) that no volume hath euer bin written directly in confutation of the ſame.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>O</hi> Moſt mighty, moſt glorious, eternall, iuſt, holy, omnipotent, all-ſeeing, and euer-liuing God, who art full of terrible Maieſtie in all thy workes, iuſt in all thy iudgements, yet moſt of all wonderfull in thy Chriſt: Since now it hath beene thy bleſſed will to ſend vnto thy poore diſtreſſed ſeruants this weake helpe, how to know, ſhunne, and iudge of thy wrath: Be graciouſly pleaſed alſo by the bowels of all thy tender mercies in thy Chriſt, to giue a bleſsing vnto the ſame, accompanying it with the powerfull working of thy meruailous Spirit: that thereby it may bee able to miniſter a word in due time to their wearie ſoules, effecting that for which thou haſt ſent it. And for the glory of thy
<pb facs="tcp:4021:95"/>
Names ſake, ſo remoue thou the darkeneſſe, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ignorance, obſtinacie and terrours of their minde, eyes, vnderſtanding, will, and conſcience; that the abuſed powers of their ſoules, may no more bee ſtayed by any deluding fancies, from effecting their proper functions: To effect which, O be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thou boundleſſe bottomleſſe Ocean of mercie, for Ieſus ſake to remoue from before them that vaile which is drawne before, and ſpread ouer all fleſh, that they may ſee and iudge of things inuiſible: thus attaining to haue a good conceite of thee their moſt gracious and louing God. O, ſince all Nations are as nothing before thee, and in that they are, it is becauſe thou calleſt things that are not, as though they were, (thus cauſing them to be) therfore but cal thou them, which in their owne eyes and feeling are not, and they ſhall preſently be ſomewhat: for ſo long as their abuſed fancies preſent thee vnto them as their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, perſwading themſelues not to belong vnto thy decree, what can they doe but runne away from thee? Therefore for thy mercies ſake in redemption, paſſe thou by all their tranſgreſsions, onely looking through the all-ſufficient merits of thy well-beloued Sonne vpon them, that thus their ſins may not ſtay
<pb facs="tcp:4021:95"/>
thy mercies. And giue them willing hearts to come vnto the place where thy honor dwelleth: that in thy good time the means may ſo ſoften their hard hearts (by thy mighty aſsiſting power) that they may attaine vnto the Spirit of mourning and compaſsion, thus teaching them to lay hold vpon Chriſt (that Altar of refuge) for their life. And ſince Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are thy gift; giue vnto them theſe graces for thy Chriſts ſake, that ſo confeſsing their ſinnes, they may call vnto thee for mercie, thy mercie by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; thus giuing them aſſurance of remiſsion of ſinnes, that ſo remiſsion of ſinnes may giue them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of ſaluation. And for thoſe who lye now as thunder-beaten vnder the terrour of thy wrath: O looke vpon them alſo in the multitude of tender compaſsion: heare them now ſpeedily, when their ſpirit faileth, put their teares in thy bottle, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly comfort them with thy choice conſolations, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them a liuely hope in expectation of their ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deliuerance. In the meane time perſwade their ſoules that they are thine, that furie is not in thee, that all theſe things ſhall worke together for the beſt vnto them. And, good Lord, ſo temper thou the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of thy iuſtice and terrors of their conſciences,
<pb facs="tcp:4021:96"/>
that as thou caſteſt them downe with the one hand, ſo thou wouldeſt raiſe &amp; hold them vp by the other: as thou ſheweſt vnto them the threatnings due vnto their ſinnes (and thereby the exacting rigour of thy iuſtice) ſo open their eyes to ſee thy manifold free promiſes in Chriſt Ieſus; that they may apply the merits and vertue of his obedience, death, paſsion and blood, vnto their trembling ſoules. Oh, as thou art mighty to ſaue, ſo ſhew thy mighty power in con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>founding all their enemies; in wrath remembring mercie. And grant vnto them for thy Chriſts ſake, grace to be truely humbled vnder thy mighty hand, and draw neere vnto thee, that thou mayeſt raiſe them vp in thy good time: Vntill which time, giue them patience, hope, faith in thy promiſes, the Spirit of prayer, many comforters; and in the multitude of thy exceeding mercies, accept of their faint and weake grones, ſighes, deſires, wiſhes and prayers, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a bleſsing vnto all their endeauours. And good Lord, of thy moſt exceeding rich mercies, for Chriſts ſake, confound Sathan and all his ſuggeſtions in any of theſe thy children, by thy mighty and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable power: &amp; though thou ſuffer him to tempt, yet let him neuer ouercome them. But diſcouer
<pb facs="tcp:4021:96"/>
thou the Tempter in his colours, that ſo (diſcerning him to be the Father of liars) they may no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue his ſuggeſtions. And teach them all ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue thee in thy word (vſing the meanes of their ſaluation) that in thy goodtime, they may finde peace of conſcience, and ioy in the holy Ghoſt. And good Lord, becauſe, if thou preſent thy ſelfe vnto them as a conſuming fire, no creature dare approach the mount of thy Holineſſe: O put off thy glittering ſword for a while, and arme thee with all thy attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of mercie, that ſo theſe poore ſoules may with boldneſſe drawe neere vnto thy Throne, ſo confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their miſerie, and giuing thee praiſe of thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that thou mayeſt reſtore vnto them their peace.
