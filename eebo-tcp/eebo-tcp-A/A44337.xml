         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>i, <hi>Jam. 2. 1. LEt not the Faith which ye have
in our Lord Jesus Christ</hi> be
blemished <hi>with partialitie,</hi> regard not who
it is which speaketh, but weigh only what is
spoken. Think not that ye read the words
of one who bendeth himself as an Adversary
against the truth which ye have already em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced;
but the words of one, who desireth
even to embrace together with you the self same
truth, if it be the truth. <hi>S.</hi> I.</p>
            <p>ii. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. Whatsoever we do, if
our own secret Judgment consent not unto
it as fit and good to be done, the doing
of it to us is sin, although the thing it self
be allowable. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule therefore ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
is, <hi>Let every man in his own mind
be fully perswaded of that thing which he either
alloweth or doth. S.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>iii. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 7. If the understanding power
or faculty of the soul be, like unto bodily sight,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99669:4"/>
not of equal sharpness in all, what can be
more convenient than that even as the dark-sighted
man is directed by the clear about
thing Visible; so likewise in matters of deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
discourse, the wise in heart do shew the
simple where his way lyeth? In our doubtful
cases of Law, what man is there who seeth
not how requisite it is, that professors
of skill in that faculty be our directors? so
it is in all other kinds of knowledge. And
even in Divine likewise, the Lord hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
appointed, that <hi>the Priests lips should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
knowledge, and that other men should
seek the truth at his mouth, because he is the
Messenger of the Lord of Hosts. S.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>iv. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 1. Dearly beloved, <hi>Give not
credit unto every Spirit.</hi> There are but two
ways whereby the Spirit leadeth men into all
truth: the one extraordinary, the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
the one belonging but unto some few,
the other extending it self unto all that are
of God: the one that which we call by
special Divine excellency <hi>Revelation,</hi> the other
<hi>Reason. S.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>v. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 12. Were it for the Glory of
God, and the good of his Church indeed
that the Clergy should be left even as bare
as the Apostles when they had neither staff
nor scrip; that God, which should lay upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99669:4"/>
them the condition of his Apostles, would
I hope endue them with the self same affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which was in that Holy Apostle, whose
words concerning his own right vertuous
contentment of heart, <hi>As well how to want,
as how to abound,</hi> are a most fit Episcopal
Empress.</p>
            <p>vi. Rom 3. 17. <hi>The way of peace they
have not known.</hi> Ways of peaceable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
there are but these two certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
one, a Sentence of judicial division, given
by Authority thereto appointed within our
selves; the other, the like kind of Sentence
given by a more universal Authority. The
former of which two ways God himself in
the Law prescribeth (<hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 8.) and
his Spirit it was which directed the very first
Christian Churches in the World to use the
latter, <hi>Act. 15. S.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>vii. <hi>Iob</hi> 39. 37. Amongst so many, so
huge volums as the infinite pains of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
hath brought forth, what one hath
gotten him greater love, commendation, and
honor, than the Book wherein he carefully
collecteth his own oversights, and sincerely
condemneth them? Many Speeches there
are of <hi>Iob</hi>'s, whereby his Wisdom and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vertues may appear; but the glory of an
ingenuous mind he hath purchased by these
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99669:5"/>
words only. <hi>Behold I will lay mine hand on
my mouth: I have spoken once, yet will I not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
maintain an argument, yea twice, howbeit for
that cause farther I will not proceed. S.</hi> 9.</p>

               <head>In Book I.</head>
               <p>i. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 18. God worketh nothing without cause.
All those things which are done by him, have
some end for which they are done: and the end
for which they are done, is a reason of his will
to do them. His will had not enclined to create
woman, but that he saw it could not be well
if she were not created. <hi>Non est bonum, it
is not good, man should be alone.</hi> Therefore
let us make an Helper for him. That, and
nothing else is done by God, which to leave
undone were not good. <hi>S.</hi> 2.</p>

               <p>iii. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 11. They are, who think, that of the
Will of God to do this or that, there is no
reason besides his Will. Many times no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
known to us, but that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thereof, I judge it most unreasonable
to imagin, in as much as he worketh all things

to his own Will, but <hi>the counsel of his
own will.</hi> And whatsoever is done with Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
or wise Resolution, hath of necessity some
reason why it should be done; Albeit that
reason be to us in some things so secret, that
it forceth the Wit of man to stand, as the
blessed Apostle himself doth, amazed thereat:
<hi>Rom. 11. 33. O the depth of the riches both of the
Wisdom and Knowledge of God! How unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

               <p>iv. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17. Concerning the <hi>Counsel</hi> of
God, (the same with that <hi>Law</hi> of God, whereby
he worketh all things, whereof he is the Cause
and Author) the Apostle termeth it a thing
<hi>unchangeable.</hi> Nor is the <hi>freedom</hi> of the Will
of God any whit abated, let, or hindred by
means of this; because the imposition of this
Law upon himself, is his own free and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

to signifie the infinite greatness of Gods power,
by the easieness of his accomplishing such
effects, without Travel, Pain, or Labour:
But his commanding those things to be which
are, and to be in such sort as they are, to keep

are huge, mighty, and royal Armies, so likewise
in perfection of Obedience to that Law which
the Highest, whom they adore, love, and
imitate, hath imposed upon them; such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servants
they are thereof, that our Saviour
himself being to set down the perfect <hi>Idea</hi>
of that which we are to pray, and wish for

more, than only, that here it might be with us,

meaning is, that by force of the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
wherewith God illuminateth every one
which cometh into the World, men being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to know Truth from Falshood, and Good

The drift of the old, that which the Apostle
mentioneth to <hi>Timothy, 2 Tim. 3. 15. The holy
Scripturees are able to make thee Wise unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
So that the general end both of old
and new, is one: The difference between
them consisting in this, that the old did make
wise by teaching Salvation through Christ that
should come; the New, by teaching that
Christ the Saviour is come, and that Jesus
whom the <hi>Iews</hi> did crucifie, and whom God
did raise again from the dead, is He. When
the Apostle therefore affirmed unto <hi>Timothy,</hi>
that the Old was able to make him <hi>Wise unto
Salvation;</hi> it was not his meaning, that the
Old alone can do this unto us, which live
since the publication of the New: For he
speaketh with presupposal of the Doctrine of
Christ, known also unto <hi>Timothy:</hi> And
he addeth, <hi>Through the Faith which is in
Christ.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>xiv. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14, 6. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> peculiarly terms

because there can be no reason wherefore
the publishing thereof should be taken away,
and any other instead of it proclaimed, as long
as the World doth continue. Whereas the
whole Law of Rites and Ceremonies, although
delivered with so great solemnity, is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

unless there be reason shewed, which may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
enforce, that the Law of Reason, or

we either interrupt or otherwise abridge

the Rule &amp; Canon whereby touching this point
the very order of the Church is framed. The
appointment of times for solemn ordination is
but the publick demand of the Church in the
