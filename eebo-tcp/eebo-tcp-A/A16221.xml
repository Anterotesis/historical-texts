         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Began this Arithmeticke more than ſeuen

Bacon,</hi> the daughter of Sir <hi>Nicholas Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
Knight, a man of moſt excellent wit,
and of moſt deepe iudgment, and ſometime
Lord Keeper of the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi>
and latelie (as ſhee hath bene manie yeares paſt) the moſt loving
and faithfull wife of my worſhipfull friend M. Iuſtice <hi>Wynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
not long ſince deceaſed, who for his integritie of life, and
for his wiſedome and iuſtice daylie ſhewed in gouernement, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
for his good hoſpitalitie deſerued great commendation. And
though at her requeſt I had made this Arithmeticke ſo plaine
and eaſie as was poſsible (to my ſeeming) yet her continuall ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
would not ſuffer her to exerciſe her ſelfe therein. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that diuerſe having ſeene it, and liking my plaine order of
teaching therein, were deſirous to haue copies thereof, I thought
good therefore to print the ſame, and to augment it with many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
rules meet for thoſe that are deſirous to ſtudie any part of
Coſmographie, Aſtronomie, or Geographie, and ſpeciallie the
Arte of Navigation, in which without Arithmeticke, as I haue
ſaid before, they ſhall hardly profit. But nowe to returne to my
<pb facs="tcp:2698:5"/>
matter, the contents of this Arithmeticke are theſe here follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Firſt, hauing defined what Arithmeticke is, and what nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration
or numbring is, and of what parts it conſiſteth, and how
to number any great ſumme written in many figures, I deale
with the foure ſpeciall kindes of Arithmeticke, that is, Addition,
Subtraction, multiplication, and division. Then I ſhewe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of working in whole numbers, called in Latine <hi>Integra,</hi> by
the rule of proportion, otherwiſe called the golden rule, or the rule
of three. Then I treat of broken numbers called Fractions, ſetting
downe ſeuen neceſſarie rules belonging thereunto, by the helpe
whereof you ſhall be the better able to adde, ſubtract, to multiplie
and divide the ſame. That done, I ſhew how to vſe the rule of three
aſwell in dealing with ſole fractions as with fractions annexed to
integrums, which rule of three is threefold, that is, the common
rule, the rule reverſe, and the double rule, the order of all which
three kindes I doe plainlie teach by examples, ſhewing wherein,
how, and when, they are to be vſed. Next to that I ſet downe the
rule of fellowſhip, a neceſſarie rule for thoſe that haue to traffique
in anie trade of merchandize, giving divers examples thereof.
Next to that I treat of Arithmeticall, and Geometricall progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and alſo of proportion, and of the three kindes thereof, that
is, of proportion Arithmeticall, Geometricall, and muſicall.
Then I ſhew how to finde out the ſquare roote of anie number,
and alſo the vſe thereof in ſetting of Battels, and alſo how to finde
out the cubique roote of any number. And laſt of all I treat of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomicall
fractions, ſhewing how to adde, to ſubtract, to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
and divide the ſame. And alſo to take the ſquare root there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
without the knowledge of which fractions, you can neuer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
any thing trulie out of the Aſtronomicall Tables.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps do look here that I ſhould ſpeak ſomewhat of the

                  <p>It is the art of counting or numbring
by figures.</p>
                  <p>What is to number by figures?</p>
                  <p>It is to expreſſe the value of any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in his proper Characters and figures,
which is called by a Latine name <hi>Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What belongeth to Numeration?</p>
                  <p>Two things, to know the ſhapes of the figures, and the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of their places.</p>
                  <p>How many figures are there?</p>
                  <p>Theſe ten. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 0. Whereof the tenth made
like an. 0. as you ſée here, is called a Cypher, which is no num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of it ſelfe, but ſerueth onely to fill vp a number.</p>
                  <p>What is number?</p>
                  <p>Number is a collection or ſomme of many ones added toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>How is number deuided?</p>
                  <p>Into thrée kinds, that is Digit, Article and compound.</p>
                  <p>Which be they?</p>
                  <p>The Digit is any of the firſt 9. figures before ſet downe. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
is any number ending in ten, as ten is one Article, twentie
is two Articles, thirtie is thrée Articles, &amp;c. Compound is that
which is compounded of Article &amp; Digit, as 13. 14. 17. 24. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Shew what ſignification euery Digit hath according to his
<pb facs="tcp:2698:9"/>
place, and in what order ſuch place is to be conſidered in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsing
any number?</p>
                  <p>The order as touching the place, is to beginne at the right
hand, and ſo to procéede towardes the left hand. For any of the 9.
Digits whatſoeuer, ſtanding in the firſt place, which is on the
right hand, ſignifieth the value of himſelfe onely, in the ſecond
place ten times himſelfe, in the third place Hundreth times
himſelfe, in the fourth place a Thouſand times himſelfe, in the
fift place ten Thouſand times himſelf, in the ſixt place a hundreth
Thouſand times himſelfe, in the ſeuenth place a Myllion, in the
eight place ten Myllions, in the ninth place a hundreth Myllions
in the tenth place a thouſand Myllions, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Doth the Cypher ſignifie nothing?</p>
                  <p>Yes it maketh a place whereſoeuer it ſtandeth, ſo as it be not
the outermoſt on the left hand: for there it hath no place at all, as
here you may ſée in this number, 04500. whereof the firſt Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
on the right hand, ſignifieth the firſt place, the ſecond Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
the ſecond place, but the laſt and outermoſt Cypher on the
left hand, ſignifieth no place at all, becauſe it hath no Digit ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
before it towards the left, hand, and therefore though in this
number there be 5. figures, yet it ſignifieth no more but foure
Thouſand and fiue Hundreth.</p>
                  <p>By what meanes may a great number written in many fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
be readily expreſſed or tolde?</p>
                  <p>By diuiding the ſame into diuerſe parts with ſtréekes, or
prickes made at the ende of euery third figure, beginning to tell
from the right hand towards the left, as in this number, 4/270/
570. In which, beginning with the Cypher on the right hand,
I tell one, two, and thrée, and there make a Stréeke, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding
forth ſtill towards the left hand, I make a Stréeke at the
ende of euery thirde figure, by which Stréekes or partitions I
make them now ſeuerſt numbers, and euery Stréeke must bée
named by this word Thouſand. Notwithſtanding, in expreſſing
this number being thus deuided, or any other ſuch like, you muſt
begin at the left hand, and ſay thus foure Thouſand thouſand,
thrée Hundreth twentie Thouſand, fiue Hundreth and ſeuentie:
for by reaſon of this Diuiſion, the figure 4. ſtandeth here alone,
and in the firſt place, and in déed ſignifieth 4. Myllions, and by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2698:9"/>
that means, you may more fitly expreſſe the ſaid number in ſaying
thus, foure Myllions, thrée Hundreth and twentie Thouſand, fiue
Hundreth and ſeuentie: And the better to diſcerne the Myllions
from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt in great numbers, it ſhal not be a miſſe to ſet an M. ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifiing
Myllions, right ouer the head of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Stréek which is drawne
betwixt the ſixth and ſeuenth figures, as in this example co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining
a leauen figures, 34/545 <hi rend="sup">m</hi> / 678/694. which is to be vttered thus,
thirtie foure Thouſand, fiue Hundreth fortie fiue Myllions, ſixe
Hundreth ſeuentie eight Thouſand, ſixe Hundreth nintie and
foure Crownes, or Pounds, or whatſoeuer other denomination or
name, it ſhall pleaſe you to giue them.</p>

to the higheſt figure of the ſame rancke, and ſo from rancke
to rancke, til you come to the laſt, and if the Somme of any rancke
doe not excéede the number of any of the foreſaide 9. Digits, then
ſet downe that Digit which comprehendeth that number right
vnder his proper rancke, beneath the line, but if the Somme of
that rancke, excéedeth the number of any one Digit by reaſon that
it conſiſteth of Articles and Digits, then ſet downe the Digit and
kéepe the Article or Articles in your minde, to be added to the firſt
figure of the next rancke on the left hand, but if the Somme be an

number of Article or Articles in your minde, be it, one, two, or

                     <p>Here firſt beginning with the
Collum of farthings, I finde therein
3. farthings which is one halfe peny
and one farthing. Wherefore I ſet
downe the od farthing as you ſée,

then adding the halfe pennie in minde to the loweſt halfe pennie
of the ſecond Collum, I ſay that 1. in minde and 1. maketh 2. and
2. and 1. maketh 3. then 3. and 1. maketh 4. which 4. halfe pence
becauſe they make iuſt two pence, I ſet downe a Cypher kéeping
the two pence in minde, which two pence being added to 8. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
10. then 10. and 9. maketh 19. and 19. and 1. maketh 20:
How becauſe that 20. <abbr>d</abbr>. maketh one ſhilling and 8. <abbr>d</abbr>. I ſet down
the 8. <abbr>d</abbr>. kéeping the ſhilling in minde, which on ſhilling being
added to the 6. of the next Collum maketh 7. then 7. and 4. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

and 3. and one maketh 4. Articles, which 4. Articles maketh
40. s<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is two pound which I kéepe in minde, and therefore I

                     <p>Some doe teach it to be done by calling out all the nines, which
way is more tedious then ſure: for the ſureſt tryall indeéde is to be

12. and not 10. from pounds you borrow not one Article but

right vnder the firſt figure of the number that is to be multiplyed,
on the right hand, and then orderly to place the reſt of the figures
of your multiplyer, be they few or many, towards your left hand,
directly vnder the reſt of the figures of the number that is to beé
multiplyed, for if the figures ſtand not in order one right ouer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2698:14"/>
it will bréede a confuſion in your working. Secondly you
muſt not forget to multiply all the figures of the number that is

deale with the next multiplyer, beginning alwaies on your right

Thirdly you muſt remember to ſet downe the firſt figure of euery
ſeuerall product, right vnder the figure of that multiplyer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you doe multiply, and hauing ended your Multiplication, draw
a line vnder the ſeuerall products: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> done, ad the ſeueral products

as hath béene ſaid, the product will be 3/650. if you ſet downe 2.

                     <p>How is that done?</p>
                     <p>Thus, Multiply the firſt Numerator into the ſecond, and if

of the firſt two Numerators into the third Numerator, and that

ſhall be the Numerator of the ſimple Fraction, then Multiply the

them ſo as now I finde that ¾ of ⅔ of 6/7 do make 36/84 which indéed is
no more but 3/7 as you ſhall learne hereafter by the ſixt rule.</p>
                     <p>What doth the ſecond rule teach?</p>
                     <p>To bring Fractions being more in value then Integrums in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <p>When are Fractions ſaid to be more then integrums?</p>

                     <p>To bring Integrums into parts by Multiplying the number

finde out a number that will diuide them both without leauing
ſome remainder, then leaue not to Subtract the leſſer number out
of the greater, vntill you finde two like numbers, by one of the
which two like numbers diuide both the Numerator, and alſo the
denominator ſeuerally as before, and the quotient will ſhew that
which you ſéeke: but if ſuch 2. like numbers cannot be found, then
you may aſſure your ſelfe that the Fraction cannot be written in
fewer figures then they alreadie be.</p>
                     <p>Giue examples of theſe two waies?</p>
                     <p>For example of the firſt way, ſuppoſe that you would expreſſe

them by the number of 3. you may doe: For by aſking how many
times 3. is contained in 9. the quotient will be 3. and in aſking
how many times 3 is conteined in 12. the quotient ſhall be 4. ſo
ſhall you find 9/12 to be no more then ¾. Now for example of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
way, let 27/81 be the Fraction which you would ſet down in few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
figures, here becauſe you cannot readily finde out a number that
wil euenly diuide both the Numerator and the denominator, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the leſſer out of the greater, that is to ſay 27. out of 81. and
there will ſtill remaine 54. from which Subtract 27. and there
will remaine 27. which 2. numbers becauſe they are both like, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
the Numerator and denominator of the foreſaid Fraction,
each of them by one of theſe numbers, that is to ſay, by 27. and the
quotient of the firſt Diuiſion will ſhew you the Numerator which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2698:20"/>
is 1. and the quotient of the ſecond Diuiſion wil ſhew you the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominator
which is 3. ſo as you ſhal find ⅓ to be as much in value
as 27/81 and note that when there be Cyphers both in the Numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and in the denominator ſtanding in ſuch ſorte as they may bee
euenly cut off, the remainder will ſhew the feweſt figures, wher in
the Fraction may be written as 200/500 here by cutting off the two
Cyphers as well beneath as aboue the line, with a daſh of your
penne in this manner ⅖ 00/00 the remainder ſhall bee ⅖ which is as
much in value as 200/500.</p>
                     <p>What doth the ſixt rule teach?</p>
                     <p>It teacheth to find out the value of the Fraction of any inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum.</p>
                     <p>How is that done?</p>
                     <p>Thus, Multiply the Numerator by the knowne partes of the
Integrum, and diuide the product thereof by the denominator, ſo
ſhall you haue the value of the Fraction: As for example, if you
would know the value of ¾ of an Angel, conſider firſt what partes
an Angel hath, and you ſhall find the parts thereof to be 10. s. or
30. groats, here if you Multiply 3. by 10. s. it will make 30. s.
which being diuided by 4. you ſhall finde in the quotient 7. s. and
the remainder to be 2/4 or one half of a ſhilling, which is 6. <abbr>d</abbr>. Againe
if you Multiply 3. by 30. groates it will make 90. groats, which
being diuided by 4. you ſhall finde in the quotient 22. groats, and
the remainder to be 2/4 or one halfe of a groat which is 2. pence, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in all 7. s. 6. <abbr>d</abbr>. like vnto the firſt Somme, ſo as you ſée that
¾ of an Angel is 7. s. 6. <abbr>d</abbr>. and thus you may deale with the Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of any other Integrum that hath knowne parts.</p>
                     <p>What doth the ſeauenth rule teach?</p>
                     <p>It teacheth to bring Fractions of diuerſe denominations to
one ſelfe denomination, without the which nether Addition, nor
Subtraction of Fractions can be made: As for example if you
would adde ⅔ and ⅘ together, you muſt firſt bring them to one ſelfe
denomination thus, Multiply the denominators the one into the
other, and the product thereof ſhall be a common denominator to
both the Fractions, wherefore ſay 3. times 5. doe make 15. which
muſt be ſet downe in 2. ſeueral places by them ſelues thus, 15. and
15. then Multiply the Numerator of the firſt Fraction into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominator
of the ſecond, as 2. into 5. maketh 10. which ſet downe
<pb facs="tcp:2698:21"/>
ouer the firſt common denominator thus 10/15 then Multiply the
Numerator of the ſecond Fraction into the denominator of the
firſt Fraction, as 4. into 3. which maketh 12. and that muſt bée
likewiſe ſet downe ouer the ſecond common denominator thus 12/15
ſo ſhall you find that ⅔ and ⅘ are all one in value with 10/15 and 12/15.</p>

Somme?</p>
                  <p>Thus, Multiply the laſt Somme of the
progreſſion by the number of the proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
whereby ſuch progreſſion procéedeth, and
from the product of that Multiplycation,
Subtract the firſt number of the progreſſion, that done, diuide that
which remaineth by a number which is leſſe then the proportion
by one, and the quotient of ſuch Diuiſion ſhall ſhew you the totall
Somme of the ſaid progreſſion. As for example, let this bee the
progreſſion 2. 6. 18. 54. 162. 486. 1458. the proportion of which
progreſſion is tryple, wherefore according to the rule, I Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the laſt number of the progreſſion by 3. and the product of ſuch
Multiplycation amounteth to 4/374. out of which Somme I
Subtract the firſt number which is 2. and there remaineth 4372.
which I diuide by 2. (for it is leſſe then be proportion 3. by 1.) and
ſo I finde in the quotient 2186. which is the totall Somme of the
progreſſion Geometricall.</p>
                  <p>Is there no brieffer way of adding ſuch kinds of progreſsion?</p>
                  <p>Yes indéede, but not ſo plaine as this way is, and therefore I
thinke not good to trouble your memorie therewith.</p>

                  <p>Proportion is taken generally for the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

we deale with Proportion, and with the 3. kinds thereof, that is
Proportion Arithmeticall, Geometricall, and Muſicall: You haue
firſt to vnderſtand, that of numbers ſome are ſaid to be abſtract,
and ſome concreate.</p>
                  <p>The abſtract are ſuch as are not tyed to any denomination, and
ſuch are twofold, that is abſolute and relatiue.</p>
                  <p>The abſolute, are ſimply pronounced without hauing any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to any other number, meaſure, or quantitie, as 2. 3. 4. &amp;c.
and all numbers whatſoeuer, that are without denomination and
are not attributed to any other thing.</p>
                  <p>The relatiue are thoſe which haue relation one to another,
which may be thrée manner of waies. Firſt in reſpect of difference
which is found by Subtraction, ſecondly in reſpect of the quotient

figures as may be, ſo are proportions to be ſet downe in
ſo ſmall numbers as may be, which is to be done by the
ſelf ſame rule that Fractions are. Againe as you can neither adde
nor Subtract Fractions, hauing diuerſe denominations, before
that you haue brought them to one ſelfe denomination: So can
you neither adde nor ſubtract proportions hauing diuerſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,
vntill you haue brought them to one ſelfe conſequent by

the ſame rule that Fractions are reduced to one ſelfe denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And looke what order is to be obſerued in adding, ſubtracting,
multiplying and diuiding of Fractions, the ſame is to be kept in
adding, ſubtracting, multiplying and diuiding of proportions.

his fellow, but alſo ſet downe the ſame right vnder the next pricke
on the right hand, and then multiply that Digit together with the
double whereto it is ioyned, by the ſaid laſt found Digit ſet downe
in the quotient, the product whereof you muſt ſubtract out of the

in ſuch order as is before taught, and then ſéeke out ſome one of
the 9. Digits, which being multiplyed in it ſelfe, may take away
the firſt 4. on the left hand, or as much thereof as may be, which you
ſhall finde to be 2. which 2. being ſet in the quotient, multiply the
ſame in it ſelfe, in ſaying 2. times 2. maketh 4. which 4. doth

how many times 4. is comprehended in 6. you ſhall finde to
be but one, which you muſt not onely put in the quotient, but alſo
ſet it downe vnder the firſt pricke on the right hand thus.</p>
                  <p>So as you ſhall make the lower Somme to be 41.

which is to be multiplyed by the laſt found quotient
which is 1. wherefore you muſt ſay that 1. times 41.
is 41 which being taken out of 64. there remaineth 23. ſo as the

                  <p>And to know whether you haue done well or not,
multiply the quotient in it ſelfe, and if there be any
remainder left, adde that vnto the product of the
multiplyed quotient, and if you finde the ſumme thereof to be like
to the firſt, then you haue done well, if it be not like, then you haue
erred, the product of this quotient being multiplyed in it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth
vnto 441. whereto by adding the remainder which is
23. you ſhall finde the ſumme to be like vnto the firſt number that
is 464. whereof you ſought the ſquare roote. But if ſuch number
do conſiſt of many figures, then in working you muſt double the
quotient once, twice or thrice, according as the number doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
as you ſhall more plainely perceiue by this example follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
as let 50/467. be the number whereof you would know the

in it ſelfe together with the double quotient, may take away all
that which ſtandeth ouer the ſecond pricke towards the left hand,
or as much thereof as may be, which Digit by aſking how many
times 4. is comprehended in 10. you ſhall finde to be 2. then ſet
downe the ſaide 2. not onely in the quotient, but alſo vnder the

41063625. and looke howe
<pb facs="tcp:2698:36"/>
many prickes there be, ſo many figures ſhall you haue in the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient:
That done, you haue to finde out thrée ſeuerall numbers,
firſt ſuch a Cubique number as will cleane take away the number
which ſtandeth right ouer the head of the laſt pricke on the left
hand, or ſo much thereof as may be, which you may eaſily finde in
the foreſaid table: The roote of which Cubique number, you muſt
ſet downe in the quotient, the ſecond number which you haue to
find is a number called the Triple, which is eaſily had by tripling
the quotient, and the third number is called the Diuiſor which you
ſhall moſt readily finde by multiplying the quotient into the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
both which numbers are to be placed in ſuch order as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Firſt then hauing found the Cubique number as is before
ſaid, and taken the ſame out of the number ſtanding ouer the laſt
pricke on the left hand, write the remainder (if there be any) ouer
his head, cancelling that which is vnder it, and then place the
roote of the ſaid Cubique number in the quotient: that done, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the roote ſet downe in the quotient, and that ſhall be the Triple
which you muſt place in the ſecond voide ſpace on the left ſide of
the next pricke which is on your right hand, then multiply that
Triple by the quotient, and the product thereof ſhall be the Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
which muſt be placed right vnder the Triple one figure ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
towards the left hand: that done, drawe a line as you ſée in the
example hereafter following and worke thus: Firſt aſke how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times the firſt figure of the ſaid Diuiſor is contained in the
number ſtanding right ouer his head: and hauing found an apt
Digit for the purpoſe, put that Digit in the quotient to his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that done, multiply the ſaid Digit into the Diuiſor and ſet the
product thereof right vnder the Diuiſor: Secondly multiply the
ſaid Digit in him ſelfe, and againe the product thereof into the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
&amp; ſet the ſomme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> comes therof right vnder the triple: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
multiply the ſaid Digit in it ſelfe cubically, and ſet the product
thereof loweſt of all, right vnder the next pricke on the right hand:
that done, drawe a line, and by Addition bring all the foreſaid thrée
products into one ſomme placing euery figure ſo as you may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take the ſaid ſomme out of the vpper number, whereof you ſéeke
the Cubique roote, and write the remainder (if there be any) ouer
the head, and if ſuch ſomme will not be ſubtracted out of the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2698:36"/>
the former triple and Diuiſor, and if there bee more pricks in the
number then two, then you muſt for euery pricke finde out a new
Triple, and a new Diuiſor by tripling the whole quotient, and by
working continually in like order as the rule before teacheth,
which rule you ſhall more plainely perceiue by example thus. Firſt
then hauing to finde out the Cubique roote of the number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, which is 4 1 0 6 3 6 2 5 marked with prickes as before
is taught: reſorte to the Table wherein you ſhall finde ſuch a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique
number as will take away as much of the 41. as may bée,
which is 27. the roote whereof is 3. for al the other Cubique num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in the table are either too ſmall or too great, and therefore you
muſt alwaies haue due conſideration therof. Then take 27. which
is the Cubique number, out of 41. and there remaineth 14. which
remainder you muſt ſet ouer the laſt pricke on your left hand can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
the 41. as in this example.</p>

                  </gap>
                  <p>Then triple the quotient which maketh 9.
which you muſt ſet downe vnder the figure
6. next vnto the ſecond pricke which is on your
right hand: Then to find out the Diuiſor mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
the Triple 9. by 3. which is the quotient, and the product
therof ſhal be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Diuiſor: which diuiſor you muſt place right vnder

the whole number at the firſt, but rather leaue ſo much as the ſaide
quotient hauing afterward to be multiplyed diuerſe waies as ſhal
be ſaid hereafter, may take away the reſt or as much therof as may
be, as in this example following, you ſhall finde the apteſt Digit
for this purpoſe to be 4. which you muſt put in the quotient, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the quotient ſhall be now 34. that done, you muſt firſt multiply
this laſt quotient which is 4. into the Diuiſor 27. the product
whereof is 108. which you muſt ſet downe right vnder the Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
beneath the line already drawne, as you ſée in this example.</p>
                  <p>

                        <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                     </gap>Secondly you muſt multiply the
ſaid 4. in it ſelf quadratly which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
16. then multiply that 16. by
the triple 9. the product whereof is
144. which is to be ſet right vnder

                  </gap>
                  <p>Thirdly you muſt multiply the
ſaid 4. in it ſelfe cubically, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
64. which is to be ſet right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the next pricke on the right hand
beneath the former ſummes as you ſée

                  </gap>
                  <p>So as euery one of the foreſaide
thrée products doe extend one further
then another by one figure towardes
the right hand, as you ſée in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former
example: Now theſe products being
thus placed, drawe another line and
bring all the thrée ſeuerall products
contained betwixt the 2. lines, into
one ſumme by Addition, and you ſhal
finde the totall ſumme to be 12304.
which being ſubtracted out of the
number ſtanding right ouer it which
is 14063. there will remaine 1759.
which you muſt ſet downe aboue as
you ſée in this example.</p>
                  <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <p>Now to procéede with the next,
you muſt finde out a new Triple and
a new Diuiſor.</p>
                  <p>How is that done?</p>
                  <p>Thus, multiply the whole quotient which is 34. by 3. the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
whereof is 102. and that is the Triple which is to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the next voide ſpace hard by the next pricke that is on your
right hand: Then multiply the whole quotient into the laſt found
Triple 102. and the product thereof which is 3468. ſhall bee
your Diuiſor, which is to be placed vnder the Triple one figure
ſhorter towards the left hand as you ſée in the example following:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2698:37"/>
which two numbers being thus found and rightly placed, draw a
line, then aſke how many times the firſt figure of your Diuiſor
which is 3. is contained in the number right ouer his head which
is 17. and you ſhall finde it to bee 5. times contained therein,
wherefore ſet downe 5. in the quotient, that doone, multiply
the 5. into the Diuiſor, and place the product thereof which is
17/340. right vnder the Diuiſor beneath the line, as you ſée in
this example.</p>

                  </gap>
                  <p>Secondly ſquare the ſame 5 that is
to ſay, multiply it in it ſelfe, and that
maketh 25. which 25. you muſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
againe into the Triple 102. the
product whereof is 2550. which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you muſt ſet right vnder the ſaide

the ſaid 5. in it ſelfe cubically
which maketh 125. and place that right vnder the firſt pricke on
the right hande, and drawe a line, that done, adde all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde
3. products together, and you ſhall finde the totall
ſumme thereof to bée 1759625. which being ſubtracted out
of the vpper number, there remaineth nothing, as this example

                  </gap>
                  <p>Whereby you may conclude that
the foreſaid nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber whereof you ſought
the roote, is a perfect Cubique num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
for if you multiply the whole quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

the ſelfe ſame number whereof you
ſought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roote. But note that if in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the firſt Subtractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the firſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſor
is not to be found in the vpper
number, then you muſt ſet a Cypher
in the quotient, that done, triple the whole quotient, and place the
ſaide triple vnder the figure which is next to the next pricke on the
right hand, working in ſuch order as before, and to avoide confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
hauing to deale with a multitud of nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers it ſhal not be amiſſe

in ſeueral places by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; to worke then in the ſelf ſame order
<pb facs="tcp:2698:38"/>
that is before taught, alſo note that if you haue to deale with a
fewe numbers, and that the Diuiſor cannot bee ſubtracted out of
the number ſtanding right ouer his head, then you muſt ſet a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
in the quotient and ſo you haue done, as for example, hauing
to take the cubicall roote of 8597. here I find 2. to be the quotient,
which being cubically multiplyed, doth cleane take away the 8.
and now according to my former rule 12. muſt be my Diuiſor,
which becauſe I cannot take it out of 5. I ſet downe therefore a
Cypher in the quotient, ſo as the quotient is now 20. which is the
cubicall roote of the foreſaide
number, for if you multiply
20. cubically and adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
5 6 7. which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,
the ſumme thereof
will be like vnto the firſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

Integrums of two ſundrie denominations are propounded in the
queſtion, it may be very well doubted with what denomination the
product of ſuch multiplycation is to be named, as in this example
hauing multiplyed time by motion, a man may aſke whether the
product ſhall be named daies or degrées, the reſoluing of which
doubt dependeth vpon the nature of the queſtion propounded, for
in the foreſaid example, becauſe time or daies do comprehend any
certaine appointed motion, therefore the product of the Multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is to be referred to the degrées of motion which are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
vnder time, and not to time which comprehendeth motion,
wherfore this product of Integrums <hi>videliz.</hi> 389. ſignifieth here
degrées and not daies, ſo likewiſe when degrées and minutes are
multiplyed by myles and minutes, the product of ſuch Multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
taketh his name fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> myles &amp; not from degrées, because de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées
do comprehend myles, for we ſay in matters of Geography
that euery degrée of the great circle comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth 60 myles, thus

the remainders by 60. thinking this ſufficient to ſhew you in
what order you haue to worke, to diuide your diuidend by a ſimple
Diuiſor, into as many ſmall parts as you will: but if your Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
be compound, then the Diuiſion is to be done either by reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into the ſmalleſt Fractions, or without reductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which last way
<pb facs="tcp:2698:43"/>
is very hard and tedious, and therefore I will onely ſhew you how
to make your diuiſion whereof the Diuiſor is compound by reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that by this one example here following. Suppoſe then
that the Moone according to her owne courſe which is from Weſt
to Eaſt, is diſtant from ſome fixed Starre 36. degrées. 30′· 24″·
50‴· and 15<g ref="char:qprime">''''</g>· and that you would know in what time ſhe will runne
that diſtaunce, according to her daily moouing which as hath béene
ſaid before is 13. degrées, 10′· 35″· 1‴· and 15<g ref="char:qprime">''''</g>· here to make this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
by reduction, you muſt doe thus. Firſt reduce all the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of your diuidend into the ſmalleſt Fractions thereof by the
Sexagenarie Multiplycation and Addition of the next Fraction
vnto the product of that Multiplycation: that done, reduce all the
numbers of your Diuiſor by like Multiplycation and Addition,
into the ſmalleſt Fractions, ſo as the diuidend &amp; the Diuiſor may
be both of one ſelfe denomination, and diuide the one by the other,
euen as they were Integrums, as in this example you muſt firſt
multiply 36. degrées, by 60. and it will make 2160′· whereto by
adding 30′· you make the whole ſumme of minutes to be 2190′·
which being multiplyed againe by 60. doe make 131400″· whereto
if you adde the 24″· the ſumme of ſecondes will bee 131424″· and ſo
procéeding ſtill with the Sexagenarie Multiplycation and Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the next Fraction as you did before, you ſhall find the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend
to be 473129415<g ref="char:qprime">''''</g>· Then in like order reduce your Diuiſor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſmalleſt Fraction, and you ſhall find the totall ſumme ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to be 170766075<g ref="char:qprime">''''</g>· this reduction being made, diuide the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend
by the diuiſor, ſo ſhal you find in the quotient 2. Integrums,
that is to ſay 2. daies, and the remainder to be 132597365<g ref="char:qprime">''''</g>· which
remainder if you multiply by 60. and diuide the product by the
ſelf ſame Diuiſor, you ſhal haue in the quotient minutes, then mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
againe that remainder by 60. and diuide the product thereof
by the ſame Diuiſor, and you ſhall haue in the quotient ſeconds,
and ſo by obſeruing ſtill that order you ſhall bring it into as ſmal

to her daily motion, will runne the foreſaide ſpace of diſtance
that was betwixt her and the fixed Starre in 2. daies, 46′· and 14″·</p>

yet I minde once againe, to ſet downe a generall

often in vſe in hauing to deale with Aſtronomicall
tables, and to giue you example thereof: Firſt then hauing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
any number, whoſe Diuiſor is greater then the diuidend,
doe thus; multiply the greateſt denomination of the diuidend by
60. and if there be any Fractions annexed thereunto which are of
the next inferiour kinde, as minutes are to degrées, or to howers,
and ſeconds to minutes, and thirds to ſeconds &amp;c. Then adde them
to the former product, but if ſuch Fractions be not of the next infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
kind, then let them ſtand as they are vntill you come to deale
with them, and hauing diuided according to the common rule of
Diuiſion the firſt ſumme of the diuidend by the Diuiſor, multiply
the quotient into the whole Diuiſor, and ſubtract that product out
of the vpper number if it may bee, if not, then make the quotient
leſſer and leſſer, vntill you can finde ſuch a number as will be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of the ſaid vpper number, and if there be any remainder
left, then multiply that remainder by 60. not leauing to follow the
former order of working, vntill you haue found the neareſt exact
quotient that may be. And you haue to note that the denomination
of the firſt quotient muſt be of the next inferior kind, to that denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
which the Diuiſor hath, and to make this rule the plainer, I
will ſet downe and example vſed by <hi>Standius</hi> ut the 115 page of his

Diuiſor becauſe it is greater then the diuidend, you muſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the rule before giuen, worke thus: Firſt multiply the
greateſt denomination of the diuidend which is 8. degrées by 60′·
the product whereof will be 480′· whereunto by adding the Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
annexed <hi>videliz.</hi> 46′· it maketh in all 526′· which is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
by 13. degrées, 48′· here in diuiding the laſt product firſt by
13. degrées, I finde in the quotient 39. which is one too many, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that I muſt take out of the foreſaid diuidend 48′· as often
as I did take out thereof 13. degrées, wherefore I ſet downe but
38. in the quotient, and then the remainder will be 96. which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I may eaſily diuide by the common Diuiſor 13. degrées,
and 48′· I diuide therefore that 96. firſt by 13. whereof the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
is 7. and the remainder is 5. which I reduce into ſeconds by
multiplying that 5. by 60. the product whereof is 300″· that done,
I multiply 48′· by 7. the product whereof is 336. which though
it bee ſomewhat too great a number to be taken out of 300. yet I
let it ſtand becauſe it approcheth to a very nigh exactneſſe, and by
this meanes I finde the whole quotient to bee 38′· and 7″· and you
haue to note that if after the firſt quotient be ſet downe, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

name to the roote, for if the queſtion bee of thirds, you muſt firſt
reduce them to fourths before you can take the roote, and you muſt
doe the like with any other Fraction, whoſe denomination is od
and not euen. As for example, if you would take the roote of 43‴·
here by multiplying theſe 43‴· by 60. you ſhall reduce them into
1580<g ref="char:qprime">''''</g>· the roote whereof is 50″· Moreouer the Fractions where.
with you haue to deale, are either ſimple or compound, if they bée
ſimple and leſſe then minutes, and therewith haue euen denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and not odde, then you néede to make no further reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but to worke as if you had to deale with whole numbers. As
in ſeeking the ſquare roote of 1600″· you find it to be iuſt 40′· but if
the number be compound, that is to ſay, conſiſting ot Integrums
and Fractions, or of many Fractions hauing diuers denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
then you muſt firſt reduce them all to the ſmalleſt Fraction
that hath an euen denomination before that you can take the roote:
As for example, you would know the roote of 4. degrées, 25′· here
you muſt by the Sexagenarie Multiplycation and Addition of
the next Fraction, reduce the degrées to minutes, and the minutes
to ſeconds, as you were taught before in Diuiſion, and then to
worke as you were wont to doe in taking the ſquare roote of whole
numbers, and in ſo doing, you ſhall finde the ſumme of ſeconds to
be 15900″· the ſquare roote whereof is 126′· which if you diuide by
60. it will make 2. degrées, 6′· Another example, as to take the
roote of 13. degrées, 42′· and 45″· here by reduction as before, you
ſhall bring the degrées and minutes to 49365″·. the ſquare roote
whereof is 222′· which being diuided by 60. maketh 3. degrées,
42′· And thus I end with the Aſtronomicall Fractions, which
kinde of Fractions, though they be very learnedly and orderly

which being added together according to the rule before ſet
<pb facs="tcp:2698:46"/>
downe in the Chapter of Multiplycation of Aſtronomicall
Fractions doe make 7. then ſay one times 7. is 7. which you

and thus you haue the firſt product: then procéede with the
next number of the multiplyer towards your left hand which is 35.
and is to be multiplyed into 30. which to doe readily, you muſt
enter the table with theſe two numbers, and ſéeking in the firſt
Collum of the <hi>Trapezium</hi> on the left hand, for 35. in the foote of

the 15. vnder the fourth denomination, and kéeping the one in
mind, multiply 10. into 50. and you ſhall find the product thereof
in the <hi>Trapezium</hi> to be 8. and 20. whereunto if you adde the 1.
in mind, it will make 8. and 21. whereof you muſt ſet the 21. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the third denomination, and kéeping 8. in mind, multiply 10.

it, and right againſt that in the outermoſt collum on the left hand
you ſhall find the quotient to be 27. by which if you ſhould multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the whole Diuiſor, the whole product thereof would be 5. 56
21. 24. 1. 47. 6. which is more then the diuidend, and therefore
you muſt make your quotient one leſſe, ſetting downe no more but
26. in the quotient line, by which if you multiply the Diuiſor, the
product will be 5. 26. 41. 22. 25. 14. 8. which being ſubtracted
out of the fourth diuidend, the remainder will bee 28. 7. 18. 17.

I thinke that thirds be ſmall inough. And as often as the
product of any particular quotient ſhall bee greater then the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend,
remember to take a leſſe quotient euen as you doe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Diuiſion. But now you haue to note that though this whole
quotient here ſignifieth time, for the firſt quotient ſignifieth daies,
the ſecond quotient minutes of daies, the third quotient ſeconds,
and the fourth quotient thirds, yet for ſo much as the day is to be
counted by 24. howers and not by mynutes, you muſt therefore
reduce all the particular quotients ſauing the firſt, into howers
and parts of howers, euen to ſo ſmall denominations as you ſhall
thinke good your ſelfe, by helpe of this rule which in diuiſion of
Aſtronomicall Fractions biddeth to multiply the quotient by 2.
and to diuide the product thereof by 5. as here if you multiply the
33. which is the ſecond quotient by 2. the product will bee 66.
which being diuided by 5. the quotient will be 13. howers and one
ſixtie remaining to be kept in minde, wherefore ſet downe in the
place of 33′· 13. howers, then multiply the third quotient which
is 16. by 2. and that will make 32. whereunto if you adde the one
60. in mind it will make in all 92. which being diuided by 5. the
quotient will be 18. and two ſixties, which is 120. remaining to
be kept in minde, wherefore in ſtéede of 16″· which was the third
quotient, ſet 18′ of an hower, and then procéede to the fourth quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
which is 26‴· which being multiplyed by 2. maketh 52. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
if you adde, 120. it will make 172. which if you diuide by

or likenes betwixt a right line and a

<hi>Ptolomey</hi> and diuers other, were much
troubled in ſéeking to know the meaſures
of a Circle or of any portion thereof by his
Diameter, and by knowing the Diameter
to find out the length of any chorde in a
circle, which is alwaies leſſer then the Diameter it ſelfe, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that the more parts whereinto the Diameter was diuided,
the nearer they approched to the truth: Some of them therefore,
as <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> diuided the Diameter of a circle into 120. parts,
and the Semidiameter into 60. parts, and euery ſuch part into
60′· and euery minute into 60. ſeconds &amp;c. And in like manner did
<hi>Arzahel,</hi> an auntient Arabian, who diuided the Diameter into
300. parts and the Semidiameter into 150. and euery of thoſe
parts into 60′· and ſo forth as before, according to which compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
they made their tables: but becauſe the working by thoſe
tables was very tedious and troubleſome, by reaſon that it was
néedfull continually to vſe the art of numbring by Aſtronomicall
Fractions: therefore <hi>Georgius Purbachius,</hi> and <hi>Regio monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
his Scholer to auoide that trouble of calculating by Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall
Fractions, diuided the Diameter of a Circle into a farre
greater number of parts, and made ſuch tables as are vſed at this
preſent, the deſcription and vſe whereof doth hereafter follow,
firſt of thoſe that are ſet downe by <hi>Monte Regio</hi> in Folio, and
then of thoſe that were lately Corrected and made perfect by <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius</hi>

                     <pb facs="tcp:2698:56"/>
And becauſe that the way to find out the proportion which any
chord hath to the whole Diameter, was very hard, therefore the
ſaid <hi>Purbachius</hi> and <hi>Monte Regio</hi> hauing direction from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
propoſitions of <hi>Euclyd,</hi> as from the 47. propoſition of his
firſt booke, and from the third propoſition of his third booke, and
alſo from the 15. propoſition of his fift booke, they made choiſe of
the halfe chord and Semidiameter of the Circle, calling the halfe
chord, <hi>Sinum rectum,</hi> and the Semidiameter <hi>Sinum totum.</hi> And
becauſe that the proportion of any circumference to his Diameter
neuer changeth, how great or how little ſo euer the Circle be: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that they had calculated for one Circle, they made ſuch tables
as might ſerue for all Circles, and though theſe tables of ſines
doe ſuffice to worke thereby all manner of concluſions, as well of
Aſtronomie, as of Geometrie, yet for more eaſe, our moderne
Geometricians haue of late inuented two other right lines belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to a Circle called lines Tangent, and lines Secant, and
haue made like tables for them that were made for ſines, and both
tables, that is to ſay as well of the ſines, as of the lines Tangent
and Secant, haue one ſelfe manner of working thereby, as ſhall

to vſe the foreſaid tables when néede is, vnleſſe you know
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2698:57"/>
alſo how to find out thoſe things in the ſaid tables, I thinke it good
therefore to ſhew you the order of the ſaid tables by deſcribing the
ſame as followeth.</p>
                     <p>You haue then to vnderſtand that the tables of <hi>Monte Regio</hi>
printed in Folio, are contained in 18. Pages, and euery Page
containeth eleauen partitions, called collums, whereof the firſt on
the left hand containeth 60. minutes, which are to be counted from
head to foote, as they ſtand in order one right vnder another in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
places, procéeding from 1. to 60. The ſecond collum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
Sines. The third containeth onely a portion or part of
one ſecond, and from thence forth procéeding towards the right
hand all the other collums doe containe in like manner Sines and
the portion of one ſecond. And right ouer the head of euery Sine
(the firſt collum of Sines onely excepted, hauing nothing but a
Cypher ouer his head) are ſet downe the degrées of the whole
Quadrant called arches, in ſuch order as from the firſt Page to
the laſt, there are in all 89. degrées, or arches, as by peruſing the
ſaid tables you may plainely ſée. Now to find out in theſe tables
the things aboue mentioned, you muſt doe as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Firſt to find out the right Sine of any giuen Arke, you muſt
ſéeke out the number of the ſaid Arke in the front of the tables, and
if the giuen Arke hath no minutes ioyned thereunto, then the firſt
number of Sines right vnder the ſaid Arke, is the right Sine
thereof. But if it hath any minutes ioyned thereunto, then you
muſt ſéeke out in that Page, where you found the giuen Arke, the
number of the minutes in the firſt collum of the ſaid Page, on the
left hand, and right againſt thoſe minutes on the right hand, in
the ſquare Angle right vnder the ſaid arch, you ſhall find the right
Sine. As for example, you would find out the right Sine of a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
Arke containing 8. degrées, and 20′· here hauing found out
in the front of the ſecond Page the figure of 8. ſtanding right ouer
the eight collum, ſéeke in the firſt collum on the left hand of the ſaid
Page, for 20. minutes, and right againſt the 20. minutes you
ſhall find on the right hand in the common Angle or ſquare 8695
93. which is the right Sine of the foreſaid giuen Arke, ſo as you
make 6/000/000. to be the totall Sine: but if you make 60/000.
the totall Sine, then you muſt alwaies reiect the two laſt figures
ſtanding on the right hand of the ſaid right Sine, and the reſt of
the figures ſhall be the right Sine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:2698:58"/>
Now to find out the complement, there is nothing to be done,
but onely to ſubtract the giuen Arke out of the whole Quadrant
which is 90. degrées, and the remainder ſhall be the complement:
as in the former example by ſubtracting 8. degrées, 20′· out of 90
degrées, you find that there remaineth 81. degrées, 40′· which is
the complement of that arch. Againe to find out the Sine of the
complement you muſt doe thus, ſéeke the complement in the front
of the tables of Sines, euen as you doe to find out any giuen arke:
as in the former example, the complement being 81. degrées 40′·
you muſt ſéeke 81. in the front of the 17. Page of the firſt tables,
which being found, ſéeke out alſo the 40′· in the firſt collum of the
ſaid Page on the left hand, and right againſt thoſe 40′· in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Angle right vnder the Arke 81. you ſhall find 5/936/649.
which number is the right Sine of the foreſaid complement, ſo as
you make 6/000/000. to be the totall Sine, for if 60/000. be the
total Sine, then you muſt reiect (as I ſaid before) the two laſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
on the right hand, and the number remaining ſhall be the
right Sine of the foreſaid complement, and therefore in working
by theſe tables, you muſt alwaies remember what number you
make the totall Sine to be.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sinus verſus</hi> commeth ſeldome in vſe, notwithſtanding if you
would know how to find it out, you néede to doe no more but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<hi>Sinum complementi</hi> of the giuen Arke, out of the totall
Sine, and the remainder ſhall be <hi>Sinus verſus,</hi> as in the former
example your <hi>Sinus complementi</hi> was 5/936/649. which being
ſubtracted out of the totall Sine 6/000/000. there remaineth
this 63/351. and that number is <hi>Sinus verſus:</hi> for if you adde this
remainder to the number which you ſubtracted, it will make vp
the totall Sine 6/000/000. But there is one thing more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to be knowen then this, becauſe it commeth oftner in vſe, and
that is vpon ſome diuiſion made how to find out the Arke of any
quotient, which is to be done thus: Enter with the quotient into
the body of the tables, and leaue not ſéeking amongſt the ſquares
of the Sines, vntill you haue found out the iuſt number of the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
(if it be there) if not, you muſt take the number of that Sine
which is in value moſt nigh vnto it, whether it be a little more or
leſſe, it maketh no matter, and hauing found that number, looke in
the front of that collum, and you ſhall find the Arke of your quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2698:58"/>
ſtanding right ouer the head of that collum, and alſo the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
thereof in the firſt collum of the ſaid Page on the left hand.
As for example, hauing diuided one number by another, I find
the quotient to be 469/012. whereof I would know the arch, now
in ſéeking this quotient amongſt the Sines, I can not find that
iuſt number, but I find in the firſt Page, and in the tenth collum
469/015. which is the nigheſt number vnto it that I can ſée. In
the front of which collum I find the Arke to be 4. degrées, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
againſt that Sine on the left hand, I find 29′· belonging to
that arch, whereof that quotient is the <hi>Sinus,</hi> ſo as I gather here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
that the arch of the foreſaid quotient is 4, degrées, 29′· But you
haue to note by the way that the number of your quotient muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be much leſſe then 1745. for otherwiſe it is not to be found in
theſe tables, vnleſſe you make the totall Sine to be but 60/000.
for then by reiecting the laſt two figures on the right hand, as I
haue ſaid before, the firſt right Sine of theſe tables ſhal be no more
but 17. and by that account a very ſmall quotient may be found in
theſe tables. And whatſoeuer hath béene ſaid here touching the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that is to be obſerued in the firſt tables of <hi>Monte Regio,</hi> whoſe
totall Sine is 6/000/000. the like in all points is to be obſerued
in the laſt tables, whoſe totall Sine is 10/000/000. Thus much
touching the order of the foreſaid tables of <hi>Monte Regio</hi> Printed
in Folio: but for ſo much as thoſe tables bee not altogether truely
Printed, and for that they haue béene lately corrected, and made
more perfect by <hi>Clauius,</hi> who doth ſet downe the ſaid tables in
quarto and not in folio, whereby they are the more portable, and
the more commodious, as well for that they are more truely Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as alſo for that the complement of euery Arke is ſet downe in
euery Page at the foote of euery collum, ſo as you néed to ſpend no
time in ſubtracting the Arke from 90. I thinke it good therefore
to make a briefe deſcription of thoſe tables, and the rather for
that I haue requeſted the Printer to print the like here in quarto,
and I doe worke all ſuch concluſions as hereafter follow, by the
ſaid tables, the totall Sine whereof is 10/000/000. according to
the laſt tables of <hi>Monte Regio.</hi> But for ſo much as ſome may
haue already the tables of <hi>Monte Regio</hi> Printed in Folio, not
knowing perhaps the vſe thereof, I will ſet downe two concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to bee wrought by thoſe tables, and all the reſt of the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:2698:59"/>
are to be wrought by thoſe tables which I haue here cauſed to

concluſions next following, which are to ſhew the vſe of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
tables, may be wrought by the tables of Sines in what forme
ſo euer they be truely Printed if Folio, or in quarto, yet becauſe I
had appointed them to bee done by the tables of <hi>Monte Regio,</hi>
Printed in folio before that euer I ſaw <hi>Clauius</hi> his booke, I mind
not now to alter them but to let them ſtand ſtill as they are.</p>

to be the total Sine, and therefore he reiecteth the two laſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures

multiply the right Sine of the leſſer Latitude which is 31/498.
by the totall Sine 60/000. and the product thereof wil be 1/889/

one whole degrée, to make vp the complement. As for example,
ſuppoſe the Arke to be 46. degrées, without any minutes ioyned
thereunto, the complement whereof ſet downe at the foote of the
ſaid arch, is but 43. degrées, wherefore you muſt adde thereunto
60′· which is one degrée, ſo ſhall the complement be 44. degrées,
which is the true complement indéede, but if you ſuppoſe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Arke to haue 13′· ioyned thereunto you ſhall find the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be 43. degrées, 47′· which is anſwerable to the foreſaid
Arke 46. degrées, and 13′· for if you take 46. degrées, 13′· out of
90. degrées, the remainder will be 43. degrées, 47′· which is the
complement, ſo as you néed not to make any Subtraction out of
90. to find the complement of any arch, that hath any minutes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
thereunto: but when ſo euer you haue to find out the right
Sine of any complement in theſe tables, you muſt then make the
complement an arch, ſéeking for the ſame in the front and not at
the foote of the tables, &amp; if the ſaid complement haue any minutes
annexed thereunto, you muſt ſéeke thoſe minutes in the left outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
collum of euery Page, and not in the outermoſt right collum
belonging to complements, for in this caſe the complement is an
arch and not a complement. The order of working by theſe tables
in all other things differeth not one iotte from that which we haue
obſerued in working the two former concluſions by the tables of

cut the ſaid Circle.</p>
                  <p>The line Secant is not by him any

ought to bee plaine and briefe, and not long, intricate or
doubtfull, which will be hardly performed in ſhewing the nature of
theſe two lines by way of definition, and therefore marke well this
figure following.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>In this figure you ſée firſt a
Circle drawne vpon the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
<hi>C.</hi> from which Centre is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to the circumference of
the Circle a right line, called
the Semidiameter, marked
with the letters <hi>A. C.</hi> then
there is another right line
which toucheth the ſaid Circle, and alſo the outermoſt end of the
ſaid Semidiameter making therewith a right Angle in the point
<hi>A.</hi> and is called the line Tangent, then there is a third line which
procéeding from the Centre <hi>C.</hi> doth cut the circumference of the
Circle in the point <hi>B.</hi> and alſo méeteth with the line Tangent in
the point <hi>D.</hi> and therefore is called the line Secant, betwixt which
two lines, I meane the Tangent and Secant, is intercepted

<pb facs="tcp:2698:64"/>
leſſe then a Quadrant marked with the letters <hi>A. B.</hi> of
which Arke the line <hi>A. D.</hi> is the Tangent, and the line <hi>C. D.</hi> is
the Secant thereof, which muſt néeds méete with the Tangent in
the point <hi>D.</hi> becauſe that the two Angles <hi>C. A. D.</hi> and <hi>D. C. A.</hi>
are leſſer then two right Angles, for the one is right, and the other
ſharpe, by reaſon that the Arke is leſſe then a Quadrant. And
ſome doe call the line Tangent the line <hi>Aſcript,</hi> becauſe it is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
to the Circle, and they call the line Secant the <hi>Hipothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſe,</hi>
becauſe it ſubte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the right Angle <hi>A.</hi> &amp; they cal the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter

which is called a rectangle Triangle becauſe it containeth one

manner of Angle is propounded by thrée letters, that the middle
letter doth alwaies ſignifie the Angle propounded, be it right,

two lines were inuented, &amp; wherto they ſerue, you haue to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that they chiefly ſerue in calculating the quantitie of Angles
and their ſides, as well in right lined Triangles, as in ſphericall
Triangles, for the ſides of Triangles are either right or crooked,
and if they haue right ſides, ſuch Triangles are either right ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Triangles, or oblique angled Triangles, and you haue to
note that the quantity of euery Angle is to be meaſured by the arch
of a Circle ſubtending that Angle, for the point of euery Angle is
imagined to be the Centre of a whole Circle, which you may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to be ſo great or little as you will, for euery Circle (be it great
or little) is diuided into 360. degrées, and looke how many degrées
and minutes the arch ſubtending that Angle containeth, ſo much
is the quantitie of that Angle, the practiſe whereof is very well

                     <p>IN ſéeking out the Tangent or Secant of any Arke giuen, or of
the complement of any Arke by either of theſe tables, you haue to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2698:64"/>
obſerue the ſelfe ſame order which you did before in finding out the
right Sine of any Arke giuen, or of the complement of any Arke,
<hi>Per tabulas ſinuum.</hi> As for example, if you would find out the
Tangent of an Arke containing 50. degrées, 24′· then reſorte to
the table of Tangents in the front, whereof looke firſt for the Arke
50. degrées, and then in the firſt collum on the left hand of the ſaid
table, for 24′· right againſt which on the right hand vnder the Arke
50. you ſhall find in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Angle the Tangent to be 12/087/
923. the totall Sine whereof is 10/000/000. but if you would
find out the Secant of the foreſaid Arke 50. and 24′· then you muſt
reſort to the table of Secants, and hauing found out the Arke 50.
in the front of the ſaid tables, and the 24′· on the left hand as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
you ſhall find in the common Angle the Secant to be 15688144.
And if you would haue the Tangent of the complement of the
ſaid Arke which is 39. degrées, and 36′· you ſhall find the 39. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées
of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plement in the foote of the table of Tangents right
vnder the Arke 50. &amp; the 36′·. in the outermoſt collum on the right
hand of the ſaid table, with which complement you muſt enter the
table of Tangents, ſéeking for 39. degrées in the front of the table,
and 36′· in the firſt collum on the left hand of the ſaid table, right
againſt which in the common Angle you ſhall find 8272720. to be
the Tangent of 39. degrées, 36′· which is the complement of 50
degrées, 24′·</p>
                     <p>And you muſt work in like manner with the table of Secants:
As for example, if you would find the Secant of 72. degrées, 36′·
firſt then enter the table of Secants, looking for 72. degrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
in the front of the table, and 36′· in the firſt collum on the left
hand of the ſaid table, and in the common Angle you ſhall find 33/
440/240. which is the Secant of 72. degrees, 36′· But if you
would haue the Secant of the complement of the ſaid arch 72. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,

degrees, you ſhall find 17. degrees, and in the outermoſt collum
on the right hand, iuſt againſt 36′· you ſhall find 24′· ſo as you ſee
that 17. degrees 24′· is the complement of 72. degrees, 36′· with
which complement you muſt enter the table of Secants, looking
for 17. degrees, aboue in the front of the table, and for 24′· in the

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Inding to treate of the principles of
Coſmographie, and eſpecially of the
Sphere, I thinke it good firſt to expound
vnto you certaine termes of Geometry,
without the which the vnlearned ſhall
hardly vnderſtand the Contents of this
Treatiſe, which tearmes are certaine
principles of Geometrie, called defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
For there are but thrée kinds of
principles, whereon the demonſtration of all Geometricall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
dependeth: that is, definitions, petitions, and maxims,
but I mind here to deale onely with certaine definitions, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I will ſet downe as many as I thinke néedful for this purpoſe,
in ſuch order as followeth.</p>
                  <p>1 A point called in Latine <hi>punctus,</hi> is
a thing ſuppoſed to be indiuiſible, hauing
neither length, breadth, nor deapth, as the
point or pricke a.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>2 A line called in Lataine linea, is a
ſuppoſed length, hauing neither breadth nor
thickneſſe, as the line a. b.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>3. The ends or bounds of a line, are
two points, and of lines ſome be right, and
ſome be crooked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2698:137"/>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>4 A right line is that which goeth right
from one point to another, and not bowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as doth the line <hi>c. d.</hi> but ſo ſtraight as is
poſſible, as the line <hi>a. b.</hi> Againe the crooked
line is either a whole Circle, or portion of a
Circle, or elſe goeth winding in and out, as
a ſerpent called in Latine <hi>Linea tortuoſa,</hi>
or elſe winding about like the ſhell of a
Snaile, called of the Latines, <hi>linea Spira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
as theſe figures here doe ſhew.</p>
                  <figure>

                     <p>Linea ſpiralis.</p>
                  </figure>
                  <p>5 Superficies or vpperface, is that
which onely hath length and breadth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deapth, which is twofould, that is to
ſay, plaine and crooked.</p>
                  <p>6 The bounds of ſuperficies are lines.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>7 A plaine ſuperficies is that which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſtraight betwixt his lines, as the figure
a. &amp; a crooked ſuperficies is that which goeth
bowing and lyeth not ſtraight betwixt his
lines as the figure <hi>b.</hi> Againe ſuperficies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conſidered in an hollow body, as a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
tunne, or vault, may be deuided into
two other kinds, that is Conuexe, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caue,
for the vpper part of ſuch vault is ſaid
to be conuex, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inward part cancaue as
the figure <hi>b.</hi> ſheweth.</p>
                  <figure>
                     <p>Conuex. Concaue.</p>
                  </figure>
                  <p>8 A plaine Angle is when two lines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drawne vpon a plaine ſuperficies not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
one againſt another, but ſo as by mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or touching one an other in one ſelfe
point, they may make a plaine Angle, as the
Angle <hi>a.</hi> 
                     <figure/>For if two lines be drawne directly
one againſt another, though they méete in
one point, yet they make no Angle, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one ſelfe line as the two lines <hi>a. b.</hi> mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the point <hi>c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <figure>
                     <p>Right. Crooked. Mixt.</p>
                  </figure>
                  <p>9 Of plaine Angles, ſome are called
right line angles, becauſe that both the lines
whereof it conſiſteth are right, and ſome are
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2698:137"/>
called crooked line angles, becauſe that both
lines are crooked, &amp; ſome are ſaid to be mixt,
becauſe the one line is crooked and the other
right, as you may perceiue by the thrée ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
ſhapes thereof made in the Margent.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>10 If one right line ſtanding vpon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
right line do make two equall angles,
that is to ſay, of ech ſide one, then eyther of
thoſe Angles is a right Angle, and the line
ſo ſtanding vpon his fellow, is called the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
or plumbe line, as the line <hi>a. b.</hi>
ſtanding vpon the line <hi>c. d.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>11 A blunt Angle, is that which is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then a right Angle, as the Angle <hi>e.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12 A ſharpe Angle, is that which is leſſer
then a right Angle, as f. ſo as there be in all
thrée Angles, that is right, blunt, and ſharpe,
in Latine <hi>rectus, obtuſus, &amp; acutus:</hi> And
beſides theſe Angles, there be alſo certaine
Sphericall, that is to ſay, round Angles,
which conſiſt of two circular lines, drawne
vppon a Sphericall ſuperficies, which doe
croſſe one another in ſome point, eyther
rightly, or obliquely: if rightly, then they
make right Angles, on ech ſide of the point
where they croſſe, as the figure <hi>E.</hi> ſheweth,
if obliquely then they make ſharpe Angles of
the inſide, and blunt Angles on the out ſide
of the point, where they croſſe as the figure
<hi>F.</hi> doth partly ſhew, for ſuch Angles cannot
be ſo well deſcribed in <hi>Plano,</hi> as vpon the
ſuperficies of ſome Sphericall body.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>13 A terme called in Latine <hi>terminus,</hi> is
the bound or linute of any thing, as points
are the bounds of lines, &amp; lines the bounds
of ſuperficieſes, and ſuperficieſes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bounds of
a body, which is that which hath imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely,
but not materially, both le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, bredth,
and depth, and if ſuch body haue many faces
<pb facs="tcp:2698:138"/>
or ſides, then it is bounded with many ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficieſes,
as the figure <hi>g.</hi> made like a ſixe
ſquare dye. But if ſuch body be round as a
bowle, Sphere, or Globe, then it is bounded
or couered with one ſuperficies onely, as the
figure <hi>H.</hi> doth ſhewe.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>14 A figure is that which is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
within one bound, or many bounds.</p>
                  <figure>
                     <p>Circumference.</p>
                  </figure>
                  <p>15 A Circle is a plaine figure bounded
with one circular line, which is called the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
vnto the which as many right
lines as are drawne from the point ſtanding
in the midſt, are all equall one to the other,
that is to ſay, one is as long as another, as
the figure <hi>I.</hi> here doth ſhew.</p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>16 And the middle point of a Circle is
called the Center, as the point <hi>A.</hi> in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
<hi>I.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17 The Diameter of a Circle, is a
right line paſſing through the Center, from
one ſide of the Circumference to the other,
which deuideth the Circle into two equall
parts, as the line <hi>B. C.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>18 A Semicircle is a figure, contayned
within the Diameter and halfe the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of a Circle as the figure <hi>D. C. E.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>19 The portion of a Circle, is a part of
a Circle, greater or leſſer than the Semicir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
as the figures <hi>F.</hi> and <hi>G.</hi> doe ſhewe, the
right line in eyther of which figures is called
in Latine <hi>chorda,</hi> in Engliſh the ſtring, and
the Circular line in Latine is called <hi>arcus</hi>
in Engliſh the bowe, but the Diameter is
alwayes the greateſt cord in any Circle.</p>
                  <figure>
                     <p>The cord.</p>
                  </figure>
                  <p>20 Right line figures, are thoſe which

                     <p>Some ſay that <hi>Atlas</hi> was the firſt inuentor, whom the Poets
ſaine to beare vp the heauens with his ſhoulders, hauing his head
placed in the North Pole, and his féete in the South Pole, and
his right hand bearing the Eaſt part, and his left hande the Weſt
part of the world. Albeit that ſome apply this fiction of the Poets
to an high mountaine in <hi>Affrica</hi> called <hi>Atlas,</hi> which for his great
height ſurmounting the cloudes, is ſayde to beare vp the ſkyes.
But ſome ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> our firſt Parent, was the firſt inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
thereof: And ſome others affirme that <hi>Abraham</hi> was the firſt
inuentor thereof. But whoſoeuer was the firſt inuentor, it well
appeareth by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> his booke, called <hi>Almageſti,</hi> that he hath

it hath with the chiefe Idea or ſhape of Gods minde, which hath
neither beginning nor ending, and therefore is compared to a
Circle. Secondly by aptneſſe aſwell of mouing as of containing,
for if it were not round of ſhape, it ſhould not be ſo apt to turne
about as it continually doth, nor to containe ſo much as it doth,
for the round figure is of greateſt capacitie and containeth moſt.
Thirdly, neceſſitie prooueth it to be round, for if it were with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles

turning about, it ſhould leaue voide and emptie places, which
nature abhorreth, for no place by nature can be without a bodie,

the latter obſeruers haue found them when they be in their ſwift

Which call you greater and which leſſer?</p>
                     <p>Thoſe are called the greater Circles, which paſſing through
the Centre or midſt of the firmament, do deuide the whole circuit
thereof into two equall parts, and of ſuch Circles there be ſixe,
that is to ſay, the Equinoctiall, the Zodiaque, the Colure of the

The leſſer Circles are the foure laſt mentioned, that is
the two Tropiques, and the two polar Circles, which are called
leſſer, becauſe they do not deuide the world into two equall parts,
but into vnequall portions.</p>
                     <p>What other diuiſions doe the Aſtronomers make of the

                     <p>The right be the two Colures, the right Horizon, &amp; the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
becauſe they cut the Spheare or Globe with right Angles:
And the oblique are theſe two, that is, the Zodiaque, and the

Spheare or globe with oblique Angles.</p>
                     <p>Which are ſaid to be moueable, and which immoueable?</p>
                     <p>The moueable are theſe, the Equinoctiall, the Zodiaque, the
two Tropiques, &amp; the 2. polar Circles which are ſaid to be moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
becauſe they continually mooue with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firmament &amp; are like

are ſaid to be intrinſicall or inward. The immoueable are theſe 2.
that is, the Horizon, &amp; the Meridian, which are ſaid to be immoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
becauſe in the turning of the Spheare they remaine vnmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,

of which degrées it containeth 360. which being deuided by 15.
do make 24. houres, which is a naturall day, contayning both

                     <p>Now tell what breadth the Zodiaque hath, and why it is

                     <p>It hath (according to the ancient writers) 12. degrées in bredth,
that is to ſay, 6. degrées on the one ſide of the Ecliptique line, &amp; 6.
degrées on the other ſide of the Ecliptique line, but according to
<pb facs="tcp:2698:153"/>
the moderne writers, it hath 16. degrées in breadth, that is, eight
degrées on ech ſide of the Ecliptique line, which breadth was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
imagined, firſt to the intent that by the meaſures and
degrées thereof it might be knowne, how much the Planets (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
called the wandring ſtarres, whoſe courſe is to paſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
vnder this broad Circle) doe wander at any time
on either ſide of the Ecliptique line, for they all wander, but ſome
more, ſome leſſe, the Sunne onely excepted, which neuer ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
from that line, but alwayes goeth right vnder the ſame, and
therefore the ſaide line is called of ſome writers the way of the
Sunne: And ſecondly it hath ſuch breadth to the intent it may
containe within the ſame, the 12. ſignes aforeſaid, by meanes of
which ſignes the whole circuit or longitude of the ſaide Circle is
deuided into 12. equall parts, and euery ſuch part is deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
30. degrées, and euery degrée into 60. minutes, and euery mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
into 60. ſeconds, &amp;c. ſo as the whole Longitude thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth
360. degrées, according vnto which diuiſion, all the reſt
of the Circles both greater and leſſer deſcribed in the Spheare,
are made to containe the like number of degrées, and euery halfe
Circle to containe 180. degrées, and euery quarter of a Circle to
containe 90. degrées, and by this diuiſion aſwell of the breadth as
of the length of the Zodiaque, it appeareth that euery one of the
12. Signes hath 30. degrées in length, and 12. degrées in bredth,
and thereof the Planets, Starres, and all other Celeſtiall bodies
are ſaid to haue both Longitude and Latitude, the ſunne onely
excepted.</p>
                     <p>How is ſuch Longitude and Latitude to be vnderſtood?</p>
                     <p>The Longitude of any Planet or Starre is to be counted in
the Ecliptique line containing in circuit 360. degrées, reckoning
from the firſt point of <hi>Aries,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Taurus, Gemini,</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi>

                        <p>This Table conſiſteth of 5. collums, whereof the firſt on the

the 12. ſignes of the Zodiaque, counting from one to 30. And the
thrée middle collums do contain the degrées minutes, and ſeconds
of declination, ouer the head of which thrée middle collums are ſet
downe the characters of theſe 6. oppoſit ſignes, <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Libra,
Taurus</hi> and <hi>Scorpio, Gemini</hi> and <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> and at the foot of

oppoſit ſignes, that is, <hi>Virgo</hi> and <hi>Piſces, Leo</hi> &amp; <hi>Aquarius, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>
and <hi>Capricornus,</hi> for euery 2. oppoſit ſignes, aſwell aboue as

hauing found out the degrée of the Sun by the inſtrument before
deſcribed, or rather by ſome true Ephemerides, you muſt ſéeke out
the number of the ſaid degrée, either in the firſt or laſt collum, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the character of the ſigne is placed. For if the ſigne or
character be aboue, then you muſt ſéeke for the ſaid number in the
firſt collum on the left hand, which numbers do diſcend from 1. to
30. but if the ſigne be beneath, then you muſt find it out in the the
outermoſt colum on the right hand, the numbers wherof do aſcend
from 1. to 30. and the common angle or ſquare, ſtanding right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſaid number will ſhew you the degrée, minutes and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds
of the declination, as for example, hauing found by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
inſtrument that the 4. day of May the Sun is in the 23. degrée
of <hi>Taurus,</hi> I ſéeing the character of <hi>Taurus</hi> to ſtand aboue, doe
ſéeke my foreſaid number of 23. degrées in the firſt collum on the
left hand, and in the common angle or ſquare right againſt that
number, and vnder the ſigne <hi>Taurus,</hi> I find the declination of the
Sun to be 18. degrées 32′· and 37″· But this Table cannot ſerue
alwayes: yea rather ſuch tables are to bee renewed as our Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers
ſay euery 30. yeares. Alſo you may know the daylie decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Sun, by helpe of a materiall Spheare or globe: thus
hauing ſet the Spheare at your latitude, bring the degrée of the
ſigne wherein the Sanne is that preſent day vnto the moouable
Meridian, and ſtaying it there, marke whether it falleth
on the South ſide or on the North ſide of the Equinoctiall:
<pb facs="tcp:2698:156"/>
for if it be in any of the Northern ſignes, it will fall on the North
ſide of the Equinoctial, and if it be in any of the Southern ſignes,
it will fall on the ſouth ſide of the Equinoctiall, and by counting
the degrées vpon the Meridian, contained betwixt the degrée of
the Sun and the Equinoctial, you ſhal know what declination the
Sun hath that day, as for example in the latitude 52. in the yeare
1590. the fift day of May, I find the Sunne by the Ephemerides
to be in the 23. degrée and 48′· of <hi>Taurus,</hi> which point I bring to
the moouable Meridian, and there ſtaying it, I find that point to
be diſtant from the Equinoctiall northward 18. degrées &amp; certaine

to haue that day.</p>

                     <p>It is as much to ſay, as to want light,

as when the Sun &amp; Moon are both at one

                     <p>When is the Moone ſaid to be totally eclipſed?</p>

trallie, and the earth in the verie midſt betwéen them both, for
the bodie of the earth being thick and not tranſparent, caſting his
ſhadow to that point which is oppoſite to the place of the Sun,
will not ſuffer the Moone to receiue any light from the Sun, from
whome ſhe alwaies borroweth her light.</p>
                     <p>At what time is the Moone ſaid to be diamtrallie oppoſit
to the Sunne?</p>
                     <p>When a right line drawne from the center of the Sun to the
center of the Moone, paſſeth through the center of the earth: &amp; note
that euery time that ſhe is at the ful, ſhe is oppoſit to the Sun, and
yet the earth is not at euery ſuch full diametrally betwixt her and
the Sun, for then ſhe ſhould be eclypſed at euery ful, which indéed
cannot be but when ſhe is either in the head or tail of the Dragon.</p>
                     <p>When is the Moone ſaid to be eclipſed in part?</p>
                     <p>When the Sunne, the earth, and the Moone be met in one ſelfe
Diametrall line, but the Moone is declining either on the one ſide
or on the other, as you may plainlie ſée by this figure following.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2698:157"/>
                        <figure/>
But note that the Eclipſes of the Moone may be vniuerſall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Earth is farre bigger than the Moone, and thereby able
to ſhadow her whole bodie.</p>
                     <p>When is the Sunne ſaide to be eclipſed?</p>
                     <p>When the Moone is betwixt the Sunne and the Earth, which
chanceth in a Coniunction, and yet not in euery coniunction, but
when it falleth either in the head or taile of the Dragon, which
may chance, as I ſaide before, either totally or in part: totallie
I ſay, in reſpect of thoſe parts of the earth whereon the ſhadowe
directly falleth. For ſith the Moone is farre leſſer than the Earth,
ſhe cannot ſhadow all the Earth, and therefore the Eclipſe of the
Sunne cannot be vniuerſall, but yet to ſome partes of the Earth
totally, and to ſome partlie, and to other ſome nothing at all, as
you may plainlie ſée by this figure following.</p>

                     <p>The Colure of the Equinoxes is ſo called becauſe it cutteth

the Horizon &amp; the Equinoctial are Paralels, this kind of Spheare
is called a paralel Spheare, in which Sphear they that dwel haue
6. moneths day, and 6. moneths night, as you may eaſily perceiue
by placing the Sphear, ſo as one of the Poles may ſtand right vp
in the midſt of the Horizon, by means wherof you ſhall ſée 6. ſignes
of the Zodiaque to be alwayes aboue the Horizon, and 6. ſignes
to be alwayes vnder the Horizon: Againe by placing the Sphear
ſo as both the Poles may lie vpon the Horizon, you ſhall ſée the

Equinoctiall a Meridian, ſo as they make in al 180. Albeit moſt
commonly in the Spheare they ſet downe but one, which ſerueth
for all by turning the bodie of the Spheare to it, which for that
cauſe is called the moouable Meridian. And in ſuch Spheares as
haue not a foote and a ſtanding Horizon, there is no Meridian at
all, but the two Colures are faine to ſupply their want, but all
terreſtriall Globes are commonly deſcribed with twelue Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

more Weſtward.</p>
                     <p>What other vſes hath this circle?</p>
                     <p>This circle deuideth the Eaſt part of the world from the Weſt
and alſo it ſheweth both the North and South, for by turning
your face towardes the Eaſt, you ſhall find the Sunne being in
that line at noone tide to be on your right hand right South, the
oppoſit part of which circle ſheweth on your left hand the North.
Alſo this circle by reaſon that it paſſeth through both the Poles
of the world, deuideth both the Equinoctiall and all his Paralels
into two equall parts aſwell aboue the Horizon as vnder the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
and by that means it deuideth the artificial day and artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

of the Horizon where the ſun riſeth, mounting ſtil vntil he come
to this circle, which is at noontide, is contayned the firſt halfe of
the day, &amp; the other half is from the ſame circle to the going down

ech Circle, and how many minutes are required in euery
leſſer degree proportionally to anſwere one degree of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall.</p>
                     <p>For the better knowledge hereof, you muſt firſt imagine that
there may be as many Circles made from the Equinoctiall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
any of the Poles, as there be degrées of Latitude, which
are in number 90. as hath béene ſaide before: And the nigher that
any Circle is to the Equinoctiall, the greater it is in circuit,
and the further from the Equinoctiall towards any of the Poles,
the leſſer in circuit, and therefore more or leſſe minutes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to anſwere to one degrée of the Equinoctiall, as you may
eaſily perceiue by this Table following, conſiſting of 6. collums,
euery front or head whereof is noted with three great letters,
<hi>D. M. S.</hi> ſignifying degrées, minutes and ſeconds, ſixe times
repeated, and in the beginning of the firſt colum on the left hand
is ſet downe one degrée, which is the firſt degrée of 90. &amp; nigheſt
vnto the Equinoctiall, right againſt which one degrée is placed
towards the right hand, 59. minutes, and 59. ſeconds: and ſo
procéeding from degrée to degrée ſucceſſiuely, vntill you come to
90. you ſhall finde how many minutes and ſeconds doe anſwere
to one degrée of the Equinoctiall, and this Table will alſo ſerue
to ſhew the difference of miles in euery ſundry clyme or paralell,
whereof we ſhall ſpeake hereafter when we come to treat of the
earth.</p>

                     <p>What meane you by a giuen Arke?</p>
                     <p>A giuen Arke is as much to ſay as ſome ſuppoſed portion of

the aſcention of ſome ſuppoſed portion of the Ecliptique, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning
for example 25. or 30. degrées, here this portion of the
Ecliptique contayning that number of degrées, is called the

ſome deſcrete or deuided, which I minde to Engliſh here whole
and broken, for ſo I doe Engliſh <hi>quantitas, continua, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creta</hi>
in my Logicke, That Arke is ſayde to bee continuall or
whole which taketh his beginning from the firſt point of <hi>Aries,</hi>
and ſo procéeding orderly, endeth at ſome other degrée of the
ſaide Ecliptique. And that Arke is called diſcrete or broken,
which doth not take his beginning from the firſt point of <hi>Aries,</hi>

ſuppoſe that it beginneth at the fourtéenth of <hi>Taurus,</hi>

vnderſtande that the auncient Aſtronomers doe commonly make
but two kindes of aſcention and deſcention, that is, right and

                     <p>When is any aſcention ſaide to bee right, oblique or
meane?</p>
                     <p>It is ſaide to be right, when that portion of the Equinoctiall
which riſeth or goeth downe together with the Ecliptique, is
greater or more in circuit then that of the Ecliptique. And it is
ſayde to be oblique, when that portion of the Equinoctiall which
riſeth or falleth together with the Ecliptique, is leſſer then that
of the Ecliptique, Againe that is ſayde to be meane aſcention,
when that portion of the Ecliptique which aſcendeth, is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
greater nor leſſer then that of the Equinoctiall, for as in
<pb facs="tcp:2698:173"/>
the right Spheare euery quarter of the Ecliptique hath a meane
aſcention, and equall to euery quarter of the Equinoctiall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
the quarters at any of the foure principall pointes, ſo
if you take thrée ſignes in any other part of the Zodiaque, their
aſcentions will not agrée with a quarter of the Equinoctiall,
ſith there is no one ſigne that doth equally agrée with the like
portion of the Equinoctiall, and all this matter dependeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the knowledge of the vſe of certaine Circles before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</p>
                     <p>Which be they?</p>
                     <p>Theſe thrée, the Zodiaque, the Equinoctiall, and the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon:
for firſt the Zodiaque doth ſhewe the place of the Sunne,
that is to ſay in what degrée it is of any ſigne together with the
minutes of the ſame, and turning about euery day by the diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
motion, doth both appeare aboue the Horizon, and alſo is
hidden vnder the Horizon. Secondly the Equinoctiall with his
equall riſing and going downe, doth meaſure the time of the
ſunne whileſt he maketh his abode vnequally and diuerſely aboue
the Horizon. Thirdly the Horizon deuideth the one Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheare
from the other, on which Horizon is to be conſidered
what Angle any ſigne or ſtarre maketh therewith, in his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or deſcention, and according as any portion of the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
riſeth or ſetteth rightly or obliquely, ſo in reſpect of the

                     <p>Why ſhould the aſcentions and deſcentions be meaſured

                     <p>The cauſe thereof is the obliquitie of the Zodiaque, hauing

aſcention and deſcention, wee will
make this diuiſion, for either it is of ſome
point or ſtarre, or elſe of ſome portion of a
Circle chiefely of the Ecliptique line. In the
aſcention of any point or ſtarre, wee conſider
two thinges. Firſt what Angle it maketh with
the Horizon either right or oblique. Secondly
the time from the riſing of the firſt minute of <hi>Aries,</hi> which is
the firſt beginning of the Longitude of any ſtarre or Circle in
heauen, and in reſpect of the Angle euery aſcention is ſayd to be
right in a right Spheare, and oblique in an oblique Spheare: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the time of the aſcention is to be meaſured by the degrées of
the Equinoctiall from the firſt minute of <hi>Aries,</hi> vnto that degrée
and minute of the Equinoctiall which aſcendeth together with
the ſtarres, And note by the way that 15. degrées of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall
do make an houre, and foure doe make one degrée of the
ſame Equinoctiall, for foure times 15. doe make 60. minutes,
which is an houre, Againe euery aſcention conſidered, according
to the time of his gate, is eyther right, oblique, or meane: if it be
right, it is ſlowe: if it be oblique, it is quicke: if it be meane, it
is equall. Now the aſcention of any Arke or portion of a Circle is
alſo eyther right, oblique, or meane: if it be right, it aſcendeth
ſlowely: if oblique, it aſcendeth quickely: if meane, it aſcendeth
equally. And the better to vnderſtand all theſe thrée kindes of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centions,
I will ſet downe theſe twelue rules heere following,
whereof fiue doe belong to the right Spheare, and ſeuen to the

                     <p>In the right Spheare all the foure quarters riſing from the

3 In the right Spheare all ſtarres or pointes that be in the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticiall
Colure haue meane aſcention.</p>
                     <p>4 In the right Spheare thoſe ſignes that do aſcend rightly, doe
deſcend rightly, and thoſe that doe aſcend obliquely, doe deſcend
obliquely.</p>
                     <p>5 In the right Spheare, <hi>Gemini, Cancer, Sagittarius,</hi> and
<hi>Capricornus,</hi> doe aſcende rightly, and all the reſt obliquely.</p>
                     <p>6 In the oblique Spheare, the two Equinoctiall points haue
meane aſcention.</p>
                     <p>7 In the oblique Spheare ech halfe of the Spheare, beginning
at eyther of the Equinoxes haue meane aſcention: but this rule
holdeth not, if that you beginne any other where.</p>
                     <p>8 In the oblique Sphere, thoſe ſignes that do aſcend rightly, do
deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d obliquely, &amp; thoſe which aſcend obliquely do deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d rightly.</p>
                     <p>9 In the oblique Spheare, the aſcention of any ſuppoſed ſigne
is equall to the deſcention of his oppoſite ſigne, and the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any ſuppoſed ſigne, is equall to the aſcention of his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
ſigne.</p>
                     <p>10 In the oblique Spheare, the aſcention of any ſigne being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to his deſcention, is equall to the aſcention and deſcention of
the ſame ſigne being in the right Spheare.</p>
                     <p>11 In the oblique Sphere euery two ſignes equally diſtant from
the two points of the Equinoctiall, haue equall aſcentions and

                     <p>12 In the oblique Sphere vnder the pole Arctique, al ſignes from

                     <p>What is the chiefe cauſe of the diuerſity of aſcentions and

                     <p>The chiefe cauſe is the diuerſity of the Angles which the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaque

that inſtant, which you ſhall finde to be 84. degrées 54′· and by
counting the degrées contained betwixt the two markes on the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall,
you ſhall find the number of degrées to be 42. degrées
24′· ſo as you may conclude that the deſcention of <hi>Taurus</hi> in that

                     <p>How manifold is the Poeticall riſing and ſetting?</p>
                     <p>Thréefold, that is, <hi>Coſmicus, Acronicus,</hi> and <hi>Heliacus,</hi> the
ſignification of which wordes ſhall appeare vnto you by the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the foreſaid thrée kindes here following: For <hi>ortus Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micus,</hi>
called in Latine <hi>mundanus,</hi> which is aſmuch to ſay here
as the worldly or morning riſing, is when any ſtarre riſeth in the
morning aboue the Horizon, together with the ſunne, or rather
with that point of the Ecliptique line wherein the ſunne is at that
time. And the Coſmicall ſetting, called in Latine <hi>occaſus Coſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
is when a ſtarre goeth downe vnder the Horizon at ſuch time
as the ſunne riſeth, ſo as this kind of riſing and ſetting is wholly

                        <hi>Ortus Acronicus</hi> which is as much to ſay as the Euening or

the Euening at the going down of the ſunne: And <hi>occaſus Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi>
that is to ſay, the Euening ſetting is when any ſtarre go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
downe vnder the Horizon, together with the ſunne, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this kind is alwaies to be referred to the going downe of the

                        <hi>Ortus Heliacus,</hi> that is to ſay, the Solar riſing, is when any
ſtar by departing from the beames of the Sun appeareth, &amp; may
be ſéen, which before being darkned by the ſunne could not be ſéen,
And <hi>occaſus Heliacus,</hi> is when any ſtarre by the nigh approching
of the ſunne ceaſeth to bee ſéene, for by reaſon that the ſunne by
his yearely courſe &amp; oblique motion of the Ecliptique, doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
approch to diuerſe ſtarres, and ſometime by little and little
retireth backe againe from the ſame, it falleth out that thoſe ſtars

and not ſéene, and by his departing from them, and eſpecially
when the ſunne is in the Eaſt or Weſt part of the firmament, they
beginne againe to be ſéene. And therefore as in the other 2. kinds,
the Horizon together with the riſing and ſetting of the ſunne, are
to be conſidered as chiefe cauſes thereof, ſo in this laſt kinde the
chiefe cauſe is to be referred to the highneſſe or farreneſſe of the

deſcribe the time by the riſing or ſetting of ſome notable ſtarre,
which they thinke moſt méete for their purpoſe, and thereby doe
greatly adorne their ſtile, and ſpecially being poeticall: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that the times wherein ſuch ſtarres did riſe or ſet, do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
differ in theſe dayes from the auncient times. Many therefore
of our moderne writers, as <hi>Garceus</hi> and others, haue made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſe
Tables of purpoſe to finde out the difference, and thereby to
come to the true knowledge of the times by the auncient men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
of which matter I leaue to ſpeake, thinking it not méete
to trouble young Saylers therewith, for whom I chiefely wrote
this Treatiſe of the Spheare.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſome affirme that the auncient men did vſe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
poeticall riſing and ſetting of certaine ſtarres, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of the <hi>Pleiades, Hiades, Orion, Arcturus, Capella,</hi> and <hi>Lira,</hi>
(which ſtarres were to them beſt knowne) as a Kalender not
onely to know thereby the difference of times, and ſeaſons of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2698:177"/>
the yeare: but alſo by their manner of riſing, ſetting, hiding,
and appearing to prognoſticate and to fore-ſee tempeſts and
ſtormes, yea and that in theſe daies wee alſo (as ſome write)
might doe the like, though there were neither Kalender nor
Ephemerides, and in that reſpect the knowledge hereof ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

                     <p>All ſuch things are to be knowne more exactly by the Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall
aſcention and deſcention, then by the Poeticall riſing or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

ſince thoſe dayes haue changed their places, their longitudes, and
declinations, and thereby in diuerſe reſpects haue altered their
Natures and qualities, yea and the very ſignes themſelues: As
for example, neither <hi>Taurus, Gemini,</hi> nor <hi>Cancer,</hi> is ſo hoat and
dry now, as in times paſt, neither doth <hi>Scorpio</hi> cauſe ſo much
thunder now, as in times paſt, ſome againe are more or leſſe cold

                     <p>How ſhall I know how many points of the Mariners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
are contained in any number of degrees, exceding the
number of degrees and minutes contained in one point?</p>
                     <p>The Mariners Compaſſe containeth 32. points, and euery
point containeth 11. degrées and ¼. of a degrée which is 15. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
wherefore whenſoeuer you would know how many points
of the Compaſſe are contained in any number of degrées be it
great or ſmall, multiply that number by foure, and deuide the
product thereof by 45. and the quotient will ſhewe the number of
the points, and if there be any remainder, then becauſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner
doth make euery point to haue foure quarters, multiply that
remainder by foure, and deuide the product by 45. which is the
common diuiſor, and the quotient will ſhew the quarters, or if the
remainder be but ſmall, then multiply that remainder by eight,
which are halfe quarters, and deuide the product thereof by 45.
as before, and the quotient will ſhew the halfe quarters of a point:
<pb facs="tcp:2698:186"/>
As in the former example in multiplying 40. degr. by 4. the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
is 160. which if you deuide by 45. you ſhall finde in the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
3. whole points, &amp; the remainder to be 25. which being mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed
by 4. the product will be 100. which if you deuide by 45.
you ſhall find in the quotient 2. quarters of a point, &amp; the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to be 10/45. of a quarter, that is to ſay, if you can deuide one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into 45. parts, then you muſt take 10. of thoſe parts, and adde
them to the former ſumme, which being of ſmal importance is not
to be regarded. But now to returne to my firſt matter, I ſay that
by counting the degrées vppon the Horizon, from the firſt péece of
waxe to the South point of the Horizon, I find the number of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées
to be 130. degr. &amp; by allowing 15. degr. to an houre, I finde
the halfe day to containe 8. houres 10′· which being doubled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
16. houres 20′· Then to know the Meridian altitude of the
ſunne, you muſt bring the degrée of the ſunne right vnder the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,
and the number of the degrées contained in the Meridian
betwixt the South point of the Horizon, and the ſaid degrée of the
ſunne will ſhewe the Meridian Altitude of the ſunne, ſo ſhall you
find the Meridian Altitude of the ſunne, being in the firſt point of
<hi>Cancer</hi> to be 61. degrées, which once had, the diſtance from the
Zenith is ſoone knowne: for if you ſubtract 61. degrées from 90.
you ſhall find the diſtance of the ſunne from the Zenith to be 29.
degrées. Againe contrariwiſe the diſtance from the Zenith being
ſubtracted from 90. the remainder will ſhew the Meridian Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
for thoſe two numbers being added together, doe alwaies
make a iuſt quarter of the great Circle, which is 90. degrées.</p>

ſometimes ſhort, according to the time of the yeare, ſo are the

day is 17. houres long, and the night but ſeuen houres, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide

alſo that the vnequall houres are called ſometime artificiall and

are neuer equall but twice in the yeare, when the ſunne is in ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                        <p>Now the vſe of the ſaide Table is thus: whenſoeuer you would
knowe in what houre of the day or night any Planet raigneth, you
muſt firſt ſéeke out the houre of the day or night, and if it be of
the day, then you ſhall finde it in the firſt rowe of the front, if of the
night, in the ſecond rowe of the front, as hath béene ſaide before:
and from that houre deſcende with your finger to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Angle ſtanding right againſt the day which you ſéeke, and
that will ſhewe you what Planet then raigneth. As for example,
if you would know on Wedneſday at 8. of the clocke of the day
what Planet raigneth, then hauing found the number of 8. in the
front, written in Arithmeticall figure, come ſtraight downe from
thence with your finger to the common Angle ſtanding right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Wedneſday, and you ſhall finde that <hi>Mercurie</hi> raigneth.
And if you would knowe what Planet raigneth the ſame day at
the eight houre of the night, then deſcende from the houre of the
night downe to the common Angle, and you ſhall finde that the
ſunne raigneth, and ſo foorth of all the reſt.</p>
                        <p>The rule contained in one verſe, and the vſe thereof.</p>
                        <p>The rule in verſe is thus:</p>
                        <p>Sol, Ve, Mer, Luna, Saturnus, Iupiter, &amp; Mars.</p>
                        <p>Theſe vii. wordes (the coniunction &amp; being left out) doe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the ſeuen Planets: For <hi>Sol</hi> is the Sunne, <hi>Ve</hi> ſtandeth for
<hi>Venus, Mer</hi> for <hi>Mercurius, Luna</hi> is the Moone, and the other
thrée Planets following, as <hi>Saturnus, Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> doe
make vp the number of ſeuen, which muſt alwayes followe one
another, in ſuch order as they are here ſet downe in the foreſaide
verſe, and to haue the true vſe of this rule, you muſt firſt apply
euery Planet to his owne proper day, as <hi>Sol</hi> to Sunday, <hi>Luna</hi> to
Munday, <hi>Mars</hi> to Tueſday, <hi>Mercurius</hi> to Wedneſday, <hi>Iupiter</hi>
to Thurſday, <hi>Venus</hi> to Friday, and <hi>Saturnus</hi> to Saturday: for
euery one of theſe Planets gouerneth the firſt houre of his owne
proper day, and the Planet placed next to him in the verſe, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the ſecond houre of the ſame day, and ſo forth orderly, as for
example, if you would knowe what Planet ſhall raigne on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
at the third houre of the day, you muſt firſt ſay that <hi>Sol</hi> doth
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2698:188"/>
raigne the firſt houre becauſe that is his day, and <hi>Venus</hi> raigneth
the ſecond houre, and <hi>Mercurie</hi> the third houre according to your
rule, &amp; ſo by kéeping the order of the verſe, you ſhall eaſily appoint
to euery houre both of the day and of the night artificiall his owne
gouernour: For though both day and night be deuided ech of
them into 12. houres, making in all 24. houres, and that there
be but ſeuen Planets, yet by appointing euery Planet to his owne
proper day as gouernour of the firſt houre of the ſame day, and
by obſeruing the order of the verſe in repeating the ſaid Planets,
you ſhall not faile to giue to euery houre his proper Planet. Thus

whereſoeuer this firſt Meridian cutteth the Equinoctiall, there

                     <p>Define once againe what Latitude is?</p>

by reaſon that the Equinoctiall girdeth all ſuch Meridians in the

knowe the Latitude at any other day or time of the yeare, then
after that you haue taken the height of the ſunne at noone, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
called the Meridian altitude, you muſt firſt learne to knowe

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2698:194"/>
to be ſure in taking the Meridian altitude, it ſhall be néedefull to

hath béene moſt commonly taught, as well by the auncient,
as moderne writers, as a moſt ſure and readie way of finding the
Latitude of any place.</p>
                     <p>What if the ſunne doe not ſhine at noone, nor perhaps all

                     <p>Then you muſt tarrie vntill night that ſome ſtarre appeare,
which you perfectly knowe, and ſuch a one as both riſeth and
ſetteth. And hauing taken the Meridian altitude of that ſtarre
with your Aſtrolabe or Quadrant, you muſt learne what decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
he hath, and whether it be Northerne or Southerne. For
if the ſtarre hath North declination, then you muſt ſubtract his
declination from his Meridian altitude, and the remainder ſhall
be the Altitude of the Equinoctiall, which being taken out of
nintie, ſhall be the Latitude of the place, or eleuation of the

muſt adde his declination to his Meridian altitude, and that
ſumme ſhall be the Altitude of the Equinoctiall, which being
taken out of 90. the remainder ſhall be the eleuation of the Pole.
As for example, ſuppoſing that you knowe the ſtarre called
<hi>Arcturus,</hi> or <hi>Bubulcus,</hi> and that you finde his Meridian alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
by your Aſtrolabe or Quadrant to be 59. degrées 30. minutes
and alſo that you haue learned by ſome Table, that his declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Northwarde is 21. degrées 30. minutes: here by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his ſaide declination becauſe it is Northernly, out of his
Meridian altitude, you finde the remainder to be 38. degrées
which is the Altitude of the Equinoctiall, which béeing taken

I minde here therefore briefely to ſhewe you firſt the order of
finding out the Longitude by the Eclipſe of the Moone, and
then how to finde out the ſame by that readie way which he hath
inuented: the order then to knowe it by the Eclipſe of the Moone
is thus: Firſt you muſt learne by ſome Ephemerides at what
houre the Eclipſe ſhall be in ſome place, where you knowe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
by ſome Table the Longitude, that done, you your ſelfe or
ſome other for you, muſt the ſame day of the Eclipſe obſerue
by the Aſtrolabe at what houre the Eclipſe beginneth in that
place, whereof you knowe not the Longitude: For if the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe
doe beginne in both places at one ſelfe houre, then aſſure
your ſelfe that both places haue one ſelfe Longitude, but if it
beginne ſooner or later, then there is difference betwixt them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the varietie of the time, which difference is thus to
be knowne: Take the leſſer ſumme of houres out of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and there ſhall remaine either houres, or minutes, or both,
if houres, then multiply the ſame by fiftéene, if minutes, deuide
the ſame by foure, (for in this account fiftéene degrées doe make
one houre, and foure minutes doe make one degrée) and adde the
difference ſo found to the Longitude, if the Eclipſe doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
there ſooner: if later then ſubtract the ſayd difference from
the knowne Longitude, and that which remaineth will ſhew the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2698:195"/>
vnknowne longitude. But note by the way, that if there remaine
any minutes after the diuiſion, you muſt multiply thoſe minutes
by 15. and ſo ſhall you haue the minutes of degrees.</p>
                     <p>Shew the vſe of this rule by ſome example.</p>
                     <p>For example I finde by the tables of <hi>Ptolomey</hi> that the
longitude of <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France</hi> is 23. degrées, and by ſome Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manacke
or Ephemerides I finde that the Eclipſe doth begin
there at thrée houres after midnight, now by this I would know
the longitude of <hi>Tubing</hi> a famous citie in <hi>Sueuia,</hi> which is a
region of <hi>Germany,</hi> at which towne in the verie day of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe
I cauſe to bee obſerued by Aſtrolabe at what houre the
Eclipſe beginneth there, and I finde that it beginneth at 3. of
the clocke and 24′· after midnight, then by ſubtracting the
leſſer number of time out of the greater, I find the remainder to
bée 24′· which béeing deuided by 4′· which doe make one degrée,
the quotient ſhall be 6. degrées, and that is the difference, which
being added to the knowne longitude of <hi>Paris</hi> (becauſe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe
is ſooner there than at <hi>Tubing</hi>) it maketh in all 9. degrées,
whereby I gather that the longitude of <hi>Tubing</hi> is 29. degrées,
by this meanes all the Tables of Coſmographers are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie

longitudes for lacke perhaps of vſing diligence in taking the

the true moouing of the Moone according
to the longitude at the time of your obſeruation
at ſome certaine place, for whoſe Meridian the
rootes of thoſe Tables are calculated and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refied.
Alſo you muſt know the degrée of longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of ſome fixed Starre nigh vnto the Ecliptique, going ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
next before or els next after the moouing of the Moone, then
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2698:196"/>
you muſt ſéeke out the diſtance of the moouing of the Moone and
of the ſaid Starre, which diſtance once had, apply the croſſe ſtaffe
to your eye, and mooue the croſſe vp and downe vntill you may
ſée the center of the bodie of the Moone with the one end of the
croſſe and the foreſaid fixed Star with the other end of the croſſe,
ſo ſhall the croſſe ſhew you by the degrées and minutes marked
vpon the ſtaffe, the diſtance of the Moone and of the foreſaide
Starre aunſwerable to the place of your obſeruation, which being
ſet downe, ſet downe alſo the diſtance betwixt the Moone and the
foreſaid Starre that was firſt calculated, and then take the leſſer
out of the greater, ſo ſhall remaine the laſt difference, which may
be rightly called the diuerſitie of aſpectes, which difference if
you deuide by the moouing which the Moone maketh in one houre,
you ſhall knowe thereby the time in which the Moone is or was
ioyned with the firſt diſtance of the foreſaid Starre, then hauing
conuerted that time into degrées and minutes, adde or ſubtract
the product thereof to or from that Meridian, vnto which the
Tables (whereby you firſt calculated the moouing of the Moone)
were verefied, that is to ſay, if the diſtance betwixt the Moone
and the fixed Starre of your obſeruation be leſſer, then adde the
degrées and minutes to the knowne longitude, ſo ſhall you find
the place of your obſeruation to be more Eaſtward, but if it bée
greater, then ſubtract the degrées and minutes from the known
longitude, and the place of your obſeruation ſhall bee more weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
All which rules <hi>Gemma Friſius</hi> affirmeth to be true, ſo
as the Moone be more weſtward than the fixed Starre: for if at
the time of your obſeruation the Moone bee more Eaſtwarde,
then you muſt worke cleane contrarie, that is to ſay, if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
betwixt the Moone and the fixed Starre bee leſſer, you
muſt ſubtract the degrées and minutes from the knowne lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude,
ſo ſhall the place of your obſeruation bee more Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
but if it be greater, then you muſt adde the degrées and
minutes vnto the knowne longitude, and you ſhall finde the place
of your obſeruation to be more Eaſtward.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He diſtance may be knowne diuerſe wayes, that
is, either Arithmetically, Geometrically, or by
the Tables of <hi>Sinus.</hi> But before I ſhew you the
order of any of theſe wayes, you haue to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that any two places do differ in diſtance one
from another one of theſe 3. maner of wayes, that
is, either in latitude onely, or in longitude onely, or els in both: if
two places hauing one ſelfe longitude do differ onely in latitude,
then according to the Arithmetical way you muſt ſubtract the
leſſer latitude out of the greater, and the remainder ſhall be the
difference, which being multiplied by 60. will ſhewe the number
of miles as for example, <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Roan</hi> hauing in a manner
one ſelfe longitude, doe differ onely in latitude, for the latitude of
<hi>London</hi> is 51. degrées 32′· &amp; the latitude of <hi>Roan</hi> is 49. degrées
and 10′· which being the leſser latitude and therefore to bee taken
out of 51. degrées 32′· there remaineth 2. degrées 22′· which 2.
degrées being multiplied by 60. maketh 120. whereunto if for
the 22′· annexed to the degrées you adde 22. miles (for euery mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
is a mile) it ſhall make in all 142. miles, which by a right line
is the true diſtance betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Roan.</hi> But you haue to
note that the difference of 2. ſundry latitudes is not to be knowne
by ſubtracting the leſſer out of the greater, vnles both the places
be ſo ſituated, as both may haue either North latitude or South
latitude, for if the one place haue North latitude and the other
South latitude, the difference is to be known by addition, and not
by ſubtraction: as for example, <hi>Naples</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> hath 41. degrées
of North latitude, and <hi>la Madalena</hi> in <hi>Aphricke</hi> not farre from
<hi>Manicongo,</hi> hath 8. degrées of ſouth latitude, both places hauing
one ſelf Meridian, here the difference of theſe two latitudes is to
be knowne by addition, and not by ſubtracting the leſſer out of the
greater, for 8. and 41. being added together do make 49. and that
is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true difference, which being multiplied by 60. maketh 2940.
miles. So likewiſe the difference of the two longitudes is not
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2698:197"/>
alwayes knowne by ſubtracting the leſſer out of the greater, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the two places haue both Eaſt longitude or els both Weſt
longitude: As for example <hi>Lisbona</hi> in <hi>Spaine</hi> hath in Eaſt. lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude
13. degrées and <hi>Cap de losſlauos</hi> in the Weſt <hi>Indies</hi>
hath in weſt longitude 334. degrées: here the difference of theſe
two longitudes is not to be known by taking the leſſer out of the
greater, but thus, firſt take 334. out of 360. and there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
26. degrées, wherunto if you ad the Eaſt longitude for <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bona,</hi>
which is 13. degrées, it wil make in all 39. degrées, which is
the true difference of the 2. longitudes, for if you ſhould take 13.
degrées out of 334. there would remaine 321. which is not the
true difference. But to know the diſtance of two places differing
in longitude, this Table here following is needfull.</p>

euery degrée of latitude is leſser in value than other, and

make in all 247. miles and 54″· of a mile. But in making this

37. and the product thereof will amount to 222. then by the rule
of proportion you may find out the value of the minutes annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

60′· which is one degrée, do require 37. miles, what ſhall 42′· re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.

                        <p>Firſt, take the difference of the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
and latitudes of both places by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
the leſſer out of the greater, then
conuert the ſame into miles by multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the difference of the two longitudes
into the miles that be anſwerable to the
latitude of each place, which miles you
ſhall find in the Table aforeſaid, and if
there be any minutes annexed to the degrées of the difference of
longitude, then reduce the ſame alſo to miles by the rule of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
as before is taught, and hauing added the two products
together, halfe the ſumme, and ſet it by it ſelfe. Then multiply
the difference of the latitudes into 60. miles, and adde thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fraction of minutes annexed to the ſaid difference if it hath
anie fraction, allowing for euerie minute one mile, and ſet that
number alſo by it ſelfe: that done, ſquare the ſummes reſerued,
that is to ſay, multiplie ech one part by it ſelfe into it ſelfe, and
hauing added the two products together into one ſumme, ſéeke
out the ſquare roote thereof, &amp; that ſhal be the true diſtance of the
two places. As for example, if you would knowe the true diſtance
betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> firſt you muſt knowe by ſome Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the longitude and latitude of both townes, wherefore finding
the longitude of <hi>London</hi> to be 19. degrées, 54′· and the latitude
thereof to be 51. degrées, 32′· And the longitude of <hi>Venice</hi> to be
35. degrées, 30′· and the latitude thereof to be 44. degrées, 45′·
Now by ſubtracting the leſſer longitude out of the greater, I
finde the difference of longitude to bee 15. degrees, 36′· and by
ſubtracting the leſſer latitude out of the greater, I find the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of latitude to be 6. degrées, 47′· Then knowing the latitude
of <hi>London</hi> to be 51. degrées, I reſort to the table of miles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for euerie degrée of latitude before ſet downe, and theer I
find that to 51. degrées of latitude do anſwere 37. miles and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="tcp:2698:199"/>
ſeconds, which being of ſmall moment are not woont to be
reckoned. Then in multiplying the difference of the longitudes
which is 15. degrées 36′· by 37. miles I find the product of the
15. degrées ſo multiplied to be 555. and becauſe there bée 36′·
annexed to the foreſaid 15. degrées, I ſéeke by the rule of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to knowe how many miles that fraction containeth, in
ſaying thus, if 60. require 37. what ſhall 36. require? and I find
22. miles, which being added to 555. maketh 577. then by ſéeking
in the foreſaid table how manie miles be anſwerable to the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of <hi>Venice,</hi> which is 44. degrées, I find the number of
miles to be 43. by which number I multiply once againe the
difference of longitude, which is 15. degrées. 36′· the product
whereof, together with the fraction annexed thereunto being
conuerted into miles by the rule of proportion, as before, doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to 670. which ſum being added to the former conuerted
longitude, which is 577. maketh in all 1247. the halfe whereof
is 623. which halfe number I reſerue by it ſelfe, that done I
multiply the difference of the latitude, which is 6. degrées 47′· by
60. miles, in saying 6. times 60. maketh 360. whereunto I adde
for the 47′· annexed 47. miles, &amp; it maketh in al 407. which ſum
I reſerue alſo by it ſelf. Then I multiplie the firſt reſerued num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
into it ſelfe, the product whereof is 388129. That done,
I multiplie the ſeconde reſerued number alſo into it ſelfe, the
product whereof is 165649. which two laſt productes being
added together, do make in all 553778. whereof the ſquare roote
being taken, is 744. miles, which is the true diſtance of <hi>Venice</hi>
by a right line from <hi>London.</hi> And to the intent that the order
and working herein may more plainly appeare vnto you, I haue
ſet downe all the particular numbers of the ſame here by them
ſelues, as it were in a Table.</p>

Chap. 14.</head>
                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt now becauſe the way before taught
to finde out ſuch diſtance by the Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
way may ſéeme perhaps to ſome
folkes very buſie and tedious, I haue
thought good therefore to ſet downe this
other way which was ſent me not long
ſince from my louing friend M. <hi>Wright</hi>
of <hi>Cayes</hi> colledge in <hi>Cambridge</hi> who is
wel learned in the Mathematicals, &amp; is ſo
apt therunto by nature, as he is like inogh to attain to ſuch perfit
<pb facs="tcp:2698:200"/>
knowledge therein as he may be able thereby hereafter greatly
to perfect his country, if for want of ſufficient exhibition he bée
not forced to leaue ſo noble a ſtudie, wherefore I wiſh with al my
heart that all Gentlemen of abilitie were minded to ſhew their
liberalitie towards him in that behalfe. But to returne to my
matter, I ſay that the way to find out the foreſaid diſtance is this
here following: firſt hauing drawne a demi-circle vpon a right
Diameter (the larger that the demi-circle is the better,) and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
the ſame into 180. degrees, like vnto this hereafter deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
and marked with the letters <hi>a b c d.</hi> whereof <hi>d.</hi> is the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and <hi>a. c.</hi> the Diameter. Then learne firſt by ſome Table
to know the longitude the latitude of both places, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their longitudes, as you did before in ſéeking to know by
the Arithmetical way the diſtance betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi>
the difference of whoſe two longitudes is 15. degrées, and 36′· as
you may ſée in the former Table: for in working by this way, you
haue chiefly to ſéeke out in the circumference of the demicircle but
thrée things, that is, firſt, the difference of the two longitudes, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie,
the leſser latitude, and laſt of all the greateſt latitude.
Knowing therefore the difference of the ſaid two places in longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to be 15. degrées, 36′· ſéeke out the ſame in the demicircle,
beginning to count at <hi>A.</hi> and ſo proceed towards <hi>B.</hi> And at the
end of thoſe degrées and minutes ſet downe a pricke marked with
the letter <hi>e.</hi> vnto which pricke drawe a right line by your ruler
from <hi>D.</hi> the center of the demicircle. That done, ſéeke out the
leſſer latitude, which is 44. degrées, and 45′· in the forſaid demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle,
beginning to account the ſame from the pricke <hi>e.</hi> and ſo
procéede towards the letter <hi>B.</hi> and at the end of the ſaid leſſer la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
ſet downe another pricke marked with the letter <hi>g.</hi> from
which prick or point draw a perpendicular line which by help of
your ſquire or compaſſes may fal with right angles vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
right line drawne from <hi>D.</hi> to <hi>e.</hi> and where it falleth, there
ſet downe a pricke marked with the letter <hi>h.</hi> That done, ſéeke out
the greater latitude, which is 51. degrées, and 32′· in the foreſaid
demicircle, beginning to account the ſame from <hi>A.</hi> towards <hi>B.</hi>
and at the end of that latitude ſet downe another prick marked
with the letter <hi>I.</hi> from whence draw another perpendicular line
that may fal by help of your ſquire or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſes with right angles
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2698:200"/>
vpon the Diameter <hi>A. C.</hi> and there make a prick marked with
the letter <hi>K.</hi> That done, take with your compaſſe the diſtance
that is betwixt <hi>k.</hi> and <hi>h.</hi> which diſtance you muſt ſet downe vpon
your ſaid Diameter <hi>A. C.</hi> ſetting the one foote of your compaſſe
vpon <hi>k.</hi> and the other towardes the center <hi>D.</hi> and there make a
pricke marked with the letter <hi>L.</hi> Then take with your Compaſſe
the length of the ſhorter perpendicular line <hi>g. h.</hi> and apply that
wideneſſe vpon the longer perpendicular line <hi>I. K.</hi> ſetting the
one foot of your Compaſſe at <hi>I.</hi> which is the end of the greater la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and extend the other foote towards <hi>K.</hi> and there make a
pricke marked with the letter <hi>M.</hi> That done, take the diſtance
betwixt <hi>L.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> with your compaſſe, and apply the ſame to
the demicircle, ſetting the one foote of your Compaſſe in <hi>A.</hi> and
the other towards <hi>B.</hi> and there make a prick marked with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>N.</hi> And the number of degrées contained betwixt <hi>A.</hi> &amp; <hi>N.</hi> will
ſhew the true diſtance of the two places, which you ſhall find to be
12. degrées and almoſt 24′· Now by allowing for euery degrée
60. miles, and for euery minute a mile, the ſumme of miles will
agrée with the former diſtance found out by the Arithmetical way
which was 744. miles. And thus you haue to deale to know the
diſtance of any other two places whatſoeuer, differing both in lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude
and latitude. But you haue to note by the way, that if the
difference of the longitudes doth excéede the number of 180. then
you muſt ſubtract that excéeding difference out of 360. and the
remainder ſhall be the difference of the longitudes, and then work
in all points as is before taught. And this way is as Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall,
as that which <hi>Appian</hi> ſetteth downe in his booke of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographie,

                     <p>Moſt readily and eaſily by helpe of a
terreſtrial globe in this maner following.
Firſt take the diſtance of the 2. places by
extending your compaſſe vpon the globe,
from the one place to the other, which if
you would know how many miles it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth,
apply the ſame diſtance ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vnto the Equinoctiall line, ſetting the
firſt foot of your compaſſe vpon the firſt Meridian in that point,
whereas it cutteth the Equinoctiall, then ſée how many degrées
of the Equinoctial are comprehended betwixt the two féet of your
Compaſſe, and multiply thoſe degrées by 60. &amp; the product ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſhall ſhewe you howe many Italian miles ſuch diſtance is in
length. But if either of the places or both, be wanting and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the Globe, then you muſt learne by the tables of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomey</hi>
or of ſome others, as of <hi>Appian, Gemma Friſius, Oron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
or ſuch like, the longitude and latitude of the ſaid places, that
done, hauing ſought out the longitude of the firſt place in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall,
turne the globe about with your hand vntill you haue
brought the longitude right vnder the brazen Meridian, which
being ſtayed there, ſéeke out in the ſaid Meridian the latitude of
the ſaid place, and there ſet a marke vpon the globe, for there the
place ſhould ſtand, and doe in like maner to finde out the ſeconde
place: Then by extending your Compaſſe from the one marke to
the other, you ſhall haue the true diſtance, which diſtance if you
apply to the Equinoctiall like as before is taught, the degrées
thereof being multiplyed by 60. will ſhewe you how many miles
thoſe two places are diſtant one from another.</p>
                     <p>May not the diſtance of places be found out aſwell by an
vniuerſall Map as by the globe terreſtriall?</p>
                     <p>Yes indéed and more readily by reaſon that for the moſt parte
euery Map hath his proper ſkale, ſo as you néed to do no more but
to take the diſtance of the 2. places with your Compaſſe, and to

whereinto the amient Coſmographers thought good to
deuide the earth, to the intent that euery part thereof night bée
the better known how it is ſituated either Northward or South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
whether it be hot or cold, or betwixt both, and of what length
the day and night is in euery place, and what manner of ſhaddow
the Sun yéeldeth euery where, and ſuch like accidents, and firſt of
the 5. Zones.</p>

how the Sun by his oblique, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable

one part of the earth more than another,
gathered thereby that the earth had thrée
temperatures that is to ſay, extreame hot,
extreame cold, and a meane temperature,
that is, neither too hotte, nor too colde: And
therefore to ſhew vs vnto which of theſe temperatures, any part
of the earth was ſubiect, they deuided the earth into 5. Zones,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2698:202"/>
anſwerable to the 5. Zones of the firmament, by helpe of the
Equinoctiall and the 4. leſſer circles before deſcribed in the firſt

there touching the Zones.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>But other Coſmographers comming afterward, not ſatiſfied
with the 5. Zones, becauſe they ſhewe nothing but the ſituation
and the thrée temperatures of the earth, did deuide the earth into
certaine Climes and Paraliels, to find out thereby<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the length of
the day and night in euery place, and the true latitude thereof as
<hi>Ptolomey</hi> and many others after him haue done, making ſuch
diuiſions as we ſhal ſpeake of hereafter. But trulie I think with
<hi>Mercator,</hi> that the beſt and moſt exact way of deuiding the earth
to ſerue all purpoſes is to bee made by degrées and minutes,
wherein is leſſe error than in Climes and Parallels, neither
can Climes or Parallels be ſo well deſcribed when you drawe
night to any of the Poles, for that the ſpaces as well betwixt
<pb facs="tcp:2698:203"/>
the Parallels as betwixt the Meridians doe growe continually
ſtraighter &amp; ſtraighter, as you may ſée in the figure of Parallels
hereafter following.</p>
                     <p>I remember that in the 20. chapter wheras you deſcribed
the 5. Zones, you ſaid that the ancient men did greatly erre in
affirming 3. of the Zones to be vnhabitable, that is, the two
colde Zones and the hot Zone, I pray you therefore ſhew me
here the cauſe why they erred?</p>
                     <p>They erred for lacke of experience, becauſe they had neuer
traueled into thoſe regions, but in theſe latter dayes men of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
nations, ſpecially the Spaniſh, Engliſh, French, &amp; Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
haue trauelled very farre, ſome towards the North pole,
and ſome towardes the South pole, and alſo through the burnt
Zone, for thoſe that ſayle from the North parres towardes the
South pole, or from the South partes towards the North pole,
muſt néeds paſſe in their voiage through the burnt Zone: and
theſe men doe affirme that they haue found all the 3. Zones, that
is to ſay, the two cold and hotte Zones to be well inhabited. And
our late Coſmographers doe not let to render cauſe why they
ſhould be habitable, for (ſay they) though the cold be very extream
in thoſe regions that lie next vnto the Poles, yet the Sun appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and giuing ſhine vnto them both day and night, doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
qualifie and moderate the extreame cold of thoſe regions. But
truly, in mine opinion, they haue ſmall comfort of the Sun, ſith it
ſtriketh almoſt round about their féet, without yéelding any warm
reflexe from aboue, and eſpecially to thoſe that doe inhabite nigh
to either of the Poles. Againe, they ſay that the burnt Zone is
habitable, by reaſon that the night to them is continually as long
as the day, the cooleneſſe whereof doth greatly refreſh the extream
heat of the day. But now let vs returne to our purpoſe, and ſpeak
ſomewhat of the Climes and Parallels, &amp; becauſe euery Clime

called of the old men <hi>Dia Boriſthenes,</hi> notwithſtanding the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
writers thinke that it may be more rightly called <hi>Dia Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tou,
Pontus</hi> is both a Sea and Country lying Eaſtwarde right
againſt <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The ſeuenth Clime is called of the olde
men <hi>Dia Ripheos,</hi> but of the moderne writers <hi>Dia Boriſthenes</hi>
which is a great flood of <hi>Scithia</hi> in the South part of <hi>Sarmatia,</hi>
which falleth into the ſea called <hi>Mare Euxinum.</hi> To theſe ſeuen
Climes <hi>Appian</hi> addeth two others, ſo as in all he ſetteth downe
nine Climes, making the eight Clime to paſſe through <hi>Ripheos</hi>
which are mountaines enuironing <hi>Sarmatia</hi> on the North ſide,
and the ninth through <hi>Denmarke.</hi>

                     <p>The ſelfe ſame that the Northerne Climes haue, ſauing that
they put before euery ſuch name this Gréeke word <hi>Anti,</hi> which is
as much to ſay as Contrarie or Right againſt, as <hi>Anti Meroes,
Anti Syenes,</hi> &amp;c. as you may eaſily perceiue by this figure of
Climes here following, notwithſtanding none of thoſe Southern
Climes were knowne to <hi>Ptolomie</hi> more then <hi>Anti-meroes,</hi>
and hardly all that, the furtheſt part whereof hath not twentie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées

May not the North and South part of the world ech of them
be deuided into more then 9. Climes?</p>
                     <p>Yes indéede as our latter writers affirme, for betwixt the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall
and the 66. degrée and 30′· of Latitude in which the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
day containeth full 24. houres without hauing any night,
they make 48. Parallels, and thereby 24. Climes, for euery
Clime containeth two Parallels, and euery Parallell maketh
the day to increaſe by one quarter of an houre as hath béene ſaide
before. But from thence forth, though you may continue the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels
almoſte to the very pole, yet you can make no more but
24. Climes by reaſon that the ſpaces of the Parallels towardes
either of the Poles, do grow more narrow euery one then other,
ſo as from 66. degrées and 30. minutes of Latitude vnder which
the Circle Arctique paſſeth, the longeſt day is not to be counted
any more by houres, but by whole dayes, wéekes, and monethes,
in ſo much as they which dwell right vnder the North pole,
whoſe Zenith is the pole it ſelfe, haue ſixe monethes day whilſt
the Sunne abideth in the ſixe Northerne ſignes, and 6. moneths
night, the Sunne being in the ſixe Southerne ſignes. And contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe
they that dwell right vnder the South pole haue 6. months
day, the Sunne being in the 6. Southerne ſignes, and 6. months
night whileſt the Sunne remaineth in the 6. Northerne ſignes.
But becauſe I thinke it a more readie way to account the length
of the day by the degrées of Latitude, then by Climes or Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels,
I thought good here to ſet downe <hi>Orontius</hi> his Table made
for that purpoſe, which from the 67. degrée of Latitude to the
North pole agréeth in all points with the Table of <hi>Iohannes de
Sacro Buſto,</hi> in which Table from the ſaide 67. degrée is not
onely ſet downe the longeſt day, but alſo what portion of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaque
alwaies appeareth aboue the Horizon, which portion when
it containeth one whole ſigne, then the day is one moneth long,
and the night as much, if two ſignes, then the day is two months
long and the night as much, and ſo foorth ſucceſſiuely vntill you
come to 6 ſignes, which is the one halfe of the Zodiaque, making
both day and night ech of them ſixe monethes long, as I haue
ſaide before, and as you may plainely ſée with your eye by placing
the Spheare on his Horizon at euery ſuch Latitude.</p>

                        <p>The breadth is to be knowne by multiplying the degrées of
difference contained betwixt the beginning &amp; end of euery Clime
by 60. miles: And if the degrées of difference haue any minutes
annexed thereunto, then you muſt adde ſo many miles as there be
minutes, to the product of the former multiplication. Nowe to
haue the length of euery Clime, you muſt ſéeke to knowe by the
Table of miles, how many miles be anſwerable to one degrée of
that Parallell of Latitude which paſſeth through the midſt of the
Clime, and by that number of miles multiply 360. and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
thereof ſhall be the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> length. But if the degrées of that Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
haue any minutes annexed thereunto, then you muſt finde
out the miles of thoſe minutes by the rule of proportion in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus: if 60. doe require ſo many miles as you founde in the
Table of miles, what ſhall ſo many minutes require, and adde
the quotient thereof to the product of the former multiplication,
ſo ſhall you haue the true length of the Clime, all which thinges
are obſerued in the foreſaid Table, which Table by obſeruing like

the moſt part to their féete then to their heads, for the pole is their

by reaſon that the ſunne mounting no higher aboue their Horizon

the firſt, ſecond or third Rombe from North, from Eaſt, South,

of Mercator, that is to ſay, of the Terreſtriall Globe,
and of the Celeſtiall Globe, and of either of them,
together with the moſt neceſſary vſes thereof,
and firſt of the Terreſtriall Globe,
written by M. Blundeuill.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Terreſtriall Globe is a round body co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
with an vniuerſall Map containing
both ſea and land, which is deuided by the
later Coſmographers into foure princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
parts, that is, <hi>Europe, Affrique, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
and <hi>America,</hi> the Longitude and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of euery which part is alreadie ſet
down in my deſcription of vniuerſal Maps
and Cards. And in this Globe are alſo ſet downe certaine ſtars,
ſome towards either of the poles, &amp; ſome nigh to the Ecliptique
line, whereof we ſhall ſpeake hereafter when we come to treate of
the Celeſtiall Globe. But you haue to vnderſtand that the one end
of this Globe is called the pole Arctique, that is to ſay, the North
pole, and the other ende the pole Antarctique, that is to ſay, the
South pole: vpon which two poles it is turned about. And this
Globe is traced with certaine circular lines, whereof ſome be
greater and ſome leſſer, thoſe greater which paſſe through both
the poles, are called Meridians of this word <hi>Meridies,</hi> which is
as much to ſay as noonetide, for when the Sunne toucheth anie of
thoſe Circles, it is noonetide to all thoſe that dwell right vnder
that Circle, of which Meridians though you may imagine to bée
halfe ſo many as there be degrées in the Equinoctiall, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth
to the number of 180. yet there are ſet downe in this
Globe no more but twelue which doe cut the Equinoctiall in 24.
points, making thereby 24. ſpaces, euery ſpace containing 15.
<pb facs="tcp:2698:216"/>
degrées of the Equinoctiall, which fiftéene degrées doe make
one houre, for the Equinoctiall is a great Circle which guir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Globe in the very middeſt betwixt the two Poles, and
repreſenting the motion of the firſt mooueable, maketh his dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reuolution from Eaſt to Weſt in foure and twentie houres.
And this great Circle by deuiding the Globe into two equall
parts, cauſeth the ſame to haue two Latitudes or breadthes, the
one Northerne and the other Southerne, for that ſpace of the
halfe Globe which lyeth betwixt the Equinoctiall and the North
pole, is called the North Latitude, and the other halfe of the
Globe which lyeth betwixt the Equinoctiall and the South pole,
is called the South Latitude, ech Latitude contayning euerie
where from the Equinoctiall to either of the Poles nintie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées.
Againe this Circle is deuided into 360. degrées contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the whole Longitude of the earth, and euery degrée is 60.
Italian miles, which being multiplied into 360. maketh in all
21600. miles, and ſuch Longitude is to be counted from Weſt
to Eaſt, beginning the ſame at the firſt Meridian which paſſeth
through the Iles of <hi>Canaria,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Inſulae fortunatae,</hi>
croſſing the Equinoctiall and the Ecliptique line, in the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée
of <hi>Aries,</hi> and alſo in the firſt degrée of <hi>Libra,</hi> which are the
two Equinoctiall points, ſo as the one halfe of the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
which goeth from Weſt to Eaſt, containeth 180. degrées,
and the other halfe returning againe from Eaſt to Weſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth
alſo 180. degrées, which maketh in all 360. degrées, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
where the firſt degrée of Longitude did beginne: For
though <hi>Mercator</hi> and others in their ſeuerall Mappes doe in
theſe dayes make the firſt Meridian to paſſe through the Iles
<hi>Azores</hi> which are fiue degrées more to the Weſt. Yet <hi>Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
in his great Terreſtriall Globe dedicated firſt to the Lorde
<hi>Granuella,</hi> and afterwardes to the Emperour Charles the fift,
<hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1541. placeth the firſt Meridian as before is ſaid,
both whoſe Globes my Worſhipfull friend Sir <hi>Thomas Kny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet</hi>
of <hi>Aſhwelthorpe</hi> Knight, did courteouſly lend me I thanke
him, who as he is very well learned in all the liberall Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
himſelfe, ſo is hee a great fauourer and furtherer of all
ſuch as delight in any learned or vertuous exerciſe: And by
helpe of thoſe Globes I wrote this Treatiſe. But to returne
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2698:216"/>
to my matter, there is another great ſlooping and ouerthwart
Circle, called the Ecliptique line, vnder which the Sunne
continually walketh, and this line is marked with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of the twelue ſignes, euery ſigne containing in length
thirtie ſuch degrées as the Equinoctiall hath, ſo as in all, the
Ecliptique line containeth 360. degrées, which is the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of heauen, and the firſt degree of the Longitude of anie
ſtarre beginneth at the firſt point of <hi>Aries,</hi> and endeth at the
ſame point. Nowe of the leſſer Circles there be foure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall,
that is, the two Tropiques, that is to ſay, the Tropique
of <hi>Cancer</hi> towardes the North pole, and the Tropique of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorne</hi>
towardes the South pole, betwixt which two Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piques,
the Sunne continually goeth right vnder the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide
Ecliptique line, neuer mounting higher then the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pique
of <hi>Cancer,</hi> nor deſcending lower then the Tropique of
<hi>Capricorne.</hi> Of the other two leſſer Circles, the one is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Circle Arctique enuironing the North Pole, and the
other the Circle Antarctique enuironing the South Pole: all
which foure Circles are called Parallels, that is to ſaye, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
diſtant one from another, and by reaſon of theſe foure
Circles, the Globe is deuided into fiue Zones, that is to ſay,
two colde Zones, two temperate, and one extremely hotte: of
the cold Zones, the one lyeth betwixt the Circle Antarctique,
and the South pole, and the other betwixt the Circle Arctique
and the North pole.</p>
                  <p>And of the temperate Zones, the one lyeth betwixt the
Tropique of <hi>Cancer</hi> and the Circle Arctique, and the other
lyeth betwixt the Tropique of <hi>Capricorne</hi> and the Circle
Antarctique. The hotte Zone is that which lyeth betwixt the
two Tropiques, through the middeſt of which Zone paſſeth
the foreſayde Equinoctiall line, right vnder which, they that
dwell, haue no Latitude at all, and therefore their dayes and
nightes are alwayes equall, (that is to ſaye) twelue howres
day, and twelue houres night. Alſo beſides theſe foure fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde
leſſer Circles or Parallels, the Globe is traced with
eight other Parallel Circles on each ſide of the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
towards eyther of the Poles, making on each ſide nine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
ſpaces, euery ſpace contayning tenne degrees of the
<pb facs="tcp:2698:217"/>
Equinoctiall, ſo as they doe make in all 90. degrées, which is a
quarter of the great Circle. Moreouer there be certaine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
Compaſſes deuided into 32. circular lines, ſignifying the
32. winds, whereby Marmers doe ſaile, and do direct their ſhips
from port to port, which lines doe diuerſely croſſe the other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
before rehearſed. Beſides theſe circular lines before deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
there is faſtned vnto the two poles of the Globe, a Meridian
of braſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called the mooueable Meridian within the which
the Globe turneth about, &amp; this Meridian is deuided into foure
quarters euery quarter containing 90. degrées, ſo as the whole
circuit thereof is 360. degrées, one of which quarters towardes
the North pole is deuided with circular lines into thrée ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſpaces, in the firſt and loweſt whereof being next to the
bodie of the Globe, are ſet downe the numbers of degrées of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.
In the next ſpace aboue that, are grauen the Parallels
and numbers of houres of the longeſt day in euery Latitude, and
the ſpaces of euery houre are deuided with little ſtréeks into foure
parts, ſignifying the foure quarters of an houre: and theſe houres
doe encreaſe till you come to 24. houres, and from thence the day
incereaſeth by monethes, from one to ſixe, ouer which is grauen
this Latine word <hi>Menſes,</hi> (that is to ſay) monethes, and the third
and vppermoſt ſpace containeth the Climes, beginning at one,
and ſo procéedeth to 8. The like Climes, Parallels, and houres
of the longeſt day, are to be accounted, alſo in the ſaid Brazen me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
procéeding from the Equinoctial towards the South pole,
though they be not there ſet downe. And vpon this Brazen meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
is placed at the North pole another little brazen Circle, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his Index called the houre whéele, euery halfe wherof
containeth twelue houres, the Index of which whéele being ſet
vppon the North pole turneth about as the Globe turneth, and
yet you muſt imagine the Pole it ſelfe to be immooueable. Alſo
there is a quarter Circle of thinne braſſe plate, deuided into 90.
degrées faſtened in ſuch ſort vppon the brazen Meridian, as you
may remooue it too and fro, yea and alſo take it cleane off if you
will, which quarter Circle hath a ſquare head of braſſe, ſignifying
the Zenith or verticall point of any place, and this Circle is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the quarter of altitude, which quarter is deuided into 90. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées,
procéeding from the Horizon vpward to the Zenith, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:2698:217"/>
may be deſcribed vpon the Globe the 90. Almicanterathes or
Circles of Altitude. And this quarter ſerueth for diuerſe purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as to finde out thereby the Altitude of any ſtarre or point of
the Ecliptique line, or of any other point in heauen, and the very
edge thereof on the right hand, ſheweth the Azimuth or verticall
Circle of any place, and in what coaſt and part of heauen any ſtar
is. Alſo how any place of the earth beareth one from another as
you ſhall more plainely perceiue hereafter by the examples of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
propoſitions thereto belonging. Then there is another
Circle of braſſe plate ſomewhat thicker called the ſemi-Circle of
poſition, which ſerueth chiefely for matters of Aſtronomie, as to
finde out the twelue houſes of heauen, and is to be faſtned on the
Horizon, ſo as it may be remooued and ſet vpon which ſide of the
Globe you will. Alſo there belongeth to the Globe a little round
ſquire of braſſe, made with right Sphericall Angles, the head
or ſtile whereof is to ſhewe the ſhadowe of the Sunne being ſet
vpon the Globe, in ſtead whereof a néedle being ſet right vp, will
ſometimes ſerue the turne. Finally to the Globe belongeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Circle called the Horizon, which is a broad Circle of wood,
hauing a foote of wood, within which Horizon, the Globe together
with the brazen Meridian is to be ſet at what Altitude you liſt.
And this Horizon is deuided with diuers circular lines into ſeuen
vnequall ſpaces, whereof the firſt and narroweſt ſpace next vnto
the bodie of the Globe, containeth the degrées of the 12. ſignes of
the Zodiaque, euery ſigne containing 30. degrées. The ſeconde
ſpace containeth the Characters and names of the ſaid ſigns, and
alſo the number of the degrées, as 10. 20. 30. The third the daies
of euery moneth. The fourth the names of euery moneth, and of
certaine Feſtiuall daies. The fift, the names of the 12. windes,
which the ancient Gréekes and Romaines were woont to obſerue,
whereof I haue alreadie ſpoken in my Spheare. The ſixth and
ſeuenth do ſhew the 12. houſes, together with their ſignifications
neceſſarie for the ſetting of figures and calculating of natiuities,
and in the foote of the ſaid Horizon is a little Compaſſe with a née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
to ſhew the North and South, according to which the Globe
is to be placed. But yet not before the ſaid néedle be truely recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
according to the variation which it hath in that place where
you are to vſe the Globe: for otherwiſe the néedle may cauſe great
<pb facs="tcp:2698:218"/>
error, whereof we ſhall treate in the next Chapter. Thus hauing
briefely deſcribed the Terreſtriall Globe, and all the parts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I thinke it good now to ſhew you how to place the Globe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the foure quarters of the world.</p>

the 7. chapter. which vndoubtedlie is a moſt certaine
way, by which you ſhall finde thrée thinges at one inſtant, that
is, the true Meridian, the variation of the néedle, and the true
latitude of any place. But if you haue not the inſtrument of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation,
by helpe whereof this matter is to bée accompliſhed, then
in ſome open place betwixt 8. and 9. of the clocke in the forenoon
or ſooner, vpon a ſmooth table or plancke, ſtanding leuell, draw
a good large circle with your Compaſſes, in the Center where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
muſt be fixed a round and ſtraight pinne of Iron or Latton
wyer, in length a good deal ſhorter than the ſemidiameter of that
circle, and to the intent that the pinne or ſtile may ſtande right
vp, without inclining on either ſide, it would be rectified by a
true Squire: That done, waite diligently vntill the ſhadow of
the pinne head doe iuſtlie touch the circumference of the circle, ſo
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:2698:220"/>
as it neyther paſſe beyond the circle, nor come ſhort of the ſame,
and there make a pricke, and ſo let it ſtay vntill about thrée of the
clocke in the afternoone, about which time the ſhaddow of the pin
will beginne to approch nigh vnto the ſayd circle, and ſo ſoone as
it toucheth the ſame, make there another prick: that done, diuide
the Ark or portion of the circle, contained betwixt thoſe 2. pricks
into two equall parts, and in the middeſt therof ſet another prick,
them laying your ruler to the middle pricke, and to the Center
of the circle, draw a right line through the Center &amp; alſo through
the middle pricke from the one ſide of the circle to the other, and
beyond if you liſt: for you may make the ſaid line of ſuch length
as you ſhall thinke moſt méete to ſerue your turne, and that line
ſhall bee the true Meridian for that place, ſhewing the right
North and South part of your Horizon, and by croſſing the
ſaid liue with another right line in the very middeſt with right
angles, you ſhall haue the true Eaſt and Weſt, and to auoyd long
wayting, you may draw diuerſe circles one within another. Thus
hauing found the true North and South, Eaſt, and Weſt,
place your Globe accordingly, ſo as the brazen Meridian of
the Globe may aunſwere the Meridian line alreadie drawne
vpon the boorde or plancke, and to the intent that afterwarde
you may knowe at all times both day and night, howe to place
your Globe right North and South, it ſhall bée neceſſarie to
drawe a right line vpon the foote of the Horizon, anſwerable
to the foreſaid Meridian firſt drawne vpon the boord or planck,
and vponthat line to faſten a pretie handſome Compaſſe, hauing
a needle of an inch long at the leaſt, which is much more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,

much the North point thereof declineth eyther Eaſt or Weſt
from the true Meridian before faſtned, and whereas you ſee the
Needle to decline, bee it Eaſt or Weſt, there ſet faſt a little
pinne of Latton to ſerue as a marke, whereto you may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
direct the North point of the needle when you would haue
the Globe to ſtand right North and South, for there is no nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
touched with the load ſtone, bee it neuer ſo good a ſtone, but it
wil vary from the true Meridian line, either more or leſſe, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no truſt is to be giuen to the néedle vntil you know the true
<pb facs="tcp:2698:221"/>
variation therof, the finding of which variation, as I ſaid before,
is moſt trulie taught by M. <hi>Borough</hi> in his book before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
wherunto I once againe refer you, and the rather for that it
is written in our mother tongue. But <hi>Gemma Friſius</hi> teacheth
to ſet the Globe right North and South thus, firſt goe into an
open place whereas the Sunne ſhineth, and vpon ſome table
ſtanding leuel, and alſo the Globe ſtanding leuell, the Pole being
eleuated aboue the Horizon according to your latitude, fixe a
right néedle in the degrée of the ſigne, wherein the Sunne is that
day ſo as the nédle may ſtande right vp without inclining anie
maner of way, and if it be in the forenoone, turne the Eaſt ſide of
the Globe towardes the Sunne, moouing both the Globe and
his ſeat to and fro, vntill you ſée the néedle to caſt no ſhaddow
at all, for ſo ſhall the Globe ſtand right North and South. But
if it bee in the afternoone, you muſt turne the Weſt ſide of the
Globe towards the Sun, and then worke as before, and by anie
of theſe wayes before taught you ſhall not onely place the Globe
anſwerable to the foure quarters of the world, but alſo you ſhall
find that the Circles, Poles, and Axletrées of the Globe, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to the Circles, Poles and Axletrees of the heauens.
Now hauing placed your Globe anſwerable to the 4. quarters
of the world, learne to know by ſome Table or moderne Map, or
els by ſuch wayes as are ſet downe both in my Spheare, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in the latter ende of this Treatiſe, the latitude of the region
wherein you dwell: As for example, the latitude of theſe partes
here about <hi>Norwich</hi> is 52. degrées, then taking holde of the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
Meridian aſwell with your left hand aboue the Horizon, as
with your right hand beneath the Horizon, turne the ſame vp and
downe in the nickes of the Horizon, vntill the North pole bee ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated
aboue the Horizon 52. degrées, the laſt of which degrées
muſt méete euen with the vpper brimme of the Horizon, that
done, ſéeke for <hi>England</hi> in the Globe, not leauing to turne the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of the Globe to and fro vntil you haue brought that Meridian
which paſſeth through <hi>England</hi> right vnder the brazen Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
and holding it ſtil at that ſtay, drawe the head of the brazen
quarter of altitude right ouer the place, and ouer that Meridian
vnder which you dwell, ſo ſhall the head of your brazen quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſtande for your Zenith in the verie middeſt of the Horizon
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2698:221"/>
and kéeping al things thus at a ſtay, you may ſée how euery region
or countrey is ſituated, and how it beareth from you, and which
be vnder your Climate and which be not, and to be ſure that the
brazen Zenith may ſtand in his right place, it ſhall be néedfull to
ſet it ſo as the left ſquare ſide therof made with a long notch may
touch the ſelfe ſame degrée of latitude in the brazen Meridian,
which it hath of altitude, for looke how many degrées the Pole is
eleuated aboue the Horizon, which is called the altitude, ſo many
degrées muſt the brazen Zenith be diſtant from the Equinoctial
of the globe, which is called the latitude, and is euer all one with
the altitude of the Pole. Thus hauing ſhewed you howe to place
the Globe according to the foure quarters of the world, I thinke
good now to declare vnto you, firſt the vſes of the terreſtriall
globe, whereof ſome are common alſo to the celeſtiall globe, as
you ſhall perceiue hereafter by the propoſitions following, which
propoſitions may be very well diuided into 3. ſorts, whereof the

which portion in a right Spheare any ſtarre both
riſeth mounteth to the Meridian, and ſetteth: and
in an oblique Spheare it is a portion of the Equator, wherewith
the ſtar is mounted to the Meridian: as for example, in a great
Spheare the ſtar called <hi>Cor Leonis,</hi> that is to ſay, the hart of the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:2698:240"/>
Lion, both riſeth, mounteth and ſetteth with the 145. degr. 30′· of

oblique Spheare, is to be found onely by bringing the ſaid ſtarre
to the Meridian, and you ſhall find it to be all one with the right
aſcention in a right Spheare, for by bringing the ſtarre called
<hi>Cor Leonis</hi> to the Meridian in an oblique Spheare, you ſhall
finde the right aſcention thereof to be all one with that which it

But if you would know the oblique aſcention of any ſtar,
then hauing ſet the Globe at your Latitude, bring the ſtarre to the

to the Eaſt part of the Horizon, &amp; by ſtaying the Globe there,
you ſhall find the 127. degrée of the Equinoctiall to riſe with that

is to lay, the difference betwixt the right and oblique aſcention,
you haue no more to doe but to ſubtract the leſſer out of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the remainder ſhall be the aſcentionall difference, as in
the former example, take 127 degrées out of 145. degrées and 30′
and there ſhall remaine 18. degrées 30′· and that is the aſcentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

oppoſite houſe to the firſt houſe or aſcendent is the 7. houſe which
is the 21. degrée. 30′· of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> for the oppoſite ſigne muſt
alwayes haue like number of degrées, then the oppoſit to the 12.
houſe is the 6. houſe, which the 28. deg of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> and the
oppoſit to the 11. is the 5. houſe, which is the 22. degrée of
<hi>Sagittarius,</hi> and the oppoſite to the 10. houſe is the 4. houſe,
which is the 9. degrée of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and the oppoſite to the 9. houſe

that houre or minute which you ſéeke in the ſayd collum, you
muſt take the next number which is leſſer by one, and ſo make it vp
by adding the firſt and onlie odde one vnto it, and in each common

the firſt place of the Planet anſwering to the day of the moneth
wherein you ſought. All which thinges you ſhall more plainelie

                     <p>Suppoſe then that you would knowe the true place of the
Moone at 5. of the clocke. 17′· in the afternoone the 28. of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
1591. and looking in the Ephemerides you find the place of
the Moone to be the ſame day at noonetide in the 26. degrée 12′· of
<hi>Libra.</hi> and the next day at noontide to be in the 8. deg. 17′· of <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio.</hi>
here by numbring how many degrées are contayned in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptique

leſſer number of minutes out of the greater, you ſhall finde the

to the table of proportionall parts, and there hauing found
the ſaid difference in the front of the 13. page of the ſaid table, look
in the firſt collum on the left hand, for the houres and minutes
according to the rule before ſet downe. As here in this example,
becauſe you cannot find 5. houres, you take foure, right againſt
<pb facs="tcp:2698:250"/>
which on the right hand in the common angle you ſhal find 2. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées
0′· 50″· then for one houre to make the 5. houres, you ſhall
find in the common angle 30′· 12″· that done, ſéeke out the 17′· in
the firſt collum, which number not being there you muſt take 16.
againſt which in the common angle you ſhall find 8′· 3″· 20‴· and
for the one minute which is to be added to 16. you ſhall find in the
common angle againſt that one minute 30″· 12‴· and by adding
all theſe ſummes together, you ſhall find the proportionall part to
be 2. degrées, 39′· 35″· 32‴· which being added to the place of the
Moone at noontyde firſt found in the Ephemerides, maketh in all
28. degrées, 51′· 35″· 32‴· of <hi>Libra,</hi> which is the true place of the
Moone for that houre. But you haue to note that the denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the numbers contained in the common angles of proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
parts be not alwaies like, for when they are to anſwer houres
then the firſt number on the left hand in euery angle ſignifieth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées,
and the reſt minutes &amp; ſeconds, but if they haue to anſwere
minutes of houres, then the firſt numbers doe ſignifie minutes,
and the reſt ſeconds and thirds, as you may eaſilie perceiue by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
the former example. But nowe to returne to my firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
which was to ſhewe you how to find out the true place of
euerie Planet in the Globe, you haue to vnderſtand that hauing
found out the true place of any Planet at the day and houre wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you ſéeke, by ſuch meanes as is before taught, then reſort to the
celeſtiall Globe, and hauing ſet the ſame at your latitude, and
alſo rectified the houre whéele according to the day wherein you
ſéeke. Suppoſe that the 26. of May 1592. you would knowe in
what part of the Globe the Moone is to be found at 5. of the clocke
in the afternoone. Here firſt you muſt knowe her place at noone
the ſame day, which is the 14. degrée, 28′· of <hi>Aries,</hi> and alſo her
place the next day at noone, which is the 29. degrée 0′· of the ſame
ſigne, Now by taking 14. degrées 28′· out of 29. degrées, you ſhal
finde the remainder to bée 14. degrées, 32′· with which difference
you muſt reſorte to the table ſet downe in the 109. page. And by
working as before is taught, you ſhal finde her place or longitude
to be at fiue of the clocke in the 17. degrée 23′· 6″· 43‴· of <hi>Aries,</hi>
which being counted vpon the Ecliptique line of the Globe, lay
your ſemicircle of longitude and latitude to that point, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
learned her latitude by helpe of the Table of latitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:2698:250"/>
mentioned, by which you ſhall find her latitude to be at that
time 4. deg. 46′· to the Southward, then hauing counted that lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
vpon the ſemicircle of lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gitude &amp; latitude, make there a mark
vpon the Globe, for that is her very place at that inſtant that is to
ſay, at 5. of the clocke in the afternoone the 26. day of May 1592</p>
                     <p>Now if you would know when ſhe riſeth and ſetteth, you haue
no more to do but to bring her place before marked on the Globe
vnto the Horizon on the Eaſt part, and the index of the houre
whéele being rectifyed as is before ſaid, will ſhew the houre of her
riſing aboue the Horizon, and by bringing her place to the weſt
part of the Horizon, the Index will ſhew the houre of her ſetting,
and by bringing her place to the brazen Meridian, you ſhal know
at what houre ſhe is full South. The like Tables you ſhall finde
alſo in <hi>Stadius</hi> to find out the true place of euery other Planet at
anie houre, as of <hi>Saturne, Iupiter, Mars, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercurie,</hi>
which Tables doe beginne at the 128. page, and ende at the

is like in euerie reſpect vnto that of the Moone laſt taught. By

his voyage outward, in which voyage hee ſayled in all 6050.
leagues, and from this Bay Sir Frances himſelfe (as I haue
heard) was of very good will to haue ſailed ſtill more Northward,
hoping to find paſſage through the narrow ſea <hi>Anian,</hi> which ſea
is not ſet downe by Maſter <hi>Molineux</hi> in his Terreſtriall Globe
as a ſtraight, but rather as a maine Sea, bearing in bredth 400.
leagues, and ſo from thence to haue taken his courſe Northeaſt,
and ſo to returne by the Iles Crocklande and Groynlande into
England, but his Mariners finding the coaſt of <hi>Noua Albion</hi>
to be very cold, had no good will to ſayle any further Northward,
<pb facs="tcp:2698:254"/>
wherefore Sir Frances was faine to come backe againe South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to <hi>Mondecino,</hi> which (as hath béene ſaid before) is diſtant
from the foreſaide Bay of <hi>Noua Albion</hi> 140. leagues. From
thence he ſayled in a manner right Southeaſt to the Iles <hi>Moluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi>
and touched at the Iles <hi>Terenate, Tidori, Machian,</hi> and
<hi>Motill,</hi> which are nigh vnto the Ile <hi>Gilolo,</hi> which is right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Equinoctiall, amongeſt which Iles he remayned a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
time, of which Ilands the Ile called <hi>Terenate</hi> hauing about
one degrée of North Latitude, is diſtant by that courſe from the
Cape <hi>Mondecino</hi> 1180. leagues, and from thence hee ſayled
Southweſt vntill he came to the Weſt end of the Ile <hi>Iaua maior,</hi>
which hauing in South Latitude nine degrées 30. minutes, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from the Ile <hi>Terenate</hi> by that courſe 530. leagues, and
from thence he ſayled ſtill Southweſt to the Cape <hi>di Buona Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranza,</hi>
which hauing in South Latitude 35. degrées, is diſtant
from <hi>Iaua maior</hi> 1630. leagues, then from <hi>Capo di Buona Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranza</hi>
he making his courſe Northweſt, ſailed to an Iland called
<hi>Serra Liona,</hi> which is vpon the coaſt of <hi>Afrique,</hi> and hauing in
North Latitude 7 degr. 30′· is diſtant from <hi>Capo di Buona Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranza</hi>
1090. leagues, then from thence he ſailed towards the Iles
of <hi>Capo verde</hi> vntil he came to the 12. degrée of North Latitude
right vnder the firſt Meridian, which point is diſtant from the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>Serra Liona</hi> according to that courſe 300. leagues, &amp; from
thence he ſayled Northward nigh to the Iles called <hi>Azores</hi> on
the Weſt ſide therof, which hauing of North Latitude 40. degr.
are diſtant by that courſe from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iles of <hi>Capo verde</hi> 600. leagues
from whence he directed his courſe Northeaſt to Plimouth, which
hauing in North Latitude 51. degr. is diſtant by that courſe from
the <hi>Azores</hi> 490. leagues, ſo as in his returne from <hi>Noua Albion</hi>
to <hi>Plymouth</hi> he ſayled in all 5960. leagues, which if you adde to
the number of leagues of his outward voyage before ſet downe,
which is 6050. leagues, you ſhall finde the totall ſumme of the
leagues to be 12010. leagues, which is almoſt twice ſo much as
the compaſſe of the whole world, which if you meaſure vpon the
Globe by the Equinoctiall line containing 360. degrées, and doe
allow for euery degrée thereof 60. Italian miles, you ſhall finde
the number of ſuch miles to amount to 21600. miles, which by
allowing thrée miles to a league doe make no more but 7200.

Diarie of his whole voyage, ſhewing home much he ſayled in a

Diameter paſſing through the Iles <hi>Azo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
and alſo through the Iles of <hi>Capo verde,</hi>
ſignifieth the firſt Meridian and Axletrée of

the neather end the South pole. And the other ouerthwart Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
ſignifieth the Equinoctiall, &amp; alſo the line of Eaſt &amp; Weſt,
that is to ſay, Eaſt on the right hande, and Weſt on the left hand.
And in this line are ſet downe the degrées of Longitude, which
are to be counted from the foreſaid firſt Meridian vpon the ſaide
Equinoctiall towards your right hande from one degrée to 180.
ſet downe in Arithmeticall figures thus, 10. 20. 30. and ſo foorth
vntill you come to 180. which is the Eaſt Longitude of the world,
and the Weſt Longitude beginneth on your left hand whereas is
ſet downe 190. and then 200. and ſo foorth vntill you come to
360. degrées, which is the whole circuit of the Equinoctiall, and
of the whole earth. And in the firſt Meridian are ſet downe the
degrées of Latitude, which doe procéede from the Equinoctiall
to eyther of the Poles from one degrée to 90. written in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall
figures thus, 5. 10. 15. and ſo foorth to 90. which
degrées doe procéede with equall diſtances from the Equinoctiall

<pb facs="tcp:2698:257"/>

redde inke the two Circles both Arctique &amp; Antarctique, whereof
the circle Arctique paſſeth through the Northernly part of Iſland,
hauing in Latitude 66. degrées 30′· and the Circle Antarctique
paſſeth through the like degrées of Latitude towardes the South
pole, and the diſtance of each of thoſe Circles from eyther Pole is
equall to the greateſt declination of the ſunne. And theſe foure
Circles are Parallels to the Equinoctial, bounding the 5. Zones
that is, the two cold, the two temperate, &amp; the hotte Zone which
lyeth in the midſt of the world betwixt the two Tropiques. And
on the left hand or Weſt part of the Mappe are ſet downe from
the Equinoctiall vpward towards the North pole, what number
of miles and ſecondes of miles doe belong to euery degrée of the
North Latitude, procéeding from the Equinoctiall towards the
North pole: for though that euery degrée of the Equinoctiall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great Circle containeth 60. miles, yet the further that you
goe from the Equinoctiall towards either of the Poles, the leſſer
and leſſer are your Parallel Circles in compaſſe, and therefore
one degrée of euery ſuch Parallel muſt néedes containe the fewer
miles, but becauſe the ſea men doe commonly make their account
on the ſea by leagues, and not by miles: <hi>Plancius</hi> here right vnder
the former Table of miles, ſetteth downe the number of leagues
incident to euery degrée or Parallel, in deſcending from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall
to the South pole, appointing thrée miles to a league,
and therefore he ſetteth downe vppon the very Equinoctiall 20.
leagues, which is 60. miles, and next to that he ſetteth downe 19.
leagues 59′· and ſo procéedeth foorth diminiſhing ſtill the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the leagues, euen till you come to the very South pole, and
on the right hand of the Map hard by the outmoſt Meridian are

Latitude, procéeding aſwell from the Equinoctiall to the North
pole, as alſo from the Equinoctall to the South pole, from 12.
houres to 187. dayes and 7. houres, which maketh the longeſt
day to thoſe that dwell right vnder the North Pole to be halfe a

mentioned, there are ſet downe in this Mappe certaine flyes
of the Mariners Compaſſe, each one containing two and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
lines, which doe ſignifie the two and thirtie rombes or windes
of the Mariners Compaſſe to knowe thereby howe one place
beareth from another, and by what winde the Mariner hath to
ſayle to any place whereunto he would goe: In euery which fly
the line of North and South may ſerue in ſtead of a Meridian,
and the line of Eaſt and Weſt may ſerue as a Parallel, by helpe
whereof you may the more readily take with your Compaſſes
the Longitude and Latitude of any place contained in the Mappe
in ſuch manner as is taught in my firſt Treatiſe of Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
Mappes. Alſo in the very front of his Mappe he ſetteth
downe the numbers of foure and twentie houres, euery houre
containing fiftéene degrées of the Equinoctiall, which houres
doe beginne on the right hande, and ſo procéede to the left, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the twelfth houre is placed at the ende of that Meridian
which paſſeth through the Fortunate Iles. Nowe betwixt the
72. and 86. degrées of North Latitude hee ſetteth downe two
long Ilandes extending from the Weſt towardes the Eaſt
ſomewhat beyonde the firſt Meridian, and from the ſaide Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
more Eaſtwarde he ſetteth downe other two long Ilandes,
affirming that the North Ocean ſea breaking in betwixt theſe
Ilandes with ninetéene gates or entrances, maketh foure ſtraites
and is continually carryed vnder the North Pole, and there is
ſwallowed vp into the bowels of the earth, and he ſayth further
that right vnder the North pole there is a certaine blacke and
moſt high rocke which hath in circuit thirtie and thrée leagues,
which is ninetie and nine miles, and that the long Ilande next
to the Pole on the Weſt is the beſt and moſt healthfull of all the
North partes. Next to the foreſaid Ilandes more Southward
he ſetteth downe the Ilandes of Crockland and Groynelande
making them to haue a farre longer and more ſlender ſhape
then all other mappes doe: At the Eaſt ende of the third long
Ilande, is a ſtraite hauing fiue gates or entrances, which by
reaſon of their narrowneſſe and ſwift courſe of ſtreame are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
frozen, if this be true, I marueile howe any ſhippe durſt
enter through any of thoſe ſtraites to diſcouer the North ſides
<pb facs="tcp:2698:258"/>
of any of thoſe Ilandes, and how and where it came out againe.
Moreouer at the Eaſt ende of the laſt Ilande ſomewhat to the
Southwarde, he placeth the Pole of the Lodeſtone which is
called in Latine <hi>Magnes,</hi> euen as <hi>Mercator</hi> doth in his Mappe
who ſuppoſing the firſt Meridian to paſſe through Saint <hi>Marie</hi>
or Saint <hi>Machaell,</hi> which are two of the outermoſt Ilands of the

fiue degrée of Latitude, but ſuppoſing the firſt Meridian
to paſſe through the Ile <hi>Coruo,</hi> which is the furtheſt Ile of
the <hi>Azores</hi> Weſtwarde, hée placeth the Pole of the Lodeſtone
in the ſeuentie ſeuen degrée of Latitude, I thought good to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Ilands laſt before mentioned from the bodie of the Mappe
as partes belonging rather to the North pole, then to <hi>Europe,
Aſia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>America:</hi> for if <hi>Virgill</hi> did not let to ſay
that Englande was <hi>Penitus excluſa ab orbe,</hi> mee thinkes
that I may much more rightly ſay the like of theſe Ilandes,
notwithſtanding <hi>Plancius</hi> maketh the firſt two long Ilandes,
and alſo Groynelande and Crockelande to be part of <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana,</hi>
which mée thinkes is not méete, ſithe they be deuided
by the North Sea, likewiſe hée maketh the lande which is
vnder the South pole, and is not as yet diſcouered, to bee
part of <hi>Magellanica,</hi> which (in mine opinion) ought not to bée

And although that to the foreſaide Tables or Inſcriptions
<hi>Plancius</hi> hath attributed certaine numbers for the more eaſie
finding out of the ſayde inſcriptions, yet not eaſie inough by
reaſon that one ſelfe number is ſet downe in diuerſe Tables,
and therefore to the intent that you might the more readily

places contained in this Mappe, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
firſt to knowe their Longitudes and Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.
The degrées of Latitude or of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of the Pole, which is all one thing, are
counted from the Equinoctiall to eyther Pole,
which is 90. degrées, and the degrées of Longitude are counted
vpon the Equinoctiall from the Iles of <hi>Capo Verde</hi> towardes
the Eaſt, and ſo round about the earth vntill you come to the
number of 360. degrées. The Prouinces and Townes that are
ſituated vnder one degrée of Longitude, haue at one ſelfe time
like houres of the day, but thoſe that are ſituate vnder diuerſe
degrées of Longitude, doe differ in number of houres, for when
it is in one Towne noonetide, it is in an other Towne that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from thence towardes the Eaſt 30. degrées two of the clocke
in the afternoone, and ſo conſequently for euery 15. degrée of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
they differ one houre. Likewiſe they that dwell vnder one
ſelfe degrée of Latitude haue equall quantitie of dayes and
nightes, but yet ſo as they which dwell on the South ſide of the
Equinoctiall haue the ſhorteſt day when wee haue the longeſt,
and haue Winter when we haue Sommer. But thoſe that are
ſituate vnder diuerſe degrées of Latitude, haue inequalitie of
dayes and nights, for the nigher that any place is ſituate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
any of the Poles the more houres the longeſt day of the
yeare in that place containeth. But thoſe that dwell right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Equinoctiall haue alwayes their dayes and nightes of
like quantitie, and I vnderſtande here by the daye, the ſpace
betwixt the ſunne riſe and the ſunne ſet, and you ſhall finde the
quantitie of the longeſt day of the yeare in euery degrée of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
ſet downe in the Northeaſt part of this Carde. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2698:259"/>
to thoſe that haue 30 degrées of latitude, the longeſt day is
13. houres 57′· and ſo the nigher that you go to the Pole the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is the day, in ſo much as to thoſe that dwell right vnder the
Pole, the yeare is but a day and a night, that is to ſay, they haue 6.
moneths day, &amp; 6. months night. Moreouer the Geographers do
diuide the earth into 9. climes for to diſtinguiſh therby the prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and regions by the quantity of the longeſt day, the middlemoſt
parallel of euery clime increaſing by halfe an houre, and you haue
to conſider that the degrées of latitude are in all places of like big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
euery degrée contayning 15. Almain leagues, or 60. Italian
miles, but the degrées of longitude procéeding from the Equinoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
towards any of the 2. Poles are vnequall, that is to ſay, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one containing fewer leagues or miles than other, but the
degrées of the Equinoctiall it ſelfe are equall to the degrées of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
euerie one containing 15. Germaine leagues or 60. Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
miles, as you may plainly ſée in the Table ſet downe in the
Northweſt part of this Map. And you haue to note that one Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
league doth contain 4. Italian miles, and we haue deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the degrées of longitude in the Southweſt part of this Carde
by the houres of the ſhips way, euery one decreaſing leſſe than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that two ſhips being right vnder the Equinoctiall 150.
degrées diſtant one from another, and are to ſaile with like gate
towards the North pole: when they ſhall come to the 60. degrée
of latitude, their diſtance ſhall be no more but 75. leagues. And
the further they goe towards the Pole the leſſe diſtant they ſhall
be one from another, in ſo much as when they be right vnder the
Pole it ſelf, they ſhall both méete, as you may ſée in the 2. rounde

<pb facs="tcp:2698:267"/>
and eſpecially in Architecture, wherein they excell all others,
they are great louers of learning, and thoſe that doe excell others
therein are promoted to the moſt honourable eſtates: they haue
good municipall lawes, and will ſuffer no Stewes, and they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
that any man ſhall marrie any woman with whome he hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
before in adulterie, and they gréeuouſlie puniſh all offences, &amp;
do forbid idlenes as the mother of manie euils, yea they conſtrain
blind men to get their liuing, by turning with their hands, milles
made to grinde corne, or any other things, and in their warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Tartarians, they get the victorie more by fine polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

But now to the intent that you may the better vnderſtande
all the foreſaide foure rondles, I thinke it not amiſſe to deſcribe
the ſame vnto you, and to ſhew the vſe thereof as followeth. You
haue to note then, that the two vpper rondles: that which is on
the left hand, ſignifieth the Northerne halfe of the celeſtiall Globe
and the other rondle on the right hand, ſignifieth the Southerne
halfe of the ſaid Globe as hath béene ſaid before, and each one of
theſe rondles is traced with certaine circles and lines: The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
Circle whereof being deuided into 360. degrées, and
containing the Characters of the 12. ſignes, ſignifieth the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaque,

the North rondle the circle Arctique, and in the South rondle the

ech rondle is traced with 12. right lines, ſignifying thoſe ſixe
Meridians or lines which paſſing through both the poles of the

the Longitude of euery one of the 12. ſignes, whereby the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaque
hath in Longitude 360. degrées, which Longitude is to be
counted from the firſt point of <hi>Aries</hi> and ſo foorth, according to the
ſucceſſion of the ſignes, and by helpe of theſe lines, you may know
vnder what ſigne any fixed ſtarre is: I ſhal not néede here to ſhew
you, how the ſaid fixed ſtarres are ſituated, in either of the ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
nor how they are named, becauſe their images or ſhapes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with their names, are apparant to your eye. But if you
would know the true place, the Longitude, Latitude, Magnitude
and the nature of any fixed ſtarre herein contained, then do thus:
Firſt to knowe the place and Longitude of any ſtarre, lay a ruler
or extend a thréede, ſo as it may paſſe through the Pole of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaque,
and alſo through the bodie of the ſtarre, whoſe place and

degrée thereof that ſtarre is, for that is his place, and you ſhall
knowe his Longitude by counting from the firſt point of <hi>Aries,</hi>
vnto that degrée, for that is his Longitude.</p>
                     <p>Now to know the Latitude of any ſtarre, you haue to note that
in each rondle there is a certaine right blacke line extending from
the Zodiaque to the Pole, deuided by vnequall ſpaces into 90.
degrées, which line is called the ſkale of the fixed ſtars Latitude,
the vſe whereof is thus: Set the firme foote of your Compaſſes in
the very pole, and extend the other foote into the middeſt of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of that ſtarre whoſe Latitude you ſéeke, and turne that foote
<pb facs="tcp:2698:283"/>
ſtanding at that widenes to the ſkale, and the number of degrées
written vpon the ſkale, if you count from the Zodiaque vpward
towards the Pole, will ſhew you the Latitude of that ſtarre. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
to knowe the magnitude of any ſtarre, <hi>Plancius</hi> ſetteth
down in the North rondle the ſelfe ſame meane which <hi>Mercator</hi>
alſo vſeth in his celeſtiall Globe, that is to ſay, by making certain
ſhapes of ſtarres repreſenting the bigneſſe of euery ſtarre, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his greatneſſe, that by marking &amp; comparing thoſe ſhapes
together, you might finde out, or rather coniecture the greatneſſe
of the ſtarre which you ſéeke. Laſtly he ſheweth the nature of any
ſtarre by ſetting downe nigh vnto the ſtar, the characters of thoſe
Planets, of whoſe nature that ſtarre doth participate, all which
thinges you ſhall more plainely vnderſtande by this example here
following.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe that you would know the place, longitude, latitude,

and there ſéeke out the image <hi>Bootes,</hi> betwixt whoſe legs is
the ſtar called <hi>Arcturus</hi> which you ſéeke. And by extending a thréed
which may paſſe through the pole, and alſo through the bodie of
that ſtarre euen to the Zodiaque, and ſomewhat beyond, you ſhall
find his place to be in the 19. degrée of the ſigne <hi>Libra,</hi> and his

to be 199. degrées, and by obſeruing the rule before giuen, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the knowing of the Latitude of any ſtarre, you ſhall with
your Compaſſe finde the Latitude of this ſtarre to be almoſt 32.
degrées Northward, and by his ſhape you ſhall knowe that hée is
of the firſt magnitude, and the characters of the two Planets
<hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> placed hard by him, do ſhew that he is of their
nature, that is to ſay, by participating of <hi>Mars</hi> he is extremely
hotte and dry, and by participating of <hi>Iupiter</hi> he is hotte &amp; moiſt,
and looke what order is to be obſerued in the North rondle, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the North ſtars, the ſame is likewiſe to be vſed in the South
rondle containing the Southerne ſtarres: Amongeſt which you
may ſée the Images called the Croſſe, whereby moſt Pilots in
theſe dayes doe chiefely direct their courſe, being once paſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall
towardes the South pole, which Croſſe, though <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
doth here make to conſiſt of fiue ſtarres, yet I am ſure that
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:2698:283"/>
                        <hi>Martin Cortes</hi> and <hi>Peter Medina,</hi> and all other late writers do

I haue ſet downe in my Treatiſe of Nauigation, according to
the direction of <hi>Peter Medina.</hi> And thoſe that haue trauailed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Indies, doe all affirme that to the Croſſe there doe belong

that <hi>Plancius</hi> doth ſet downe fiue, whereunto perhaps he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the relation of ſome Spaniarde that neuer ſawe them.
Thus hauing deſcribed vnto you the two vpper rondles, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
together the celeſtiall Globe, and alſo ſhewed the vſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I will now deſcribe the two neather rondles, whereof that on
the left hande repreſenteth the North halfe of the Terreſtriall
Globe, &amp; that on the right hand the other halfe of the ſame Globe,
towardes the South.</p>
                     <p>You haue then to vnderſtand that the Centre or middle point
in each rondle, ſignifieth the Pole of the world, that is to ſay, the
North pole in the North rondle, and the South pole in the South
rondle, and vpon each pole are drawne certaine Circles, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
whereof, and furtheſt diſtant from the Pole ſignifieth the
Equinoctiall, which is deuided into 360. degrées, euery degrée
containing 60. miles, which is the whole Longitude of the earth,
from which circle at the end of euery tenth degrée, are drawn cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
right lines to the number of 18. which doe méete in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Pole, and doe ſignifie halfe Meridians, whereof that which
paſſeth through the Iles <hi>Azores,</hi> and alſo the Iles of <hi>Capo Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>
is the firſt Meridian, from whence the longitude of the earth
taketh his beginning, and there alſo endeth: which Meridian in
the rondle on the left hand, is deuided into 90. parts, procéeding
from the Equinoctial to the Pole, ſignifying the North Latitude
of the worlde, the like diuiſion and number of degrées of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
hath alſo the firſt Meridian, in the rondle on the right
hande, ſauing that the ſaide Meridian tendeth vpwarde. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
you haue to vnderſtande, that in each of theſe rondles, are
drawne nine Circles, equally diſtant one from another, called
Parallels, which together with the Equinoctiall, doe make nine
ſpaces, euery ſpace contayning 10. degr. &amp; beſides theſe circles,
there are drawne in ech rondle two other circles, the one greater,
&amp; the other leſſer, the greater in the rondle on the left hand being
<pb facs="tcp:2698:284"/>
diſtant from the Equinoctiall 23. degrées 30′· which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
declination of the ſunne, is called the Tropique of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and
the leſſer Circle being of like diſtance from the pole, is called the
Circle Arctique, but the greater circle being of like diſtance from
the Equinoctiall, in the rondle on the right hand, is called the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pique
of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> and the leſſer circle in the ſaid rondle inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roning
the Pole, is called the Circle Antarctique vpon which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
in each rondle you ſhall finde their names written. The chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
vſes of theſe two rondles are theſe: firſt to finde out the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude
of any place, ſecondly the Latitude, and thirdly the diſtance
betwixt any two places.</p>
                     <p>To finde out the Longitude of any place, you muſt doe thus:
Extende a thréede, ſo as it may paſſe through the pole, and alſo
through the place whoſe longitude you ſéeke, euen to the very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial,
and ſomewhat beyond, and holding the thréed ſtraight,
the numbers of the degrées written vpon the Equinoctiall will
ſhewe the longitude of the place.</p>
                     <p>And if you wil know the latitude of that place, or of any other,
doe thus, Set the one foote of your compaſſe in the very pole, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the other to the place whoſe Latitude you ſéeke, and kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
your compaſſe at that wideneſſe, bring the mooueable foote to
the firſt Meridian, whereon the degrées of latitude are marked,
and there ſtaying it, the number of the degrées, counting from
the Equinoctiall vpward towards the pole, will ſhewe the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the place. As for example, ſuppoſe that you would know
the longitude and latitude of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> which is a famous towne
in Portingale, here hauing firſt found out that towne in Spaine,
which is nigh vnto the Weſt Ocean, extende your thréede from
the pole through the middeſt of that Towne to the Equinoctiall
and ſomewhat beyond, and you ſhall finde that the thréed will cut
the Equinoctiall in the 13. degrée, which is the Longitude of
<hi>Lisbone.</hi> Nowe if you would knowe the Latitude of the ſame
place, ſet the one foote of your compaſſe in the Pole, and extende
the other foote to <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and kéeping your compaſſe at that
wideneſſe, bring the mooueable foote to the ſkale of latitude, and
ſo you ſhall find that <hi>Lisbone</hi> hath in North latitude 38. degrées
and 30′· Now to knowe the diſtance betwixt any two places doe
thus, Set the one foote of your compaſſe in the one place, and the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:2698:284"/>
other foote in the other place, and apply that wideneſſe to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall,
and looke howe many degrées of the Equinoctiall
that wideneſſe comprehendeth, and by allowing 60. Italian miles
to euery degree, you ſhall haue the diſtance by a right line, betwixt
thoſe two places, for by doing thus, you ſhall finde the diſtance
betwixt <hi>Lisbone</hi> &amp; <hi>Compoſtella</hi> to be 120. miles. Thus I haue
ſufficiently (I hope) expounded euery thing contained in <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
his Map, his general ſkale made for the ſame onely excepted,
whereof I come now to ſpeake. In this ſkale are ſet downe the
miles of Ruſſia, of Italy, of Englande, of Scotland, the French
leagues, the houre leagues, the Spaniſh leagues, the Germaine
and Garſcoyne miles, which two are all one, the miles of Sweuia
in Germanie, of Scandia and of Swethland, which laſt three are
likewiſe all one, the vſe of which ſkale is thus. Take with your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
the diſtance betwixt any 2. places which you deſire to know,
and apply the ſame to the ſkale of ſuch miles as you would know,
&amp; ſo many miles the two places ſhal be diſtant one from another as
the number of the ſkale doth ſhew: but if the diſtance betwixt the
two places be longer then the ſkale, then hauing firſt taken the
whole length of the ſkale with your compaſſes, looke howe manie
times that widenes of your compaſſe meaſuring by a right line is
contained in the diſtance betwixt the two places, and if there be
any odde ſpace left, ſtreighten your compaſſe to that odde ſpace, &amp;
apply that to the beginning of the ſkale, and adde the number of
miles which you there find to the firſt great number, ſo ſhall you
haue the totall ſumme. And lo here for each an example: firſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that you would know the diſtance betwixt Cape S. <hi>Marie,</hi> &amp;
Cape <hi>finis terrae,</hi> which are two Capes or headlands in the Weſt
ſide of Spaine, both hauing in a maner one ſelfe Longitude, &amp; do
differ only in latitude by 6. degrées, for the one hath 37. &amp; the other
43. in latitude, which diſtance if you take with your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the one foot in the one place, &amp; the other foote in the other place,
and applying that widenes to the ſkale of Italian miles, you ſhal
find the diſtance to be 390. Italian miles, but if you meaſure the
ſame diſtance according to the Geographicall maner, which is to
allow for euery degree of latitude 60. miles, you ſhal find y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
to be no more but 360. Italian miles. Let your other example be
thus: Suppoſe that you would know the diſtance betwixt <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtella</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:2698:285"/>
in Spaine and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which haue all one
Latitude and doe differ onely in Longitude, heere becauſe the
diſtance betwixt theſe two places is longer then the ſkale, you
muſt take with your compaſſe the whole length of the ſkale, and
then to looke how many times that widenes is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
by a right line) betwixt the two ſaid places, &amp; you ſhall find
that widenes to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended in the diſtance betwixt thoſe two
places thrée times, wherefore if you multiply 840. by 3. it will
make in all 2520. Italian miles. But if (according to the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphicall
kind of meaſuring) you doe multiply the difference of
their Longitudes, which is 43. degrées, by the number of miles,
which is alſo 43. belonging to the Latitude of both places, which
Latitude is alſo very nigh 43. degr. you ſhal find that the diſtance
betwixt thoſe two townes is no more but 1870. Italian miles,
which number of miles is not ſo great as that of the ſkale by 650.
Italian miles. And therefore I can not thinke but that there is
ſome error in the ſkale committed either by the Printer or elſe by
the author through ſome negligence, and not for lacke of ſkill or
knowledge how to make a true ſkale, being ſo excellent a Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher
as the Author by this &amp; other his Maps heretofore made
ſheweth himſelfe to be, or elſe there is ſome greater miſtery ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
then I perhaps doe vnderſtand, for in ſéeking to know the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
betwixt two places differing onely in Latitude, I finde the
ſkale moſt times to agrée with the Geographicall kind of meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
but if the two places do differ either in longitude onely, or
elſe both in longitude and alſo in latitude, then I find the ſkale to
differ very much from the Geographicall kinde of meaſuring,
wherfore I thinke it good briefely here to ſet downe certaine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
waies of finding out the diſtance of two places, differing ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in latitude onely, in longitude only, or in both, which I doe
ſhew alſo at large in the ſecond part of my Spheare, Chap. 14.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F both places haue either Eaſt Longitude or Weſt
Longitude, then ſubtract the leſſer out of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

Northweſt ſide of the Mappe, or by the Table of miles anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to one degrée of euery Latitude ſet downe hereafter in the end
of this Treatiſe: and the product thereof ſhall be the number of
miles whereby the one place is diſtant from the other. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
I finde <hi>Compoſtella</hi> in Spaine and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
both almoſt 43. degrées of North Latitude, to differ only in
Eaſt longitude, for <hi>Compoſtella</hi> hath in Eaſt longitude 13. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées
30′· &amp; <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> hath in Eaſt longitude 56. degrées,
the difference whereof by ſubtracting the leſſer out of the greater
you ſhall finde to be 42. degrées 30′· here if you multiply 42. by
43. miles belonging to one degrée of the foreſaid Latitude 43. you
ſhall finde the product to be 1806. then to finde out the value of
miles for the fraction 30′, by the rule of proportion, you muſt ſay
thus: if 60. require 43. miles what ſhall 30. require, and you
ſhall finde in the quotient 21. miles, which you muſt adde to the
<pb facs="tcp:2698:286"/>
former ſumme 1806. and it will make in all 1827. miles and ½.
which is the true diſtance betwixt the two foreſaid places. But if
the one place haue eaſt Longitude, and the other Weſt Longitude,
then you muſt finde the difference aſwell by Addition as by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.
As for example, ſuppoſe that you would knowe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
betwixt S. <hi>Domingo</hi> in the Ile called <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and a
certaine place in <hi>Afrique</hi> called <hi>Septem montes,</hi> night vnto the
Ocean ſea, both places hauing 18. degrées of North latitude.
And S. <hi>Domingo</hi> hath in Weſt longitude 310. degrées 30′· and
the place called <hi>Septem montes</hi> hath in Eaſt longitude ſeuen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées.
Here you muſt firſt ſubtract 310. degrées 30′· out of 360.
degrées, and there will remaine 49. degrée 30′· whereunto you
muſt adde the Eaſt longitude of <hi>Septem montes,</hi> which is ſeuen
degrées, and it will make in all 56. degrées 30′· which is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of their Longitude. Nowe if you firſt multiply 56. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées
by 57. miles belonging to 18. degrées of latitude, you ſhal
find the product to be 3192. miles, and to finde out the value of
miles for the fraction 30′· you muſt ſay thus: If 60. require 57.
miles, what ſhall 30′· require, and working by the common rule
of thrée, you ſhall haue in the quotient 28. miles, and there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
30/60. which is one halfe mile. Now by adding 28. miles and ½.
to 3192. it will make in all 3220. miles ½. and that is the true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
betwixt S. <hi>Domingo</hi> and <hi>Septem montes,</hi> but by <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
ſkale you ſhall finde the diſtance to be 3410. miles, which
differeth from the other almoſt 200. miles.</p>

Though it be the common order of working to know by helpe
of the former table, the diſtance of two places differing onely in
Longitude, yet I thinke it a more ſure way to find it out <hi>per Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulas
Sinuum,</hi> the rule whereof is thus.</p>
                     <p>Firſt take the difference of the two Longitudes, by ſubtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the leſſer out of the greater, and the halfe of that ſhall be the
Arch which you haue to ſéeke in the front of the Tables, then mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
the ſine of that Arch by the ſine of the complement of the
common Latitude, and deuide the product thereof by the totall
ſine, the quotient whereof you muſt ſéeke out in the Tables a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt
the ſines, and the Arch of that ſine is the one halfe of the
diſtance, which being doubled ſhall be the whole diſtance contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
degrées of the great Circle, and euery ſuch degrée contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
of Italian miles 60. and of German miles 15. and by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thus you ſhall finde the diſtance betwixt <hi>Compoſtella</hi> and
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to be 1846. Italian miles, ſuppoſing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
latitude to be 43. degrées, and the difference of their longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
to be 42. degrées 30′· And by working by the common ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you ſhall find the diſtance of thoſe two places to be 1827. Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
miles as before, becauſe the common Table hath no minutes
of miles but onely ſeconds, which are not to be accounted of, &amp; in
working by <hi>Appian</hi> his Table hauing minutes of miles, you ſhal
find the ſaid diſtance to be 2184. Italian miles, and by <hi>Mercator</hi>
his Map to be 1980. Italian miles, in whoſe Map the common
Latitude of the ſaid 2. places is 43. &amp; the difference of their lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudes
is 44. 0′· And by the ſkale ſet down in <hi>Plancius</hi> his Map,
you ſhal find the diſtance to be 2520. Italian miles, in which Map
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Latitude of the two foreſaid places is 42. deg. 30′· and
the difference of their Longitudes is alſo 42. degrées 30′· Truely
I muſt néedes confeſſe that it is not ſo eaſie to make a ſkale or
trunke for a Mappe or a Carde drawne in <hi>plano,</hi> as for that
which is drawne vpon a round bodie or Globe: and therefore it
is no maruaile though the ſkales of Mappes drawne in <hi>plano,</hi>
and likewiſe the trunkes ſet downe in the Mariners Cardes doe
not alwayes ſhewe the true diſtance of places, which I beléeue
is to bee done as truely and a great deale more readily by my
friend Maiſter <hi>Wright</hi> his Semicircle before deſcribed, then by
the rules of <hi>Gaſparus Peucerus</hi> in his booke <hi>de dimenſione ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:2698:289"/>
which rules doe depend vpon the knowledge of the quantitie
of the Angles and ſides of Sphericall Triangles, which kinde
of working is indéede more troubleſome and tedious then readie
or pleaſant. But if Maiſter <hi>Wright</hi> would make his Demicir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
an vniuerſall inſtrument to find out thereby all the thrée kinds
of diſtances as he promiſed me to doe, there were no way in mine
opinion worthie to be compared vnto it, neither for the trueneſſe,
eaſineſſe, nor readineſſe of working thereby.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F Aſtrolabes I haue neuer ſeene but
three ſorts, Firſt that of Stofflerus, which
for theſe hundred yeares paſt or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
hath beene had in moſt price and
eſtimation, as an inſtrument containing
all the vſes, or at the leaſt the moſt part
of all other Mathematicall Inſtruments,
which becauſe it requireth almoſt for
euerie ſeuerall Latitude a ſeuerall Table: Gemma Friſius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
ſince another kind of Aſtrolabe, hauing but one Table
to ſerue for all Latitudes, and therefore he called it the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon,</hi>
that is to ſay, an vniuerſall Aſtrolabe, which hath alſo
been moſt eſteemed &amp; vſed many yeres. Since whoſe time, &amp;
of very late yeares, one of our owne countriemen a Gentleman
of Reading beſides London, called M. <hi>Blagraue,</hi> hath greatly
augmented the ſaide <hi>Catholicon,</hi> and hath thereby as it were
newly inuented a third kind of Aſtrolabe, which he calleth the
Mathematicall Iewell, whereby are to be wrought more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
then by any other one inſtrument whatſoeuer, for
which his moſt excellent inuention vſed therein, he deſerueth
great commendation. And to the intent that others which
haue not beene exerciſed in ſuch thinges, might the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
attaine to the better vnderſtanding of the ſaid Iewell: I
haue made a plaine deſcription of all the partes belonging to
the ſaid Iewell, without committing any offence (I hope) to
the Author thereof, to the intent that euery Gentleman might
haue the perfect knowledge and vſe of ſo worthie an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But broade Aſtrolabes though they be thereby the
truer, yet for that they are ſubiect to the force of the winde,
<pb facs="tcp:2698:291"/>
and thereby euer moouing and vnſtable, are nothing meete to
take the altitude of any thing, and ſpecially vppon the Sea,
which thing to auoide, the Spaniards doe commonly make
their Aſtrolabes or Rings narrow and waightie, which for the
moſt part are not much aboue fiue inches broad, and yet doe
waigh at the leaſt foure pound, and to that end the lower part
is made a great deale thicker then the vpper part towards the
ring or handle: Notwithſtanding moſt of our Engliſh Pilots
that be skilfull, doe make their ſea Aſtrolabes or ringes ſixe
or ſeuen inches broad, and therewith very maſsiue and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,
not eaſie to be mooued with euery winde, in which the
ſpaces of the degrees be the larger, and thereby the truer, of
which kinde of Aſtrolabes or Rings, I ſhall ſpeake hereafter
in my Treatiſe of Nauigation, and alſo of the Mariners
Croſſe ſtaffe. But whenſoeuer you haue to take the altitude
of the Sunne or of any other ſtarre be in wandering or fixed,
I would wiſh you to vſe the Mariners heauie and maſſiue
Aſtrolabe, which in mine opinion for that purpoſe, is the
ſitteſt and moſt aſſured inſtrument of all others and to finde
out all other concluſions by helpe of Maiſter <hi>Blagraue</hi> his
Iewell, or rather by helpe of the Celeſtiall Globe, which
for Aſtronomicall matters is the perfecteſt inſtrument of
all, in which are contained all the ſtarres both ſoutherne and
Northerne that haue beene heretofore knowne, and thoſe
that are lately knowne or ſhall be knowne hereafter may be
eaſily placed therein: which thing can not be ſo well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed
in any Aſtrolabe were it neuer ſo great. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Globe is comberſome and not portable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
coſtly, and eſpecially if it bee of any greatneſſe, (for
the greater the better) and alſo if it chance to be broken
in any part of the bodie thereof, it can neuer bee made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
perfectly whole, it is therefore no meete inſtrument
for euery Mariner to haue, but onely for ſuch as be of good
habilitie, in ſteede whereof to finde out manye neceſſarie
concluſions, Maiſter <hi>Blagraue</hi> his Mathematicall Iewell may
ſerue verie well, and ſpecially if it had on the backe parte
the like mater and <hi>Rete</hi> or <hi>Nette,</hi> to ſerue the South Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the worlde as it hath in the fore parte to ſerue the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:2698:291"/>
North latitude, for then I beleeue verilie, that the chiefeſt
Sotherne ſtarre, as the Croſſe, the Southerne Triangle, Noahs

the true longitude, latitude, and declination of the

much more ſerviceable to the ſea men, then nowe it is, by
reaſon that thoſe fewe Southerne Starres that be contained

the North pole, amongſt which Northerne Starres, it
were verie neceſſarie for the Sea men, that the ſeuen prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Starres as well of the great Beare as of the little Beare,
were all dulie placed in his firſt Net. Trulie if Maſter
<hi>Blagraue</hi> his affaires would ſuffer him to take paine herein,
I beleeue that his Iewell ſhould not be much inferiour to
the celeſtiall Globe, which indeede it repreſenteth, and

containeth two principall partes, that is,
the Mater, which is vnmooueable, and the

Mater is enuironed with a great circle,
called the Meridian, paſſing through the
2. Poles of the world marked with the letters <hi>A.B.</hi> and through
the two Solſticiall points of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and <hi>Capricorne</hi> marked

the whole Mater is diuided into foure quarters, that
is, Northeaſt, and Southeaſt, Northweſt and Southweſt. The
Northeaſt quarter lyeth betwixt <hi>Imum Coeli,</hi> and the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

from which you ſhall the more eaſilie finde out any houre

doe ſometime ſignifie euerie one a ſeuerall oblique Horizon,
ſauing that the firſt Meridian or Axletrée ſignifieth the right

15. ſpaces, euery ſpace containing two degrées, which maketh
180. degrées, and béeing doubled, becauſe the ſpaces are to bée
counted doth forward and backward, do make in all 360. degrées,
which is the whole circuit or longitude of the Ecliptique, and
the degrées of the ſaid Ecliptique are larger towards the Limb

of the forenoone, then counting fiftéen degrées downwarde
towards your left hand is ſet down in the foreſaid ſpace the figure

                  <p>But the difficultie of finding out the true aſcendent conſiſteth
in knowing whether it is to be ſought in the Northeaſt quarter, or
in the Southeaſt quarter of the Iewell. The Northeaſt quarter
is that which lyeth betwixt <hi>Imum coeli,</hi> and the North pole or
Eaſt end of the Axletrée, becauſe in this caſe the Axletrée ſignifieth
the line of Eaſt and Weſt, and the Equinoctiall ſignifieth the line
of South and North, at the South end whereof is faſtened the
ringle or handle. But in the former example you may plainely
ſée that the North part of the Zodiaque of the <hi>Rete</hi> doth cut the
Horizon, as well in the Northeaſt quarter as in the Southeaſt
quarter with two ſeueral degrées and ſignes, for in the Northeaſt
quarter the Zodiaque cutteth the Horizon with the firſt of <hi>Cancer</hi>
which is the aſcendent, and in the Southeaſt quarter it cutteth the
Horizon with the eight of <hi>Taurus,</hi> which is not the aſcendent: for
you haue to vnderſtand that euery degrée of the Zodiaque doth
both riſe and ſet either towards the North or towards the South,
the firſt point of <hi>Aries</hi> and of <hi>Libra</hi> onely excepted, both which
do riſe right Eaſt, and goe downe right Weſt, euen as the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall
<pb facs="tcp:2698:311"/>
doth, whereof M. <hi>Blagraue</hi> doth gather a rule how to find
out by his Iewell when the aſcendent is to be ſought either in the
northeaſt quarter of the Mater, or in the ſoutheaſt quarter, which
is thus: The aſcention of any of the ſixe Northerne ſignes is to
be ſought for in the Northeaſt part of the Iewell, &amp; the aſcention
of any of the ſixe Southerne ſignes is to be ſought for in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt
part of the Iewell. For although that the North part of the
Zodiaque of the <hi>Rete</hi> containing the 6. Northerne ſignes cutteth
the Horizon anſwerable to your Latitude, aſwel in the Northeaſt
as in the Southeaſt part of the Iewell, yet you muſt ſéeke the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
in the Northeaſt part, and not in the Southeaſt part of
the Iewell, becauſe that euery degrée of any of the 6. Northerne
ſignes riſeth Northernly: ſo contrariwiſe if the South part of the
Zodiaque containing the ſixe Southerne ſignes doe cut the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
aſwell in the Northeaſt part as in the Southeaſt part of the
Iewel, yet you muſt ſéeke the aſcendent in the Southeaſt part, and
not in the Northeaſt part of the Iewell. As for example, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

treating of the 12. houſes, for hauing them you haue all the reſt.
The order of working according to M. <hi>Blagraue</hi> his rule is thus:
hauing brought the Zenith to the foreſaid Latitude, looke what
Circle of poſition cutteth the Equinoctiall in the firſt 30. degrées
next to the limbe, and you ſhall finde that the 47. Azimuth or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle

then from thence tell vppon the Equinoctiall 30. degrées more,
which do make in all 60. degrées, and through that point you ſhal
finde the 19. Azimuth or Circle of poſition to paſſe, whoſe eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that is, 47. and 32. worke thus: Lay your labell to the

eight houre of the morning, which is 30. degrées diſtant from the

ſhall finde that the 25. degrée 30′· of <hi>Piſces</hi> cutteth the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon

by inſtruction, and ſome onely by experience: for what inſtruction
I pray you wil ſerue to make a good coaſter, that is to ſay, to know
any Cape or Cliffe when he ſéeth it, vnleſſe he hath firſt ſéene it &amp;
hath before taken good markes thereof. Alſo to know the currents
in all places, the deapth and qualities of waters, ſandes, flats, or
ſhoulds, and ſuch like, the perfect knowledge whereof conſiſteth
chiefely in experience. Of which experience I minde not here to
treate, becauſe I knowe that a Dutchman called <hi>Wagoner</hi> or
<hi>Aurigarius</hi> hath lately written of theſe things notably wel, &amp; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for theſe our ſeas and the Northeaſt ſeas, whoſe booke I
doubt not but that ſome of our learned ſea men will ſet foorth in
our mother tongue, with ſome augmentation of their owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
for the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, for the profite of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
and to their owne praiſe &amp; commendation. In the meane time
<pb facs="tcp:2698:315"/>
I will procéede with inſtruction, the chiefe pointes whereof are
theſe here following: firſt to know the vſes of ſuch inſtrumentes
as euery ſkilfull ſea man ought to haue with him that mindeth to
ſayle any long voyage, which are theſe here following: Firſt a
perfect Kalender or Ephemerides, the Mariners ring or Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labe,
the Croſſe-ſtaffe called of the Spaniardes <hi>Balla ſtella,</hi> the
two Globes both Celeſtiall and Terreſtriall: Of all which things
I haue in a manner alreadie written ſeuerall Treatiſes. Item
an vniuerſall Horologe, to knowe thereby the houre of the day
in euery Latitude, and a Nocturnlabe to know thereby the houre
of the night. And it were neceſſarie for him that ſayleth long voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
to carry with him a Topographicall inſtrument to deſcribe
therby thoſe ſtraunge Coaſts &amp; Countries wherby he ſayleth, the
vſe of which inſtrument is plainely taught by <hi>William Borne</hi>
in his booke called the Treaſure of Trauailers, and by Maiſter
<hi>Digges</hi> in his booke called the <hi>Pantometria,</hi> wherefore I ſhall
not néede to ſpeake any further thereof: Alſo the Mariners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe,
whereof I do not only make a plaine deſcription and ſhew
the vſes thereof, but alſo how to finde out the variation of the
ſame, according to the precepts of the beſt moderne writers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And laſtly the Mariners Carde, whereof whileſt I ſpeake,
I doe not onely ſhewe the making thereof, and how to drawe the
Parallels in better ſort then they are vſed to be drawne in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Cardes, but I ſet downe therewith the chiefeſt vſes of the
Card, amongſt which is taught how to know by help of the Card
and certaine Tables made of purpoſe, what way your ſhippe hath
made in ſayling by any rombe or wind, yea in ſailing right Eaſt &amp;
Weſt, which heretofore (as <hi>Cogniet</hi> ſayth) hath béene thought a
thing vnpoſſible to be knowne, but only by coniecture: And being
out of your way how to know in what place you are, &amp; to marke the
ſame in your Card that you may the more readily direct your ſhip
againe to the place whereunto you would go. But all theſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſerue to little purpoſe, vnleſſe you know alſo the North ſtar
with his guards, &amp; diuerſe other ſtars ſituated aſwel towards the
North as towardes the South pole, together with their Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
Latitudes, declinations, and greatneſſe, to knowe thereby
the Latitude of any place, &amp; the houre of the night: alſo the courſe
of the ſunne and his declination, by helpe whereof you may know
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:2698:315"/>
the Latitude of any place, the times and ſeaſons of the yeare,
the houre of the day, and the length of the day and night in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
latitude. And finallie you muſt know the courſe of the Moone,
whereon dependeth the knowledge of the tydes in all places: Of
all which thinges I mind here to treat in ſuch order as the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
hereafter following doe ſhew.</p>

the laſt of October 1592. I finde by the fourth propoſition the

meanes ſhould be the day of the change, but the very day indéed
was the 25. of the ſaid moneth, for the former rule to know the
age of the Moone is not ſo true it ſelfe, but that ſometime it will
fall a day either ouer or vnder. But <hi>Gemma Friſius</hi> teacheth to
find out the day of the change in euery moneth thus. Adde to the
Epact the number of the moneths from the beginning of March
whereof that Moneth wherein you ſéeke the change, muſt be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

which rule I finde to be true ſo long as the ſumme of the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

than 30. which will commonlie chance when the Epact is a
great number, as 26. or 29. he teacheth no rule for that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:2698:319"/>
ouer or vnder, and hauing the day of the change, you ſhall haue
the day of the full by adding 15. dayes more to the day of change:

and in matters of Aſtronomie more trulie by reaſon that the yard

degrée of the yard the ſhadow of the Vane ſtréeketh. Moreouer,
when the Sunne or ſtarre is 50. or 60. degrées high, they are fain
to vſe their Aſtrolabe and not their ſtaffe, which Aſtrolabe in mine

                  <p>The firſt is thus done, hauing put the ſtaffe or yarde through
the ſquare hole of the Tranſame, ſet the end of the yard which is
marked with 90. to your eye, laying that end vpon the vpper point
of your chéeke bone kéeping your legs cloſe together, and hauing
directed the other end of the yard towards the ſunne or ſtar whoſe

at one inſtant, and that degrée of the yard which the ſquare edge of
the Tranſame cutteth, wil ſhew how high the ſunne or ſtarre is at
that preſent: And in taking the altitude of the ſunne or of any ſtar,
remember alwaies to holde the yarde ſo leuell as it may be a iuſt
Parallel to the Horizon, for ſo ſhall you take the altitude the more
truely. Now as touching the ſecond point, which is to knowe
<pb facs="tcp:2698:330"/>
the true diſtance betwixt any two ſtarres you muſt doe thus.</p>
                  <p>Set the end of the yarde marked with ninetie to your eye as

one end of the Tranſame to anſwere the one ſtarre, and the other
end thereof to anſwere the other ſtarre, for that degrée of the yard
which the Tranſame cutteth will ſhewe the diſtance betwixt the
two ſtarres: And if the two ſtarres be ſo nigh together, as they
wil not conueniently anſwere the two ends of the Tranſame, then
you may vſe the two mooueable vanes, which (as I ſaide before)
you may ſet at what wideneſſe you liſt, but yet ſo as they may both

For thoſe are counted beſt which are found in the Eaſt Indies

Now whenſoeuer the wyers are to be touched with this

that the Iron may the more firmelie receiue the vertue of the

of the Lodeſtone the North point of the Compaſſe declineth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
from the true North, either to the Eaſt, or Weſt more or
leſſe according to the latitude of the place wherein you are vnleſſe
you be right vnder the Meridian of the <hi>Azores.</hi> And therefore,
moſt men in theſe partes of the worlde doe vſe to ſet the North

<hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Deepe,</hi> an excellent Pilot, that in ſayling vnder the
Meridian which paſſeth thorough the Iles called the <hi>Azores,</hi>
the néedle doth decline neither Eaſt nor Weſt, whereupon <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi>
by calculating the variation of the Compaſſe at <hi>Ratiſbone,</hi>
found that the Pole of the Lodeſtone ought to be put in that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian

of the Compaſſe at the towne of <hi>Antwerp</hi> to be 9. degrées.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:2698:332"/>
And Maiſter <hi>Borough</hi> by the helpe of the newe inſtrument of
variation firſt made by <hi>Robert Norman,</hi> and afterward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

11. degrées and fiftéene minutes, which is a whole point from

And his greateſt declination is when you come to a
full quarter of that Parallell wherein you ſaile, for from thence
it declineth leſſe and leſſe vntill you come againe vnder the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid

needle declineth on neither ſide, but pointeth right to the North
<pb facs="tcp:2698:333"/>
Pole, and alſo to the Pole of the Lodeſtone. But if you ſayle
Eaſtwarde and arriue to the point <hi>E.</hi> then the right line of the
North is <hi>E. A.</hi> but your néedle declineth on the right hande
towardes his owne Pole <hi>D.</hi> which is to the Eaſt, ſo much as
the angle <hi>A. E. D.</hi> doth ſhewe. Likewiſe if you ſaile from <hi>B.</hi>

<hi>F. A.</hi> but your needle will decline to his owne Pole <hi>D.</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
the Weſt, ſo much as the angle <hi>A. F. D.</hi> doth ſhew.
And to bée ſhort, the néedle doeth neuer ſhewe the right North,
but onelie in <hi>C.</hi> or <hi>B.</hi> to eyther of which pointes the nigher that
you approch the leſſe your néedle declineth, and the more that you
goe from anie of theſe two pointes the more your néedle decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
either Eaſt or Weſt, but the greateſt declination thereof is
in <hi>H.</hi> or <hi>G.</hi> for then you are a iuſt quarter from the foreſaide
Meridian. Alſo by this Figure he plainelie ſheweth that of two
ſundrie townes hauing one ſelfe Meridian, that which is néereſt
to the Pole of the worlde hath greateſt declination. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
ſuppoſe the letter <hi>I.</hi> in the foreſaide Figure to ſignifie
that towne which is nigher to the Pole, and the letter <hi>E.</hi> to
ſignifie that towne which is more diſtant from the Pole, both
townes béeing vnder one ſelfe Meridian <hi>E. A.</hi> Here you ſée
that the Néedle being in <hi>E.</hi> doth ſhewe the Pole of the Lodeſtone
by the line <hi>E. D.</hi> and béeing in <hi>I.</hi> it ſheweth the Pole of the Lode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
by the line <hi>I. D.</hi> Nowe according to the doctrine of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyde,</hi>
the angle <hi>A. I. D.</hi> is greater than the angle <hi>A. E. D.</hi>
whereby it followeth that the néedle declineth more in <hi>I.</hi> than
in <hi>E.</hi> But whereas <hi>Mercator</hi> affirmeth that there ſhould bée a
mine or great rocke of Adamant, whereunto all other leſſer
rockes or néedles touched with the Lodeſtone doe incline as to
their chiefe fountaine, that opinion ſéemeth to mée verie ſtrange,
for truelie I rather beléeue with <hi>Robert Norman,</hi> that the
properties of the ſtone, as well in drawing ſtéele, as in ſhewing
the north Pole, are ſecrete vertues giuen of God to that ſtone
for mans neceſſarie vſe and behoofe, of which ſecrete vertues no

diuers wayes how to finde out the variation of the
Compaſſe, as well by the Sun in the day time, as by
the North ſtarre in the night ſeaſon. Firſt, thus mark
at what point of the Compaſſe the Sunne riſeth and
ſetteth, for if hee riſeth at the Eaſt point of the Compaſſe, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
down at the Weſt Northweſt point, then the Compaſſe is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
one whole point, that is to ſay, the North point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
ſtandeth North and by Eaſt. But becauſe the aire is ſeldom
cleare at the riſing and ſetting of the Sunne, you may do thus,
take with your Aſtrolabe or croſſe ſtaffe the altitude of the Sun in
the forenoone, the ſooner the better, at ſome iuſt point of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe,
&amp; take again his altitude in the afternoone, when he is in like
degrée of altitude, and mark therwith at what point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
the Sunne hath ſuch altitude, and by the difference thereof
you ſhall know the variation of the Compaſſe. As for example,
you finde by your Aſtrolabe or croſſe ſtaffe, that the Sunne is 20.
degrées high at the Southeaſt point of the Compaſſe, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the ſame againe in the afternoone you finde his height to bée
20. degrées at the Weſt Southweſt point of the Compas, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you ſée that the compaſſe is varied one whole point, that is to
ſay, that the North point ſtandeth North and by Eaſt, and the
South point is South and by Weſt. He teacheth it alſo another
way, which is thus.</p>
                  <p>Take with your croſſe ſtaffe or Aſtrolabe the height of the Sun
at noontyde, which is called the Meridian altitude of the Sun,
and thereby you ſhall haue the true Meridian of the place where
you are, with which Meridian if the South point of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
doth agrée, then your Compas hath no variation at al, but if
the ſouth point therof do ſwarue or incline on either ſide from the
ſaid Meridian, marke how much it differeth, and that difference
will ſhewe you the variation. Nowe to knowe the variation of the
Compaſſe by the North ſtarre, doe thus, ſet your Compaſſe with
the North ſtarre, and if you finde them to agrée, then there is no
<pb facs="tcp:2698:334"/>
variation, but note that this is to be done when the two guardes
or pointers of <hi>Charles waine</hi> are right ouer or right vnder the
North ſtarre, for if theſe two ſtarres be Weſt from the North
ſtar, then the North ſtar is a third part of a point vnto the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the North Pole, and if the ſaid two ſtarres be right Eaſt
from the North ſtarre, then the North ſtarre is a thirde part of a
point vnto the Weſtward of the north Pole.</p>
                  <p>The compaſſe (as <hi>Bourne</hi> ſaith) doth varie moſt in ſayling
long voyages Eaſt and Weſt, and though it varieth two or thrée
points, yet you may know what courſe to holde without alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Wiers any maner of way. As for example, ſuppoſe the
Northeaſt point to ſtand right North, and your courſe is to goe
right Weſt, here in this caſe you may vſe the Southweſt point in
ſtead of the Weſt point, whereby you may perceiue that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no great matter which point ſtandeth due North, ſo as you
take that point of the Compaſſe for the North which directly
pointeth to the North. But <hi>Robert Norman</hi> and Maſter <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>
by the help of their new inuented Inſtrument of variation,
doe ſhewe how to finde out the variation of the Compaſſe much
more exactlie than euer it hath bene heretofore taught, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
together with the booke, I would wiſh all ſea men to
haue, and therby to learne the perfect vſe of the inſtrument, which
vſe that booke teacheth both plainlie and learnedlie, in which booke
is alſo prooued by diuers demonſtrations that there is no ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiue
point as ſome haue dreamed, but rather a reſpectiue
point whereunto the néedle of your Compaſſe wil alwayes turne
in what part of the world ſoeuer you ſaile. But of the place where
that reſpectiue point ſhould be, diuers learned Pilottes haue
had diuers opinions, for ſome haue imagined it to be in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
and ſome aboue the heauens, if it were in the heauens, then
the néedle would dayly turne about, and alter according to the
motion of that heauen, wherein the ſaid point is, which is nothing
ſo. And to bée aboue the heauens, it is contrarie to the old rule
of Philoſophie, which ſaith that <hi>Extra Coelum non eſt locus,</hi>
and therefore <hi>Norman</hi> and Maiſter <hi>Borough</hi> haue great reaſon
to ſay that it is in the bodie of the earth beneath the Horizon,
for they haue tried by diuers liuely experiments that the North
parte of the néedle of his owne accorde and nature would alwaies
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:2698:334"/>
decline downwarde if it be not otherwiſe counterpoiſed or letted,
&amp; by their demonſtrations ſuppoſing the Meridian of the Azores
to be the firſt or common Meridian, and alſo knowing the altitude
of the Pole at <hi>London</hi> to be 51. degrées, 32. minutes, they find
that according to that latitude the Pole of the Lodeſtone, béeing
in the vpper face of the earth, and right vnder the foreſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Meridian is 25. degrées 44. minutes diſtant from the Pole
of the worlde. And the point reſpectiue to bee diſtant in a right
line from vnder the Horizon of <hi>London</hi> 71. degrées, 50 minutes
and the variation of the Compaſſe to be as hath bene ſaid before,
11. degrées and 15. minutes, but to find out the true place of the
reſpectiue point in euerie latitude, they ſay that no certaine rules
can as yet be ſet downe, by reaſon that the compaſſe doeth vary
more ſodenly in one place than in another, for in ſome place it will
varie more in ſailing 200. leagues than in another place in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
400. leagues. Againe, it will ſometimes be retrograde, for
M. <hi>Borough</hi> in ſayling betwixt the North Cape and <hi>Vaigates,</hi>
towards the Northeaſt, and looking by his computation that the
néedle ſhould haue increaſed his variation towards the Eaſt, hée
found that it was ſodainly turned backward towarde the Weſt,
notwithſtanding both <hi>Norman</hi> and M. <hi>Borough</hi> doe affirme that
though the Compaſſe hath in ſeuerall Horizons ſeuerall variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet in any one Horizon the néedle alwaies reſpecteth one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
point without alteration, and that in his declining it kéepeth
the like order and that certainlie in euery place. And although the
néedle of the Compaſſe by reaſon of the waightines of the Flie
cannot decline downward according to his own propertie, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ſheweth the point reſpectiue alwayes vpon the Horizon, which
indéed, as they ſay, is moſt neceſſarie for nauigation, yet by ſuch
meanes and concluſions as are ſet down in the foreſaid book, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Pilot hauing with him a perfect ſtone may by exact obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations
find out the increaſing or decreaſing of the declnation of
the néedle, which declination you ſhall find, as they thinke to bée
more or leſſe according as the point reſpectiue is more or leſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from the place whereas the triall is made, which being dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
obſerued in ſundrie places, with the certaine variation of
the néedle from the Meridian, the true place of the point reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
may be found out as they thinke.</p>

                  <p>Firſt drawe with a paire of compaſſes a ſecrete circle that
may be put out, ſo great as you ſhall thinke méet for your carde,
which circle ſhall ſignifie the Horizon, then diuide that circle into
foure equall quarters, by drawing two Diameters croſſing one
another, in the center of the foreſaide circle with right angles,
whereof the perpendicular line is the line of North and South,
and the other croſſing the ſame is the line of Eaſt and Weſt, at
the foure ends of which croſſe Diameters you muſt ſet downe the
foure principall windes, that is, Eaſt, Weſt, North and South,
marking the North part with a flower deluce in the toppe, and
the Eaſt part with a croſſe, as you may ſée in the figure follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Then diuide euerie quarter of the ſaide circle with your
compaſſes into two equall partes, ſetting downe prickes in
the middeſt of euerie quarter, through which prickes, and alſo
through the center of the circle, draw two other croſſe lines, which
muſt extende ſomewhat beyond the circumference of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,

from the center of one little circle to another, in ſuch order as the
figure here placed more plainely ſheweth to the eie, than I can

litle Mariners compaſſes, the lines wherof ſignifying the winds,
do ſhew how one place beareth from another, and by what winde

one whole rounde body, the lines of the 32. rombes in the Carde

ſhew the true courſe that the ſhip hath to hold, which <hi>Michaell
Cogniet</hi> prooueth by a Figure demonſtratiue, and thereof ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth
thrée concluſions. Firſt, that a man may ſayle right north
and South round about the worlde, if the Sea in all that courſe
be nauigable, and ſo returne againe to the Porte from whence
he firſt departed. Secondlie, that making the Equinoctiall his
Parallell hée may ſayle Eaſt and Weſt round about the worlde,
and ſo returne to the porte from whence hee departed, Alſo
if hée ſayle Eaſt and Weſt in any other Parallell that is diſtant
from the Equinoctiall, hee may returne by the ſame Parallell
to the porte from whence hée firſt departed, and yet not about
the whole worlde, for that cannot be done, but onelie when the
Equinoctiall is his Parallel, Thirdlie, that whoſoeuer ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
by any other rombe than by one of the foure principall, hée
by often changing his Meridian and Horizon muſt needs ſaile
by a line Spirall, which is neither perfectlie right, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie
rounde, and thereby hée may well approch the Pole,
and alſo goe rounde about it, but yet with vnequall diſtance,
ſo as he ſhall bee nigher beyonde it than on this ſide, by meanes
whereof hee cannot returne to the place from whence hée came,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:2698:337"/>

your Eaſt point, for in ſayling from <hi>Q.</hi> towardes <hi>D.</hi> you come
immediatelie to the Meridian <hi>A. F.</hi> whoſe right Eaſt point is

from whence you firſt departed, but not about the whole worlde:
for that you cannot doe vnleſſe the Equinoctiall were your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell,
as hath bene ſaide before, but if you ſayle by any other
rombe than by one of the foure principall, that is, Eaſt, Weſt,
North, or South, your courſe ſhall neither be by right line, nor
yet by true circle, but by a ſpirall line, which is partly right, and
partlie round, ſo as you cannot with like courſe returne to the
place from which you departed, by reaſon that you change ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
both Meridian and Horizon, as by the Spirall line <hi>Q. N.
O.</hi> drawne in this Figure you may eaſilie perceiue, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth

the ſea men by making the Meridians and parallels in their

that ſayleth Eaſt and Weſt round about the Pole in the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell
whoſe latitude is 60. degrées, ſhould make as long a voyage
as hee that ſayleth Eaſt and Weſt alongſt the Equinoctiall, the
voyage whereof is twiſe as long as the other, for the redreſſe and
remedie of which faultes, <hi>Cogniet</hi> hopeth to finde out ſome more
perfect rule of making cardes when opportunitie of time ſhall

ſo ſhall you haue a hundred and eight partes, and if there bee
ſpace inough, diuide again euerie one of thoſe into ten, ſo ſhal you
haue a 1080. partes, and if it be poſſible, diuide againe euerie
one of thoſe partes into other tenne, ſo ſhall you haue in all
10/800. partes, but this can hardlie be done, vnleſſe the Carde
be verie large, wherein euerie degree of the Equinoctiall is neere
an inch long, which happeneth verie ſeldome, and therefore
1080. partes ſhall ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>And for the eaſier numbring of theſe partes, ſet to them A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall

be put out when your worke is done, beginning at the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall
and ſo procéede from thence both Northward and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
then looke what number ſtandeth right againſt euerie
degrée in the former Table, which degrées doe extende from 1.
to foureſcore degrées, and omitting alwaies the firſt figure on
the right hande of that number which you finde, for ſo you
muſt alwaies doe when your diuiſion containeth no more but
1080. partes, count that number which remayneth vpon the
line of diuiſion, and there make one pricke, and make another
pricke of the ſame diſtance from the Equinoctiall vpon the ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
Meridian on the left hand, through which two prickes
drawe a right line, and that ſhall be your firſt Parallell of lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and ſo procéede with all the reſt firſt Northwarde, and then
Southward, if you mind to make an vniuerſall Carde. But the
example following containeth no more but the one halfe of an
vniuerſall Carde procéeding from the Equinoctiall line North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He chiefeſt vſes of the ſea Card are theſe foure here
following:</p>
                  <p>The firſt is to know thereby how that place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
you would ſayle, beareth from the place or Port
from whence you ſet off, or depart. And that is to be knowne by
the lines of the Mariners Compaſſes painted in the Card in this
manner following: Take a paire of Compaſſes and hauing ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them, ſet the one foote thereof in the very place from whence
you depart, and the other foote in the next line of that Compaſſe
which is neareſt vnto your place of departing, I meane ſuch line
as doth moſt rightly direct you to the place to which you would
go, and your Compaſſe being opened at the fit wideneſſe to ſerue
that line, draw them from the place of your departing vnto the
place whereto you would go, ſuffering that foote of the Compaſſe
which ſtandeth vpon the line of the winde whileſt you draw it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
not to ſwerue one iot from that line, and that line will ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rightly direct you to the place aſſigned or fall ſhort thereof,
or elſe ouerrech the ſame, if it fall ſhort, then take another line
nearer to the place from which you departed, and if it ouerreach,
take ſome line that is further off from the place of your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:2698:342"/>
and hauing found a line that pointeth directly to the place,
conſider what winde or rombe it is, for by that winde the place
aſſigned beareth from you, and the rombe or winde oppoſite to
that is the winde whereby you haue to ſayle.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond vſe is to knowe by the Carde how farre the place
whereto you go is diſtant from the place of your departing, which
is done by helpe of the ſkale or trunke ſet downe in the Carde
thus: Take the iuſt diſtance betwixt the two places with your
compaſſes by ſetting the one foote in the one place, and the other
foote in the other place, and apply that wideneſſe of the compaſſes
to the ſkale or trunke, and the trunke wil ſhew how many leagues
the one place is diſtant from the other, and if the diſtance betwixt
the places be longer then the trunke, then take firſt the length of
the trunke with your Compaſſes, and looke how many times that
is contained in the ſpace betwixt the two places, and if there doe
remaine any odde meaſure, then hauing taken that odde meaſure
with your compaſſes by ſetting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at ſuch widenes as is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to that odde meaſure, apply that wideneſſe to the firſt part
of the trunke, ſo ſhall you know the iuſt meaſure of the whole. And
this rule ſerueth to take the true diſtance of any other two places
whatſoeuer ſet downe in the Card.</p>
                  <p>The third vſe is to know by the Card what Latitude or alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Pole any place ſet downe in the Carde hath, which is
done by helpe of the line of degrées of Latitude, otherwiſe called
the Graduation of the Carde in this manner following. Set the
one foote of your compaſſes in the very place whereof you would
know the Latitude, and the other foote in the line of Eaſt &amp; Weſt,
which is next vnto that place, and kéeping that foote ſtill vpon that
line, draw your compaſſes forward vntill you come to the line of
degrées, and marke what degrée of the ſaid line the foot of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
which was firſt ſet in the place doth croſſe or touch, for that
is the degrée of Latitude for that place, numbring from the loweſt
degrée of Graduation vpwarde, ſo ſhall you finde the Latitude of
<hi>Lisbone</hi> in Portingale by <hi>Mercator</hi> his vniuerſall Carde, and
by the Carde ſet downe in <hi>Martin Cortes</hi> booke, and alſo by <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina</hi>
his Carde drawne in his booke of Nauigation to be 38. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées
30. minutes and ſomewhat more. But by the Tables of
<hi>Ptolomie</hi> you ſhall finde it to be 40. degrées 24. minutes, and
<pb facs="tcp:2698:343"/>
by <hi>Appian</hi> his Tables to be 39. degrées and 38. minutes.</p>
                  <p>The fourth vſe chanceth when you are driuen out of your right
courſe by ſtormes or tempeſt, which ſtormes how to foreſée and to
prognoſticate, is plainely taught by <hi>Martin Cortes</hi> in the 19.
Chap. of his ſecond booke. Alſo you may be driuen by force of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
windes, by ſurging of the ſea, or by ouerthwart tides, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
&amp; ſuch like impediments, ſo as you can not lay your courſe
right to the place aſſigned, for remedy whereof you muſt ſéeke in
what place you are, &amp; to note the ſame in your Card which as the
Mariners terme it, is to make a pricke in the Carde, which to doe
truely in time of néede many things are to be known &amp; well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and kept in memorie. Firſt to know what latitude the place
from whence you firſt departed hath, then to kéepe in minde what
way your ſhippe did make good at euery ſhift of winde, that is to
ſay, how many leagues, and in how long time you ſayled by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſeuerall winde: and then not knowing well where you are, nor
how farre you are diſtant from the place whereto you would go,
learne to knowe by helpe of your Aſtrolabe or croſſe ſtaffe, in
ſuch ſort as is before taught, the altitude of the Pole in that
place where you are, which if you finde to be all one with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the place of your departure, then you may aſſure
your ſelfe that you haue ſayled by the line of Eaſt and Weſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
altering your Latitude, but if you finde the Latitude of the
place where you are, to be more or leſſe then the Latitude of the
place from whence you departed, then reſort to your Card, and
take two payre of Compaſſes opened at ſuch widenes as the one
foote of the one Compaſſe may ſtand in the place from which you
departed, and the other foote of the ſame Compaſſe to ſtand in the
line of the rombe whereby you ſayled: and let the one foote of the
other Compaſſe ſtand in that degrée of Latitude which you laſt
found, and the other foote of the ſame Compaſſe in the next line of
Eaſt &amp; Weſt, and holding the Compaſſes ſo ordered in ech hande
one paire: draw them both ſo as they may méete together, taking
good héede in drawing them, that the foote of that compaſſe which
was placed in the line of the winde, may at no time ſwarue from
that line, nor the one foote of the other Compaſſe to ſwarue
from the line of Eaſt and Weſt, wherein it was firſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and whereas the two féete of thoſe Compaſſes doe méete,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:2698:343"/>
that is to ſay, that foote of the one compaſſe which was drawne
from the place of your departing doe méete with that foote of the
other compaſſe which came from the degrée of Latitude laſt found,
where theſe two féete (I ſay) doe méete, there make a pricke or
marke in your Carde, for that is the place where you ſhippe is at
that inſtant: And from thence you muſt take your right courſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to the place whereunto you would go. But becauſe it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
aſwell at this time as at all other times, to knowe what
way your ſhippe hath made, and that the ſame is not in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
ſo plainely nor ſo commodiouſly taught by any one that I
haue read, as by <hi>Michaell Cogniet,</hi> I minde therfore in the two
chapters next following to ſet downe his way not only how to find
out the way of your ſhippe when you ſaile South and North vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one ſelfe Meridian, or in any other place where you are to
change in your gate the latitude or altitude of the Pole, but alſo
how to finde out the way of your ſhippe in ſayling right Eaſt and

the altitude of the Pole is changed one degrée,
then haue you gone 17. Spaniſh leagues, and a
halfe, and you haue to note that euery Spaniſh league containeth
2857. fathams, and that our Engliſh league containeth no more
but 2500. fathams, ſo as the Spaniſh league is more then our
Engliſh league by 357. fathams, &amp; euery fatham containeth vi.

of the leagues, but by ſuch meanes as <hi>Cogniet</hi> teacheth in the

one rombe either towards the Eaſt or Weſt, and go ſo farre
as the altitude of the Pole is changed by one degrée, then you
haue made ſomewhat more then 17. Spaniſh leagues and a halfe,
and to be ſhort, the more rombes that you decline towardes the
Eaſt or Weſt, the more leagues in number doe belong to one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée
of altitude, as you may plainely ſée by this figure demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue

you departed as of that place whereunto you be arriued: then by
the foreſaid Table ſéeke to knowe how many leagues doe belong
to a degrée of that rombe whereby you haue ſayled, for in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the number of the leagues by the degrées of the difference
of the two Latitudes, the product thereof will ſhew you how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
leagues you haue ſayled, notwithſtanding ſith the way may be
made longer or ſhorter by changing or ſhifting of the winde, it is
néedefull that the Pylot haue conſideration thereof, who by ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
coniecture muſt ſometime eyther adde to, or take fro accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as néede ſhall require. Moreouer by the foreſaid figure mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with letters, you may alſo eaſily vnderſtande how much you
change in Longitude, that is to ſay, how much you are diſtant
from the Meridian of that place from whence you departed, be it
eyther towardes the Eaſt or Weſt, for he that ſayleth from the
point <hi>A.</hi> as is aforeſaid right North or South, he remaineth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
vnder one ſelfe Meridian: but he that ſayleth by the firſt
rombe towards the Eaſt or Weſt ſo farre as he changeth one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée
of Altitude, and arriueth to the point <hi>E.</hi> is now diſtant from
his firſt Meridian ſo much as is the ſpace betwixt <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> which
we finde by computation to be thrée leagues and a halfe for one
degrée of Latitude, which amounteth to twelue minutes of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée,

the quantitie whereof
anſwerable to euery rombe, is

                  <p>And to make this more plaine by example ſuppoſe that you
ſayle from <hi>Lisbone,</hi> which is a famous port in Portingale, by the

to Weſt, ſo farre as you finde the altitude of the Pole to be 18.

that place is more weſtward then the Meridian of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> then
doe thus. Looke in the firſt Table, and you ſhall finde that to one
degrée of the fift Rombe doe belong 31. leagues and a halfe,
which leagues being multiplyed by 18. doe make in all 582.
leagues and ¾. which you haue ſayled. then looke in the ſecond
Table, and you ſhall finde for the fifth rombe one degrée and 30.
minutes of Longitude, which being multiplyed by 18. and a halfe,
do make 27. degrées and ¾. of a degrée, for by ſo much is <hi>Lisbone</hi>
more Eaſtward, then the place where you are. And whereas the
firſt Table is made according to the proportion of right lines
ſuch as are commonly drawne in Mariners Cardes, <hi>Cogniet</hi>
maketh another Table according to the proportion of circular
lines, which for that it differeth very little or nothing from the
firſt Table, I omit here to ſet it downe. But now becauſe the
firſt Table doth chiefely ſerue thoſe that fayle either Eaſt or Weſt
in any Parallell betwixt the Equinoctiall and the 60. degrée of
Latitude or Altitude of the Pole: And that from thence foorth by
reaſon that they ſayle by more oblique and ſpirall Circles doe
make the longer voyage, <hi>Cogniet</hi> thought good to adde a thirde

thinke it impoſſible for you to make any true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the leagues but onely by coniecture, for
remedie whereof <hi>Cogniet</hi> hath inuented a rule
moſt certaine, as he ſaith, the foundation whereof is thus: Firſt
you muſt ſuppoſe the Meridian of that place from whence you
depart to be a firme and fixed point, and to be the very beginning
of the Parallell wherein you ſayle, then you muſt knowe what
houre it is aſwell at the place from whence you firſt departed, as
alſo at the place whereunto you are arriued, and hauing the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the houres, you muſt knowe howe many leagues euery
houre yéeldeth, according to the Parallell of that altitude of the
<pb facs="tcp:2698:346"/>
Pole vnder which you ſayle, ſo ſhall you eaſily knowe how manie
leagues you haue ſayled. This foundation being firſt laide, <hi>Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niet</hi>
ſetteth downe his generall rule in this manner following:
When ſoeuer you haue to ſayle (ſayth he) right Eaſt or Weſt,
you muſt firſt prouide your ſelfe of theſe two thinges, the one is
of an Aſtronomicall ring that may iuſtly ſhew the houre at anie
time: In ſtéede whereof I thinke it better to haue an vniuerſall
Dyall, ſuch a one as is deſcribed by <hi>William Borne</hi> in the one
and twentieth Chapter of his Regiment: the other thing is to
haue a true houre glaſſe that will run continually foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
houres, and therefore had néede to be thrée times more long
and large then common houre glaſſes be, whereof the glaſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
can quickly prouide you, and becauſe the ſhip leaneth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
on the one ſide, and ſometime on the other, it ſhall be néede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to hange the ſaide houre-glaſſe with rings of braſſe or latten,
to the intent that it may alwayes hange leuell like as the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Compaſſes are wont to be hanged in their boxes. Now being
thus prouided of theſe two inſtruments, you muſt at your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
prepare your houre glaſſe, that is to ſay, you muſt ſet it a
running iuſt at noone when the ſunne is right South, not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to turne it in your voyage once a day in the very inſtant that
it is readie to runne out. Then hauing ſayled certaine daies, and
being arriued at the place where you would knowe what way you
haue made, looke to your houre-glaſſe, and tarry vntill it be full
runne out, at which inſtant ſéeke to know what houre it is by your
Aſtronomicall ringe, or rather by the vniuerſall Dyall, for if you
ſayle Eaſt, you ſhall find it to be paſt noone, but if you ſayle Weſt,
then it will want of noone, and kéepe thoſe houres in minde that
you may know how much it is more or leſſe then noone, for thoſe
houres by ſhewing the difference of the houres that are betwixt
the Meridian of the place from whence you departed, and the
Meridian of the place whereto you are arriued, will certifie you

imagine
a right line to paſſe thorough the two hindermoſt ſtarres other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
called the guardes or pointers of the great Beare, as you ſée
here in this figure, and that line will rightly direct your eye to the
Loadſtarre which ſtandeth in the tippe of the little Beares taile,
for there is no bright ſtar that can be ſéene betwixt the two gards
of the great Beare and the Loadſtarre. Notwithſtanding ſome
do affirme that there is another ſtarre nigher vnto the Pole then
the foreſaide Loadſtarre, and that ſtar is as they ſay no more but
50. minutes diſtant from the Pole: I haue heard that there is a
Prieſt and Aſtrologer with the King of Demnarke, who is woont
to finde out this ſtarre by the helpe of an inſtrument whereby hee
getteth firſt the ſight of ſixe other ſtars at one inſtant, which way
I feare mee is more troubleſome then profitable, and if there
were any ſuch ſtarre indéede, and therewith ſo néedefull and
méete to bee vſed as is the Loadſtarre, I doubt not but that
ſome of our learned Pilots would haue found it out, and alſo
haue had ſome vſe thereof long ere this time: But leauing this
matter, I will returne to the deſcription of our Mariners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Loadſtarre, and ſhew of what bigneſſe it is: alſo what Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude,
Latitude, declination, and motion it hath, and finally the

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2698:349"/>
This ſtarre according to the prutenicall Tables is of the
third bigneſſe, and hath in Longitude 53. degrées 30. minutes,
counting from the firſt ſtarre of the Rams horne, whoſe place in
theſe our dayes is in the 27. degrée 30. minutes of <hi>Aries,</hi> and by
this meanes the place or Longitude of the Loadſtarre is in the
21. degrée of <hi>Gemini,</hi> &amp; his Latitude, counting from the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
line towardes the North Pole of the Zodiaque is 66. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées
0. minutes, and his declination counting from the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall
towardes the North pole of the worlde is 86. ſo as he is
in theſe dayes diſtant from the North pole 4. degrées, ſome ſay
4. degrées and 9. minutes, but <hi>Cogniet</hi> ſayth, that he is diſtant
from the pole but 3. degrées and a halfe, who findeth by the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall
Tables that this ſtarre at the birth of Chriſt was 12. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées
36. minutes diſtant from the Pole, and euer ſince hath gone
decreaſing, and ſhall decreaſe euery day more then other, vntill
it come to be but 26. minutes diſtant from the Pole, which is as
nigh as it can approch to the Pole, for then his diſtance ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
againe to encreaſe. This ſtarre maketh his daily reuoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from Eaſt to Weſt in 24. houres, as all other ſtarres doe by
vertue of the firſt mooueable, but his circuit is ſo ſmall, and his
gate ſo ſlow, as in the ſpace of 24. houres he goeth not much more
then 24. degrées of the Equinoctiall, and in his turning round
about he maketh as it were a little Circle, in the middeſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is the North pole it ſelfe, which is inuiſible &amp; can not be ſéene.</p>
                  <p>And though the image or conſtellation of the little Beare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
many ſtars, yet the ſeuen before mentioned and ſet foorth
in figure are moſt obſerued, of which ſeuen ſtarres in the little
beare, two ſtars called the gards of the North ſtar are to the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
moſt familiar, for diuers reſpects hereafter declared. And of
thoſe gards the one is Northerne &amp; the other Southern, and both
are ſaid to be of the ſecond bigneſſe, &amp; yet the Southerne gard ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to the eye both leſſer and darker then the other. Of which two
ſtars I thinke it not amiſſe to ſet downe here the Longitude, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and declination as I haue done before of the Loadſtarre.</p>
                  <p>The Longitude of the South garde is 100. degrées 30. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
whereby his place is in the ninth degrée of <hi>Leo.</hi> And his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
is 72. degrées 40. minutes, and his declination is 73. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées,
ſo as he is diſtant from the North pole 17. degrées.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:2698:349"/>
The longitude of the North guard is 109. degrées, 30. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
ſo as his place is in the 20. degrée of <hi>Leo,</hi> and his lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
is 74. degrées, 50, minutes, and his declination is 76. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées,
ſo as his diſtance from the North Pole is 14. degrees.
Thus hauing ſhewed the greatneſſe, the longitude, the true
place, the latitude, and the declination aſwell of the Lodeſtarre,
as of his two guardes, I thinke good now to ſet downe the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt

This table differeth in one point from the Mariners common
rule ſet downe as well by <hi>Medina,</hi> and by <hi>Martin Cortes,</hi> as alſo
by <hi>William Boorne</hi> touching the guards, for they all appoint but
halfe a degrée of declination of the North ſtarre from the Pole, the
guardes being either in the rombe Southeaſt, or Northweſt, to
both which rombes <hi>Cogniet</hi> appointeth one whole degreé of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.
The vſe of which table in ſeeking to know, the eleuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Pole is thus. Firſt, hauing taken with your Aſtrolabe
the altitude of the Lodeſtarre aboue your Horizon, obſerue imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatelie
in which of the 8. former rombes his guardes be. For if
they be in any of the 4. vpper rombes of the Table, then you muſt
ſubtract from the height of the Lodeſtarre taken with your Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labe,
ſo much as is ſet downe for that rombe in the collum on the
right hand of the ſaid table, and the remainder ſhall be the true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

this table ſerueth only for the 8. principall winds and for no

at all times the true eleuation of the Pole whereſoeuer I haue

when the North Starre with his guardes ſhal be hidden,
I woulde wiſh all carefull Mariners to acquaint themſelues
with as manie bright Starres as they can, and eſpeciallie with
thoſe which do both riſe and ſet, and alſo to learne by ſome Table
the declination of euerie ſuch Starre and whether it be Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thernlie

muſt ſubtract his declination, and if it be Southernlie, you muſt
adde the ſame to the altitude of the Starre) you ſhall finde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the altitude of the Equinoctiall, which being taken out of 90.
the remainder will ſhew the eleuation of the Pole. The meeteſt
ſtarres for this purpoſe in theſe our North partes of the worlde
are theſe, <hi>Hircus</hi> the Goate, <hi>Canis minor,</hi> the little Dogge, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis

And in anie caſe conſider whether the declination of the ſtarre
be greater or leſſer than his Meridian altitude, for if his declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be greater then his meridian altitude, as of thoſe ſtars which
are nigh the Pole, then you muſt take his Meridian altitude with
your Aſtrolabe at two ſeuerall times, that is to ſay, when he is at
his higheſt in the meridian, and alſo when he is at the loweſt point
of the ſame Meridian called the depreſſion, and hauing added
thoſe Meridian altitudes together take halfe thereof, and that half
ſhall be the eleuation of the Pole, which way of finding out the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuation
of the Pole is nothing méet for a Mariner that is vnder
ſaile. But now to procéede according to <hi>Cogniet</hi> his direction in
this matter, hee ſaith, that if in ſayling you approch ſo nigh vnto
the Equinoctiall as the eleuation of the Pole is not aboue 17. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées,
then the guardes are not ſo eaſilie ſéene, wherefore it ſhall
be néedfull to take ſom other ſtarre whereby you may both know
the houre of the night, and alſo how much the Lodeſtarre is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
aboue or beneath the Pole, and <hi>Cogniet</hi> thinketh none of the
ſtarres more méet for that purpoſe than one of theſe two, that is,
either the ſtarre called <hi>Caput Meduſae,</hi> that is the head of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſa</hi>
called of the <hi>Arabians, Ras Algol,</hi> or els the ſtarre cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Hircus,</hi> that is, the Goat, both which are faire bright ſtarres
and of the firſt bigneſſe: and the cauſe why he appointeth the head
of <hi>Meduſa,</hi> is for that this ſtarre is directlie oppoſite to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
guard, in ſuch ſort as this ſtarre is alwayes aboue the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
when both the guardes are vnder the Horizon. Wherefore
hauing prepared your inſtrument, that is to ſay, hauing laid the
longeſt tooth of the mooueable rundle vpon the day of the moneth
wherein you ſéeke, and hauing found out thereby in ſuch order as
is before taught, the north ſtar and alſo the ſtar called the head of
<hi>Meduſa,</hi> both at one inſtant, marke where the index falleth, and
immediately turne the index from that point to the point oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
abating twelue houres, and ſo the Index ſhall ſhew you thrée
things at once. Firſt, the rombe wherein the guardes are at that
preſent. Secondlie, the houre of the night. And thirdly how much
the North ſtarre is aboue or beneath the Pole. But becauſe this
ſtarre is not knowne perhaps to all Mariners, <hi>Cogniet</hi> would
haue you to take the other bright Starre called <hi>Hircus,</hi> which
(as hée ſaith) goeth 9. houres and ½ before the guardes, in ſuch
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:2698:354"/>
ſort, as when the former guarde is Eaſt,, you ſhall finde this
Starre, counting from the North ſtarre, to be Northweſt, and
almoſt 45. degrées diſtant from the Pole, with which ſtarre
if you worke, as you did before with the heade of <hi>Meduſa,</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that you ſhall not néede to turne the index vnto the oppoſite
point, but onelie to rebate from the point on which it falleth
9. houres and ½ you ſhall knowe all the thrée thinges laſt mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
And this rule (as he ſaith) is ſo generall as you may haue
your deſire by working in like manner with any other ſtarre that
is to you certainlie knowne, &amp; is at that time aboue the Horizon.</p>

                  <p>But the ſea men of theſe preſent dayes doe moſt commonlie
obſerue foure great ſtars, which according to the ſhape and forme

hauing taken the altitude or

Moreouer he ſaith, that in taking the altitude of the great Starre
called the foote béeing in his right place, that is to ſay, when hée is
directlie oppoſite to the head, and that you finde his altitude to
be 30. degrées, then you may aſſure your ſelfe that you are right
vpon the Equinoctiall. And if you finde his altitude to bee more
than 30. degrées, then you are paſt the Equinoctiall towardes
the South Pole. But if you find it to bee leſſe than 30. degrées,
then you are ſtill on the North ſide of the Equinoctiall.</p>

                  <p>Moreouer, the Sunne hath thrée motions, that is, ſlowe, ſwift

<hi>Auge</hi> or <hi>Apogeon,</hi> which is a point imagined to bee nigh vnto
the outermoſt edge of the circle which carrieth the bodie of the

And contrariwiſe when ſhe is in her ſlow motion ſhe maketh
her change, or ful, or any other aſpect the later. Moreouer you ſhal
ſée her at the time of her change eyther ſooner or later, according
to the time of the yeare, for from Ianuary to Iune you ſhal ſée her
within 24. houres after her change, becauſe ſhe hath during thoſe
monethes North declination from the ſunne, &amp; maketh a greater
arch then the ſunne doth. But from Iuly to December you ſhall
not ſée the Moone ſcant thrée dayes after the change. But you may
ſée her within 24. houres before her change, becauſe that during
thoſe monethes ſhe hath South declination from the ſunne: And
note that when the Moone is thrée dayes and 18. houres, which is
the halfe quarter of the Moone, the ſea men doe call that time the
prime day, becauſe the Moone is then 4. points to the Eaſtward of
the Sunne, which is thrée houres, for to euery point is attributed

thrée quarters of an houre as hath béene ſaide before. Moreouer it
is neceſſary for ſea men to knowe when the Moone riſeth &amp; ſetteth,
and in what part of the Horizon in euery Latitude: and how long
ſhe ſhineth and when ſhe is full South, and alſo what Latitude ſhe
hath, and whether it be South or North euery day and houre tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout
the yeare. All which thinges are moſt eaſie to be found
by the Globe, and by helpe of the Ephemerides in ſuch ſort as is
before taught in my Treatiſe of the Globes, and alſo by helpe of
M. <hi>Blagraue</hi> his Aſtrolabe, her true place in the Zodiaque being
firſt knowne by the Ephemerides. It is méete alſo to know when
ſhe is in coniunction with the ſunne, or at the full, and the reſt of
her quarters, which is eaſily knowne by the Ephemerides.</p>

28. degrées and a halfe on either ſide of the Equinoctiall, which
in mine opinion might be more rightly called her greateſt decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which excéedeth by 5. degrees the declination of the ſunne,
for that is but 23. degrees and a halfe, or rather 28′· on either ſide

onely to be vnderſtood when the prime is one, and that her <hi>Auge</hi>
is in <hi>Aries:</hi> For when the prime is betwixt 9. or 10. yeares or
more, the Moone declineth not from the Equinoctial on either ſide

it is neceſſary to knowe the true tydes of that
place, which tydes are ſubiect to the motion of
the Moone, for ſhe cauſeth at one place or other
alwaies in one certaine rombe full Sea. As
for example it is alwayes full ſea at <hi>Antwerp</hi>
when the Moone is either right Eaſt or Weſt:
and it is ebbe or lowe water there when ſhe is North or South,
and becauſe the Moone doth paſſe through all the rombes of the
Mariners Compaſſe in 24. houres, they allow to euery rombe ¾.
of an houre, which is 45. minutes, and that being multiplyed by
32. do make iuſt 24. houres, wherefore if the two rombes, North
and South do yéeld ech of them 12. houres, then the firſt rombe
muſt néedes yéelde ¾. of an houre, the ſecond one houre and ½. and
the third two houres and ¼. and ſo foorth of the reſt: For by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to euery rombe ¾. you ſhall find that the Eaſt and Weſt doe
yéelde alwayes 6. houres: but then you muſt note that according
to the age of the Moone the tydes do fall euery day later and later,
wherfore to know the true time of the tyde in any place, you muſt
firſt learne by ſome Rutter or by the relation of others that can
tell in what rombe the Moone cauſeth full ſea in that place, &amp; then
at what houre it is full ſea, the Moone being eyther in the change
or at the full, which you ſhall know by allowing to euery rombe ¾.
of an houre in ſuch manner as is before ſet downe. But if you
would knowe at what houre it is full ſea in that place euery day,
then you muſt firſt vnderſtand that the Moone in 30. daies ſlacketh
24. houres, which amounteth to ⅘. of an houre which is 48. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
for euery day, for ſo much ſhe declineth euery day from the
ſunne, then looke how many dayes the Moone is old, and hauing
multiplyed the ſame by ⅘. that is to ſay by 48. minutes, adde the
product thereof to thoſe houres at which it is full ſea, and you
ſhall haue the true time of full ſea euery day. As for example, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
th at it was full ſea at the laſt new Moone at ſome place here
<pb facs="tcp:2698:362"/>
in England at thrée of the clocke in the afternoone, and nowe I
would know at what a clocke it ſhall be full ſea 5. dayes after the
new Moone. Now if you multiply 5. being the age of the Moone
by 48. minutes, and adde to the product therof thrée houres, which
was the time of the laſt change, the full ſea ſhall be at that place
at ſeuen of the clocke. But if the ſumme of ſuch addition be aboue
12. houres, then you muſt caſt away the 12. and the remainder

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Illiam <hi>Borne</hi> doth ſet downe what Moone doth make
a full ſea, aſwell here in the moſt parts of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
coaſts as in ſome other parts of France &amp; Spain,
and ſo doe many others whoſe Tables touching the
tydes are called Rutters, whereof ſome are truely ſet downe and
ſome are falſe: But ſith ſuch Rutters do ſerue but for a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
places, I would wiſh that ſome learned Pilot that hath
ſayled many and ſundry long voyages, to make a generall Rutter
that might ſerue for al places if it were poſſible, or at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt for ſo
many places as are knowne in theſe daies: And I would wiſh ſuch
generall Rutter to be made in manner of an Alphabet: and that
euery place might haue his true Longitude and Latitude added
thereunto, to the intent that euery place might be the more eaſily
found out in any Map or Card that is graduated with degrées of
Longitude and Latitude: And then to ſhewe what Moone doth
make a full ſea in euery ſuch place, which thing who ſoeuer would
performe, he ſhould in mine opinion deſerue great commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And thus I end this Treatiſe, praying all the learned Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
not to be offended or gréeued with mee for that I doe make
young Gentlemen our owne Countrimen partakers of their moſt
worthy knowledge, whereof the ignorant are not able to iudge,
nor to yéelde them that prayſe which they deſerue: yea rather I
hope that they will help to perfect what ſo euer I haue herein left
vnperfected, to make the young Gentlemen the more ſkilfull,
and thereby the more ſeruiceable to their Countrie, and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they ſhall procure to them ſelues great good will and infinite
thankes.</p>
