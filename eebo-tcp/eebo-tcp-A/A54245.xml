         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce it hath pleaſed the Everlaſting God to viſit a poor deſpiſed
People in this Nation, with a more direct, immediate and clear
Sight, Sence and Knowledge of him, then heretofore they had, by
the Shinings of his Eternal Light and Spirit in their Hearts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
giving them a true Diſcerning of the Ways and Worſhips that
have been in the World, which gender towards meer Outſide and
lifeleſs Formality, and of that Pure, Straight and Narrow Way, that
ſtands in the Power of God, and holy Life of Righteouſneſs, many,
very many have been their Tryals, Exerciſes and deep Sufferings,
and that of Slandering them and their moſt precious Faith, has not been
the leaſt in their Eye; for by that Practice hath the Enemy of Chriſt's
Kingdom caſt ſuch Miſts and Vails over the Truth, as have obſcured
the divine Beauty and Excellency of it from the Sight of People, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that ſome have dreaded nothing more then the Reception of
that Principle, which bears true and faithful Witneſs for God in their
own Conſciences. It is cryed down for <hi>Inſufficient</hi> by ſuch as never
tryed the Power and Efficacy of it, and termed a <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Dim</hi>
Light, though It diſcovereth and inſtructeth Man in and about Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and Supernatural Things. O that they would obey this Day
of ſmall things, and remember, that Obedience is far better then
Sacrifice; How much is there of the latter? But how little, O how very
little of the former! What Degeneracy is there among all Profeſſions?
Their Tenderneſs is withdrawing, their Greenneſs withering apace;
&amp; with the former do they earneſtly contend, as the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, againſt
the very Power and Life of Godlineſs; and ſee not that the God of the

Lord may formerly in Condeſcenſion have appeared, that he might lead

them nearer to the Subſtance it ſelf; and for want of a true favoring
Spirit in this Matter, Millions are deluded, yea, ſo far, as therein
and therewith to oppoſe a more clear and heavenly Appearance of God
to the Sons of Men; thus do they reſiſt the Viſitations of God's Love to
their Souls, and reject their own Mercies. Oh, that an inquiring tender
Spirit were more generally raiſed in the Hearts of People, that they
would conſider our Relation to the latter dayes, &amp; how much it concerns
them in theſe New Covenant Times, to be in Covenant with God; which
it is utterly impoſſible thoſe ſhould ever be, who rebel againſt the Light
by which he has viſited them with daily Reproof and Inſtruction; <hi>I
have given him,</hi> ſaid the Lord of his Son, <hi>for a Light to lighten

a Miniſter of the Goſpel near <hi>Banbury,</hi> though briefly handled, is of
great Weight; for it conſiſts of two fundamental Doctrines of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,

            <head>A General Defence of the LIGHT WITHIN,
by way of Introduction.</head>
            <p>THough there be no Paſſage or Propoſition to be found from
one End of holy Scripture to the other, more clearly laid
down, then that in <hi>John 1. 9. That was the true Light that lighteth
every man that cometh into the World;</hi> yet ſo ſtrong hath been the
Envy, and ſo ſubtil the Endeavours of the Prince of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> as
ſcarcely any one place hath been more wreſted and abuſed, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to hinder Mankind from minding the Manifeſtations of it, and
yielding all ready Obedience to it, as the way appointed of God
to Eternal Life and Salvation.</p>
            <p>Some will have it to be a <hi>Natural Light,</hi> though it be the <hi>very
Life of that Word, which is God over all bleſſed forever,</hi> and wrapt
up within thoſe Verſes, which only concern <hi>his Eternal Power and
Godhhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others will have it read thus, Not, that he enlightens all
Mankind, <hi>but that all who are enlightened are enlightened by him;</hi>
thereby, not only narrowing and wronging the Text, but ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
God ſo partial and injuſt to his Creatures, as to cauſe his Light
of Righteouſneſs to ariſe on ſome, without ever viſiting the greateſt
part of Mankind with ſo much as a Day of Salvation; though
he ſayes, <hi>He would not the Death of any, but rather that all ſhould
Repent, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a third ſort that will needs have it underſtood not of
any Illumination by a Divine Light or Spirit, but <hi>the Life Chriſt
lived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Doctrine he preached, when viſibly in the World,</hi> which
neither reacheth the hundredth part of Mankind, nor can be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with the Nature of that Part of <hi>John</hi>'s Hiſtory which whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
relates to his Divinity, or what he was before he took Fleſh.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, Chriſt was the Light of the World in that very Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44441:4"/>
and ſhined forth by his Heavenly Doctrine, and Self
denying Life, a moſt holy Example; yet not ſo, as the exclude
himſelf from being that ſpiritual Light, which ſhineth in the
Hearts of the Sons and Daughters of men. <hi>He was full of Grace
and Truth;</hi> yet of his Grace hath Mankind received, <hi>Grace for
Grace,</hi> which is that Grace of God, that in all Ages hath appeared
for Salvation; whoſe Nature and Property is ſo plainly deſcribed,
and the Salvation it brings, unfolded by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tit.</hi> 11, 12. viz.
<hi>Teaching us, that denying Vngodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, we ſhould
live Godly, Righteouſly and Soberly in this preſent World.</hi> And ſo
far is that Univerſal Light and Grace we teſtifie of, from leading us
to undervalue Chriſt and the Scriptures, that we cannot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to all the World in pure Conſcience towards God, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
moderate Enquirer, that we never had any true Knowledge of
God or Chriſt, any right Sence, of the Work of Converſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Souls, nor any right Sight or Reliſh of thoſe Heavenly
Truths declared in the Scriptures, till we came to know, and be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient

is reproved is made manifeſt by the Light; and that whatſoever
doth make manifeſt is Light,</hi> Rom. 1. 19. Epheſ. 5. 13. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

<hi>Divine Things.</hi> 'Tis rare that we meet with any Adverſary, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth

it a <hi>Natural Light,</hi> common to, yea, a part of all men in their
Natural Eſtate, eſpecially when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſo long

Nay, ſo far is Man in his natural Eſtate from being acted and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

evident, that the very Manifeſtation given, is Divine; much
more the Nature of that Light that gives it. Indeed, how is it
poſſible for Man to know Chriſt, who is Light, without Light?
It was <hi>John</hi>'s Meſſage to preach, <hi>That God is Light.</hi> The
ſame Apoſtle teſtifies, <hi>That the Blood of Cleanſing is to
be found of them that walk in the Light,</hi> ver. 7.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, <hi>That this is not that Light wherewith every Man
is enlightned:</hi> The ſame Apoſtle in his Hiſtory ſaith, That <hi>in the

            <p>Its Properties and Effects prove it Divine; in that 1ſt, <hi>If manifeſts

            <p>But if any ſhall yet object, <hi>That this is to be underſtood of a ſpiritual
Light,</hi> &amp; that ours is but a natural one: I ſhall deſire them to do two
Things, 1ſt, To prove that a Natural Light <hi>doth manifeſt God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
for Evil, and cheriſh that which is Good;</hi> ſince whatever is Part of
Man in his Degeneration from God, is ſo far form giving one good

               </gap>aries, that what we call <hi>Divine,</hi> and they call <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Light,</hi> can do both. 2dly, That in Caſe this Light be Natural,
and can ſo manifeſt and reprove, that they would aſſign us ſome
certain <hi>Medium</hi> or Way, whereby we may truly diſcern and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
between the Manifeſtations and Reproofs of the <hi>Natural
Light from thoſe of the Divine Light,</hi> ſince they allow the Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
of God &amp; Reproof of Evil, as well to the one as to the other.
And I challenge them all to give us one Scripture that diſtinguiſhes
between <hi>a Natural and Spiritual Light within,</hi> reproving Evil, &amp;c.
They may with as much Reaſon talk of a Narural and Spiritual
Darkneſs within: 'Tis true, there is a <hi>Natural</hi> Darkneſs, to wit,
the <hi>Night</hi> of the outward World; and there is a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
viz. the <hi>miſty and clouded</hi> Underſtandings of Men, through
Diſobedience to the Light and Spirit of God: Let them aſſign us a
third, or rather a ſecond Darkneſs of the Underſtanding in the things
of God, if they can: Chriſt never diſtinguiſhed between Darkneſs
&amp; Darkneſs, or Light and Light in any <hi>ſuch</hi> Senſe, nor did any of his
Diſciples I ever read of; yet both have frequently ſpoken of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

yields to us, that the Light in Controverſie manifeſteth Evil and
reproveth for it; ſo doth Chriſt himſelf teach thus of the Light,
Joh. 3. 12. <hi>For every one that doth Evil hateth the Light, neither
cometh to the Light, leſt his Deeds ſhould be reproved:</hi> And the Apoſtle
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44441:5"/>

Darkneſs cannot be Darkneſs; And ſo ſay our Adverſaries of
our Light. And as if the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> would have anticipated their
Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>your Light within reproves for Evil;
but it is not therefore the Divine Light, which leads into higher things,
and which comes by the Goſpel;</hi> he thus expreſſeth himſelf, Chap. 2.
<hi>Darkneſs is paſt, and the true Light now ſhineth. He that ſaith, He
is in the Light, and hates his Brother, is in Darkneſs even until now,</hi>
which is not another Light from God the Light, Chap. 1. For,
as Light there is put in Oppoſition to Darkneſs, ſo Light here is put
in Oppoſition to Darkneſs: The Darkne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s is one and the ſame, ſo
the Light; Wherefore we may plainly ſee, that it is not another
Light then that which reproved a man for hating his Brother, that
brings a man into Fellowſhip with God, and to the Blood of Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
as the next verſe ſpeaks: Therefore that Light which repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
a man for hating his Brother, is of a Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>In ſhort; That Light which is oppoſite to, and reproves ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Darkneſs, is a ſpiritual Light: But ſuch a Light is that within,
as our Adverſaries themſelves confeſs, therefore ſpiritual. It is worth
our notice that the Apoſtle uſeth the ſame manner of Expreſſion
here, Chap. 2. 8. <hi>The</hi> TRUE <hi>Light</hi> ſhineth, that he doth in his
Hiſtory, Chap. 1. 9. <hi>That was the</hi> TRUE <hi>Light,</hi> intimating the
ſame Divine Word or <hi>True</hi> Light now ſhineth; and that it was
that ſame <hi>True</hi> Light (for there is but one) that reproved ſuch as
hated their Brethren; conſequently that Light, that ſo reproveth,
is the True Divine Light.</p>
            <p>And ſtrange it is that Chriſt and his Diſciples, but eſpecially <hi>John,</hi>
ſhould ſo often make that very Light, which ſtoops to the loweſt
Step of Morality, to the Reproof of the groſſeſt Evils, to be
no other then the ſame Divine Light, that brings ſuch as follow it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44441:6"/>
to the Light of Life, and thoſe who walk in it to the Blood of
Cleanſing, and to have Fellowſhip with God, &amp;c. Nay, not only ſo,
but make the very beſt of man's being a Child of God, to depend
upon his anſwering of the Light in a palpable moral Caſe, <hi>viz.
not hating of his Brother;</hi> And yet that our Adverſaries ſhould ſhut
their Eyes from beholding its Divinity, and conclude it <hi>therefore</hi>
a meer Natural Light, This is both Unreaſonable and Unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
            <p>But here is the very Ground of their Ignorance and ſleight Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of the Light within, They have never known it further then
in the Capacity of a Reprover of Evil (though that's enough with
a conſiderate and tender-ſpirited man to feel from whence it came)
and ſo conclude it unable to give either further Diſcoveries of God's
Will, or Power and Virtue to enable to do it. But to all ſuch as
object againſt the Sufficiency of the Light of Chriſt within, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as to its Knowledge or Power, I ſay, <hi>Try it;</hi> you are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Judges in the Caſe, till you have walked in it: If then you meet
not with the Blood of Cleanſing, and pure Fellowſhip with God,
who is Light, it will be time enough for you to object. Do not
infer from the Diſcovery of ſmall and great things, two diſtinct
Lights, inſtead of two Manifeſtations of one and the ſame Light;
ſuch as do the Will of God, ſo far as the Light in the Conſcience
enjoyns them, ſhall know more of the Doctrine it teacheth all the
Children of Light.</p>
            <p>However, it hath pleaſed the man we have now to deal with,

               <note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> p. 5. brings
two places againſt the Sufficiency of the Light within:
The firſt is <hi>Deut. 31. 13. That their Children which have
not known</hi> any thing <hi>may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God,
as long as ye live in the Land whither ye go over</hi> Jordan <hi>to poſſeſs it.</hi>
But this is anſwered without Difficulty; for <hi>any thing</hi> is not
in the <hi>Hebrew:</hi> And it appears both from the place it ſelf, and
<hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 2. that thoſe many great and wonderful Works of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
the Lord had wrought for them, and which their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
through <hi>Non-age</hi> knew not, were only intended; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the hearing of them might be a deep Engagement upon their
Spirits to fear and worſhip the God of their Fathers; therefore
were they to hear of thoſe Noble Acts at the Mouthes of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
as the place ſpeaks. How this Inſtance proves the Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of the Shinings of Chriſt's Light in the Conſcience, with
Reſpect to their Duty to God and Man in that Day, is left with
every man of Sober Conſcience to judge.</p>
            <p>The other is 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. The words, <hi>Through Faith in Chriſt
Jeſus,</hi> he omits. The Scriptures <hi>through</hi> Faith are able to make
Wiſe, but not <hi>without</hi> Faith: This doth not prove that therefore
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44441:7"/>
Faith cannot make wiſe without the Scriptures; for that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Scriptures were written, as in <hi>Abraham</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>To <hi>John</hi> 16. 2. They thought and apprehended, the Scripture
commanded them to do God good Service, when they perſecuted
the Saints. Doth this ſet the Scriptures above the true Light, by
which only we muſt rightly underſtand them? Not that we would
exclude the Scriptures of that Service the Lord has appointed
them to, but to maintain the true Light againſt vain Cavils; for
God's Super-adding of Scripture, no more renders the Light In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient,
<hi>then the Spirit, Grace, yea, God or Chriſt;</hi> Man being
abroad from the Spirit, and not abiding in the Light, the Lord
went forth into outward Means to bring him home: <hi>Is God's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion
to Man's Weakneſs a Proof of his Inſufficiency?</hi> The
Scriptures came from the Light, and teſtifie of it, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of them that are ſaved muſt walk in it; this was the End of
the Evangelical Miniſtry. And as for taking true Light from the
Scriptures, without true Light within, how abſurd and impoſſible
it is, is obvious to all. That Light, that gives to underſtand the
right Meaning of the Scriptures, muſt be true Light; elſe, how
can it underſtand right? And how can it be put in us by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>when we muſt and do bring it with us to the Scriptures before
we read them?</hi> Doth the Bible ſend forth a Spirit to read it with?
or doth God ſend it from it? or doth not he rather illuminate the
Soul to underſtand it, as held all Ancient Fathers and Proteſtant
Writers? See what Teſtimony this man gives for his pretended
Light without, againſt the Light within; and after what rate he
diſproves it, to ſatisfie his Neighbour: He manifeſtly ſets the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and the Light within at Variance that Harmonize.</p>
            <p>But ſhall the <hi>Evil, Envy, Pride, Paſſion, Murder and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
then in the <hi>Jews,</hi> Diſcredit, Undervalue, or render Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
the bleſſed Light of the Lord, that at that time ſhined in them
(though their Blindneſs and Darkneſs comprehended it not) Why
may I not as well ſay, they had no Scriptures, or that they did all
thoſe infamous, hardned Acts againſt Chriſt, by the Scriptures
(ſince they thought ſo) as that <hi>S. Grevill</hi> ſhould infer the one or
the other againſt the Light within? Every man hath Light from the
Creating Word, and that is Divine, becauſe the very Life of that
Word; and by it, God, who is Light, is only truly known;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44441:7"/>
and while men hear, obey, and live in the Counſel of it, they
walk in the Way of Truth and Path of Life, they feel the Light of
Life, and experience the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt to cleanſe them
from all Sins.</p>
            <p>To his Anſwer about Perfection, viz. <hi>That he pleads not for
Sin, becauſe he denyes perfect Freedom from it, ſince he pleads for Sin,
that telleth men, they may ſin.</hi> I ſay, If any hear an Advocate plead
that ſuch a man muſt break the Law as long as he lives, will it not
be underſtood, that he pleads for a Toleration of him in the ſame
Evils after he hath been pardoned? But if any hear him plead,
that the Law-makers ſay the ſame (that is, the Teachers) will they
not conclude, that he makes them tolerate Injuſtice, that he blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemes
and ſlanders them, as the Word ſignifies? yet this is <hi>S. G's</hi>
Caſe in point of <hi>Indulgence of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To his other Compariſon, p. 6. viz.</hi> Who favours a Diſeaſe
moſt, He that preſcribes to his Patient to take Antidotes, or He that
tells him, He has no Diſeaſe, nor needs to uſe any Means?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, He weakens a man moſt, that perſwades him, That
his Diſeaſe is ſo rooted, that it is impoſſible for him to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
it, yet preſcribes Remedies, and puts the poor man to
Coſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor doth Chriſt ſay, That all men muſt offend, and that as long
as Heaven and Earth endures;</hi> but that one Jot or Tittle from the
Law ſhall not paſs, till all be fulfilled: And he that breaks one of
the leaſt of theſe Commandments, and teacheth men ſo, ſhall be called
Leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Mat 5. 19. And if the leaſt be
not to be broken, then all ought to be kept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe <hi>A. P.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Where God is manifeſt within, he muſt
needs be Light; S. G.</hi> would make him to conclude, That <hi>God,
Chriſt and the Spirit are the Light within us.</hi> It feems he dares not
faſten his Conſequences upon the Scriptures, but upon what <hi>A. P.</hi>
alledgeth out of them: And doth not <hi>S. G.</hi> deny <hi>them</hi> by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
as he denyes the King that denyes the King's <hi>Writ,</hi> ſince
they hold forth that very Doctrine. If to reject Scripture be Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,
S. G. cannot be ſound, that makes that Conſequence
matter of Error, which he himſelf acknowledges to be Scriptural:
Hear him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If</hi> A. P. <hi>intended not, that God and Chriſt are the Light within,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44441:8"/>
to what Purpoſe did he alledge thoſe Scriptures, which ſay, God is
Light, and God is in us: Chriſt is Light, and Chriſt is in us?</hi>
Which Reader, If I underſtand any thing, is to allow; that we
have Scripture for our Aſſertion, and to give up the Cauſe as far as
ever we contended for it, to wit, That <hi>God is Light, and Chriſt is
Light, and as ſuch, do ſhine or appear in the Hearts of Men,</hi> to
give them the Knowledge of thoſe things which concern their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Peace.</p>
            <p>But <hi>S. G.</hi> ſayes, <hi>If Chriſt were the Light within, the Prophet
would not have ſaid, They have no Light in them.</hi> That <hi>Chriſt is
the true Light, John</hi> teſtifies, and that he was and is ſuch a Light,
<hi>as was to enlighten the</hi> Gentiles, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah tells us;</hi> and
that <hi>the Nations of them that were ſaved, were to walk in this Light,</hi>
John the Divine in his Revelation aſſures us. Now, unleſs the
Soul of Man be not to be lighted with this Light, or that it is
not to be underſtood of the Soul, but Body only that was to walk in
the Light of the Church; it will follow, that this Light muſt needs
ſhine where the Soul of Man is, which is within; conſequently,
that Chriſt is that Light which ſhines within.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> that took Counſel to perſecute Chriſt without, was ſtroke
at the Appearing and Shining of Chriſt within; <hi>and when it pleaſed
God to reveal his Son in him</hi> (the true Light that enlightens all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind)
<hi>he conſulted not with Fleſh and Blood,</hi> which is their State
that reject and vilifie his ſpiritual Appearance and Revelation of
him in the Soul: But for all their vain Expectations and loud Boaſts,
in that State they ſhall never inherit the Kingdom of God; that is
God's Word of Truth. As to the Prophet's Words, they are
not to be underſtood, as it thoſe wicked Men had no Light from
God; but that they rebelling and blinding themſelves againſt it,
and following their own Imaginations for Truth, <hi>They had no Light
in all their Wayes;</hi> or as <hi>S. G.</hi> well ſayes, <hi>Their conceited Light
was Darkneſs; They walked in Darkneſs, and ſo participated or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
not of the Benefit and Bleſſing of the Light; but it ſhined in the
Darkneſs uncomprehended:</hi> There was Light, <hi>but it was not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
upon him, or no Morning riſen in him,</hi> as the Words may be
rendred: Is there no Sun in the Firmament, becauſe Men that are
blind, or ſhut their Eyes, cannot, or will not ſee it? Or, I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a School-Maſter
Unlearned or Inſufficient, becauſe any of his Lads play tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44441:8"/>
and neglect his Reproof &amp; Inſtruction? Or, Is it reaſonable for
any of us to ſay, that ſuch Schollars have no School-Maſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are idle and regard not their Book, notwithſtanding his
daily Checks and Reprehenſions of them? Or, Can they be ſaid to
have no Leſſon, becauſe they neglect to get it?</p>
            <p>In ſhort, Chriſt is the great Prieſt, Prophet, King, Judge and
Law-Giver under the new Covenant: He is the Shepherd that dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overlooks and feeds his Flock; and ſuch as know not him ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed

we read, the Apoſtle did in the Epiſtle to the</hi> Romans. But this man
interpreting it, <hi>the Death of the Body,</hi> inſtead of <hi>the Body of Death,</hi>
firſt gives a Reaſon, why Sin muſt be deſtroyed by the Death of
the Body, namely, <hi>becauſe it entered by the Conjunction and Vnion
of the Soul with the Body;</hi> but that he proves not, and it were to
diſprove himſelf in pag. 8. For there he ſaith,<note place="margin">pag. 8.</note> 
               <hi>The Light is Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
wherewith God hath endued man's Soul, and is a Natural Gift,
that comes by Generation:</hi> How then, ſay I, is it conjoyned and
united to it, if it be generated with it? for ſo 'tis one with it.
Are there two Generations, one of the Body, and another of the
Soul; one with Sin, and another without it; and the latter united
to the former, that it may receive Sin, and ſay, <hi>A Body haſt thou
prepared me, O God, to do not thy Will on Earth, as it is in Heaven,
but the Will of the Devil, that at my firſt Entrance into it, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my Continuance in it, I may alwayes do thy Enemy ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
who muſt have a place allowed him in it as long as it lives?</hi>
Is not this blaſphemous and contrary to the Scripture,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 17.</note> which ſayes,
<hi>He that defiles the Temple of God, him will God deſtroy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would fain know of S. G. how the Man of Sin got entrance to
defile this Temple, if it was not through the Mind, by entring
that with his Temptation, <hi>of becoming as God, knowing Good and
Evil,</hi> which was ſometime after that God had breathed into Man
the Breath of Life. If he ſayes, it was, as inevitably he muſt, then
will it follow, that sin came not by Conjunction of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as he teaches, but after that Conjunction; and ſo his Reaſon for
Death's deſtroying of Sin, which implies, the neceſſity of ſinning
til men dye, is quite overturned. Beſides, how can a Houſe of Clay,
a lifeleſs Lump of Earth, be capable of Pollution any wayes,
but by him or them, that inhabit or enter it, as becoming his or their
Organ, Inſtrument or Habitation?</p>

            <p>Further, <hi>S. G.</hi> tells us, <hi>That the legal keeping of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
is an univerſal and perpetual keeping of them; but the
Evangelical is not ſo, but an Aim and Endeavour:</hi> Which if I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44441:14"/>
underſtand any thing, is to make God in theſe New Covenant
Times, to indulge in man a ſlacking of Obedience to his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Law. At this rate Chriſt came not that we ſhould fulfil the
Law, but only that we ſhould endeavour it: Strange Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Are men under a leſs Obligation to Holineſs, now they have more
plentiful Aſſiſtences to compaſs it? Is this the Way to finiſh Sin,

            </p>
            <p>Whether this man writes like a Goſpel-Miniſter, or Servant of the
God of this World, let the Conſcientious Reader judge. But he
was not alwayes of this Mind; for in pag. 10. he ſeems to plead

            <p>None of thoſe Fathers he ſpeaks of, I dare ſay, if he quoted the
Places, would be found to countenance his Definition; for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes,

not; they only declare ſuch Things to Believers. If <hi>Mathew</hi> and
<hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were not the Goſpel, becauſe they were
Powerful Inſtruments to declare it; no more are their Books &amp; Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:
They were not the glad Tidings, but the Bringers and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers

them, firſt turn themſelves manifeſtly againſt us, and endeavour what they can
to obſtruct our March:</hi> But the Lord God <hi>Jehovah</hi> is ſufficient, our Pillar
of Cloud by Day, and Fire by Night; he goes before us; Power and Might
and Majeſty are with him, whoſe Holy Pure and Clear Voice we have certainly
heard, and in whoſe Bleſſed Appearance we have firmly believed; and it is ſo well
with us, who retain our firſt Love to him and his pretious Truth in the inward parts,
that we can ſing for Joy, though in a weary Land, and in the midſt of many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes.
And this we know aſſuredly, That he will ſhake terribly the Nations,
and bring Amazement upon the People; Their Conſciences will he ſuddainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken,
and with terrible Judgment will he plead with all the Proud Profeſſing,
as well as Prophane Fleſh in this Land; it ſhall wither as the Graſs, and the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it fade as the Flower of the Field: And in that Day ſhall Obedience to, and
Communion with the Light of Chriſt within, be honourable and deſirable in the
ſight of Thouſands; and the Truth ſhall have the Victory, and the Dominion ſhall
not be any longer the Devil's, but the Saints of the Moſt High, over Hell, Death
and the Grave; the Ancient of Dayes will bring it to paſs: Then ſhall <hi>Babylon</hi>
fall, and her Merchants howl; for the great Judgment will ſurprize them, as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
a Woman with Child, and the Lord God will reckon with them for the Souls of
his People. O fear before the Lord, ye Prieſts! and turn you unto him all ye
