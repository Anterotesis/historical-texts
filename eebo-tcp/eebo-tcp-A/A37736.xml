         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
To the
READER.</head>
            <p>THE Design of this small Tract
is to give an easie and clear
Account of these Parts, which are
now the Seats of Noble and Heroick
Actions; in which every Thing is so
well Contrived, and set in such good
Order and Method, as I believe will
give due Satisfaction to all such as are
Curious and Inquisitive after the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of these Times.</p>
            <p>All the Towns of Note are here
mentioned, and their Situation so well
designed, that they may very easily
and quickly be found in any good
Map; but especially by the help of
the Index, where their Longitude and
Latitude is also set down, (according
to <hi>F. de Wits</hi> Maps, the first Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
<pb facs="tcp:109842:3"/>
beginning at <hi>Tenneriff)</hi> which
is a great help towards the easie find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Place.</p>
            <p>Those Towns that are of greatest
Note, and those that are Frontiers, and
probably may be places of Action, are
here very exactly and particularly
described; more largely and better
than are in the vulgar Geographies:
And such Descriptions as these are
both Pleasant and Profitable, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much needed in these Times.</p>
            <p>In short, Reader, here is scarce any
thing wanting that may be reasonably
expected from such a Volumne; and if
it should afford you any Profit, or
one or two hours Divertisement, is
all that I Desire; and shall think my
time not ill bestow'd if it shall deserve
your Perusal.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bounds.</note>
or the <hi>Catholick Provinces,</hi>
commonly called by the

(the Principal of
these Provinces) are bounded on the
East, with <hi>Germany;</hi> on the West, or
rather North-West, with the <hi>German

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:109842:4"/>
The whole is of a kind of a Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
From;<note place="margin">Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</note> being in length from the
most Eastern parts of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> to
the most Western parts of <hi>Artois,</hi> about
192 Miles; and in breadth, from the
most North parts of <hi>Brabant,</hi> to the
most South parts of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> about
155 Miles; the whole Circumference
being scarce 600 Miles: containing,
according to <hi>Sellers</hi> Account, 7197000
of Acres.</p>
            <p>The Principal Rivers in these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,<note place="margin">Rivers.</note>
are, 1. <hi>Maes,</hi> which (besides
its course in <hi>France)</hi> passes through
<hi>Namur, Liege</hi> and <hi>Gelderland,</hi> wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Towns of <hi>Charlemont, Dinant,
Namur, Liege, Maestricht, Ruremond,
Venlo, Grave</hi> and <hi>Dort,</hi> below which
it falls into the Sea. 2. <hi>Scheld,</hi> or
<hi>Escaut,</hi> passing through <hi>Cambray, Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault</hi>
and <hi>Flanders;</hi> washing the Towns
of <hi>Cambray, Valenciennes, Tournay; Ghent,</hi>
and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> a little below which it
falls into the Sea. 3. <hi>Lys,</hi> passing
through <hi>Artois</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> and wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Towns of <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Courtray,</hi> and

This is but a small spot of Land,<note place="margin">Riches &amp; Strength.</note>
but exceeding populous, full of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Towns and Villages, and most
plentifully endowed with all things
necessary either for Pleasure or Profit.
So very rich, that at once the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s Revenues from thence (when
he had all) was greater than any
Prince in Christendom, the King of
<hi>France</hi> excepted; but at present the
charge of keeping is much greater
than the Revenues. The Strength of
these parts are very great, and were it
not for the vast increase of the French
Power, and the decay of the Spanish,
it would be thought much greater:
But for a long time the Spaniards
have not been able to keep those they
have still, without great help from
others.</p>
            <p>The Traffick in these parts have
been always very great;<note place="margin">Traffick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> but now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so much as formerly, by reason
of the prodigious increase of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces</hi> in these late years. It
chiefly consists of several sorts of
Manufactures, as rich Tapestries, fine
Camlets, Serges, coloured Says, Mock-Velvets,
great Quantities of fine Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
Damasks, Cambricks, Taffaties,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109842:5"/>
and strip'd Stuffs for Beds, which sell
well in many Countries; all sorts of
Ribbons, Bastard Sattins, and many
other things of this Nature, made at
the Cities of <hi>Mons, Gaunt, Brusselles,
Ypres, Lille, Bruges, Valenciennes, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of these parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
of Flemmings,<note place="margin">Inhahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</note> Walloons, Spaniards,
with some intermixture (more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at present) of French, Dutch,
and English. The Religion among
them may be said to be various, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their several Nations; but
howsoever that of the Roman Church
is only publickly allowed. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
(which are of no small Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in many of the chief Cities) are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suffered out of Policy. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishopricks
and Bishopricks are all Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick.</p>
            <p>The Languages most generally used
in these parts are the Walloon and
Flemmish;<note place="margin">Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> the Walloon is a corrupt
French, spoken in <hi>Artois, Hainault,
Namur, Luxemburg, French Flanders,</hi>
some of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and the Bishoprick
of <hi>Liege.</hi> The Flemmish or Low-Dutch,
is a Dialect of the German,
spoken in the <hi>Marquisate, Mechlin,</hi> the
rest of <hi>Brabant, Flanders,</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109842:5"/>
of <hi>Liege.</hi> The Spanish is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
much in use among the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s Subjects, and the French a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the better sort. English and
Latin is here well understood by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>In these Provinces are two Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks,<note place="margin">Remarks</note>
               <hi>viz. Cambray</hi> and <hi>Mechlin;</hi>
and eleven Bishopricks, <hi>viz. Antwerp,
Boisleduc, Bruges, Ghent, Ruremond</hi> and
<hi>Ypres,</hi> under <hi>Mechlin; Namur, Arras,
St. Omers,</hi> and <hi>Tournay,</hi> under <hi>Cambray;</hi>
and <hi>Liege</hi> under <hi>Cologne</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi>
Here are also 155 Cities or Walled
Towns, (besides those in <hi>Cambray</hi> and
part of <hi>Gelderland)</hi> and 6867 Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
besides the Castles, Forts, and
Noble Mens Houses, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
innumerable. The chief City of
the whole is <hi>Antwerp;</hi> but <hi>Brussels</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Seat of the Spanish Governor,
and the Heart of the Country, I shall
reckon the distances from that. The
chief City of the French is <hi>Mons;</hi> of
the Hollanders, is <hi>Boisleduc,</hi> or <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricht;</hi>
and of the Bishop of <hi>Liege,
Liege.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Provinces are in Number 10;<note place="margin">Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>

There is a New Trench cut for a

Guns apiece; and on the West-side of

the Sands. It is a Place of very great
Strength, but much added by the late
Fortifications, which are very large,
and the Bastion towards the North is
most stately. It is well built and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
