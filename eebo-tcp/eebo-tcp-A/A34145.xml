            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE the Under-Subscribers, Ministers of His Majesty the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> have, upon the arrival of Commissioners from an Indian Company in <hi>Scotland,</hi> represented at two several times to Your Magnificences and Lordships, from the King our Master, That His Majesty understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the said Commissioners endeavoured to open to themselves a Commerce and Trade in these Parts, by making some Convention or Treaty with this City, had commanded us most expresly to notifie to Your Magnificences and Lordships, That if you enter into such Conventions with private Men, his Subjects, who have neither Credential Letters, nor are any otherwise authoriz'd by His Majesty, That His Majesty would regard such Proceedings as an Affront to his Royal Authority, and that he

            <p>WHereas, by the XXXII. Act of the Fourth Session, and by the VIII. Act of the Fifth Session of Your Majesty's Currant Parliament, as well as by Your Majesty's Patent under the Great Seal of this Kingdom, This Company is establish'd with such Ample Priviledges as were thought most proper for encouraging both Natives and Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to join in the Carrying on, Supporting and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of our Trade: The most Considerable of the Nobility, Gentry, Merchants, and whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Royal Borroughs, have (upon the Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Publick Faith of Your Majesty's said Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent) contributed as Adventurers in raising a far more Considerable Joint-Stock, than any was ever before raised in this Kingdom, for any Publick Undertaking or Project of Trade what soever, which makes it now of so much the more Universal a Concern to the Nation.</p>
            <p>And for the better enabling us to accomplish the Ends of Your Majesty's said Acts of Parliament and Letters Patents, we have, in pursuance thereunto, appointed certain Deputies of our own Number to transact and negotiate our necessary Affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yound Sea; And at the same time to treat with such Foreigners of any Nation, in amity with Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, as may be inclinable to join with us for the Purposes aforesaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95194:4"/>In the Prosecution of which Commission to our said Deputies (vested with full Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, according to Law) we are a little surpriz'd to find, to the great Hinderance and Obstruction of our Affairs, that Your Majesty's Envoy to the Courts of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> and Resident at <hi>Hamburg,</hi> have under Pretence of special Warrant from Your Majesty, given in a Joint-subscrib'd Memorial to the Senate of <hi>Humburg,</hi> expresly invading the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges granted to our Company by Your Majesty's said Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent, as by the herewith transmitted Copy may appear.</p>
            <p>By the which Memorial we sustain great and manifest Prejudices, since both the Senate and Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the said City of <hi>Hamburg,</hi> are thereby (contrary to the Law of Nations) expresly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Your Majesty's high Displeasure, if they, or either of them, should countenance or joyn with us in any Treaty of Trade or Commerce whatsoever; which deprives us of the Assistance which we had reason to expect from several Inhabitants of that City.</p>
            <p>For Redress whereof, we do in all Duty and Humility apply to Your Majesty, not only for the Protection and Maintenance of our Privileges and Freedom of Trade, but also for Reparation of Damages, conform to Your Majesty's said Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent: And do further beg Leave humbly to represent to Your Majesty, that tho' by the said Act of Parliament and Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, we conceive our selves legally and sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authorized to treat even with any Sovereign Potentate or Estate in Unity with Your Majesty, for the Support and Advancement of our Trade, yet we by our said Deputies have only treated with particular and private Merchants of the said City of <hi>Hamburg,</hi> without ever making any the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95194:5"/>
least Proposal to the Senate thereof. And this we humbly conceive to be the natural Right and Privilege of all Merchants whatsoever, even tho' we had wanted the Sanction of so solemn Laws. And without some speedy Redress be had therein, not only this Company, but also all other indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Merchants of this Kingdom, must from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward conclude, that all our Rights and Freedom of Trade are, and may be, further, by our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, violently wrested out of our Hands.</p>
            <p>We therefore, to prevent the further evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of the said Memorial to our Company in particular, do make our most humble and earnest Request to Your Majesty, That You would be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously pleased to grant us such a Declaration, as in Your Royal Wisdom You shall think fit to render the Senate and Inhabitants of the said City of <hi>Hamburg,</hi> and all others that are or may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, secure from the Treatnings and other Suggestions contained in the said Memorial, as well as to render us secure under Your Majesty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in the full prosecution of our Trade, and free enjoyment of our Lawful Rights, Privileges and Immunities, contained in Your Majesty's said Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.</p>

We cannot imagine what should be the Occasion of this new Disappointment, since we cannot suffer our selves to believe, but that His Majesty has, according to his Letter to your Lordship, given Orders as aforesaid, which makes us admire the more where the Neglect of that Matter doth now stand: Yet we must needs say, We are in some Measure afraid to acquaint the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-General with it, lest they be more uneasie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, than we would wish, till first we have your Lordship's Answer: For which Cause we, the several under-subscribing Directors of the said Company (who are now in Town) have thought fit, in as quiet a Manner as possible, to give your Lordship an Account thereof, to the end you may in your Wisdom and Prudence, advise His Majesty with Relation thereunto; and doubt not but your Lordship will take such Care herein, as may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our Calling another Council-General, with

            <p>BY a former Address of the 28th of <hi>June</hi> last, we have humbly represented to Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, how that Your Majesty's Envoy to the Courts of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> and Resident at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pretence of Special Warrant from Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, give in a Memorial to the Senate of the said City of <hi>Humburgh,</hi> contrary to the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and expresly invading the Privileges contained in the Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent, by which our Company is established: Copies of which Address and Memorial we have, for Your Majesty's better Information, hereto annexed.

said Order, that upon Application made to him for that Effect, with all the Respect due to his Character, he pretended that he had never as yet got any such Order on our Behalf, which we thought fit in all Duty and Humility, to lay before Your Majesty, renewing withal our most humble and earnest Request, That Your Majesty would be now graciously pleased to take the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of This, and our said former Address, into Consideration, and in your Royal Wisdom order some speedy and effectual Redress of our Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances therein mentioned, and a just Reparation of the manifest Damages, which our Company has already sustained, by reason of the said Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.

            <p>'TIs not unknown to your Lordships, how that in several successive Sessions of this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Parliament, His Majesty's Instructions to His respective High Commissioners, and their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Speeches pursuant thereunto, have been full of repeated Assurances of His Majesty's good Inclinations for encouraging the Trade and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of this Nation. And whereas accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, by the 32d Act of the 4th Session, and the 8th Act of the 5th Session of the said Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, together with His Majesty's Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent under the great Seal of this Kingdom, our Company is establish'd with such ample Privileges and Immunities as were thought most proper for encouraging both Natives and Foreigners to joyn in the carrying on, supporting and advancement of our Trade. We have in pursuance and upon publick Faith thereof, not only contributed at home a far more considerable Joint-Stock than ever was raised before in this Nation, for any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Undertaking or Project of Trade whatsoever; but have also had all the promising Hopes and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95194:9"/>
Prospect of Foreign Aid that our Hearts could wish, till, to our great surprize, the English Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> have, under pretence of Special Warrant from His Majesty, put a stop thereto, by giving in a Memorial to the Senate of that City, threatning both Senate and Inhabitants with the King's utmost Displeasure, if they should counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or joyn with us in any Treaty of Trade and Commerce: As by the annexed Copy thereof may appear.</p>
            <p>Upon due Consideration whereof, we have, in all Duty and Humility, address'd His Majesty in <hi>June</hi> last for redress thereof. In answer to which Address His Majesty was then graciously pleased to signifie by His Royal Letter, That upon His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>England,</hi> He would take into Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Contents of our said Address. And that in the mean time He would give Orders to His said Ministers at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> not to make use of His Royal Name or Authority for obstructing the Trade of our Company with the Inhabitants of that City. In the full assurance of which we rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed secure, and took our Measures accordingly, till, to our further Surprize and unspeakable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, we found by repeated Advices from <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> that the said Resident continues still Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious, and is so far from due Obedience to His Majesty's said Order, that upon Application made to him by our Agent in that City, with all the Respect due to his Character, he declared, That as yet he had got no such Order on our behalf: Which, by a further Address we are now to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His Majesty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95194:9"/>But whereas we humbly concelve your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships to be more immediately under His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty the Guardians of the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, we think it our Duty to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to Your Lordships the Consequences of the said Memorial, both with relation to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in particular, and the Privileges, Interest, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Dignity and Reputation of the Nation in general.</p>
            <p>Your Lordships very well know of what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Success of this Company is to the whole Kingdom, and that scarce any particular Society or Corporation within the same can just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boast of so unanimous a Suffrage or Sanction, as the Acts of Parliament, by which this Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is established: So that if effectual means be not taken for putting an early stop to such an open and violent Infringement of, and Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Privileges of so solemn a Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, 'tis hard to guess how far it may in after Ages, be made use of as a Precedent for invading and overturning, even the very Fundamental Rights, Natural Liberties and indisputable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency of this Kingdom; which, by the now open and frequent Practises of our unkind Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, seem to be too shreudly pointed at. And should this Company (wherein the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable of the Nobility, Gentry, Merchants, and whole Body of the Royal Boroughs are concern'd) be so unhappy (which God forbid) as to have its Designs rendred unsuccessful, through the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable evil Treatments of our said Neighbours; most certain it is, that no Consideration whatever, can thereafter induce this Nation to join in any

such other Publick, tho' never so advantageous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, as not doubting but to meet with the like or greater Discouragements from those who give such frequent and manifest Indications of their Designs, to wrest our Right and Freedom of Trade out of our Hands.</p>
            <p>For which cause we humbly offer tbe Premises to your Lordship's Consideration, not doubting but you will (in your profound Wisdom and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) take such effectual Measures for redress thereof at present, and to prevent the like En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments for the future, as may be capable to remove those Apprehensions and Jealousies which the bare-faced and avowed Methods of the <hi>English</hi> do now suggest, not only to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in particular, but even to the whole Body of this Nation in general.</p>

            <p>THat whereas the Wisdom of the King, and this present Parliament, has thought fit by two several solemn Acts and Letters Patent under the Great Seal of this Kingdom, to establish our Company with such Powers, Privileges and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, as were thought needful, to encourage any such new Undertaking in this Nation, particularly to raise a Joint-Stock in such manner as we should think fit. And for that end to enfranchise such Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners as would become Partners with us, and to enter into Treaties of Commerce with any in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with His Majesty for that effect, &amp;c. Those of our Number who were then intrusted with the Management thereof, did think it most Natural to make the first Offer of sharing our said Privileges, with our Country men, and other Neighbours in <hi>England,</hi> as living under the same Monarchy. And they not only readily embraced the Offer, but in nine Days time subcribed 300000 /. Sterling, as the one half of the Capital Stock then proposed, and actually paid in the first fourth Part thereof, part
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95194:11"/>
in Specie, part in Bank-Notes, and the rest in Notes payable upon demand.</p>
            <p>That both Houses of the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> taking umbrage at those Proceedings, did not only jointly Address His Majesty, for frustraring the Ends of the said Act; but the House of Commons did also appoint a Committee to examine, What Methods were taken, for obtaining the said Act of Parliament here, for establishing our Company, who were the Subscribers thereto, and who were the Promoters and Advisers thereof, with Power to send for Persons, Papers and Records; pursuant to which, the said Committee gave Orders to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon not only the English Subscribers, but even some Persons then residing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as by the said Address, Votes of the House of Commons, and Copy of the said Summons, may appear; by all which, together with some other Measures then taken. Our Friends in <hi>England</hi> were, to our great Loss, Disappointment, and Retardment, forced to relinquish, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That notwithsranding of that Discouragement, not only most of the Nobility, Gentry, Merchants, and the whole Body of the Royal Boroughs, have upon the Inducement, and Publick Faith of the said Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed as Adventurers, in raising a far more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Joint-Stock, than any was ever before rais'd in this Kingdom for any Publick Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Project of Trade whatsoever (which makes it now of so much the more universal a Concern to the Nation) but we have also had all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising Hopes of Forreign Aid that our Hearts could wish, especially at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of that City entred into Contract with our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95194:12"/>
Deputees, to joyn at least 200000 /. Sterling with us, till, to our great Surprize and Loss, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Ministers there, did, under Pretence of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Warrant from His Majesty, put a Stop there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by giving in a Memorial to the Senate of that City, not only disowning the Authority of the said Acts of Parliament and Letters Patents, but also threatning both Senate and Inhabitants, with the Kings outmost Displeasure, if they should counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or joyn with us in any Treaty of Trade or Commerce, as by the annexed Copies thereof, in <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> may appear; which Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, We humbly pray, may for the better Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Grace, and Right Honourable Estates, be also read in Parliament.</p>
            <p>That after the said Memorial was by the Senate transmitted to the Commercij or Body of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of that City, they to assert their own Freedom, did advise and prevail upon our Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees and Agents, who were there for the time, to open Books in the said Merchants Hall, where for some Days they sign'd considerableSumms pursuant to their said Contract, though under Condition to be void, if we should not procure some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration from the King, that might render them secure from the Threatnings and other Insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contained in the said Memorial: And to our great Disappointment, thus the Case stands in suspence, between them and us to this Day.</p>
            <p>That as the reasonable (nay, and unquestionable) Prospect which we had of a powerful Assistance from <hi>Hamburg,</hi> and several other Places (if not obstructed as aforesaid) induced us to propose a far greater Equipage at first than otherwise we would have done; so the rendring of those Measures
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95194:12"/>
abortive, has not only weakened our Stock, les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened our Credit, retarded our first Expedition, and dishheartned many of our Partners at Home, but even also shackled our Resolutions and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from prosecuting at present several other Branches of Foreign and Domestick Trades and Improvements, which we had in view, if we had not met with such Obstructions and Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from time to time.</p>
            <p>That though our Company is more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and sensibly touched in many Respects by such Proceedings than any other; yet we humbly conceiving also, that the Honour and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the Nation, as well as the Authority and Credit of the Parliament is struck at through our sides, we could not as Country-Men; and in Duty to that collective Power, which gave our Company first a Being; but inform his Grace, His Majesty's High Commissioner, and the Right Honourable the Estates of Parliament of the Premises, to the end that the great Council of the Nation, now assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled (whom God Almighty direct) may do therein as they in their profound Wisdom and Discretion shall think fit.</p>
            <p>That as to what thereof concerns our Company in particular, we shall humbly. beg leave to suggest further, that our Ships being now at Sea, on their intended Voyage, the former Treatment which our Company met with in <hi>England</hi> and elsewhere, may give us too just Grounds to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, that if either through multiplicity of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs, or otherwise howsoever: Your Grace and Right Honourable Estates of Parliament, should neglect the taking present Notice of such Usage the Enemies of our Company, would be thereby
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95194:13"/>
encouraged, either directly or indirectly to pursue their former Designs of ruining (if possible) all our Measures.</p>
            <p>May it therefore please your Grace, and the Right Honourable the Estates of Parliament, to take the Premises into your most serious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, to vindicate our Company's Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Abroad, by supporting the Credit of the said Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent, by which the same is established, and wherein the Honour of the Nation is so much concerned, to take effectual Measures (as the said Act pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides) for repairing, the great Loss and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, which we have already sustained, thro' the unawarrantable Treatment above mention'd, as well as for, preventing the like for the future; and withal to continue us the Privileges and Exemptions mentioned in the said Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Letters Patent sor some longer time, in Consideration of the time already elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed without Execution, and our Stock lying dead without Improvement, by Reason of the Obstructions aforesaid.</p>

            <p>THIS being the first Opportunity that we have had to address your Lordship, since your Advancement to that eminent Station and Place of Trust wherein you are: We must account it a Happiness that upon Receipt of the late welcome News from our Colony's Company in <hi>America,</hi> we can transmit an Account thereof to his Majesty by the hands of one so much devoted to the Honour and Interest of our Country and Company, as your Lordship has upon all Occasions shewn your self; and who being often Witness to our Company's Proceedings from time to time, can give a juster Account thereof than any other that has no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95194:19"/>
in our Stock, nor has ever been amongst us. Inclosed you have our Council-General's seal'd Letter to his Majesty, which we doubt not your Lordship will carefully deliver, together with an exact Copy thereof for your Lordship's better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, to which we refer, but shall for your further Information enlarge a little upon the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Heads therein mention'd. As to our place of Settlement it is so far from having ever been pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd by any European whatsoever, that by all the Accounts that we could ever yet get, not only at this time from the Council of our Colony, but even by such Letters as we have seen and heard of from <hi>Curacao,</hi> and other <hi>American</hi> Islands, no Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an did before our Settlement so much as once set a foot upon that Plot of Ground wherein our Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is now fix'd: And tho the same was altogether uninhabited, when our People came there, the chief Men and Leaders of the said Natives of that part of the Coast nearest adjoining to <hi>Golden Island,</hi> East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Westward, have not only treated with the Council of our Colony before Landing, but have also in pursuance of that Treaty in a most kind and friendly manner admitted our said Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony into such Places of their Neighbourhood as are not yet possess'd, and taken Commissions from the said Council in a very solemn manner, and joined with our People; and that in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Colony's admitting them and their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to participate of the Liberties and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges granted to our Company by his Majesty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> OUR SOVERAIGN LORD, with Advice and Consent of his Parliament of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> entreating to be protected accordingly: We repeat these Words, as being the express Words of the first Commission which the said Council granted. As to the French Designs of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95194:20"/>
thereabouts, it is a Point not to be doubted of: For in order thereunto they have already been tampering with several of the Natives, some of whom they endeavour'd to have carried into <hi>France;</hi> and we have very good reason to believe that a further Progress had been made in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before now, were it not the daily Expectaions which that Court had of the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Death, which we humbly conceive is a Matter worthy of his Majesty's Consideration, and of no small Concern to the Interest of his whole Dominions, tho this Nation and our Company may seem to be more immediately interested at present.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship sees we have in the inclosed Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King, made mention of our last Petition, and hope your Lordship will take a convenient Opportunity to back the same: For as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship knows, we have already suffered considerably by encroaching upon our Privileges, so we ought to be very careful, as much as in us lies, not to admit of any dangerous Precedents. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally we must say, We were very much surpriz'd the other day, when we understood by Letters from the Council of our Colony, that Capt. <hi>Long</hi> Commander of the <hi>Rupert</hi> Prize, who carries his Majesty's Commission for sinding out and fishing of Wrecks, should, under the colour of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, wherever he went, traduce our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking and Colony to all sorts of People upon that Coast, whether Natives or others, declaring that our said Colony was no other than a pack of Rogues, Vagabonds, Robbers, and broken Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, without any Commission, and that the King would not own them: nay further, he himself came into our Harbour, wherehe was very courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and respecfully treated by all our People
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95194:20"/>
there; in recompence of which he very ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made it his study all the while to seduce our Men, and did carry off one of our chief car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, which is a very considerable Loss in that part of the World, and in the Infancy of our Settlement, considering how necessary a Man he was, and the Difficulty of supplying his place so quickly as they may have occasion for him. This kind of Usage is really so provoking, that we cannot suppose but that the King may be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously pleased to interpose his Royal Authority for preventing the like usage in time to come, if his Majesty were duly informed thereof. So in the confidence of his Majesty's gracious Countenance and Protection, and your Lordship's hearty endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to procure the same; this is by Order of the Council-General, and in Name, Presence, and by Warrant of the Court of Directors of our Company, Signed by,</p>

We found the <hi>Indians</hi> on all sides in open War with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> their nearest Neighbours: against whom they besought our Assistance which we could by no means com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with, by reason of the present Peace and good Understanding between your Majesty and the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding this our just and peaceable deportment and inclination, and our certifying the same by Letters to the two neighbouring Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of <hi>Panama</hi> and <hi>Carthagena;</hi> We have, to our no small surprize, received certain Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that several great and warlike Designs and Preparations are on foot, and carrying on by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> against this Colony; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Justice and Humanity, as well as the

Treaties of Peace between your Majesty and the Catholick King, they now unjustly detain, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to deliver up the Persons and Goods, that were saved of a Ship belonging to this Colony, called the <hi>Dolphin;</hi> which by misfortune of spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Leak, was not long since oblig'd to run ashore and suffer Shipwreck near the City of <hi>Carthagena.</hi> All which have been no small inducement for us to have improved the frequent Opportunities we have had of taking Measures greatly disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to the Crown of <hi>Spain:</hi> Yet in order to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, as much as possible, any thing that might look like a publick Breach, until the same were laid before your Majesty, and your Royal Pleasure known therein: We have hitherto proceeded no further, than of granting of Letters of Reprisals for the People and Effects unjustly detained from us.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable the Lord High Chancellor, and remanent Lords of his Majesty's most Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Privy Council.</head>
            <head type="sub">The humble Address of the Conncil-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Company of <hi>Scotland</hi> Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi>

               <salute>May it please your Lordships;</salute>

            <p>WE think it needless to trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships with a repetition of the many Steps, Difficulties and Discouragements that we met with all along both abroad and at home, since the beginning of this Undertaking, the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable of them being already particularly known to your Lordships. But maugre all those Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we have with a great deal of Trouble and vast Expences settled a Plantation in one of the most valuable and impregnable Places in all <hi>America,</hi> situated on the North-side of the Isthmus of <hi>Darien,</hi> called by us <hi>Caledonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As no Nation in <hi>Europe</hi> ever begun any such Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement with so considerable a Strength of Men, Ships, and other Necessaries, as we did: so no instance can be given of any Settlement ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore made, that had so hopeful an Aspect in so short a time as our Plantation aforesaid.</p>
            <p>But to our and the Nation's inestimable Loss, we have very surprizing Advices of our Peoples having deserted the said Settlement by reason of Proclamations issued forth in all his Majesty's Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>America,</hi> strictly forbidding all his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95194:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Majesty's Subjects to hold any manner of Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with our said Colony, and that no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Provisions, Arms, Ammunition, or other necessaries whatsoever, should be transported or carried to them, either in their own Vessels, or any other Ship or Vessel for their use; and that under the utmost Pains, Penalties, and Forfeitures men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the said Proclamations. The certain Nature whereof could not but have put them in a desperate Condition, especially none of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices having come to their hands, tho we wrote to them at several times, by the several ways of <hi>Jamaica, Barbadoes, Antegoa, New-England,</hi> &amp;c. And sent them likewise an illimited Credit for buying of Provisions, till our own Ships and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits should come up to them.</p>
            <p>We have taken such further measures, as seem'd most reasonable to us upon this unexpected Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, but have too good ground to fear, that not only what we have already done, but even all that we are able to do, must prove ineffectual, if the King and his Parliament of this Kingdom, do not give some encouraging Mark of their Favour and Protection, to our said Company and Colony: Wherefore we have in all humble Duty petitioned his Majesty that he would be graciously pleased to take off the Force of the said Proclamations, and allow his said Parliament to meet at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in <hi>November</hi> next, or as soon as possibly may be, to give their Advice and Assistance in such a weighty and general Concern.</p>
            <p>Your Lordships very well know the great Losses, both of Men and Treasure, that we have already suffered by the unaccountable Proceedings of the Enemies of our Company and Colony: Nor can
<pb facs="tcp:95194:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
gainst us, unless his Majesty and the Great Council of the Nation fall upon proper and effectual Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures for supporting so valuable an Undertaking.</p>
            <p>May it therefore please your Lordships to take the whole Premises into your most serious consideration, and do us all the good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with his Majesty, that in your profound Wisdoms you shall think most expedient for supporting our Company and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's Interest, and give him an account of our present hard Circumstances, and how much the Honour and Interest of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion stands concern'd.</p>
