            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

GHOST. At St. James's.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>My Power once was dreadful to all,</l>
               <l>Corruption was not known nor did I fall,</l>
               <l>Into the Vices of the preſent Age</l>
               <l>But boldly did my Enemies engage.</l>
               <l>Cowards could never have my Approbation,</l>
               <l>Nor Villains live on the Spoils of the Nation,</l>
               <l>I did not enrich my ſelf or Family,</l>
               <l>Although I liv'd ſo Great, Poor did I die.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>THE Ghoſt of our once famous Protector, appears on every
occaſion to frighten our corrupt M—s, and hath drove
them from the Spot whereon they have acted all their Villany: The
Fox now finds his Cunning no longer of any Avail, the old Salmon
Woman has retired into the Country, ſo hath Bardoiph, and among
all the Caball there is only Lovegold and his Son Aquepulco, that
dare viſit the Lion, who unwilling to loſe their Places; and to be
called to Account for their paſt Behaviour, endeavour all in their
Power to Influence the Lion in their behalf. But the Ghoſt of Old
Oliver is continually reproaching them with their Crimes, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up all true Britons to revenge their Country's Wrongs, by tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them how he acted in his Time, that he never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>orgave any one
that behav'd ill, that he always having the Intereſt of the Nation
at heart, was continually ſeeking every Opportunity to Aggradize
her, that he ſo well ſucceeded as to cauſe her to be reſpected by
all Nations, that although he was an Uſurper, he fear'd not to put
Arms into the Peoples Hands, as knowing well however they might
Quarrel among themſelves, yet on an Invaſion they would all unite
to oppofe any Invaders. That as the late M—y had acted in
a contrary Manner, and ſeem'd on every Occaſion to endeavovr to
enſlave their Country, he hoped to ſee them brought to Juſtice for
their Villany, and an Upright ſet of M—rs appointed in their
Room, who will behave in a manner Reverſe to the Former. The
Great Man who preſides over all, has theſe Leſſons every Night
from the Ghoſt, whoſe Admonitions, ſet afide all the evil Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

doubted the Ghoſt will ſucceed in his honeſt Endeavours, and that
all Delinquents will be brought to Puniſhment, and all wrongs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
within the hope of all true Lovers of their Country.</p>
