            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>THe Righteous Man <hi>(saith the inspired Prophet)</hi> is Merciful to his Beast: <hi>Which Mercy, Compassion or Pittifulness consists not only in his</hi> not abusing <hi>them with excessive Labour, and unreasonable Stripes and Hardships, but in providing for them convenient</hi> Food, <hi>and helping to free them of</hi> Diseases <hi>and</hi> Infirmities, <hi>when by his own or other Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence or ignorant Conduct, Distempers are brought upon them; or rather in such a prudent and moderate Government and Use of them, as may prevent, and give no occasion for such Evils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis generally said, and very truly,</hi> That Man is the Vice-Roy of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, <hi>and to him i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> given Dominion over the Beasts of the Earth; but this Rule is not</hi> absolute <hi>or</hi> tyrannical, <hi>but qualified so as it may most conduce, in the</hi> first <hi>place, To the Glory of God,</hi> 2dly, <hi>To the real Use and Benefit of Man himself, and not to gratifie his sierce and wrathful,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53535:3"/>
               <hi>or foolish and wanton Humor; and,</hi> 3dly, <hi>As it best tends to the helping, aiding and assisting those Beasts, to the obtaining all the Advantages their Natures are by the great, bountiful and always benificent Creator made capable of; For as a</hi> Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd <hi>is the Ruler of his</hi> Flock <hi>and yet is bound to</hi> feed <hi>as well as</hi> fleece <hi>them: And as</hi> Angels, <hi>though of a kind</hi> superior <hi>to us, yet by Gods Decree are</hi> Ministring Spirits, <hi>and often imploy'd for the good of their Inferior</hi> (Man) <hi>so will not any</hi> wise, <hi>or (which is all one)</hi> good Man <hi>think it below him to descend to do good Offices to these</hi> under-graduated Fellow-Creatures <hi>of his, whom some with a proud disdainful Scorn call</hi> Dumb Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>and</hi> Brute Beasts, <hi>though yet they will haue a Voice to cry against their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions; and if all things were rightly weighed, the</hi> former <hi>would appear much more</hi> Brutish <hi>(that is, more Absurd, and acting more contrary to the pure Dictates of unbyass'd and indepraved Nature) than the</hi> latter; <hi>It being certain that</hi> Lyons <hi>and</hi> Tygers <hi>are not more</hi> savage
<pb facs="tcp:53535:3"/>

            <p>
               <hi>This is not said to undervalue the Noble Dignity of</hi> Humane Nature, <hi>whereon the Adorable All-bless'd Creator vouchsafed originally to impress his own</hi> Image, <hi>but to remind that Insolent Creature</hi> [Man] <hi>(too apt to forget it) of his miserable degenerate state, and to awaken him to aspire to that real Dignity which he seems almost wholly to have forgot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as in a former larger</hi> Treatise <hi>I have endeavoured to bring Man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, and prudently to govern himself (an Empire far more Happy</hi>

               <hi>Drivers</hi> beyond their strength and power of Nature; which for want of mercy, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion and Understanding is often done. And thence so many Diseases in this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, more than any other, do proceed; for they are not thus infirm from their Temperature or Radixes, but the same arises from, and is occasioned by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders &amp; Intemperances their Mannagers do enforce them unto, being by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>This innate Heat and Strength in <hi>Horses</hi> is further manifested by this, <hi>viz.</hi> Let the Season of the Year be never so <hi>Wet,</hi> or <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Unkind,</hi> yet the Grass will bring upon them little or no Inconveniency, though they lie out Day and Night, and though the same Grass and Pasturage will rot <hi>Sheep,</hi> and cause <hi>Cows</hi> to become unhealthy, as also that in <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> when the Air and Elements are humid and thick, whence do arise great Dews, which makes the Grass <hi>white</hi> like a <hi>Frost,</hi> that so turns the Stomachs of <hi>Cows</hi> and <hi>Sheep</hi> that they

               <p>ALL <hi>Riders</hi> and <hi>Drivers</hi> of <hi>Horses</hi> ought by all means to ride or drive them <hi>moderately in the Morning,</hi> if they intend they shall perform their Journey (or Day's Work) without prejudice to their Healths; for they generally eat most part of their Food in the Night and towards Morning, and also drink freely, which does in some measure indispose them; for <hi>full Stomachs</hi> do naturally hinder from performance of Labour, since Nature cannot equally endure two Burdens at one time. <hi>Exercise</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways dangerous, if it be violent, on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated Stomachs, whether in Man or Beast; for let a man observe, if he eats or drinks plentifully in a Morning, and then present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour strongly, or go a Journey after it, unless he be very moderate therein, he shall find himself much indisposed the first part of the day, his Limbs aking, hot and faintish; the very same is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in other Creatures, only they cannot make their Griefs and Inconveniences known, nor have understanding to observe the Rules of <hi>Temperance,</hi> either in Quality

or Quantity, or the apt Times and Seasons, therefore their Keepers ought to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, wise and considerate, and govern them aright, which they cannot do without considering, <hi>That the Stomach and Natural Heat cannot attend two Works at once;</hi> for when the Stomach is full of fresh Food, all the Powers of Nature are busie to lend their Assistance to help forwards <hi>Concoction,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time all the external parts, and whole Body seem to be in a degree indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, but after three, four or five hours (in which time the natural Heat has digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made Separation) then the Passages begin to be open, with the Pores, and the Blood and pure Spirits have their free Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, which gives advantage to the thin pleasant moist vapours of the Air to penetrate all parts, and to be suck't from without, as by Spunges, which renders all Creatures brisk, strong, lively, and able to go through with their work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Time, Quantity</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi> are three material Points to be regarded by every Rider and Driver of <hi>Horses,</hi> and he ought to consider the Strength, the Method and Possibility of Nature, or else he may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay heavier Burthens than they can bear; but the prime Lesson every one ought to learn, is <hi>[The Knowledge of Himself]</hi> and

to distinguish the Properties and particular Operations of his <hi>own Nature,</hi> &amp; what Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity carries the upper Dominion in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective <hi>Complexions,</hi> and according to the degree every one understands of himself, the same he is capable to know of all other Creatures, and so shall be able, on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, to vary the Rules of Order and Temperance, according to each Creatures peculiar Nature; for in <hi>Man</hi> is contain'd the true Nature of all things (how else could he be truly called, <hi>The Microcosm,</hi> or <hi>little World?)</hi> and if he would know any thing essentially, then first the same thing must be manifested <hi>in himself,</hi> and then this Knowledge is true, solid and certain; but all other Learning or Knowledge, which depends on Custom, Chance and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not a mans own; and therefore is but a bare Opinion, which most are apt to vary and change, and to have but little faith in, because <hi>such knowledge</hi> does not arise from the Root of their own Lives, but is forreign, spurious, adventitious, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from abroad, and taken up upon the uncertain Credit of the People, who rarely know any thing as they ought to know.

But so ignorant are many of themselves and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's Power, that when they are over-hot, weary, fainty, their Spirits spent, and <hi>Radical Moisture</hi> evaporated, the first thing they will endeavour to do, is (as it were) to force Nature to take greater Quantities both of Meats and Drinks, than she is able or willing to bear, fondly thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to restore Nature to her former <hi>strength</hi> in a moment; whereas by this means they do but the more oppress her.</p>
               <p>As <hi>heat</hi> does much abound in <hi>Horses,</hi> so for that very Reason, <hi>Stables</hi> that are close are very injurious to their Health; yet few <hi>Horse-keepers</hi> do imagine, or in their whole Lives once think of the great prejudice thereby done to their Horses, especially where they stand too much in their own <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Most Stables are so close that the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Influences of the <hi>Air</hi> are prevented from having free ingress and egress, by which means the constant stagnated Air there becomes of a gross sulpherous humid Nature, as may be perceived when you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The chief cause and use of <hi>Stables</hi> at first was for Shelter in extream Weather, as when there was much Rain, and then they were built like <hi>Court-houses</hi> or <hi>Hovels,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered on the top to keep them dry, but open on all sides, that they might in such wet Weather eat their Meat dry, but were loose to run at large when they pleased, which was a very Judicious and Commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way of keeping them; and (I am informed) this fashion is to this day ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by a Gentleman in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> who has the best breed of Horses for all strong Exercises, as <hi>Hunting</hi> and the like, in the whole Country.</p>

               <p>For these Reasons, <hi>Pond-Water</hi> is not so good as that of the <hi>River;</hi> and the continual drinking of such stagnated Waters will generate thick Humours and gross Blood, hindering the Circulation thereof, dull: the Appetite, and occasions many occult Diseases, the rather for that such Waters are subject to various Excrements of the Cattel that frequent, which cannot there (as in <hi>Running-Water)</hi> be purged away, but proves of evil Consequence, and causeth Putrifaction and Diseases.</p>
               <p>But here some will object and alledge, <hi>That both Horses and Cows will chuse rather to drink Pond-Water than River.</hi>——To which. I Answer; This doth often happen to be true, and no wonder; for I hope you do not expect your <hi>Horses</hi> and <hi>Cows</hi> to be better <hi>Philosophers</hi> than your selves, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing the Virtues and Vices of <hi>Waters;</hi> for the Pallates of Cattel are adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated

by Custom even as mens are; for if you accustom your self to Food that is not well prepared, or Drink that hath an ill smack, yet in length of time it will be so familiariz'd, and so stir up and awaken its own Property in the Body, that the ill smack or scent can hardly be perceived: So great is the power of every particular thing to strengthen and incorporate its self with its <hi>simile</hi> in the Body, whence does proceed the Possibility in Nature of making all things in a certain sort friendly unto it self. Now <hi>Pond-Water</hi> is generally the warmest of all others, and those Cattel that are used to it, had therefore much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drink it than other, the common use of it hiding the fulsome Taste and gross earthy Smell. But still, there are some <hi>Ponds</hi> that are constantly fed with good Springs, and others that in Rainy Seasons are plentifully supplied with <hi>Freshes,</hi> and the Water of either of these is very good and wholsom.</p>
               <p>I am not insensible that these Rules and Observations will seem strange, and (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) Ridiculous to the <hi>wise Iockies of this Age,</hi> since contradicting their beloved Prophet, <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> whom the Multitude admire.

The Dignity of their Nature renders them the <hi>Emblems</hi> of <hi>Innocency,</hi> and fit <hi>Metaphors</hi> for <hi>Virtue:</hi> Thus not only <hi>Princes</hi> by the Heathen-Sages are called <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and their obedient and well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd Subjects, their <hi>Sheep,</hi> to intimate that no other species of Creatures are more inclinable to good Order, or so readily governable; but even in sacred W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>it the People of God are every where denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>The Sheep of his Pasture;</hi> and Christ himself likens his Disciples and Followers to <hi>Sheep,</hi> and calls himself, <hi>The good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd that layeth down his Life for his Flock.</hi> And this was for the near Affinity Sheep have to Equality, and to the harmless in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Life and Principle, which Christs Sheep and Lambs do live in. But on the other side, he compared <hi>Evil Men</hi> unto, and called them by the Names of wild, fierce, savage, ravenous Beasts, as <hi>Bears, Tygers, Wolves, &amp;c.</hi> because that sort of degenerate men do live in, and are acted by the uneven fierce and cruel Nature and Principle, and have therein an Affinity with the Beasts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned. And thus there is as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect an Antipathy between the friendly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Principle, which governs and rules in the Hearts of Christs People, and those that are guided by his holy Peace-breathing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53535:22"/>
Spirit, and those other that live in the power of the fierce Wrath and uneven Nature, as between <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Wolves</hi> or <hi>Foxes,</hi> and the like Beasts, whose very sight does afright and amaze them, even more than that contrariety proceeding from their Radixes, <hi>Sheep</hi> being dignified as it were with a gleam of the Coelestial Principle of Unity, having no manifest Quality predominating; whereas on the contrary, all the before-mentioned Beasts of Prey have their predominant Quality standing in the <hi>fierce Wrath,</hi> as appears by their unsightly Shapes, their frightful Howlings or Noises that they send forth, their cruel Inclinations and bloody Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
            <p>To speak more plainly, <hi>Sheep</hi> are in Temperature moderately <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Moist,</hi> and in Complexion <hi>Phlegmatick-Sanguine,</hi> with a mixture of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> and if they exceed in any of the four Humours, it is in <hi>Moisture;</hi> their Radical Fires burn but gently, being of a good equal Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whence their sweet and amicable Natures and Dispositions do arise; For this cause all <hi>Inequality</hi> is an utter Enemy unto them, especially excess of <hi>Moisture.</hi> For they are very porous, by which the moist vapours of the Air do powerfully
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53535:22"/>
penetrate them on all parts, which causeth such Quantities of <hi>Wool,</hi> and does supply them with store of Moisture, which when the Air is humid, or too much wet weather happeneth, proves prejudicial unto them; for this cause <hi>Sheep</hi> can live longer in times of Drought, than many other Creatures, without Water, and receive less prejudice by the want thereof; though all Creatures are more or less nourished by this way, and do suck in their spirituous moist Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like Spunges on all parts; if this were not so, no Creature could subsist. For the attractive Quality and natural Heat do in a hidden way draw in the moist spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vapours, which the Element of Air does plentifully afford; and the more Humid the Air is, the greater Quantity of Moisture is received into the Body, which Nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms in a Magnetick Insensible way; but the same does more manifestly appear when the Season is wet, the Element of Air being then more imbib'd with Humidity than in drier times, and therefore most or all Creatures will then live with, and desire lesser Quantities of Water than when the Weather is dry, though the Meat and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour be the same. This may also appear in Man: If he shall live temperately in his Diet &amp; Exercises, so as he do not sweat, nor
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53535:23"/>
any other way affront Nature, to put her to the Expences of too great a Transpiration, then let him drink a pint or a quart in twenty four hours space (which is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Quantity for such whose Labours are easie) then observe that such an one shall make more Urine in quantity than he drank; and if the Season be moist and the Air humid, he will make near double the quantity, provided he do not eat Foods that are over Salt; for such do naturally heat the Body, and consume the thin moist cooling Vapours, which serve for the help of Concoction, and do comfort and refresh Nature. But on the contrary, if a man shall drink <hi>two or three Gallons in a day,</hi> as many do (though to their shame, and the Injury of their Healths, especially if their Drink exceed in strength) then it is to be observed, that such an one will make but half, or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And also, it is to be noted, that the more Temperately any shall live, and the smaller the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Food they eat, the more Urine they will make, that is, proportionably to their Drink; for Abstinency cools the Body, opens the Pores and Passages, sets the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirit at liberty, and strengthens the Attractive Faculty; for this cause, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable

time of Fasting makes all the Members and whole Body light and airy. But to return to our subject—</p>
            <p>The more <hi>Sanguine</hi> and equal any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are in their Qualities, the more apt they are to be put out of tune, when any affront or disorder is offered unto them; for this cause <hi>Sheep</hi> cannot endure any kind of Extreams without manifest danger to their Healths, they being sensible of every Inconvenience, whether it be from their Keepers, or from the Elements, by reason of their tender Spirits and natural Heats, so that every disorder wounds their Health, as if they be but driven a little too hard when the Weather is hot, or if they be coursed with a Dog, or the like, which puts them into an heat, in any such case, if their Keepers suffer them to lie down whilst they are yet hot, and this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e done often, it will make them break out with a <hi>Scab</hi> or <hi>Mange</hi> when they come into fresh Pasturage or about <hi>Michaelmass.</hi> Also, if they are <hi>Folded too close</hi> it will occasion the same Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; or if in Summer time and hot Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Shepherd do move them too often out of one place into another, as the custom of some is, who do not understand the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this delicate Creature, especially if it be in the heat of the day, it will keep
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53535:24"/>
them from proving or thriving, and also cause the same Distemper. So likewise much wet will Rot them; therefore Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds ought to be the most knowing, and careful of all Husband-men, since they are to preserve so timerous and tender a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whose Nature cannot endure any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality without danger.</p>
            <p>It will be convenient that all Shepherds in dry Summers, who keep their flocks in common Fallow-Fields or Downs, when Grass is scarce, and that they have no keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them but what such miserable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons will afford, should let their Sheep out of the Fold betimes in the Morning; not that they naturally delight to feed early, but in times of Drought, and where Water is not near at hand, then early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the Air is moist and full of humid Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, which powerfully penetrate, and are suckt in through all parts by the way of the Pores, which Nature has more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to perform when they are out of their Fold, because they spread themselves into fresh open places, where the Air is more humid thin and spirituous than in Folds, where the Breathings and Heats that do proceed from the Sheep, do make such Airs thick and hot, rather suffocating, heating the Blood and drying up the cool refreshing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53535:24"/>
Moisture: for this cause, if they are pen'd close, it gives them the <hi>Scab</hi> or <hi>Mange,</hi> as is mentioned before.</p>
            <p>You are to take notice of the Scituation of your Field or Downs, and in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing walk or slait your Sheep gently on the highest and and driest parts; or if there be Corn-fields or humid Pasturages, then feed them by the edges thereof for three or four hours, till they begin to be weary, and the heat of the day comes on; But remember that you do not use any Violence towards them, for violent Motion will heat and spend their Spirits, and dry up their Radical Moisture, and stir or awaken the <hi>Central Poysons</hi> and Original Heat, which ought not by any means to be awakened; and yet the same is sooner done in them (if care be not taken) than in other Creatures, by reason of their weak timerons Spirits and tender natural Heats.</p>
            <p>But when the Sun draws near the <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> viz. about ten or eleaven of the Clock, you ought to turn them from off the edges of such Pasturages or Corn-fields into the lowest Vallies or Clayie Grounds that your Field will afford, and there let them lie at large, and at the greatest ease you can, and as scattering as your Valley will afford, till folding time, which ought (if the Drought
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53535:25"/>
be great) to be late, otherwise not. You ought at all times to use Tenderness and gentle Behaviour to your Sheep, but more especially in dry times, and when the Grass is scarce; for a far lesser quantity of Food will supply Nature's wants when they are still, quiet and lie at ease, and a less quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water, than when they are hurried out of one place into another; for Motion, especially in hot seasons, and in the heat of the day, does cause sweating, and too great an evaporation of the Spirits, whence follows faintish Indispositions, that bring very ill Effects.</p>
            <p>This Order all Shepherds ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve from the latter end of <hi>May</hi> till <hi>August,</hi> if hot dry Weather continue so long, and being duly follow'd, will preserve your <hi>Sheep</hi> from many Inconveniences, especially from breaking out with the <hi>Scabb</hi> or <hi>Mange</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Michaelmass, or when they come to fresh Pasturage.</p>
            <p>As for the time of <hi>Shearing of Sheep,</hi> there are various opinions amongst Shepherds, some will have it sooner, others later; but for certain the best is to unclothe them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <hi>viz.</hi> in the latter end of <hi>May</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Iune,</hi> and many of the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters and Shepherds are of the same judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53535:25"/>
but out of a certain Policy they will not shear them then, because they should sweat in their Wool, which makes it wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, heavy, and consequently more for advantage; but that is not any part of my Work, I only aim to inform you the best and most Natural way and means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them sound and free from Diseases, and for that purpose it cannot be denyed but that the Shearing them betimes is best, especially in hot Summers; for their Wool is so thick and hot as it causeth them to sweat much, which evaporates the Spirits, and causeth saintiness, weakening the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat, which hurts the digestive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Stomach, and that by degrees disables them to go through an <hi>hard summer;</hi> for after shearing is commonly the hardest time for Sheep, especially for all <hi>Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ld-Sheep</hi> (which are the subject of my present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) whether it be a seasonable time or not; for <hi>Sheep</hi> will prove better after they are shorn than before: And if the latter part of the Summer be dry and hot, then there is but little Grass; if wet, the Sheep being newly unclothed, are cold and uneasie, and also hungry, but the Grass is then of a gross substance and but of little Vertue, it being the Declination of the Sun, all things fade and decrease in Power, Vertue and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53535:26"/>
Strength: And such <hi>Sheep</hi> as are by good Order well kept in the beginning of the year, shall be far better able to go through an hard time, (which generally happens in the latter end of Summer, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Iuly, August</hi> and <hi>September)</hi> than those that are out of heart for want of good order and keeping; even as a Cow which is well winter'd will give a far greater quantity of Milk the following Summer, than one that has been hardly kept.</p>
            <p>When Summers prove Wet, especially when the Rains come in about <hi>Iune</hi> or <hi>Iuly</hi> then these following Rules ought to be observed, whether your Field be subject to the <hi>Rot,</hi> or the contrary; for Wet is a far greater Enemy to <hi>Sheep</hi> than Drought, as daily Experience does testifie, though all Extreams are bad. Therefore the <hi>Shepherd</hi> in all such Seasons ought to let his <hi>Sheep</hi> continue in the Fold till seven or eight a Clock in the Morning, or longer, if the Morning be very moist; in which time the comforting Beams of the Sun, with the help of the Air, will in part, or wholly have exhal'd and dry'd up those moist slimy Vapours the night distill'd down on the Grass, which being gone, the Grass is much more wholsom. Besides, their lying long in the Fold doth beget a sharp piercing Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53535:26"/>
for Fasting does naturally digest and clean the Stomach and Vessels thereof from all superfluous flegmie matter, which is contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed by that too much moisture, which Grass in wet seasons does plentifully contain; for the action of the Stomach and Natural Heat is never idle, if the Creature be in health; so that when it is not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with its usual food, then it power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attracts or draws unto its self all such gross matter and supersluities, and casts it forth both upwards and downwards, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by preventing matter for the generation of Diseases; and when the Stomach is thus purged and prepared by due fasting, then a little inconveniency in food will not hurt, whether it be in quality or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; for a vigorous well prepared Stomach does not seldom make good Nouri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>hment of very ordinary food.</p>
            <p>Further, the <hi>Sbepherd</hi> is to observe to fold his <hi>Sheep</hi> before the Dews fall, whereby he may avoid many Inconveniences; nor need he fear that the long Nights lodging will hinder them from proving; for all Cattel that have clean sharp Appetites will eat as much in two hours as others will in four, whose Appetites are imperfect and Stomachs foul and obstructed through fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Juices and supersluous Humours;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53535:27"/>
Besides, <hi>Sheep</hi> do not naturally care for feeding in the Morning, whilst the Dew is much on the ground, except in times of scarcity, which seldom happens in wet sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; the Passages of Sheep are then furr'd with a moist slimy matter, which ought always to be cleansed, either by <hi>Fasting,</hi> or by some drying food, as <hi>Hay, Corn,</hi> or the like.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Shepherds</hi> observe these Rules, they may prevent most of the Diseases <hi>Sheep</hi> are subject to, since for the greatest part they are occasioned for want of good Order and skill, as Heats, Colds, Over-wet weather, being folded on New-plow'd moist grounds, or for want of a little Hay in the latter end of summer, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Iuly, August</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> when the Weather proves wet and cold. And though your Field or Pasturage will not Rot your Sheep, yet it may and does oft-times cause a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Diseases, many of which prove satal to them, as the Diseases of the <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Iaundies, Choller,</hi> and sickness coming of <hi>tough Flegon, Blinding, Stoppages, Water in the Belly, Red-Water, Coughs, turning Evil, Pains in the Ioynts, Lameness in the Feet,</hi> and the like Evils and Distempers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shepherds</hi> should likewise observe, that after an hard Summer and great scarcity,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53535:27"/>
when they put their Sheep into fresh Fields and Pasturages, where there is plenty of Grass, if then he intends to preserve them free from Disorders, he ought not to let them eat as much as they will, but only <hi>bait</hi> them (as they call it) and when they have eaten pretty well to take them out, and let them have a sufficient time to digest it, and then turn them in again; and continue this order for a Week, or two, or three, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ou shall see occasion; and though your Sheep do not look so full, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ove so fast as others, that <hi>lie at Rack and Manger,</hi> (as the Proverb is) yet in conclusion they shall gradually attain to the same or better Proof and Well-liking with others, and be abundantly sroer from Disorders and Diseases. This the Shepherd may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>That from Midsummer to Michaelmass is the most dangerous season in the whole year;</hi> and therefore then he ought to be most careful and circumspect. And of this I shall now proceed to give the true Grounds and Reasons in Nature.</p>
            <p>The most hazardous time for occasioning the <hi>Rot in Sheep</hi> is from <hi>Iuly</hi> to the last of <hi>September,</hi> especially if there be Floods or constant Rains, or moist foggy Airs.</p>
            <p>There are many Opinions, what the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53535:28"/>
matter is that does breed the Rot in Sheep, some s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y the cause is, their licking up of small white Snales, which much Wet does generate; others think that it is occasion'd by great Dews, and others have other Fancies, which I forbear to mention, being all besides the business. For most certain it is, that the true cause of this pernicious and fatal Disease in Sheep is too much Moisture at the season before-mention'd; for they very rarely Rot at any other sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the year, though there be the same occasion, as to the Weather, which all Shepherds and Sheep-masters ought well to consider. As for Example; Suppose Wet weather comes in after <hi>Michaelmass,</hi> viz. in <hi>Decemb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> or <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and hold so most part of the Winter, yet this shall not Rot Sheep, except some few in low Marshie Moorish Grounds, where they have store of Grass, and lie nights and days and have no Hay given them. Or if Rains and floods come in <hi>Ianuary, February, March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> and hold dripping till the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> or beginning of <hi>Iune,</hi> and then cease, and a dry Summer follow, this also will not cause Sheep to Rot, except (as is said before) in some certain low Grounds, a few may be infected.</p>
            <p>Hence it appears, that from the latter
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53535:28"/>
end of <hi>Iuly</hi> to the last of <hi>September</hi> or <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> is the time for generating this Disease, and wherein it reigns amongst Sheep, if that season happen to prove wet. Now the Reasons why Sheep are not so subject to this Disease at other times of the year, are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> If Rains or wet Weather come in after <hi>Michaelmass,</hi> in <hi>December, Ianuary,</hi> or the like, the season then is cold; which does check and consume the raw indigested flegmy substance or matter, which all grass is filled with in the latter end of Summer, viz. in <hi>August, September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> as appears by the Latter-Math or Hay made in those Moneths, what poor feeble stuff is it, in comparison of that Hay the first Spring produceth? And how little heart it affords to those Cattel that feed thereon?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> In this Winter-season most Sheep are in part kept with Hay, which dries up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

for all cold weather strengthens the natural Heat, sharpens the Appetite, and make the Spirits strong and powerful. Thus both Men and Beasts have sharper Appetites and stronger Digestions, and can without prejudice, eat more Food in cold seasons than in hot, and less Drink does serve them; for the stronger and more lively the natural Heat and Spirit are, the greater and sharper is the Stomach; but a less quantity of Drink will suffice Nature, because all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Heat, if it exceed the <hi>Medium,</hi> draws forth and evaporates the pure subtle Spirits, which impedes and weakens the Natural Heat and Action of the Stomach, and then the hot sierce original Fires of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> are stirred up, and become manifest in all the external parts of the Body, which indisposeth the whole, and makes the Members glow with an unnatural Heat; and therefore then all Creatures desire and require more Drink and less Food; but then they are not so strong and lively as in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cold, but faintish, and more apt to contract Diseases from every Inconveniency o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

are kept with <hi>Hay</hi> most part of the Spring, which as is mentioned before, destroys all the putrifying Matter; Besides, the Spring is powerful and lively, giving Life and Vertue to all Creatures, the warm and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening Beams of the returning Sun em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, the reviving Nature, fills all things with Spirit, so as that the <hi>Grass</hi> and <hi>Herbs</hi> then are freed from, or nothing so subject to that gross flegmy Substance most sorts of <hi>Herbage</hi> consists of in the latter Spring, by which all Creatures are healthier, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to withstand Disorders or Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences that happen from the Elements. Besides, <hi>Sheep,</hi> as is hinted before, have been at <hi>Hay</hi> a considerable time, which is a sound, healthy, hearty Food, suitable to their Natures, and drying up all Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities; nay, the very <hi>Season</hi> it self is an Antidote and Preservative; for how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, lusty and vigorous is every thing brought forth at the approach of the Sun? and how joyful all the Creation is, every thing seeming to sport it self in various Delights? But when once <hi>Phoebus</hi> drives down his fainting Steeds, and with shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Marches descends with his Charriot from the back of <hi>Cancer,</hi> then quickly does all Natures Wardrobe begin to be fullied, every <hi>Vegetable</hi> and <hi>Annimal</hi> droops, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53535:30"/>
and languishes, and the Earth mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Retreat of her Coelestial Lover, with his golden Locks, brings forth none but Sickly and Rickety Productions. And therefore no wonder if so tender a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as <hi>Sheep</hi> be at that time much more lyable to contract this Disease for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons aforesaid, than in the Spring.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly,</hi> But to come to some more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reasons; all Astrologers say, that <hi>Sheep</hi> are under the dominion of the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Sign <hi>Aries,</hi> into which the <hi>Eye of the World</hi> enters the 9th or 10th day of <hi>March,</hi> at which time the Sun is strong and powerful, as being exalted therein; and therefore then this glorious Coelestial Body by its benevolent Influences, chears and comforts all things; But on the other side, about the 11th of <hi>September, Sol</hi> enters <hi>Libra,</hi> where he is in some degree impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited or debilitated, as being in opposition to his Exaltation: These Coelestial Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do often take place, but more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when other Causes concur, as when Rains come in about <hi>Iuly,</hi> and continue till <hi>September</hi> or <hi>October,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly,</hi> You must consider that at this latter Season of the Year, <hi>Sheep</hi> have passed through the Heats of Summer, which have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53535:30"/>
awakned their natural Heat, stirring up from the Center the hidden, or sleeping Poysons, whence the Spirits on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are apt to be evaporated, and Diseases generated, which then meeting with Food full of gross Humors, and earthy flegmatick Matter, arising from declining Vegetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do then manifest themselves to the great prejudice of Health; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons those Moneths of <hi>Iuly, August, Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> and <hi>October</hi> are most dangerous both to Man and Beasts; Are not Men more sickly in this Season than in any other? and also Diseases then contracted more fierce and mortal, as <hi>Plagues, Rots, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rains,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
            <p>Not that it is to be doubted but <hi>Sheep</hi> may Rot, on have watry Diseases in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as well as in Autumn, but then it must be such as lie Night and Day in marshie wet low Grounds, living chiefly on Grass, which in all wet Seasons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving them some <hi>Hay</hi> at times with it, is very pernicious to them; whence it comes to pass, that most Years such Grounds do more or less distemper <hi>Sheep;</hi> As for Example, in <hi>Northamptonshire</hi> and <hi>Leicestershire,</hi> where their Land is rich and low, their Grass plentiful, and <hi>Sheep</hi> large, but the Country-Farmers are cunning
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53535:31"/>
enough to save themselves prety well, for knowing that their <hi>Sheep</hi> are subject to this fatal Disease, they are careful to time it, and bring them up to <hi>London</hi> Market, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are too far gone, and then our Citizens and dainty Dames do make good Cheer with this stately and (no doubt) very tender Mutton, and are as Blith and Merry at the Burial of their Carcasses in their own Paunches, as Young Men and Maids are at their <hi>Whitson-Ale,</hi> or liquerish Matrons at a Gossipping.</p>
            <p>Some do say, that there is a <hi>Spring Rot</hi> sometimes, but this is very rare, and when it happens, the chief Cause has been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the disorders of a wet Winter, where care has not been to give them a sufficient quantity of <hi>Hay,</hi> or that they have fed in low wet Grounds, where they have eaten too great a quantity of Grass, or else they have been <hi>Touched</hi> the <hi>Michaelmass</hi> before with the Rot; and though they do hold well all the Winter, yet when the Spring comes, the hidden Distemper manifests it self, for at that time Nature has a fresh and lively Motion, and what is Infirm will then appear.</p>
            <p>Having thus discoursed and laid open the Cause of the Rot in Sheep, from the Closet
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53535:31"/>
of Nature, and pointed out the time when, and by what means that Mischief is to be feared; so that I hope all Shepherds and Sheep masters will hence-forth take parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice when Rains, and much wet weather happens about <hi>Iuly, August</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> or when it is generally a wet Summer, and continues so till towards Michaelmess, and that they will remember, then is the Time to be feared of a general Rot. I shall now proceed to befriend them with some Directions, how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the danger in that case threatned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> You ought to keep your Sheep in the Fold till eight or nine a Clock in the fore-noon, or longer, according as the Morning is either wet or dry, the Air humid or clear; or if there be great Dews, as often there are in <hi>August</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> and also in <hi>October;</hi> and when the Sun and Elements have pretty well dry'd up the moist Vapours and Humidity off from the Earth, then you may let them out, and keep them on the highest Ground, and where it is dryest, and if the day prove dry, then you may about the middle of the day feed them in the lower grounds for two or three hours; and when it draws towards Evening, put them again on the higher places, always observing to fold them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53535:32"/>
the Dews fall, and let them be folded on dry grounds, it being injurious to Sheep to be out late at night, by reason of the humid Vapours which then arise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> If it do chance to rain a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the day, then you ought to give your Sheep a little Hay at night and in the morning, which is the surest Remdy against this Disease, and also many others; for dry Food is proper at all times for <hi>Sheep,</hi> especially in wet seasons, and ought to be given them once a day all the Moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned. There are likewise other sorts of Food, which are admirable for this purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> When the Weather is very wet, and the Air humid, with great Dews, to give them three or four times a week, either at night or morning, Oates in the straw, or Pease and Barley; this will prove an absolute prevention of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Disease; or if your Oates or other Grains be Thresht, then mix some Salt with them, and so give it them. If this be continued, and the afore-mentioned Observations followed, it will certainly prevent the Rot and other Distempers; for this dry Food does afford such a firm Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, that it dries up and consumes all superfluous Moisture in the Body. Now the <hi>Rot</hi> in <hi>Sheep</hi> is a <hi>Dropsical Disease,</hi> or
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53535:32"/>
the overflowing of gross Flegmatick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which in a little time spoils the Complexion, that it becomes of a pale wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terish Colour: It also generates hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed matter or knobs, corrupting the fountain of Blood, and causeth the Body to become cold; for the Bodies of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have their Original from the Watery and Earthy Qualities, as the Spirits have theirs from the Element of Air: But in what thing soever the Element of Water does too violently predominate, there all is poysoned, the Natural Heat loseth its power and proper Action, and Nature is put out of her way, and all the Humours and sweet Oyl, or Balsamick Vertues turn sower, or become of a stinking Rankness, whence proceeds Melancholly, and a sad heavy Spirit, which is the beginning of Sorrow and end of all Pleasure, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will so well prevent as continual supplies of the before-mentioned Foods, viz. Hay, Corn in the straw, or Thresht Corn mixt with a little Salt. This will certainly cut off the causes of this Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the bud, if other circumstances, mentioned before, be duely observed.</p>
            <p>There is another thing which will very much help to prevent the generation of this Disease, (the <hi>Rot</hi> in <hi>Sheep)</hi> viz. to have
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53535:33"/>
large sheds, or low wide Houses, like Barns, but open on all sides, to house your Sheep in, during wet cold Weather, which is a general Rule in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and when the day proves wet, many times they will keep them in the House all day, and give them Hay; but at all times they observe not to let them out before the Sun and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have exhaled the moist Dews and Vapours, and to house them again at Night, before the said Dews and Humidity falls; by this means they preserve their <hi>Sheep</hi> from the <hi>Rot;</hi> whereas otherwise their Land being low, their <hi>Sheep</hi> would almost every year be swept away thereby.</p>
            <p>But note, that these Rules and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations must be Timed; for a little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry and small Charge may prevent the Mischief; but if once your Sheep be taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then it will be an hard matter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them; you may possibly preserve them, with a great deal of care and charge, till spring, but then most of them will dye. Therefore be sure use these Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Remedies as soon as you perceive the Weather begin to require them.</p>
            <p>But when there happens three or four days, or a week of dry Weather, then you need give them Hay but once every other day, or a few Oats or other Grain,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53535:33"/>
either in the straw, or thresht mixt with a little Salt, as you see occasion. I would, by the permission of the Lord, be he that with four or five Loads of good old Hay, viz. Hay one year old, and a few Oates or other Grain, preserve and secure three or four Hundred Sheep from the fore-men tioned Disease in a general Rot, and I would not take any other measures than what are before specified.</p>
            <p>Those Sheep-masters that live in places subject to the Rot, may do well to change their Sheep every two, three or four years, for Hill-Country Sheep, which will, on the change of Pasturage thrive much better, and not prove so subject to Diseases; for change of Pasture for Sheep, and Air for Men, generally proves Healthy: In all Hilly poor Grounds, where Sheep do work hard for their Living, they do thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come healthy, strong and hardy; for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all Creatures does use highest dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to Arm and defend her self against those Inconveniences hard keeping and labour bring on her: But those <hi>Sheep</hi> that are bred in Rich Pastures, where they have Grass in superfluity, lying at ease, filling their Bellies without much labour or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like idle People, who feed to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity and to sleep; such Sheep, I say, are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53535:34"/>
subject to many Diseases; for no Creature can attain to Fatness, except they have Ease, and superfluity of Meat and Drink, which consequently renders them full of gross Phlegmatick Humours and Juices, which do in a degree deprave Nature of its innate Heat, and as it were suffocate the pure natural spirits and strength, and stop the Passages and contract the Vessel of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and give much flesh and little spirit, and that too very impure; Hence the Flesh of such Creatures that are large, and bred in low Marshie grounds, loaded with fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is nothing so sweet and pleasant as that of smaller Cattel, that are fed more moderately on high dry Grounds. Nor will their Flesh take salt or keep so well or long, nor breed so good Nurtriment, more especially in the said Moneths of <hi>August, September</hi> and <hi>October;</hi> for then the flesh and sat, not only of Sheep, but all other Annimals, is far more gross, and fuller of flegmatick Juices than at any other times of the year, and that's the Reason it will not keep so long, or take salt, as at other times; for where the Phlegm abounds in any flesh, or fat, there the pure Spirits and balsamick Vertues are weak, &amp; those few that are, are impure, therefore such Flesh presently turns to Putrifaction, the gross Juices and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53535:34"/>
hindering the Salt from incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with it; for where the spirituous part of flesh is hurt or wounded, either by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatness and phlegmy substance, or the Creature surfeited, or the flesh kept too long after 'tis killed, &amp;c. then such flesh will not take salt, nor ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> as others do. If you think this strange, ask the Tallow-Chandlors whether the Tallow be not fuller of gross Phlegm in Summer than in Winter, but more especially <hi>Iuly, August, September</hi> and <hi>October;</hi> Which does render all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures more subject to Diseases in that Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, than at other times, and their flesh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and apter to generate Diseases in men that eat it, as I have more clearly and largely demonstrated in our <hi>Treatise of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and the Nature of Things.</hi>

               <head>Of the Language of Sheep.</head>
               <p>ALthough <hi>Sheep</hi> have by Nature but one One only Tone or Bleat, yet they can communicate their Minds to each other by varying and altering the same, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the respective states of their Minds and Spirits, and suitable to the occasion, no less readily than Mankind do convey
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53535:35"/>
their conceptions by articulate words; for when such a Centre is awakened, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently such a sound is predominate in the Bleat; the like is to be understood in all other Creatures, even in Men; for every Word does vary in its Sound, according to what Property is awakened in the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Nature; and look whatever Property carries the upper Dominion, such a Sound or Tone is chief in the Word, and carries along with it the power of that Property or Principle, and by way of spirits it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporates with its similes, in those to whom such words are directed. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Radix of each word, so do they kindle either Love or Anger; for every Word does sound forth the state and nature of that <hi>Center,</hi> whence they <hi>proceed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which the great Prophet <hi>Moses</hi> seems to intimate, where he saith, That God brought all Creatures to Adam, and he gave them Names expressing their Natures, or according to their Natures. That is, The very Word in it self did comprehend and sound forth the genuine Nature, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, Disposition, Inclination, and what Form and Property did predominate; so that to hear any Creature named, was (then) to have a compleat Definition, or at least, Description of the true internal
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53535:35"/>
Nature, Virtues and Vices of that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which was the true Language of Nature, and the Original, which Man hath fooled away by suffering his Mind and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to enter into the evil, unclean, violent, savage, wrathful Nature of Bears, Tygers, &amp;c. But the Beasts and Birds do still retain that first natural Mother-Tongue, which the Creator endued them with in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and are not deprived of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have firmly and constantly kept and observed the pure Law of Nature; and therefore can understand by one single Bleat, Sound or Tone the various States, Inclinations and Dispositions of each other, as also express Fullness, Hunger, Love, Hate, Joy, Sorrow, where they should be, and the contrary; which no mortal Man can do by any one Word, Sound or Tone.</p>
               <p>As for Example; A Flock of Sheep of four or 5 Hundred are slaiting and grazing by a Corn-field, or inviting Pasture, if any one of them sees any pass in the Hedge, that <hi>Sheep</hi> shall slip in, and fall a feeding with silence, and not so much as Bleat, or hardly look up, except for fear, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing she is where she ought not to be; But observe the next <hi>Sheep</hi> that sees this that is got into the Corn, no sooner does she give a Bleat or two, but it does as sensibly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53535:36"/>
call or alarm the whole Flock, as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Words do men, or the sounds of Trumpets and Drums do Souldiers, and then presently they all fall to running into the Corn, making a noise, and Bleating till the whole Field ring of them. But at other times, particular <hi>Sheep</hi> in the Flock will bleat for sundry occasions, as when they want their Lambs or Fellows, as also when they are otherwise discomposed with Hunger, Cold, or the like, but then none of the rest will so much as look up, except their Lambs, which if they are within hearing, will run through the whole Flock, and quickly find their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Dams by their Calls. Also, they can distinguish the Shepherds Whistle, which is performed by his Hand, from all other Whistles, and will turn at the hearing of it, and many other things of the like nature; which experienced and observing Shepherds know to be true. So true it is that the Creator hath endued all the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Creatures with admirable Natural Gifts of Self-preservation, and distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sences amongst themselves, far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man, who yet was made a thousand degrees more sublime, but he wandered out of the Path of that pure Law and Way he was ordained to walk in, whereas those
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53535:36"/>
other inferiour Creatures have not, and therefore they all retain those Original Gifts bestowed upon them in their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures of Truth do testifie, That the Holy Antients in the first Ages of the World did understand this Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which is the true Language of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for thereby <hi>Adam</hi> gave apt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Names to all the Host of Heaven and Earth &amp; Seas, &amp; to his Wife <hi>Eve</hi> or <hi>Hevah,</hi> as also to his Sons, <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel;</hi> in which Names in truth were couched their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and what property or seed was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in each of them. And so, in several after Ages, divers of the Wise Men having the same Knowledge, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways give their Children such Names as did express and significantly demonstrate their Natures, Inclinations, and what Property or Quality was predominate in them: And likewise it did often express and sound forth the Providences or Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents (as we bindly call them) that did attend them at or near the Conception or Birth. The very same Rule they followed in the Appelations of Places and Cities, so that he that did understand the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Nature or Signification of their Names, did know what Quality or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53535:37"/>
had the Dominion in them, whether Vice or Virtue, Love or Anger, and the like; for they did not give Names by guess, or at a venture, or because the Parent's Name was so or so (for I do not remember one Person in all the Bible that bears his or her Fathers or Mothers Name) nor upon idle or vain Conceits, as most or all do now-a-days, without understanding or enquiring into the Signification of them. Whence one calls his Daughter <hi>Ursula,</hi> (that is, a <hi>little Bear</hi> or <hi>Cubb)</hi> when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps she is as pretty a Well-bred Wench as any in the Parish, and another names his <hi>Prudence,</hi> when she is the silliest foolishest Slut in the whole Town. These Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities those wiser Times avoided; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they chuse good Names, except they were suitable, and did naturally express their Natures and Qualities. For they did not seldom give their Children Towns and Places Names, which did express their Evil Nature, when the Truth of the matter so required. As the Name of <hi>Nabal</hi> signified <hi>Folly,</hi> and the Reason is given by the Text, <hi>Because Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness was with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it was a frequent Custom amongst these wise Antients and men of God, to change their Names according as they were
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53535:37"/>
changed in their Nature. As in the case of <hi>Abraham,</hi> his Original Name was <hi>A-bram,</hi> which does sound forth and signifie the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Nature and Principle of Wrath, which all Mankind had fallen into through Sin, Transgression and Violence; but when he turned his Will unto the Lord, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him, and when (as its said) the Word of the Lord came unto him [That is, when he became enlightned by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Principle of Gods eternal Love, and waxed Obedient unto the holy Voice of Wisdom] Then the Lord said, thy Name shall no more be called <hi>A-bram,</hi> but <hi>A-bra-ham;</hi> which is as much as to say, <hi>The Father of the Faithful:</hi> whereas <hi>A-bram,</hi> his first Name, signified a great Lord, or Father in Nature; but <hi>A-bra-ham</hi> denoted not only a Father in the outward Nature, but a faithful Father, in whom the Love and Light of God did govern. The same is to be understood of <hi>Iacob,</hi> when he wrestled with God, and overcame; then, and not till then, the Angel said unto him, <hi>As a Prince hast thou Power with God, and with Man, and hast prevailed; therefore thy Name shall no more be called</hi> Jacob, <hi>but</hi> Israel. Which latter Name does comprehend and truly signifie both the Divine and Humane Nature, in which all Mysteries lie hidden.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:53535:38"/>
This Mystical Language some of the Holy and Wise in all Ages understood, even to the time of the Manifestation of the Son of God in the Flesh, who himself said to <hi>Simon</hi> his disciple, Thy Name shall be called <hi>Cephas,</hi> (which does signifie, a <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Rock)</hi> after he had made that sound Confession, <hi>Thou art Christ the Son of the living God.</hi> On the Belief of which, as on a Rock, the Doctrine of Christianity is founded, and the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against it. So Panl was first called <hi>Saul,</hi> a Name of the sierce Wrath and lordly Spirit, as appears by King <hi>Saul,</hi> who disobeyed the Voice of the Lord, and persecuted <hi>David</hi> without cause, and so also did this <hi>Saul,</hi> the Servants of God, with all Violence, and a mad zeal, Imagining, that therein he had done God good Service. But when once the Lord h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>In a word, <hi>Sheep</hi> are the Emblems and lively Patterns of all Virtue &amp; Innocency; Disdain not therefore, O ye Shepherds! to learn those Qualities of them, since you know the Wisest <hi>Solomon</hi> sent some men to School to learn of the <hi>Ant</hi> or <hi>Pismire:</hi> But be you Sober and Temperate, endeavour to know your selves, and the degrees of your own Nature, which will enable you to understand all other things aright: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your Time, let no Moment (which is never to be recall'd) pass without doing, or being imployed in some good Work: Read good Books, especially that Book of Books, <hi>[The Bible]</hi> Turn your Eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, think <hi>What you are?

            <p>The <hi>Motives</hi> of our Retreating to these New Habitations, I apprehend (measuring your Sentiments by my own) to have been,</p>

               <hi>1st.</hi> The desires of a <hi>Peaceable Life,</hi> where we might Worship God and Obey his Law with freedom, according to the Dictates of the divine Principle, unincumbred with the Mouldy Errors and Fierce Invasions of Tradition, Politick Craft, Covetous or Ambitious Cruelty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>In order to these Great and Glorious Ends, it will well become, nay, is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible Duty of all that are <hi>Superiours</hi> amongst us, to make <hi>Laws</hi> and imitate <hi>Customs</hi> that may tend to <hi>Innocency</hi> and an <hi>Harmless Life,</hi> so as to avoid and prevent all Oppression and Violence either to Men or Beasts; by which we shall strengthen the Principle of <hi>Well-doing,</hi> and qualifie the Fierce, Bitter, Envious, Wrathful Spirit,

The use of such Superstuities is attended with many other evil Circumstances, as first, it occasions men to let their Farms or Plantations <hi>dear,</hi> or makes them labour very hard, or put their poor Servants upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Toil, and put their own, both Body and Mind as it were on the Rack, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure such things as are necessary, and then not content therewith, they must exchange them away for that which stands them in no stead, <hi>viz.</hi> To sell their most pleasant and fragrant <hi>Fruits, Grains</hi> and <hi>Seeds</hi> at a low and poor Rate, that with the procede there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they may buy <hi>Brandy, Rum, Wine</hi> and the like at dear Rates, As to give a Bushel of brave <hi>Wheat</hi> for half a Gallon of <hi>Brandy,</hi> or a Gallon of <hi>Rumbullion;</hi> What comparison is there to be made between a <hi>Twelve Penny Wheat Loaf</hi> and a <hi>Pint of Brandy, Rum</hi> or <hi>Wine?</hi> The first is the real Preserver of Nature, a durable sustantial Food, most grateful to Nature: The last serves only for a moments time to please the sensual Appetite; but its evil Operations and Effects stay behind, heats the <hi>Blood,</hi> makes the <hi>Veins</hi> glow with an unnatural Heat, destroys the edge of the <hi>Appetite,</hi> renders the whole <hi>Body</hi> uneasie, and fills the <hi>Mind</hi> with an innumerable Troop of wanton and vain Imaginations, which seldom are
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53535:59"/>
raised, but (as 'tis said of <hi>evil Spirits</hi> in <hi>Magick)</hi> they do some Signal Mischief, both to the Body and Mind. Or (to take notice by the way of other the like Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuities) which is most useful and beneficial to humane Nature, one Ounce of <hi>Nutmegs, Cleves, Mace,</hi> and the like, or 20 or 30 brave <hi>New-laid Eggs?</hi> (which of all sorts of Food are the compleatest, and being well ordered, afford the best of Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment).

            <p>Besides, all <hi>forreign Fruits</hi> and <hi>Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> are dear, and for the most part serve only to squander away Estates, advance Gluttony and procure Diseases, and the frequent use of them does sow seeds of <hi>Oppression,</hi> causing mankind to labour for that, which in truth he had much better have been without.

            <p>Moreover, the Disorders hence arising have put out the Eye of their Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and debauch'd the Natural Faculty of distinguishing between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil, Wholesom</hi> and <hi>Harmful, Pleasant</hi> and <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scous,</hi> and made them Bruitish, Sottish and Ignorant, even like <hi>Swine,</hi> to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in that Mire wherein by Custom they have long wallowed themselves.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53535:61"/>
not to destroy this friendly Quality or middle Nature, which is in every thing the Uniter and Preserver (as it were) of Soul and Body, it being that which gives the most fragrant Smell and pleasant Taste to all Drinks and Foods, and is the true Life, Light and Splendor of every thing in the <hi>Annimal, Vegetable</hi> and <hi>Mineral</hi> Kingdoms. And in what thing soever, be it Annimal or Vegetable, this friendly Quality is either naturally impotent, or impaired by pernicious Art, or other Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salty, thence forwards that thing is neither good for <hi>Food</hi> nor <hi>Drink,</hi> except the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noms of the <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Saturnine</hi> Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (which then are altogether predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) be first corrected; for if it be in <hi>Animals,</hi> then such Beasts are fierce, cruel, ravenous and unclean; If in <hi>Minerals,</hi> they are high Poysons; if in <hi>Herbs</hi> or <hi>Fruits,</hi> they are rank and fulsom, and also in some degree Poysonous; and all this by their natural Constitution and Quality: And the very same is to be understood when the Essential Virtues of things in themselves, most wholsome and pleasant, come to be hurt or destroy'd; which being done in the Preparation of <hi>Rum, Brandy,</hi> and all such sulpherous Spirits, 'tis evident how destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive the use thereof must be to Nature.</p>

And though in that Drink called <hi>Punch</hi> these Extreams are some-what allay'd or moderated by the friendly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, viz. <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Sugar,</hi> which do not only render it pleasurable to the Pallate, but also more tollerable to the Stomach. Nevertheless it must be granted that no Extreams can be made altogether <hi>Homogeneal</hi> by any Artificial Mixtures, or give Nature such ample Satisfaction as those things that are equal in their parts. For the first leave the Stomach and Desire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways either <hi>Craving</hi> and in want, or <hi>disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</hi> For when such improper Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of Mature and Immature Fruits and Unwholsom Liquors come into the Body, Nature's <hi>Limbeck,</hi> the Stomach, quickly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53535:62"/>
separates them, as sometimes you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive after you have eaten or drank such things, by the <hi>sower Belches</hi> and keen sharp matter the Stomach sends up into the Mouth; as when any shall eat <hi>Pyes, Tarts,</hi> or other Food made of unripe Fruits, tho' never so much sweetned to deceive the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, if one make a Meal of them, he shall find those sower distasteful Belchings, and also that they leave his Stomach unsatisfied. The same may also be said even of <hi>Ripe Fruits,</hi> when too great a number are jumbl'd together of contrary Natures. There are but few that are truly sensible of the many sore Evils and Dissatisfactions improper Mixtures in Diet brings upon the Body and Mind of Man.</p>
            <p>But certainly, <hi>My Friends</hi> and <hi>Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> you cannot but be sensible how freely, how bountifully the Creator hath given us all those things that are truly <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Necessary</hi> to support Life; and are they not familiar, and procured with little Labour and less Hazards, either to the Body or Mind? But on the contrary, are not all these <hi>Needless</hi> things hard to come by, so that oft-times the Acquest of them tends to the Ruin of the Soul and Body? And yet when all's done, the enjoyment of them gives neither <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to the one nor <hi>Health</hi> to the other, but makes our

               <hi>Wants</hi> the greater; for presently we shall want <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Physick</hi> to repair those Ruins which our own Intemperances have made; such improper Meats and Drinks being the original Causes of those cruel <hi>Belly-Akes</hi> and <hi>griping Pains</hi> in the <hi>Bowels, Feavers, Fluxes</hi> and <hi>Dropsical Diseases,</hi> both here and in the <hi>West,</hi> as also in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> where our English inhabit, all according to the Nature of each place, and as other Circumstances of Intemperances shall concur.</p>
            <p>But besides <hi>Diseases,</hi> there are many other Mischiefs that do attend all those places and Countries that accustom to give themselves up to Supersluity, and especially to the drinking of <hi>strong Liquors;</hi> for they deprave both <hi>Superiors</hi> and <hi>Inferiors,</hi> and are the Nurses of perpetual Crimes, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions and Disorders on both sides, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the first <hi>Fierce, Rash, Tyrannical,</hi> and unfit for <hi>Government;</hi> and the latter, <hi>Rude, Bold, Surly, Inhumane,</hi> and more apt to <hi>Contemn</hi> all <hi>Authority</hi> than <hi>Obey.</hi>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53535:64"/>
why will you arm your selves, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide thus to kill those <hi>innocent Creatures?</hi> Does not bounteous Mother Earth furnish us with all sorts of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ood necessary for Life? Wherefore then will you trouble your selves to kill those Creatures who have a have a Title by Nature's Charter to their Lives as well as you? Shall not the groaning of those Creatures call for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance? And must not there be a Retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? Can you think the Noble Race of <hi>Man</hi> was made to be a Tyrant over, and a Scourge unto the inferior Inhabitants of the World? No sure, he was to treat and govern them in Love and Friendliness. But instead thereof, he is now become their deadly Enemy. Therefore though you will not fight with, and kill those of your own Species, yet I must be bold to tell you, That these lesser Violences (as you may call them) do proceed from the same <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Bitterness,</hi> as the greater do, there being but one grand Fountain from whence all kinds of Evil, Violence, Oppression and Cruelty do proceed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be towards our Brother, <hi>Man,</hi> or any other of our Fellow-Creatures.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53535:65"/>
any Remorse or Bowels of Pity, yet it is still from the dark Root. 'Tis true, we read in Scripture frequently of the Killing both Men and Beasts; and 'tis true, the Lord did give the Nations liberty to kill and eat the Flesh of Inferior Creatures; But note, That this was not done until Mankind had departed out of his holy Law, and goverment of his divine Principle, into his sierce Wrath, out of which wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Principle he permitted the killing and eating of Flesh; so the Scripture saith, <hi>The Wickedness of Man had corrupted the Earth, and then the Lord said, My Spirit shall no longer strive with Man, Threescore and ten years shall be the term of his Life, &amp;c.</hi> That is, Man would not submit unto and be governed by his holy friendly Principle of Love and Light; therefore the Lord in his fierce Wrath (which man had rather chosen to precipitate himself into) short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mans Life, and gave him Flesh to eat; which sort of Food had the nearest Affinity to that <hi>Wrathful Spirit</hi> that had then gotten the Government in Man. But in Paradise, that is, whilst man continued under the sweet Conduct of the divine Principle, his Bill of Fare, allowed by his Creator in love, was only, <hi>Every Herb bearing Seed, and every Tree in which is the Fruit of a Tree</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:53535:65"/>
               <hi>yielding Seed, to you it shall be for Meat,</hi> Gen. 1. 29. Thus far the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness, as long as they were Obedient, God provided and fed them with <hi>Angels Food,</hi> pure and delicious <hi>Manna;</hi> but when they grew Disobedient, and Murmured, and nothing would serve them but Flesh, God gave them Flesh in his Wrath, and Quails in his Displeasure, which fitted them for Destruction.</p>
            <p>Furthermors, though you will not kill those of your own kind, yet your Children seeing and learning these Preparations of Oppression and Violence, they may come to be of different Opinions, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees kill one another with their Fathers Guns and Swords; for we know not what sort of People will come after us, nor what Spirit they may be of: Therefore it will be highly convenient for us to prevent the Growth of all Fierceness, Wrath and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, even in the bud, by our Laws and wholsome Customs; for there is no way or means that can or will so powerfully disarm the Rage of Men and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs, as <hi>Clemecy</hi> and <hi>Well-doing.</hi> Has not the Lord by his divine Hand of Providence brought us into a pleasant and fruitful Country, that <hi>flows</hi> (as one may say) <hi>with Milk and Honey,</hi> that is, all things necessary
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53535:66"/>
for sustaining Life and rendering it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, as far as Nature desires, or Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency will admit; why then should we by our Intemperance make i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Wherefore should we <hi>Christians,</hi> whose Laws and the Doctrines of our Saviour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to live in <hi>love</hi> &amp; <hi>unity,</hi> that we may be rendred capable to understand and enjoy that glorious Liberty of the Sons of God, which the whole Creation groans to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd into; why, I say, should we with <hi>wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Weapons,</hi> and breathing Death and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, terrifie, amaze and alarm not only one another, but also all the Inhabitants of the four Elements, meerly to gratifie our extravagant Desires and wanton Appetites, or furious Passions, and all the while to

suffer the friendly Law and good Principle of Gods eternal Love to languish, sigh and groan under the burthens of those intoller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Evils; in which slate Man often finds himself in great Trouble and Discontent, and wonders very much what may be the occasion thereof; not considering the true cause, <hi>viz.</hi> That their Hearts and Souls do move in the fierce Wrath, and that they do not do unto all as they would be done unto, nor live in Innocency and Concord with all Creatures, which is the true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine.</hi> Therefore to prevent all these Troubles, Dangers and Annixities, it will become us to be wise and Innocent in our Laws and Customs, that our Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Settlements may be a means to preserve us and our Posterity, and then our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Children will bless our Souls, and we shall as naturally attract the sweet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Coelestials, and also the benovelent Aspects of all Creatnes, as the Load-stone doth Iron; <hi>for every Like draws to its self its Likeness; for therein consists its highest Ioy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. A <hi>Third</hi> thing I would offer to your Consideration, is, That you will not suffer it to become a Custom, or to be lawful for any amongst you to wear any sort of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

or Clothing, save only such, both Woolen and Linnen, as our own Country does or may produce; nor of any other Colours, but such as the Woods, Seeds, Earths and Minerals of our own Land affords; By which we shall encourage, not only all Ingenious People, but also our own Commodities, and altogether dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Forreigners. Also, let it be a Custom amongst us for all our Superiors or Magistrates to wear <hi>White Garments</hi> made of Wool, which is not only more serviceable, but natural, whereby they will be good Examples to the lower sort, who in such things always take their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures from those above them. Besides, such Clothings are easier procured, and Custom has stronger Chains to hold the Multitude than the most severest Laws; And why should Christians so much desire those <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Saturnine Colours!</hi> whereas <hi>White</hi> is truly natural, the emblem of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> which God and Nature gives us without labour or trouble, it being convenient for us who have in some degree seperated our selves from the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this World to chuse all such things as have the nearest Affinity to Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, as well in Cloathing, as in Meats, Drinks and Exercises, by which we shall

not only free our selves from unnecessary Bonds, needless Changes, vain Fashions, burthensome Inconveniences we have many Years laboured under, but also teach our Posterity this important Truth, <hi>That the sewer things we need, the Happier we are, and the more quiet we shall lead our Lives;</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuity and Extravagant Desires being the Mother of all Need, Labour, Pain, Trouble and Diseases.</p>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53535:68"/>
the necessities of Nature, and no more; whereby the young and simple Ones will be kept from despising the Children of the Poor, and the Poor from admiring and envying the Rich; which will put a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual stop to the Carrier of Pride and Covetousness, since then all will enjoy the Goods of the Creatures, as it were, in equal Portions. Wherefore then should any strive, and sweat, and bustlo so furious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to arrive at great Riches, seeing that as they cannot be procured without such great Care, Labour, Violence, Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, not only to a mans own Body and Soul, but also to the whole Creation; so the Enjoyment of them contributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our real Happiness, but rather leads us into more Snares and Dangers than the Hazards and Turmoils of getting them did.</p>
            <p>The chief end men seem now to propose to themselves in the Acquisition of vast Riches, is, That they may eat of the best Lambs, Fowls, Fishes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and drink Wine and strong Drink to Superfluity, and to live in Idleness, and be clothed with soft and costly Rayment; That they may be admired by the Multitude, and dwell in sumptuous Houses, cramb'd with Rich and glittering Furniture, and such like Vanities;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53535:68"/>
All which puff up the Rich with a swelling Conceit of their own Worth, and causeth them in most Nations to despise, and count the Poor but as <hi>Dogs</hi> in comparison of themselves: And on the other side, makes the Poor secretly <hi>Hate</hi> and <hi>Curse</hi> the <hi>Rich;</hi> And hence usually proceed <hi>Tmuults, Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,</hi> and most of the publick <hi>Miseries</hi> and <hi>Desolations</hi> which happen amongst the Sons of Men: And what can be more fit and prudential, more necessary for the publick Repose, as well as the Happiness and Content of all Individuals, than that we should not only by our Laws, but also in our Examples and Customs, cut off these Roots of so many Evils, by grubbing up all Temptations to such Superfluity and Intemperance, and by so well cultivating our Plantation, as to remove all the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whence these Mischiefs are generated. And then we and our Children shall be free from those Disquietudes which chiefly render mans Life uncomfortable; free from wasting <hi>Laborious Days</hi> and <hi>Restless Nights</hi> in a greedy pursuit after <hi>Noxious Vanities,</hi> and half killing our selves with <hi>cruel Carking Cares</hi> &amp; <hi>Excessive Drudgeries;</hi> free from <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Also, let our times of eating be about <hi>Nine</hi> in the Morning and <hi>Five</hi> in the After-noon; for you will find that much more agreeable than a Meal at Mid-day, as commonly in use; for the central Heat or Eye of the World being then in the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, hath great power to awaken the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat, and also to evaporate it, and therefore at that time, most People, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in hot Weather, do feel themselves more hot and indisposed than either in the Morning or Afternoon; besides, all that would preserve their Health, ought to fast a proper time between Meals, that so the Stomach and Natural Heat may the better concoct, and make a perfect seperation, whence is generated good Blood, and brisk lively Spirits; besides, a long Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings

than <hi>Flower:</hi> But give me leave to tell her, that <hi>Bread</hi> has passed through a strong fiery Preparation, which has, as it were, broken the very heart of it; besides, it does more or less retain those sulpherous Vapours it received in the Oven, which are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious; also Salt being generally mixed with it, makes it so much the worse, Salt being of a sharp fretting Nature, apt to incorporate with the Venoms in such Sores, and so advance and encrease them.</p>
            <p>What is said of <hi>Bread</hi> is clearly manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this, <hi>viz.</hi> Put what quantity you will of <hi>Bread</hi> into Water or Milk, and it will not thicken nor become of so strong a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance as it will do with a small quantity of <hi>Flower.</hi> For this cause Milk and Water thickned with <hi>Flower,</hi> (provided it be not thicker than <hi>Milk-Pottage,</hi> and do but just boyl up) is one of the healthiest Foods in the World for all Ages, but especially for Children and Old People; for it does not only administer wholsom Nourishment, but naturally opens the Passage of the Stomach, and powerfully carries the Windy matter downward, and causeth it to break away with case. This sort of Food is good for all Women, but more particularly those that are troubled with Fumes and Windy Vapours flying into the Head; nor doth it

bind the Body, as some ignorantly imagine, though sometimes it does prove beneficial in <hi>Looseness</hi> and <hi>Fluxes,</hi> but that does not proceed from its binding Quality, but from its sweet friendly Nature, by moderating those sharp keen Poysons that are by some Intemperance or Accident awakened in the Bowels.</p>
            <p>There are several other particulars which might be recommended to your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and Use; but if you duely follow these, and continue to walk in the strait Paths of Nature, your Eyes will be daily more and more enlightned, and you will come to see and discern in all things what is <hi>good, wholsom, safe, proper</hi> and <hi>natural,</hi> and the contrary, so as to chuse the one and refuse the other.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To which I <hi>Answer;</hi> This Objection is some-what like that of the <hi>Iews</hi> of old, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting whether or no they should put to death Innocent <hi>Iesus; If we let this Man alone,</hi> cry'd they, <hi>the Romans will come upon us, and take away our Place and Nation.</hi> Whereas on the quite contrary, for their

not only to one another, but to all the <hi>Host</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> have precipitated your selves into the fierce Wrath of God and Nature, whence have been invented all <hi>Guns, Powder, Bullets,</hi> and other hellish Engines of Destruction, by which you do not only plague and torment and butcher one another, but all other Innocent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whom the great Jehovah hath made for his Honour and Glory, and to sing forth his Praise, by whose Power and divine Hand we are sustained; for he bountifully gives us our daily Bread without labour of Body or perturbation of Mind; therefore in our way and according to our nature, we joyfully chaunt forth <hi>Hellelujahs</hi> to his Name, and rest satisfied with his good pleasure.</p>
            <p>But depraved <hi>Man</hi> will not suffer us in peace or safety to go on with that Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for which we were made, but declares himself our Enemy, and causelesly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims War against us, and by force and fraud, open Violence and secret Stratagems endeavours, where-ever he can catch or sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize us, to deprive us of that Life which God hath given us.</p>
