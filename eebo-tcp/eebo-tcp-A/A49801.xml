         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Will not trouble thee with any tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Preface, or Epistle Dedicatory;
but onely in a few words acquaint thee,
1. With the subject of this Treatise.
2. The manner how its handled. 3. The
use that be made of it.</p>
            <div type="subject">
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>The Subject is noble and excellent: it is that glorious Kingdom, and special
Governmentt of the <hi>Supream, Universal, and Eternal King,</hi> which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
if not the adoquate, subject of the Holy Scriptures, which were revealed
from Heaven; and without which, neither Men nor Angels could have known
much of it. For as it is the Kingdom of God, so the Word of God must inform
us of it. <hi>Angels, Prophets, Apostles, and Christ</hi> himself spake of it, and it was
<pb facs="tcp:64164:3"/>
the principal matter of the Doctrine. This Government was contrived before the
World was; and, after time began, it was one of his principal Works, wherein
once made known by Revelation, we may read more of God, of his deepest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
and of his perfections, then in the vast Volume of Heaven and Earth. The
Doctrine thereof doth so much concern sinful Man, that upon the knowledge
thereof depends his Eternal Salvation. This Kingdom should be the chiefest sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
not onely of our most serious and retired Thoughts, but of our Discourse; that
it might be made known to the following Generations, till time shall be no more:
and it will be the matter of that Heavenly Musick and Melody, which Saints
and Angels shall make in the Temple of Eternal Glory; <hi>For all thy Works
shall praise thee, O Lord, and thy Saints shall bles thee. They shall speak of
the Glory of thy Kingdom, and talk of thy power. To make known unto
the sons of men His mighty Acts, and the glorious Majesty of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Thy Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and thy Dominion endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
throughout all Generations,</hi> Psal. 145. 10, 11, 12, 13. This Kingdom
did commence upon the Creation of Angels and of Men; whom both, He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
according to different Rules, especially after the Fall and Promise of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer:
for then He new-modelled the Government of Mankind, and of that
new Model there were three degrees: The first, continued from the times of
<hi>Adam,</hi> till the exaltation of Christ at His Fathers right hand. The second,
which is more excellent began to be administred by Christ glorified, and shall not
determine till all Enemies, even Death the last, shall be destroyed. The third which
is most glorious, shall commence upon the final Judgment, and shall be of endless
date. This is the subject.</p>

               <head>II.</head>
               <p>For the manner of handling of it the Language is plain, and rather rude then
polite, and more Grammatical, then Rhetorical: for my desire was to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
I had no design to please the curious, but, by plain Doctrine to inform the
Vnderstanding; by clear Method to help the Memory; and by the divine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
matter, rather than by excellency of words, to work upon the affection, and
wind into the heart. The very Subject, being a Kingdom, did dictate the Method,
and the Scripture furnished me with suitable Expressions. I do not proceed by way
of Dialogue, or of Catechisms or of Probleme, or of Systems, or of Sermons. I
thought good, and took the liberty, to deliver positive Doctrine in a continued Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
yet in a certain method; and so to draw on the Reader from one head to
another and from one part of this Government to another, till he come to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of that perfect and most glorious degree, wherein God shall be all in all. In
some particulars I deliver my opinion yet with submission to the judgment of the
more Learned and Judicious. I desire no man to believe any thing delivered
in this Treatise, which shall not be found agreeable to the Holy Scriptures.
To seduce, and mislead the meanest Christian, would trouble me much. If the
more understanding discover my imperfections, I desire him to pardon them: if
any passages be amiss to correct the mistakes, and not too rigidly censure the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
We all have much of Man in us; we are yet in the flesh, and many are our
imperfections; and mine more then those of others. And if every Reader shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
himself to be a man, as yet in the flesh, I shall do well enough. Let none
impute to me the <hi>Errata</hi> of the Press, though some few may be gross: for I was
for the time of Printing at a great distance. Some things in this work I onely
touch, intending a more distinct discussion in another Book, (which is an Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>) This for the manner of handling.</p>

               <p>The use of it may be the same with that of other Systems, and larger Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms;
What it may adde, I leave to others for to judge. It may serve to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
us more particularly with the nature of that Kingdom, whereof many
speak, and which few do understand. It may help to improve our Knowledge of
the Principles; to understand the Scriptures more clearly; to direct younger Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
who intend the Ministery; to bring some Controversies to an Issue. It may
give occasion to men of more excellent gifts, out of Scriptures, to improve the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of saving Doctrine:</hi> And, for the present, it may testifie, that notwithstanding
all our Divisions and Alterations, the substance of the Ancient and Apostolical
Doctrine remains amongst us. I desired to do some good unto this poor Church:
and if any good be done, it is not I, but the Grace of God in me; who desired to
serve in this, as in other things, the great and glorious Monarch of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
To whom be glory everlasting, <hi>Amen.</hi>

were new and different from the former. God acquires a new Power,
requires a new Obedience, and orders Man to Eternal Rewards another way. And
because these are high Matters, great Mysteries, glorious Designs, and many of them
far above the reach of Mans Reason; therefore it's necessary, that we have some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

God must give it: and this he hath done. The Rule is at hand; even the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>1</label> The Mind of God, are his Thoughts and Counsels concerning this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as known unto himself. For the Wisdome of God contrived and model'd
this Kingdom before the World was, and his Will decreed it. <hi>For God ordained
these things before the World to our glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 7. These his Thoughts and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
at first were known onely to himself, and to none other: <hi>For what man knoweth
the things of a man, save the Spirit of Man which is in him? Even so, the things of
God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 11. Therefore, before there can
be any knowledge of them, God must express himself, and communicate his Mind
unto Angels or Men, who alone are capable and fit to receive the knowledge of his
Minde made known to them. This Expression and <hi>Revelation</hi> of himself, out of
himself, is called, <hi>The Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Word of God is; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> 1. A Word. 2. The Word of God. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a word, is to express, or represent the mind of the Speaker. The end of it,
is to make it known to another, to whom it is spoken. For the end of my speech,
and so of speech in general, is to communicate my mind unto others, who know it
not. So the Word of God, declares the Mind of God to Angels or Men who know it
not. God is the Speaker; his Mind the thing spoken: his speech is that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he expresseth and maketh known his Mind. By <hi>Word,</hi> I do not understand that
Word which was in the <hi>Beginning, and was with God, and was God, and by which the
World was made,</hi> Joh. 1. 1, 2. For that Word was a clear and full expression of God
himself to himself; the brightness of his glory, and the express Image of his Person.
This was the <hi>Word</hi> in himself: But this Word is an expression of some part of his
Mind out of himself.</p>
               <p>There be,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> First several ways: Secondly, divers degrees of God's Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
1. Several ways; for he may and doth express himself by his Works, and
make his Works his Word: <hi>For the Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sheweth his Handy-work,</hi> Psal. 19. 1. Not onely the Works of Creation, but
of Providence, speak much of Gods glorious perfections; as of his Wisdome, his
Power, his Goodness, his Justice, his Mercy. He may express himself by Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
by Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by an audible Voyce to the outward Senses, or by Impression up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the inward and common Sense, or by inspiration immediatly unto the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Souls of Men. <hi>For as God [at sundry times,] so he spake [divers ways] to the Fathers by
the Prophets,</hi> Heb. 1. 1 How he spake to Angels and Man at the first Creation, we
know not. The Expression, by Inspiration and immediate Vision, is the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and excellent: For by that the persons inspired know not onely what the
things spoken are but that it is God that speaketh. He expresseth himself by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
as he wrote the Ten <hi>Words,</hi> or <hi>Commandements,</hi> of the <hi>Moral Law</hi> in two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of Stone; and at length, in process of time, caused the whole Body of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
concerning his <hi>Kingdom</hi> to be written. And hence that Book, with all the
parts thereof, concerning this Kingdom, is called the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> which, both
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64164:11"/>
in regard of the Author, the Matter, and the Contexture, is the most excellent
Book and Writing in the World. But before I come to speak of them, I must
observe the several degrees of Gods expression, and signification of his Mind to
Man.</p>
               <p>The several degrees of God's expression of his Mind,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of this Kingdom, are reducible to Two. 1. He spake Immediatly unto
man. 2. Mediatly by man, unto Man: For God spake unto the Prophets and
Apostles, before he spake unto others by them. The Word of the Lord came
to the Prophets, before they could signifie and declare it to the people. And the
Matter and Doctrine of the Scripture was first communicated by <hi>Inspiration and
Revelation,</hi> before it could be infallibly communicated unto others, either by
Word or Writing. The holy men of God spake as they were moved by the
<hi>Holy Ghost, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 21. For they must first be moved and inspired by the <hi>Holy
Ghost,</hi> before that they spake unto any man, that which they received immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
from God. <hi>Paul</hi> received not the Gospel of man; neither was he taught
it, but by the <hi>Revelation of Jesus Christ,</hi> Gal. 1. 12. And the mystery of Christ
was revealed unto the Apostles and Prophets by the Spirit, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 5. In this
respect it is said, <hi>that all Scripture</hi> (that is, all the Doctrine of Scripture) <hi>is given
by inspiration of God,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16.</p>
               <p>Thus God speaks immediatly to man; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> and secondly, mediatly by
man to man. And this he doth two ways. 1. By infallible and extraordinary
Teachers. 2. By ordinary men not immediatly inspired: yet both of these
agree in two things. 1. That God speaks by both to Man, and both speak from
God. 2. That the matter spoken by both is the same: For if the latter and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Teachers, do not speak the same things which the former did, God did
not speak by them. And the Doctrine of the former, ought to be the Rule of
the Doctrine of the latter. First, he speaks by extraordinary men: and these
are Prophets and Apostles, to whom he did reveal his wisdome, not that they
should conceal it, but that they should declare it to others. And these expressed
the mind of God two ways: 1. By Word: 2. By Writing: And they were
infallibly directed in both, to a Word, to a Letter. For the holy men of God
spake as they were moved by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> (as before): And so did write;
otherwise their Doctrine had not been infallibly true. It's said, not onely that
the <hi>Word,</hi> but the <hi>Scripture: all Scripture</hi> was given by inspiration of God.</p>
               <p>And now,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>6</label> at length, we are come to the Scriptures. That the Doctrine and
Word of God should be written, was no ways necessary in respect of God: yet
in respect of the frailty and corruption of man, the <hi>Divine Wisdome</hi> thought it
expedient (if not necessary) to express himself by Writing. God could have
supplyed all defects of man<hi>'s Vnderstanding, Memory, Vtterance,</hi> by immediate
inspiration and direction, as he did at first, and will do in Heaven: yet he
thought good to make use of Writing, which was a more certain, and ordinary
permanent way of continuing and propagating his Truth to many Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
for Writing is a lasting <hi>Monument</hi> and <hi>Record.</hi> Whether the Word was
written, or any part of it upon Record, before the time of <hi>Israels</hi> deliverance out
of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> we do not certainly know: Yet this is certain, that God spake unto
man from the <hi>Beginning.</hi> For <hi>Abel</hi> offered a better Sacrifice then <hi>Cain,</hi> by
Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4. But where there is no Word, there is no Faith: And <hi>Enoch,</hi>
by Faith, pleased God: but this could not have been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he had not believed that
God is, and that he is a Rewarder of such as diligently seek him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. yet
this he could not believe, without the Word of God. If any should say that he
knew all this by the Light of Nature: The answer is; 1. The Light of Nature,
is the Light of God. 2. That God should reward sinful, guilty man with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
glory, could not be known by Reason, looking upon the Works of Creation,
but by Revelation from God himself, or the instruction of man, according to
that Revelation. The first Books and Writings of God's Kingdom, now extant,

are those of <hi>Moses;</hi> as the last is the Revelation of <hi>John</hi> the Divine. And this
<hi>Canon</hi> of the Scripture, was finished within the space of Two Thousand Years,
or thereabout; and the Authors and Pen-men of them were all the Posterity of
<hi>Jacob</hi> (if <hi>Luke</hi> the Evangelist be not excepted). The several parts thereof were
written, as they were revealed at several times. They are the most ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
in the World known unto us. They are either Historical, or Doctrinal,
or Prophetical. The Historical reacheth the Creation: The Prophetical, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the World, and toucheth upon Eternity to succeed. They were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> two Languages used in the midst and Center of the
then known World. That <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Malachy,</hi> and all the rest of the Books,
should be written in the same <hi>Hebrew,</hi> seems strange: For, that any Nation
should continue their Language the same, without alteration (at least) in the
Dialect, for so many Generations, is not probable, though possible. Yet it may
be, God did so order it, that it should be published in the Learned, not the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Language of that People. For the Learned <hi>Greek,</hi> which is now in use
amongst Schollers, is the same, which was used near Two Thousand Years ago:
Or it may be, that <hi>Ezra,</hi> or some inspired Prophet, after the Captivity, might
gather them into one Body, and Volum, and turn them into the same <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
wherein we enjoy them. The <hi>Old Testament,</hi> which is the former part of this
<hi>Canon,</hi> was translated into <hi>Greek,</hi> before the Incarnation of our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and made way for the <hi>New Testament,</hi> the second part, and for the <hi>Gospel</hi>
to be preached in all Nations. The Original Copies are properly and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<hi>authentical Divines,</hi> and infallible; Transcripts and Translations, secondarily,
and so far as they agree with the Originals, and no further.</p>
               <p>That is true of the whole body of the Scripture,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>7</label> which the <hi>Divine Apostle</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
of his Doctrine, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4. That it was most excellent; 1. For the

tended unto.</p>
               <p>1. For the subject it was most excellent, even the Word of Life, and that
Eternal Life, which was with the Father, which was the life and light of men,
which was made flesh, and now is glorified at the right-hand of the Father.</p>
               <p>2. The truth of it was certain, and infallible: For,</p>

which was manifested: They had seen it with their eyes, looked
upon it, and handled it with their hands.</item>
                  <item>3. Their Declaration of it was agreeable to the Manifestation, and
their knowledge of it: For that which they had seen and heard,
they did declare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </list>
               <p>3. The end was Fellowship with the Apostles themselves; and their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
was with the <hi>Father,</hi> and with his <hi>Son Jesus Christ.</hi> And they wrote
these things, that the joy of their Disciples might be full. In like manner; The
subject of the Scriptures is the Kingdom of God, and that Eternal Word which
was with the Father. The truth thereof is most certain, and infallible, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of God's Revelation, the knowledge of the Prophets, and Apostles, and

               <p>In this extraordinary Communication of God's mind to Man by man,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>10</label> I will
pass by his manner of expression at sundry times, and in divers manners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the
Prophets to the Fathers, and take special notice of his speaking to man by man,
in the fulness of time, and in the latter days: And I will consider,
<list>
                     <item>1. The persons by whom he spake.</item>
                     <item>2. The matter spoken, as it was strange and new.</item>
                     <item>3. The confirmation of the Doctrine taught, so far as it was new.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. The principal persons were Christ and his Apostles: For in these last days
(saith the Apostle) he hath spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath made
Heir of all things; By whom he made the Worlds, who was the brightness of
his Fathers glory, and the express Image of his Person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2, 3. He was more
excellent then the Angels, then <hi>Moses,</hi> then all the Prophets: He was the
great Prophet, acquainted with his Fathers secrets, taught the Doctrine of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Life, confirmed the same by his Holy Life his glorious Miracles, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it with his bloud. Besides, God spake by the Apostles, and especially after
they had received the Holy Ghost, sent down from Heaven by Christ glorified,
according to his Promise. These made up the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. They taught Doctrine, that for the matter was new: For, besides the
<hi>Morals</hi> formerly known, and other Points revealed in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> they
did declare and write by the infallible direction of the Holy Ghost, That Jesus
of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> born at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> crucified at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was the Son of God, was
risen again from the dead, ascended into Heaven, made Universal King, and an
everlasting Priest, makes intercession in Heaven: That remission of sinnes, and
eternal life upon condition of Faith in him as glorified, was promised, and to
be preached to all Nation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Jew first, and then unto the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>3. Because these things, though not contrary to Reason, yet far above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
were <hi>New,</hi> and tended to the alteration of the former administration of
God's Kingdom, and many former Laws given by God unto the Fathers, and
the abolition of Religion that was then established in all Nations; therefore it
was confirmed by the new and excellent gifts of the Apostles, the great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
miracles done in the Name of Christ; the gifts of the Holy Ghost from
Heaven upon such as heard and received this Doctrine, by the conversion of
Jews and Gentiles, and this by mean and contemptible men. These were spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Works of the Supream and Eternal Providence, and such as the like had not
been done since the Creation, nor ever since the times of those Apostles, who
could speak in the Languages of all Nations to whom God sent them, so as the
unlearned might understand them. These taught first by word of mouth, and
then by Writing, till the Canon of the New Testament was finished: and the
Originals of their Writings were kept in the Churches they planted, and after
composed in one body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64164:13"/>
Thus far God spake to man,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>10</label> by man infallibly inspired, both by word of
mouth, and by Writing. He speaks also to man, by ordinary men, who are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
infallible; but onely so far as their Doctrine shall agree with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Inspirations, and Revelations. For the Word of God was always in the
<hi>Church,</hi> and his Divine Revelations were always the Rule of ordinary Teachers:
And, in matter of Religion, they had no Warrant to teach any thing, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that Rule. These ordinary Teachers were Fathers, Masters of Families,
every Neighbour and Brother, which had ability and opportunity. Amongst
the Jews, the ordinary Prophets, Scribes, Lawyers, who were learned in the Law
of <hi>God,</hi> Priests and Levites. But the principal amongst these are the Learned,
who have taken that charge upon them, according to a Lawful Call, make it
their chief business, to whom maintenance, by <hi>God</hi>'s institution, is due. These<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in
the <hi>New Testament,</hi> are called <hi>Pastours, Teachers, Bishops, Elders, Ministers,</hi> who
take charge of mens souls. This distinction of Teachers in the times of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
may be grounded on that Text; <hi>When Christ ascended up on high; he led Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
captive, and gave gifts to men. And he gave some Apostles, some Prophets,
some Evangelists, some Pastours and Teachers,</hi> Ephes. 4. 8, 11. The extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
were Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists: The ordinary were Pastours and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.
And these later, as well as the former, were given for the perfecting of
the Saints, for the work of the Ministery, for the edifying of the body of Christ,
<hi>ver.</hi> 12. These also may teach the mysteries of God's Kingdom by word, and
by writing. Yet neither their words nor writings were of equal authority with
the words and writings of the Prophets and Apostles. For the Authority of
their Doctrine presupposeth, that it is contained in the Holy Scriptures, and
that the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God; and that those which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
to be the Holy Scriptures are so indeed. This gives occasion to examine
what force may be in the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church, to prove the Scriptures to be
the Word of God. This cannot be done to purpose, except we know
<list>
                     <item>1. What Tradition is.</item>
                     <item>2. What the Church.</item>
                     <item>3. What the Holy Scriptures be, as most understand them in this
point.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. Tradition, in this particular, is nothing but a Testimony, which as such
hath no force in it to prove any thing, but that which is borrowed from the
party testifying, or the thing testified, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from some other thing: Therefore it is
called <hi>Argumentum artificiale, &amp; assumptum;</hi> because it assumeth force from
some other Reason or Argument. A Testimony is either Divine or Humane:
For here I will say nothing of the Testimony of Angels. The Divine Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is infallibly and necessarily true; yet not as a Testimony, but as the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of God, whose <hi>Veracity</hi> is such, that he cannot d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ive, or be deceived: He is
true, and Truth it self. The testimony of man may be, and is many times false;
for he is subject unto Errour, and may be deceived, because his knowledge is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect:
He may also deceive for want of fidelity and integrity. There is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and inseparable <hi>Connexion</hi> between his testimony and the truth; because
he himself, as testifying, and truth, are separable. This is the reason why testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in judgment are confirmed by Oath: And for this cause the Doctrine of
the Apostles, so far as it was new, was attested from Heaven.</p>
               <p>2. The party testifying in this particular is the Church, as a Collective Body.
By Church may be understood, either a particular Church, or Churches, or the
Universal made up of all the Particulars. This Universal Church is either the
present Universal Church, or the same considered, as successively continued since
the time of the Apostles, or as including <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, Christ, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
or the Church of all times since the Beginning. Again, the present Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church of any time may be considered, either as properly Universal, or as
representatively such, in a general Council.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64164:13"/>
3. The thing testified is, that the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God: And
by Holy Scriptures we may understand the whole Body of the <hi>Canon,</hi> and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Books of the Old and New Testament, and the same in such a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
as to exclude, or include the Books called <hi>Apocrypha.</hi> And these may be
considered either in the Original Copies, or in Transcripts, or in Translations:
or else we may understand the principal matters of the Scripture, concerning
Faith in Jesus Christ, and obedience unto his Commands. After this explication
given, some things are to be observed,
<list>
                     <item>1. Concerning the thing testified, and to be believed,</item>
                     <item>2. Concerning the Testimony of the Church.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>11</label> Concerning the thing testified:</p>
               <p>1. Every Christian born, and continuing in the Church, by his Birth, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
Education in the Church is bound to believe that the Doctrine of the
Scriptures, concerning Faith in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
is Divine and from God.</p>
               <p>2. That none such having the use of Reason, ought to rest upon mere traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but ought to seek a better and higher Reason.</p>
               <p>3. None is bound to believe by a divine and infallible Faith, necessary to
Salvation, that all, and every Book, and part of the Scripture is immediatly and
infallibly divine, further then he hath some certain reason so to do.</p>
               <p>4. That the Original Transcripts and Translations of the Scriptures, agree in
the principal Doctrine necessary to Salvation, though in other respects they
may differ. For the most wise and merciful Providence hath so ordered it, that
there is found no Transcript or Translation, wherein there is not so much as
would direct a man unto Salvation, though there be many mistakes and errours
in them.</p>
               <p>5. That many have been converted by the bare instruction of one single
Teacher without the Scriptures: Yet the matter of that instruction was in the
Scriptures. No man can believe without the Word of God taught, yet many may
believe without the Word of God written.</p>
               <p>6. That the Doctrine of the Old Testament, was sufficient to save such as
lived before the <hi>Incarnation;</hi> but not, after the <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>12</label> Concerning <hi>Tradition,</hi> and the testimony of the Church;</p>
               <p>1. That the testimony of the Church, as a Testimony, can satisfie no man. If
the Church indeed were infallible, and I knew it to be so, then I were bound to
believe it.</p>
               <p>2. The testimony of the Church Universal, since the Apostles times, is but
humane and fallible, and inferiour to the testimony of any one man immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inspired.</p>
               <p>3. No man living, since the Gospel was preached to all Nations, and the
Church extended to the ends of the Earth, can resolve his Faith into the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Universal Church. The reason is, because the Church, as universal,
never gave, nor he immediatly receive, any such testimony. Much less is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
in these present times, for any one man, or particular Church, to have any
distinct knowledge of any unanimous testimony of the Universal Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
up to the Apostles times. For if there were any such testimony, it must
be known either by Histories of Credit, decrees of Councels, Writings of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
men, or Bibles translated into the Languages of those Nations, where the
Gospel hath been preached, and Churches planted. Yet all the Histories, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi>
Writings of Christians, except very few, now extant have no Authors but
such as lived within the bounds of the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> Though we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that within those Bounds, the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and <hi>Canonical Writers</hi> were born,
the work of Redemption accomplished, the Gospel revealed, and the <hi>Canon</hi> of
the <hi>New Testament</hi> finished.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64164:14"/>
4. It being granted that the Scriptures of the Old, and New Testament,
are the Word of God, and of Divine Authority, it follows, that the Testimony
of the New Testament confirming the Old, and the predictions of the Old
Testament, related in the New to be exactly fulfilled, are of greater Authority
and Credit, then the Testimony of the Universall Church.</p>
               <p>5. The Testimony of the Universall Church, including Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
with the Prophets, is infallible; but not, as the Testimony of the Church,
distinct from Christ and his Apostles.</p>
               <p>6. The Testimony of the Universall Church (if we knew it) could not be a
sufficient ground of a Divine, but onely an human, morall, fallible faith;
which Devils and wicked men may have, and that by nature without Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
grace.</p>
               <p>7. The Testimony of the Church, so far as it may be had, is a good intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
and also a rational motive to receive the Scriptures as the Word of
God. Yet this is not as a Testimony, nor merely, as Universall in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
nor as ancient, and consisting with it self (for Antiquity, Universality
and Consent may agree to a false tradition of Idolatry), yet it's more worthy of
credit then other Testimonies.</p>
               <p>First, In respect of the Persons testifying, The best qualified men in the World,
and such as did manifest by their profession, Practice, Sufferings, that they
had much of God in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and principally in respect of the matter of the Scriptures testified
to be <hi>Divine.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>1. It's excellent, and such as cannot be found in any other Writings in the
World: There is nothing rational, or good, which tends to make a man bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or more happy to be found in any <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Books, which is
not found in It, and far more excellent then can be read in theirs; and the same
pure, without mixture of any such <hi>Errours, Absurdities, Abominations,</hi> as their
writings are polluted with.</p>
               <p>2. The eternall rules of Wisdom and Justice, according to which the World,
is and ever hath bin governed by a Supreme Providence, are recorded in these
<hi>Volums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. In this book we read more Truths, and the same more clear concerning
the <hi>Eternall Deity,</hi> the nature and imployment of Angels; the nature, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and qualities of the immortall Soul, than in any book in the
World.</p>
               <p>4. The Doctrine therein contained hath had, and still hath, such excellent
effects upon the souls of men, both to convert and comfort them, as never
any other had. And this is the more wonderfull, if we consider the Successe of
the Gospel. For the Doctine thereof, though contrary to flesh and blood,
to the errours of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Religion of all Nations, yet was diffused, and
that by a few mean and contemptible men in the eye of the World, into all
Nations; and this in the midst of cruel and bloody persecutions, against all the
opposition, which the Devils of Hell, the greatest Schollers, the profoundest
States-Men, the most Cunning Priests, the greatest and most Powerfull Rulers,
both of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> could make.</p>
               <p>5. The most certain, clear, particular praedictions of future Contingents fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so exactly, many years after they were publiquely declared, by word and
writing, do much, and very much argue, these Divine Writings to be from
<hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. There is an admirable Harmony, and Consent of all parts, though the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
thereof lived in several times, and at so great a distance, that there passed
near 2000 years, between <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the Divine and Evangelist, and near
1500, between <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Malachy.</hi> They all agree in the Principall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the Principal Scope, and the meanes conducing thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64164:14"/>
7. I never did Seriously meditate upon, and digest any part of it, so as to
understand the Scope and Method, but I did admire the excellency of it; and
the more I understood it, the more I admired it. And I am perswaded, that
if we clearly understood the parts thereof, we might easi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Characters, and plainly distinguish them from all other writings. Yet
none of these are of any great force, to such as are ignorant of them, and know
them onely upon the Tradition of others; Neither is Universall Tradition,
the ordinary way whereby men are Converted: For most who do believe to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
hear onely one, or a few teachers, and the same not immediatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
and inspired; and by their Doctrine contained in these Scriptures,
and the power of the Spirit attain to a Divine and saving faith. For faith is by
hearing, and hearing by the word of God, preached immediatly unto them;
For so the place is to be understood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. And no man can prove
that the immediate Proposer of saving truth should be infallible, but that the
Doctrine taught be infallibly true. No rationall man can rationally reject
any Doctrine, much lesse this, except he have some reason for it; but there
can be no reason of any moment ever alleaged against this Doctrine, or any
particular thereof rightly understood. It seemes strange to me that any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
especially, such as do confesse the holy Scriptures in themselves to be
Divine, should make a question, whether they can be believed to be the word
of God any other wayes, but by the Tradition of the Church. It is indeed
some advantage to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Associates, and Vassals to make
men believe, that their faith and belief of the Divinity of the Scriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the Tradition of the Church in their Sense: For when all is well
examined, they understand by Church themselves, and their own present
Church: Yet they cannot well agree amongst themselves what this present
Church should be; Whether the Pope in his Chair alone as the Visible head,
or he with a general Council: Yet this Church is no wayes universall, except,
so far as she professeth the universall faith (as some of their <hi>Cardinalls</hi> have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served):
Neither is she any more infallible then other Churches be. Yet men
will believe that she is the Universall Church, infallible, and the onely infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
expounder and proposer of the Scriptures, and can detain them, and
Seal them up in an unknown Language, so as that the <hi>Vulgar</hi> shall neither read
them, nor hear them in a Language understood by them; she will have some
advantage. For by this meanes the people are kept in ignorance, and unity;
and so their unwritten Traditions, Doctrines and Practises, so directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to expresse Scripture, shall not be question'd, but received by an implicit
Faith. This argument of Tradition well examined cannot advantage them of
<hi>Rome,</hi> nay it's a Plain Disadvantage. For their Tradition doth prove a <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,</hi>
and Some Protestant writers ascribe too much unto it, and also speak
too loosly and at random of it in this point especially.</p>
               <p>But to return unto those ordinary teachers,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIII</label> and especially the Ministers
of the New-Testament, Let us examine,</p>
               <p>1. How they acquire their knowledge.</p>
               <p>2. How they Communicate it to others.</p>
               <p>3. How the People must receive it Communicated.</p>
               <p>4. What God hath promised to do, if both Minister and People perform
their duty.</p>
               <p>1. They acquire their knowledge by such meanes, which God hath given,
and ordained for that end. They do not receive it by immediate inspiration,
as the holy Prophets and Apostles did: God gives them naturall parts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
in the giving of them being, and some of them from their Mothers
womb, are designed for this work. But let their naturall parts and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be never so excellent, yet they must at first be taught and instructed,
both in the Arts and Languages, especially the originalls: and after some founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64164:15"/>
is layd, they may much improve themselves by the Learned works of
others, their own industry, Prayer, and Gods blessing. <hi>Lexicons, Concordan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Translations,</hi> are great helps for the attayning the knowledge of the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
tongues: <hi>Expositions, Commentaries, Systems, Treatises,</hi> do conduce
much for the understanding the matter of the Scriptures. God hath done much
for us in this kind; but our neglect is great, and many have not the benefit
of good education and direction at the first. And there is a great disparity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Ministers of the higher and lower forms: yet no man is fit for this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
who is not furnished, with so much knowledge, and such a measure of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance,
as to be able to declare to others, the whole Counsell of God, and

                  </gap>each them all things, necessary to Salvation. Yet many will take upon them
to teach before they have well Learned; and will be Masters before they have
bin Scollers: And the most insufficient will pretend the Spirit to cloak their
ignorance. After these ordinary teachers have once stored up a treasure, they
consecrate themselves to Christ, and engage to make it their work to do him
service in this kind.</p>
               <p>Being rightly qualified,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIV</label> sent and called, they begin to teach others, and take
the charge upon them, yet so as that they may be probationers, and assistants at
the first. They instruct others, either by Learned Books or treatises of piety,
or by word of mouth, and that severall wayes, as by <hi>Catechisms, Expositions,
Sermons,</hi> and other ways. The first work, is to <hi>Catechize</hi> the Ignorant, and
teach them the first principles of the Gospel. To this purpose they have our
Saviours Creed of faith in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
of the Moral Law, contracted into the Love of God and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
The Lord's Prayer (as we use to call it), and the Doctrine of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.
And these few understand; yet the ignorant and unlearned, and
Children should know, and that not onely the words, but the true and <hi>Genuine</hi>
sense according to their <hi>Capacity.</hi> This (though the foundation) is too much
neglected: By Expositions they acquaint the people, with the occasion,
<hi>Scope, Method, and Meaning</hi> of severall parts and portions of the Scripture.
By Sermons they explain and apply some Text of Scripture, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
out of the same some <hi>Divine axiom;</hi> which once un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

plain, they apply by way of <hi>Instruction</hi> in the truth; Confutation of errour,
Reproof of the guilty, <hi>Consolation</hi> of the dejected stirring up to duty by exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
restrayning from sin by <hi>Dehortation.</hi> Their Doctrine should be the
Pure word of God, made plain, dispensed wisely, delivered out of an heart
sincerely desiring, and intending the Salvation of the People, and ought to be
confirmed by the <hi>Teacher's</hi> example, and the Principall matter must be the

               <p>This is the duty of Teachers; which performed by them, God ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>1. The heart of man must be prepared and that,</p>
               <p>1. With an high conceit of the Doctrine of the Scriptures taught, that it is
the word of God revealed from Heaven, out of great love and mercy to man;
that it highly and very much concerns him, upon the knowledge and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
whereof depends his eternal estate in the World to come; According
to it he must be judged, and sent to <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> and made eternally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
or miserable, All errours and false notions contrary unto it, must be rased
out of the mind: All inordinate affections and unruly passions must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued:
For we must lay apart all filthinesse, and Superfluity of naughtinesse,
and receive with meeknesse the pure and genuine word of God, which is able
to save our souls, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 24. And we must lay aside, all malice, and all guile,
and hypocrisies, and envies, and evil speakings and as New-born babes desire
the <hi>Sincere milk</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2. We must make our minds

the Heavenly Doctrine cannot make so li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ely impressions upon us.</p>
               <p>2. When the heart is thus prepared, we must hear and read attentively; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what is heard or read, that we may understand it: We must apply it, and
lay it close unto our own hearts, and pray for the Spirit, to make it powerful and
effectual within us. As it is Wisdom, first, to teach; so it is, first, to learn the
Principles, and to understand them well: and being once in these well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
they will not be so subject either to be seduced, or wave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and it will be a great advantage to improve their knowledge. And when
once they understand the truth, it will discover their woful condition to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them, and their Saviour to raise them up again. It's a part of the duty of
every one that is a Scholler in this School, not onely to understand the truth,
but also to endeavour the practise thereof,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of an earnest desire of Salvation.
And if a man neglect the means, use not the power that God hath given him,
and seriously intend the principal end, it will be just with God to desert him,
and deny his grace unto him. Practice must be the principal design, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
so far as conducing thereunto.</p>
               <p>If the man being taught,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XVI</label> be diligent and willing for to learn, both to know,
and do that which is known, and that with a prepared heart, and desire of <hi>God's</hi>
Blessed Spirit, to teach him inwardly and effectually, then God will remember
his Promise, and will give him a new Heart; and a new Spirit he will put in
him, and will take the stoney heart out of his flesh, and give him an heart of
flesh: He will put his Spirit within him, and cause him to walk in his Statutes,
and keep his Judgments to do them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26, 27. For this is a Promise of
the Gospel, and the New Covenant; <hi>I will put my Laws into their mind, and
write them in their hearts,</hi> Heb. 8. 10. And, as man teacheth outwardly, God
teacheth inwardly; yet he never writes his Word in an unprepared heart; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth he write any thing within, but that which is taught outwardly, out of
the Scriptures: And, as the Minister, must teach, so the People must hear, and
heed; otherwise God will deny his Spirit. Man cannot speak unto the Soul
immediatly, but by the outward and inward Senses: God speaks immediatly
unto the Soul, pierceth deeply into it, writes clear and lively Characters upon
the mind, and makes strong impressions upon the heart. When the Ministers
Doctrine is thus accompanied with the Power of God, and brought home not
onely unto, but also into the Soul, then the Teacher is a Minister, not onely of
the Letter, but also of the Spirit: and the Word is the Word of God indeed,
formally and properly, when God thus speaks it immediatly himself; and it
will manifest it self by the <hi>Heavenly Light, Power of Sanctification,</hi> and Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
following thereupon. And then man knows the Word, read or heard
preached out of the Scripture, to be from Heaven, and God's Voyce; and that
upon better grounds, then any Tradition possibly can be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By the same Word,
we are begotten, and born anew: By the same, we must grow and tend unto
perfection, the Spirit concurring with it. And the Spirit, by Divine Institution,
and God's Promise, goes along with it, except man, by his neglect of the means,
or some other deme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The sum of all this, is,<label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>1. That the Doctrine of the Scriptures is the Rule whereby we are directed
<hi>in the knowledge of God's Kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. This Doctrine was in the mind of God, and known onely to himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he communicated it to Men and Angels.</p>
               <p>3. He did make this known by immediate Inspiration to the <hi>Holy Prophets</hi>
and <hi>Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. By them he communicated it to others, both by Word and Writing: in
both which they were directed by him infallibly.</p>
               <p>5. The Originals therefore were immediatly of <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> and most
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64164:16"/>
worthy to be believed; and the <hi>Transcripts</hi> and <hi>Translations</hi> so far, as they
agreed with the <hi>Originals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. The <hi>Tradition</hi> or <hi>Testimony</hi> of the Church may declare this; yet, as a <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
it can satisfie no man fully.</p>
               <p>7. God communicates this Doctrine unto men by ordinary <hi>Teachers,</hi> not
immediatly inspired.</p>
               <p>8. The Scripture is the standing Rule, to direct these ordinary <hi>Teachers:</hi> And
so far as they follow this Rule, so far their <hi>Doctrine</hi> is good, and no further.</p>
               <p>9. The people taught, are bound to hear those Teachers, with prepared
hearts, and, in that manner, as God requireth.</p>
               <p>10. If they hear in this manner, God, according to his Promise, will make it
effectual to <hi>convert, justifie,</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> them.</p>
               <p>11. This <hi>Spirit</hi> testifying, by real effects, the matter of the Scripture, to be
<hi>Divine,</hi> is not a private Spirit, but the publique Spirit of Christ in the <hi>Universal
Church:</hi> and the thing testified by this Spirit is the <hi>Publique Doctrine,</hi> believed
and professed by the <hi>Vniversal Church.</hi> It's true, that it's testified to a private
<hi>Man,</hi> and, in that respect, it is not <hi>Publique.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12 By this manner of ordinary teaching, with the concurrence of the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
Spirit, God works ordinarily a <hi>Divine Faith</hi> in the hearts of men, and
not by the <hi>Vniversal Tradition of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. The Tradition of the Church, so far as it may be known, concerning the
<hi>Divine Authority</hi> of the whole Canon, is a ground of a probable Faith, against
which, <hi>No rational man, as rational, can except.</hi>

which must be the Rule of the ensuing Discourse concerning God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
But before I proceed to the particular Explication of this excellent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it will not be amiss to enquire, Whether the principal subject of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may not be reduced to a method; or, Whether some parts or passages of
Scripture, will not give a sufficient light and direction to this method, if there
be any such thing. Many School-men, and some Modern Authors of <hi>Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Systems,</hi> following the Rules of the great <hi>Philosopher,</hi> have attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the <hi>Doctrine contained in God's Book,</hi> into the form of an <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Science</hi>
(as some use to speak). They determine the Subject of it to be <hi>Man, (Quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Beatificabilis)</hi> as capable of Spiritual and Eternal Happiness. The Object
of it must be <hi>(Deus, quatenus Beatificans)</hi> God, as the Fountain and Cause of
Eternal Bliss. And the end is, to direct the <hi>Spiritual Acts</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of
the <hi>Immortal Soul;</hi> so that by them, well regulated and fixed upon their due
Object, man may tend unto, and, in the end, attain the full fruition of that
<hi>Eternal Being in whom he shall be for ever blessed.</hi> According to this determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
some reduce the Doctrine of the Scriptures, to <hi>Truths, Promises, Duties;</hi> yet
this is imperfect. Others make three Heads of this Doctrine:
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>The first is the</hi> Being <hi>and</hi> Perfection of God in himself.</item>
                     <item>2. The second, the <hi>Works of God.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. The third, <hi>His Commands:</hi> Yet this, as the former, proves defective, and
no ways exact. Others, tell us, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> represent God to us.

1. Knowledge.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The Worship of God:</hi> And this hath much <hi>affinity</hi> with that <hi>Distribution of
Theologie, into Faith and Obedience;</hi> that is, the <hi>Rule of Faith, and Obedience.</hi> These
conceive all things in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> especially conducing to Salvation, to be <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda,</hi>
or <hi>agenda:</hi> The things to be believed, the Object of Faith; the things
to be done and performed, the Object of <hi>Obedience.</hi> For this, they think that
they have a sufficient ground in the <hi>Mandate,</hi> and <hi>Commission</hi> of our <hi>Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
Go and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I
have commanded you,</hi> Math. 28. 19, 20. And that of the Apostle seems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this; <hi>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me in faith
and love,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 13. I will not examine these distinctions now; but onely
say this much, That <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> or <hi>Observancy</hi> (as some call it) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the intended sense of these two places, are onely <hi>Duties</hi> to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by sinful man, <hi>Redeemed,</hi> and <hi>Called,</hi> according to the <hi>Commands of their God-Redeemer;</hi>
and so do not reach the <hi>utmost bounds</hi> of this <hi>Heavenly Doctrine.</hi> And,
even in this respect, they refer to <hi>Government,</hi> and belong onely to that <hi>One
Head,</hi> and part thereof, <hi>The Commands and Laws of God Redeemer,</hi> requiring
<hi>obedience:</hi> And <hi>Faith</hi> it self is but one part of this <hi>obedience,</hi> as it is a <hi>Duty.</hi> So
that these things may be some ways true, but no ways accurate and perfect. And
if they may be allowed, mine intended method, I hope, may pass without any
harsh censure. For, I know no reason to the contrary, seeing it's evident, that the
<hi>Principal,</hi> if not the <hi>adaequat subject</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> is the <hi>Kingdom, and
Government of God:</hi> The <hi>Doctrine</hi> whereof is methodically contracted in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Confessions,</hi> which take in the <hi>(Agenda,</hi> or) things to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
as well as the <hi>(Credenda)</hi> things to be believed.</p>
               <p>Of these ancient Confessions, it may be observed; that,</p>
               <p>1. Though they differ in words and expressions,<label type="milestone">

forms thereof; some more brief, some more large; especially in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
and <hi>Tertullian</hi>) yet they agree in the matter and the principal method.</p>
               <p>2. That divers of the <hi>Ancients</hi> inform us, that the first <hi>Planted Churches</hi> received
the <hi>Forms of Confession,</hi> though different in some words and expressions; yet the

Apostles from Christ; Christ from God. Thus, amongst others, <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>6. No particular form of Confession, considered as a Tradition of the

Church, since the time of the Apostles, can be of equal authority with the
Scriptures.</p>
               <p>7. That which we call the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> which we find in the Works of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
and <hi>Russinus,</hi> with an Exposition, is no more, nor so much the <hi>Apostles
Creed,</hi> as some ancient <hi>Creeds,</hi> in form differing from it.</p>
               <p>8. Those words of our Saviour, and his Rule of Doctrine, concerning the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son, and Holy Ghost, with the three glorious Works of Creation, Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
Sanctification, is a divine and wonderful Abridgment of all the Doctrine of
the Scripture especially of that which is necessary to Salvation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Confession</hi> and <hi>Creed</hi> of the Patriarchs,<label type="milestone">

<hi>God is, and he is a Rewarder of them who diligently seek him,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. For they
believed, That there was one God most glorious, and blessed in Himself; who,
by his Wisdome and Power, made, preserved, and governed the World, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Mankind. For to Reward, is an act of judgment: Judgment presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

So that in their ancient Creed, we have God considered,</p>
               <p>1. In Himself.</p>
               <p>2. As a Governour of the World made by him, and especially of Men and

                  <hi>The Apostles Creed,</hi> as delivered
by more understanding <hi>Catechists,</hi> and Authors of <hi>Theological Systems,</hi> is
this:</p>
               <p>God being the Subject of that Confession is considered:</p>
               <p>1. In himself, as God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>2. As in his Works.</p>

               <p>1. Falls;</p>
               <p>2. Is restored. He is restored by Redemption, and the Application of it. The
Redeemer, for Person, is the Word, and Son of God; for his Natures, God and
Man, for his Offices, Prophet, Priest, and King. His Work of Redemption hath
two Parts.</p>
               <p>1. His Humiliation.</p>
               <p>2. His Exaltation, in his <hi>Resurrection, Ascension, Session</hi> at his Father's right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
and investiture with all power in Heaven, and Earth; whereby he is made
Lord and Judge of the World.</p>
               <p>The Application, whereby we are made partakers of the <hi>Benefits</hi> of <hi>Christ's
Redemption,</hi> is made by the Spirit and Word, working Faith, whereby sinful men
are made Members of Christ, and of the Universal Church, which is the society
of Saints.</p>
               <p>The benefits of this Redemption applyed, and whereof the Church is parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
are Remission of sins Resurrection, and Life Everlasting.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The reason why I propose this,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> is, because its the most full and perfect form
of Confession both in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian:</hi> Concerning which, several things
are observable:</p>
               <p>1. That it agrees with all the rest for <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Method.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It's most exactly <hi>Consentaneous</hi> to plain and clear Scripture.</p>
               <p>3, The Method is grounded upon our Saviours <hi>Creed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. It more fully and perfectly, out of the Scriptures, informs us of the <hi>Person</hi>
and <hi>Natures of Christ,</hi> and so of his <hi>Incarnation.</hi> For that <hi>Word,</hi> by which the
World, and so man, was created, was <hi>made flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. As in it, we have God the Father, creating the World by his Word, and
the same Word by the Spirit, <hi>assuming flesh redeeming man:</hi> so we have the same
God, by his Spirit, sanctifying man, more expresly delivered then in any of the
rest.</p>
               <p>6. We may observe, that that Word, which was first uttered and spoken in
the Creation before any thing could be created, was uttered and produced
from everlasting, as a lively Representation of God himself to himself.</p>
               <p>7. That as the Spirit, so the Word was in the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as <hi>Prophets;</hi> as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
neither of which they could have been <hi>Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. The <hi>Government of God Redeemer,</hi> is therein more expresly declared, then
in most of the other Forms. For the <hi>Government of Creation</hi> being presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<list>
                     <item>1. The manner of acquiring a <hi>New Power,</hi> by the Humiliation of the
Word made flesh.</item>
                     <item>2. His Investiture with this Power, in his Exaltation.</item>
                     <item>3. The Exercise of it.
<list>
                           <item>1. In giving the <hi>New Law,</hi> with a Promise, of Heaven's Kingdom.</item>
                           <item>2. In adjudging men, either Prophane to everlasting fire, or Holy unto
the enjoyment of Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> everlasting, upon the Resurrection of both, in
the last, and Universal Judgment, are in these few Words delivered
plainly, and clearly.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>9. This Form was received by the Church from the Apostles; and by the
Apostles from Christ.</p>
               <p>10. That not any, but <hi>Hereticks,</hi> did question any thing in this <hi>Creed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. Seeing these <hi>Hereticks</hi> professed themselves Christians, and did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Christ, and this had continued from Christ and the Apostles Universally,
and without controversie before these <hi>Hereticks</hi> did arise, therefore it did suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

               </p>
               <p>2. That in a Kingdom, or Government, there must be a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Governour,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Common-wealth is administred by Laws and Judgments: Laws deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Duties and Dues of men: Judgment renders the Dues of Rewards,
or Punishments, according to the observation or violation of the Laws. These
things observed, We have in this Kingdom</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>KING.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. His <hi>Government:</hi> The King is God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who
alone is worthy of all <hi>honour, glory, power,</hi> and <hi>dominion</hi> for evermore. His <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
presupposeth his Power; which is</p>
               <p>1. Acquired.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Exercised.</hi> It's acquired by Creation, as it is continued by Preservation.
For immediatly upon the Creation, he became the Supream, Universal, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Lord, and continues so for evermore by his perpetual <hi>Preservation.</hi> For
seeing he made all things, even Men and Angels, of nothing, and they do always
for ever wholly depend upon him; therefore he must needs have an absolute,
full, and perpetual Propriety in, and Dominion over them, and they must needs
be his Servants and Vassals. This Power thus acquired, began to be exercised
immediatly upon the Creation:</p>
               <p>1. In the general Government of all things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By a constitution of an Order amongst them.</item>
                  <item>2. By a Direction of them, according to that Order, to their ends.</item>
               </list>
               <p>2. In the special Government of the immortal, and intellectual Creatures,
who alone were capable of Laws, Rewards, and Punishments. These speciall
Creatures were Angels and Men. Amongst the Angels he</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Established an Order.</item>
                  <item>2. According to that Order, he doth govern them, and exercise his
Power:</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. In giving them Laws.</p>
               <p>2. In judging them according to those <hi>Laws:</hi> Some of the <hi>Angels</hi> continued
loyal and obedient, and were confirmed in perpetual estate of Holiness and
Happiness, which was their Reward. The disloyal and Apostate Angels were
cast down from Heaven, and reserved in everlasting Chains under Darkness, unto
the Judgment of the great day, <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 6. This was their Doom, and the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God upon the Angels. The Government of Men is two-fold: The
first, of Justice: The second, of Mercy: Of Justice, in the first <hi>Adam:</hi> of Mercy,
in the second. In the first, after God became his Lord, and Man, his Subject, in a
special manner, he gives him Laws both Moral, and Positive: and whilest man
is obedient, his estate is comfortable: But this not continuing long, he is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
sinneth, and so is judged: yet so, that the Sentence, in part, might be reversed,
&amp; the Eternal Punishment deserved, was made, upon certain conditions, avoidable,
and might be prevented. And least man should perish everlastingly, this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is altered, and God acquires a new power by the work of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and doth exercise it by the Redeemer. The Redeemer is the Word, who
was God, and the Son of God, made flesh, and anointed with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> by
whom he was conceived; to be a Prophet, Priest, and King. As Priest, he offers
himself a Sacrifice upon the Cross, satisfies God's justice, merits mans salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and his own eternal glory; and upon his Resurrection he is invested with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64164:18"/>
that glory and power, which he had merited, and God by him begins to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
his new acquired power, 1. By constituting a new Kingdom, whereof the
Head must be his Son at his right hand, and the Church his body Politick, 2.
By the administration of this kingdom with victorious power unto the end.
For Christ must reign till his enemies be made his footstool. In this Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
he</p>
               <p>1. Appoints officers who must Publish the Laws of his Kingdom, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues
them with the Holy Ghost from Heaven. Their doctrine to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ether with
the Power of the Spirit, is made known and effectuall in all Nations, and
some believe, some love darknesse rather then light. The <hi>Believers</hi> make up
the Body of the Church, Unbelievers constitute the body both of Rebels and
Enemies; and both are the subject of the judgment of God Redeemer by Christ.
This judgment is executed in Rewards and Punishments, in this life, upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
persons, severally and successively considered, and is fully consummate
upon the Resurrection, at the Universall or generall Assizes; when the Wicked
with the Angels, shall be cast into everlasting fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Righteous shall be
rewarded with eternall glory. The punishments determined by this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as also the rewards, shall be perpetuall: And in all this, there is in the
matter or the method, no difference or variation from the Ancient Creeds, or
in the expressions from the holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude this Chapter,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> I will say something (though briefly) 1. Of
the name of Creed and Confession, 2. Of knowledge and Obedience, 3. Of
faith in Particular.</p>
               <p>1. These Sums and Methods are called <hi>Creeds;</hi> because the matter of them
is <hi>(Credenda)</hi> things, or rather <hi>truths</hi> concerning things, to be believed: And
<hi>Confessions,</hi> because the <hi>Truths</hi> believed in the heart must be Confessed with the
mouth; For with the heart man believeth unto Righteousnesse, and with the
<hi>mouth Confession</hi> is made to Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10.</p>
               <p>2. If we consider the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, contracted in these
Confessions in respect of mans duty; all things therein are proposed,</p>
               <p>1. As <hi>Truths,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Some things as <hi>Commands</hi> or <hi>Laws.</hi> As <hi>Truths,</hi> mans duty is to believe
them, as <hi>Commands</hi> to obey them. Thence that distribution of <hi>Divine</hi> and
Saving Doctrine into Faith, or Obedience: The truths, and so the knowledge
and unbelief of them, are first in order: And because the matter of some truths
are commands, therefore <hi>Commands</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> follow as the second in
order. Both are contained in the Scriptures, expresly. In the <hi>Creeds,</hi>
the Commands and Obedience are implied: Yet, lest we mistake, we
must distinguish between the knowledge and obedience of Angels, and the
knowledge and obedience of man. And both these may be considered in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of man innocent, man fallen, man under the Law, man under the
Gospell: For in all these respects, they are different (as will appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after).</p>
               <p>3. Mans knowledge especially since the fall is imperfect, and is not so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
as demonstrative and intuitive knowledge is, and therefore called Faith,
which cannot perceive the things known cleerly or immediately, but by <hi>vertue</hi>
of a Testimony. To define which faith in general it must needs be proper unto
<hi>Logick,</hi> which is the rule of mans understanding, whereof faith is an act, and
in general, that which we call assent, allowing the connexion of the termes of
a proposition, and yeilds unto it as true. Yet this <hi>Assent</hi> though firm and
certain, is not so perfect as that which is grounded upon <hi>immediate Evidence</hi> of
the things represented by the <hi>Termes.</hi> Therefore.<note n="†" place="margin">As quore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Lincolniensis</hi> makes the
<hi>Genus</hi> of it to be Opinion, and saith that <hi>fides est opinio,</hi> And that faith which
is grounded onely upon probable reasons can be no more then Opinion, which
alwayes is an <hi>Assent,</hi> yet not firm and certain, as this Faith, we speak of, must
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64164:19"/>
be. For it is divine and immediately grounded on the testimony or word
of God, certainly known to be such: It's not the word of God immediately
to me, as spoken by man either fallible, or infallible; but either as <hi>attested
outwardly</hi> by miracles or gifts of the Holy Ghost, or some other way; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
by some real effects of the Spirit, writing this word in mans heart pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
to affect it, and incline it to obedience. <hi>A Speculative</hi> and general assent
without any <hi>Saving effects</hi> the<note n="†" place="margin">But the devils can make no application to themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not made to them, but to Men.</note> Devils may have. The <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church
or testimony of any man cannot possibly represent the word of God, as the
word of God, immediately to the Soul. The <hi>Practical divine assent</hi> is a great part
of our Regeneration, and the <hi>Principle of all divine and noble actions,</hi> as it is of
all <hi>Spiritual Solid Comfort.</hi>

               </list>
               <p>As in himself he is God the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. The
term or word GOD puts us in mind of the <hi>Essence</hi> and being of this <hi>King;</hi>
and the <hi>terms, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost</hi> of his acting in himself; and those
<hi>Wonderful</hi> and hidden productions; Whence <hi>arise</hi> severall Relations and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative</hi>
properties. <hi>But before</hi> I proceed to speak of these <hi>deepest Mysteries,</hi> I
must say something of our knowledge of God, and the way, how he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
himself unto us, so that we may understand some little of him in the
<hi>darknesse</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> till we see him face to face, and more fully and clearly
in <hi>Eternal Glory.</hi> Such is the excellency of this King, and such the brightnesse
of his Glory, that it denies any near <hi>accesse</hi> to <hi>Silly</hi> mortal man, who must not
curiously <hi>Pry</hi> into these Secrets, but humbly adore and at a great distance.
<hi>That God</hi> is most <hi>intelligible</hi> in himself, is certain: For the perfect Being, is the
most perfect object of <hi>understanding.</hi> But it's one thing to be so clearly <hi>visible
in himself,</hi> another to be so to us. <hi>An Infinite and Eternall</hi> Being must needs
be far above a finite and limited understanding. Such especially ours now is:
For our Capacity is <hi>Shallow</hi> and <hi>Narrow,</hi> and can in no wise <hi>Comprehend</hi> the
<hi>Incomprehensible,</hi> or apprehend that which is so far above<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Sphear. That
God is, will be granted of all, <hi>a few grosse Atheists</hi> excepted: Yet such is the
want of <hi>due instruction</hi> in some, the extinction of Nature's light, by neglect, and
sin in many, and the Judgment of Divine desertion, whereby men are delivered
up into <hi>a Reprobate mind,</hi> that many do deny that God who made them, and
in whom they live move and have their Being, and will not be convinced of
the truth of <hi>his Eternall Existence.</hi> So that the great <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
had some cause to say, That by us it could not be evidently known that
God is, but only by the gratuitous union of God with our understanding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
himself as a <hi>Visible Object,</hi> sufficiently clear and shining in his own
light unto the <hi>understanding</hi> rightly disposed. <hi>Bacon</hi> and <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cam</hi> seem to be of
this mind: And surely if God withdraw his light, man presently is so blind,
that no reason alleaged by any wit of man, can make him see this truth that
God is, though it be the first of all truths. Yea though we may know this
that he is, and doth exist, yet, <hi>no man can tell what he is;</hi> Something the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
knew of God by <hi>Tradition,</hi> and the light of <hi>Nature:</hi> For his works did
speak of his <hi>Eternal Power</hi> and <hi>God-head</hi> even unto them. The <hi>Jews</hi> knew
more; for they had <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets:</hi> The Christians most of all: For they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64164:19"/>
have not onely the light of nature, the great Book and Volum of the World,
and <hi>Moses</hi> with the <hi>Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> with the light
of the Gospel. Yet notwithstanding, our knowledge is imperfect, not only in
respect of God, who fully knows himself, but in respect of Angels, who know
him clearly though not fully and infinitely. <hi>The most accurate Logick</hi> in this
particular, can little advantage the most piercing understanding: Yet so far
God hath manifested himself unto us, especially in the Gospel, as will be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for our eternall glorification, in which estate we shall know him more
fully, even so much as will make us fully happy.</p>
               <p>The manner whereby we know our God is by many Attributes,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> whereby he
represents himself sutably to our Capacity: for seeing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that <hi>one Individuall</hi> Being by one act, he hath given himself <hi>Severall,</hi> and
many <hi>attributes,</hi> that so by many and <hi>severall acts,</hi> we may know something of
that which is one in it self. Of these Attributes many things are observable,
as here they follow.</p>
               <p>1. It was Gods gracious condescension, both to the manner, and
measure of our imperfect understanding, to manifest himself by these Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</p>
               <p>2. They are called <hi>Attributes,</hi> because God attributes them to himself, and
affirms them of himself; <hi>Properties,</hi> because we conceive them as proper unto
God, and such as can be praedicated only of him; So that by them we distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
him from all other <hi>Beings; Perfections,</hi> not that they are perfections, but
because they are <hi>severall representations</hi> of that <hi>one perfection,</hi> which is himself;
<hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Terms,</hi> because they expresse and signifie something of his Essence;
<hi>Notions,</hi> because they are so many apprehensions of his Being, as we conceive
of him imperfectly in our minds.</p>
               <p>3. These Attributes, whether we call them names or notions, do truly agree
to God; and by them we truly conceive of him.</p>
               <p>4. The reason hereof is, because that one individual Being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by severall distinct representations, and so apprehended.</p>
               <p>5. There can be no inequality between these Attributes, as considered in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of God; For they all signifie but one infinite Being: Yet, as they may
be exercised, not onely <hi>Severally</hi> but <hi>unequally;</hi> So they may be apprehended
<hi>as unequal</hi> in respect of the subject, wherein they may be exercised. For God
may exercise his Justice, in punishing the wicked more then his Mercy; and
his Mercy more then his Justice, in the salvation of his people.</p>
               <p>6. Though the <hi>Unity, immensity, Eternity, Understanding, Will, Wisdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
Mercy,</hi> &amp;c, of God in respect of their severall distinct Representations,
and our apprehensions do differ, yet in respect of God, they no ways differ ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
really or formally, because they are one individual essence.</p>
               <p>7. Though <hi>Father, Son, Holy Ghost, Creatour, Preserver, Lord, Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Judge,</hi> be truly affirmed of God, yet they are not properly Attributes,
as they are usually taken; because <hi>Attributes</hi> are intended to represent the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
those other termes are <hi>Extrinsecal Denominations,</hi> in respect unto the
<hi>Creatures,</hi> and are grounded upon his <hi>Works,</hi> or else upon the <hi>intrinsecal acts</hi>
of the <hi>Deity</hi> upon it <hi>Self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To understand these things the better, we must not be ignorant, how our
<hi>understanding</hi> acts upon things and beings intelligible.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> It cannot touch and
reach the things it self immediately, but at the second hand, as it is Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Logisms,</hi> or Logical affections, which we call Arguments. For by
these the thing irradiates and becomes visible to the Soul, and so is perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
These affections are like Colours upon the Surface of the thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it is not perceivable by the eye. These affections and arguments
upon the which the understanding so much depends, are <hi>cause, effect, subject, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct,
whole, part,</hi> and the rest. God who knew this better then we our selves
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64164:20"/>
do, was willing to represent this his glorious essence, in such a manner as
man by severall acts might know something of him. For this purpose he in
his blessed word did give himself these <hi>Attributes,</hi> which are like unto <hi>Logical</hi>
arguments, but are not such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for God hath no cause, neither is his Being
in its self a cause: He is no effect, no subject, adjunct, whole, or part: These
do not agree to him. The word of God therefore is the rule of our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and directing it in the knowledge of his essence, is our Supernaturall
Logick, and the Attributes are our <hi>Divine Topicks.</hi> For the <hi>Logick</hi> which we
now have composed by man, serves only for a rule in the understanding of
things created: We must have a far higher and more excellent <hi>Logick,</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Being of our God.</p>
               <p>These Attributes by some are numbred,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> but without any order: By others
they are reduced to a method, but with some difference, though not much
materiall. And in this particular, every man may abound in his own sense,
so that he deliver the truth: Some give a definition of God, so as to include
the <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Subsistences,</hi> and make the <hi>Essence intelligible</hi> by his Names and
Properties (for so they call the Attributes) which are either <hi>Incommunicable</hi>
or <hi>Communicable</hi> by <hi>Analogy.</hi> Some inquire what God is,</p>
               <p>1. In his Essence.</p>
               <p>2. In his Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e: And thereupon inform us that some Attributes agree unto
him in respect of his Essence, Some in respect of his Life: Some rank them
under 3 heads:</p>
               <p>The first whereof agree unto him, in respect of his Being;</p>
               <p>The second, in respect of his Life;</p>
               <p>The third, in respect of the perfection of his Life.</p>
               <p>Some divide them also into 3 sorts, in another manner: For, some (say they)
shew what he is; Some, how great; Some, how good he is. I desire to have
the Liberty that these and others have taken. Before I come to the Particular
handling of these <hi>Attributes,</hi> wherein I shall not differ much, from some of the
former, it is to be observed,</p>
               <p>1. That some of the Names given to God in Scripture are <hi>Attributes;</hi> some
not.</p>
               <p>2. That God cannot be defined according to the rules of <hi>Logick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That which we call a definition of God, doth comprehend all the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes;</hi>
So that by good consequence all of them may be deduced from
it.</p>
               <p>4. The Definitions I intend to speak of are two.</p>
               <p>The first, is that of Doctor <hi>Amyes,</hi> out of Mr. <hi>Richardson,</hi> That <hi>God is a
Spirit living of himself.</hi> In this, it is supposed,</p>
               <p>1. That Spiritual Substances are more excellent then bodily.</p>
               <p>2. That Living Spirits are more excellent, then such as have not Life.</p>
               <p>3. That Such as have <hi>intellectual,</hi> and moral Life, are most excellent of all
Created beings; These are, Men and Angels. Yet these do not Live in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
independently: For they depend on God. From all these presupposed,
it follows that God being a Spirit, Living with the most excellent Life, and
in himself independently, must needs be every way, the most <hi>Excellent Substance,
and far above all others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second definition is,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> That <hi>God is a being absolutely perfect;</hi> Some, if not
all understanding Heathens, did conceive that God was <hi>(Ens praestantissimum)</hi>
the most <hi>Excellent Being.</hi> Whereby they did acknowledge,</p>
               <p>1. That God was; because a Being, and</p>
               <p>2. That He was an Excellent Being:</p>
               <p>3. That of all others, he was most Excellent. And this was to be a most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Being: God is a Being; and not any kind of Being, but a <hi>Substance,</hi>
which is the Foundation of other Beings: And not only a Substance but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64164:20"/>
Yet many Beings are perfect in their kind, and in a certain measure of
Perfection; yet limited and finite. But God is absolutely, fully, and every way
infinitely perfect: And therefore above Spirits, living Spirits; above Angels,
who are perfect comparatively, and in an high measure. But their Perfection
is infinitely short of God's perfection. This absolute Perfection includes all the
Attributes, even the most excellent: It excludes all Dependency, being after
not being, Composition, Corruption, Mortality, Contingency, Ignorance, Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
Weakness, Misery, and all Imperfections whatsoever: It includes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Being, Independency, perfect Unity, Simplicity, Immensity, Eternity,
Immortality, the most perfect Life, Knowledge, Wisdom, Integrity, Power, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Bliss; and all these in the highest degree, and the Abstract. And though by
these we may know much of God in this Life; yet all our knowledge here on
Earth is nothing to that we expect in <hi>Heaven:</hi> And the knowledge of Angels
is nothing to the knowledge, wherewith God knows himself: For he being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
knows himself, as infinite, infinitely. We may know that he is infinite; but
as infinite, we know him not. We see but, (if we may so speak) onely the
<hi>Out-side;</hi> nay, but the <hi>Back parts</hi> of God: We cannot pierce into the secrets of
this Eternal Being. <hi>Our Reason</hi> comprehends some little of him; and when it
can proceed no further, <hi>Faith</hi> comes in, and we believe far more then we can
understand. And this our Belief is not contrary to Reason; but Reason it Self
dictates unto us, that we must believe far more of God, then it can inform us
of.</p>

                  <item>2. The Goodness of GOD.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The <hi>Heathens</hi> did give unto their great God, whom they conceived to be
King of their Petty Deities, the Titles of <hi>Optimus &amp; Maximus,</hi> and so made
him the <hi>Best</hi> and the <hi>Greatest.</hi> Whence they had this Light, I know not: <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Alexandrinus</hi> tells us, that many of their greatest Schollers were Thieves,
and did steal out of the Scripture, and from the Jews (whom they would never
acknowledge their Masters) the choifest Truths in their Writings. Howsoever,
this is very certain, That to be great and good, is to be like unto God; and the
greatest and the best, are the most like unto him: and to be absolutely the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
and the best, is to be God. The Scripture speaks very much of the greatness
and goodness of God. And by these two, God is sufficiently differenced from
all other Beings, and is manifested by them, to be far above, and infinitely more
excellent then all.</p>
               <p>God's greatness is that,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> whereby he is one infinite Being. By greatness, I do
not mean greatness of Power and Dominion: For that is Political, and agrees
unto him, as King, in relation to his Subjects, and is founded in the great Works
of Creation and Providence; and, as such, it can be no Attribute: Neither is it
greatness of strength; for that is Physical, and manifested in all his Works, <hi>ad
extra,</hi> and is the same with <hi>Potentia,</hi> which is an Attribute indeed, but in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sense, Neither is it the greatness of <hi>Quantitative extension;</hi> for that is <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical,</hi>
and agreeing onely to Bodies, and Bodily Substances: Yet,</p>
               <p>1. If He were not great Essentially, he could not be so great in Dominion
and Strength.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64164:21"/>
2. This greatness is manifested in the greatness of Dominion, of Strength,
and of great and vast extensive Bodies, especially the <hi>vast Pile of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Greatness is either <hi>Vnity,</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> or <hi>infiniteness</hi> of <hi>Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Unity of his Being, is that Whereby He is <hi>one onely God;</hi> so that there
cannot be another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philosophers</hi> tell us, that <hi>Quantity</hi> follows the <hi>Essence</hi> of things <hi>quantitative</hi>
immediatly, and is so near unto it as that some conceive, that <hi>Quantitas</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but <hi>Substantia quanta,</hi> and adds no <hi>entity</hi> to the <hi>substance.</hi> This <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi>
makes a thing measurable two ways:</p>
               <p>1. By <hi>Number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. By <hi>Magnitude.</hi> And though the greatness of the <hi>Divine Essence</hi> be
neither Physical, nor Mathematical; yet for the Explication thereof, we use the
terms of both, yet abstracting all imperfection. God, for number, is one; for
measure, infinite: and he is infinite, that he may be onely one and the greatest.
That He is One, we often read in Scripture, yet so, that his Unity sometimes sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
his Constan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y; sometimes his Immutability, sometimes his Monarchical
Dominion: But so it is not here taken. Though this Unity be a general Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
agreeing to every Being; so that it cannot be a Being, except one: yet
this Unity of God is proper to himself, and agrees to nothing else as it agrees to
him: Some things are so one, as that they are many, because compounded, and
have parts; but God is a pure Act, and hath no parts; neither is compounded, but
is a <hi>Pure simple Being:</hi> And that which some make a distinct Attribute, and
call Simplicity, belongs unto this Unity. Some things are so one, as that their
Being admits of many Individuals of the same kind; as Men, Angels, and other
Creatures. Yet God is so One, that there are no other Gods, though there be
other Beings. Some things are so one, as that there are not actually any other
of that kind: So there is one Sun, one Moon, one World, one Heaven, one
Earth: yet there may be, and might have been more, if it had pleased God to
make them. But God is so one, as that there is not, there cannot be, another
God. Therefore, he is onely one, and takes up the Deity so fully, as that he can
admit no fellow.</p>
               <p>That God is onely One, the Scriptures testifie: <hi>Is there any God besides me?
Yea, there is no God, I know not any,</hi> Isa. 44. 8. Thou art God alone, is the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 86. 10. and of Christ himself: This is Life Eternal, to
know thee the onely true God. These, and many other places represent Him,
not onely as One, but as the onely One, so that there cannot be another. He was
alone, and the onely One without Superiour, Inferiour, equal God: Nay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Being, but his own Eternal Being, before the World was. This Unity
was manifested in the Creation and Government of the World: For as He was
the onely one Being in Himself from Everlasting; so He is the onely one <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,</hi>
the onely one <hi>Governour, Vniversal and Supream,</hi> and shall be so to <hi>Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.</hi>
He is the onely one Redeemer and Sanctifier; from whom, the streams
of everlasting Bliss, do, and shall for ever issue. This Truth, concerning God's
Unity, was so imprinted in the very hearts of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> that though they did
acknowledge and worship many gods, yet they believed that there was onely
one Supream God, who was King and Lord of all the rest.</p>
               <p>The infiniteness of God,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> is that, whereby He is without all Bounds of Being,
in respect of extent or duration.</p>
               <p>Hence arise two Attributes<list>

               </p>
               <p>All <hi>Creatures</hi> have their Bounds; within the compass whereof, their Being

But great is our Lord, and great is his Power: his understanding is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,

                  <hi>accidents,</hi> and <hi>extrinsecal</hi> to his <hi>Being,</hi> but they are his <hi>Being:</hi> And if his Power
be great, and his Understanding infinite, so that there is no number of it, then
his <hi>Being</hi> is infinite. There is no searching of his Understanding, saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 28. In which Chapter, from <hi>ver.</hi> 22. to 26. is described, and that in
most stately terms and expressions the greatness of God. The terms, indeed, are
suitable to our capacity, and may inform us, That he is far greater then we can
possibly conceive. And this Being is, in some measure, manifested to be infinite,
and unmeasurable, by the great abundance, and unsearchable depth of his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in his Judgments, and his ways of special Providence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. The
Creatures, even all, and every one of them; yea, the World it self have their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Circumference of space, and the periods and terms of their Duration. The
space which they take up, is finite; so is the Duration of their Being, though
drawn out in greatest length. Space of place, and length of time, with their
Periods, do measure all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet this Being is beyond the Circumference of the
World, and the Periods of Time. Neither Time, nor Place, can circumscribe or

               <p>God saith, <hi>Heaven is my Throne and the Earth is my Foot-stool,</hi> Isa. 66. 3. And
again by another Prophet, <hi>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth?</hi> Jer 23. 24. And <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>

               <p>The first place informs us, that God is so in Heaven, that He is on Earth; so
on Earth, that He is in Heaven; and in both at the same time. Yet,</p>
               <p>Because one may be in some part of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and some part of the Earth, at
one and the same time, yet not in every part of both; The second Scripture tells
us, that <hi>He filleth Heaven and Earth,</hi> and takes up both wholly. Yet,</p>
               <p>Lest we should think the <hi>outmost circumference of Heaven,</hi> to be the <hi>outmost

confined within those Bounds; so that He must needs be beyond <hi>all place,</hi> and
<hi>imaginary space.</hi> This <hi>Incomprehensibility of God's Being,</hi> though not in it self <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute;</hi>
yet is represented unto us, by the largest extent of things created: yet
so, as that his Presence extends beyond the World, which cannot contain him;
but He contains it, and therefore is called <hi>Hamakom,</hi> the <hi>Place.</hi>

               <p>This is described also in respect of place, and signifies the presence of God,
and the extent thereof, which is so vast, that there can be no place, where God
is not; yet no place where God is in it, as containing him. The words of
the Prophet; <hi>I fill Heaven and Earth,</hi> do prove this: For, by <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi>
is signified the whole World; beyond which, there is no place: And to fill the
World, is not onely to be in some, or many parts thereof, but to be in all, and
every part: so that no part can be empty of God, who is where anything is.</p>

everything is in some place, either circumscriptively, as Bodies; or definitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

as that He cannot be contained in any one, or all, but is far beyond all. How
this should be, Reason cannot understand; such Knowledge is too wonderfull

               <p>4. He doth so necessarily always exist, that he necessarily is alwayes the
same: and hence his <hi>immutability,</hi> whereby he is not subject unto, but free
from all change.</p>
               <p>1. God is always, and the continuance of his Being is perpetual; Because
he had no Beginning, no interruption, nor ever shall have end of his <hi>Existence.</hi>
He hath no <hi>Beginning:</hi> For before the <hi>Mountains were brought forth,</hi> or ever
thou hadst formed the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the <hi>World, even from everlasting to everlasting,
Thou art God,</hi> (saith the Author of <hi>Psal. 90. v. 2.</hi>) By which words, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,</p>
               <p>1. That God created the Mountains, the Earth, the World.</p>
               <p>2. That He was, and did exist, before they were created.</p>
               <p>3. That He was before them, from everlasting, without any beginning.</p>
               <p>4. That He continues without any interruption, to everlasting, without
end. This long and perpetual Existence, is sometimes represented by His Co-Existence
with all times, or rather with all things in all times: For He is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be the Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 8. He was in all times past, is in all times present, and shall be in all
times to come. Yet Time is not His Measure, it's too short, and cannot
measure his <hi>Everlasting Being,</hi> which infinitely exceeds the <hi>Duration of the
World.</hi> He did exist, when nothing did exist; when nothing could co-exist with
Him.</p>
               <p>2. He necessarily always exists: For He had no cause of his Being without
Himself, neither could He be a Cause of His own Being: For then He should
have been before Himself, which is impossible. Neither is there, or can be any
cause, either within, or without Himself, destructive of His Being. He stands
immoveably fixed in Himself, so that it's impossible to give, or take away the
least <hi>Particle</hi> of <hi>His Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. He is always necessarily the same: <hi>For though the Heavens shall wax old,

he far exceeds and excels all created Beings, even the most excellent.
The Angels now are; yet once they were not: They had a <hi>Beginning</hi> of their
<hi>Beeing,</hi> after not being at all; and are subject to return to nothing again. That
they are in some respect immortal, and shall never ceale to be, it's extrinsecall
unto them. The continuance of their Being without end, depends upon the
Will of the great King their Creatour, without whose support, they cannot exist
a moment, upon whose Will their Being always, doth depend: And in that
respect it's not necessary, but contingent. Besides this essential change, they are
<hi>accidentally mutable,</hi> and may of <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>happy,</hi> become <hi>unholy</hi> and <hi>miserable,</hi> as
was evident by the <hi>Apostate Angels.</hi> Therefore, in all Creatures, even in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi>
we find a mutable Succession of Being, after Not-being, and a Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to Not-being after Being, and a Being so and so, after Being
otherwise. But there can be no Succession in this eternal and unchangeable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which is every way perfect, without any imperfections at all. Yet if any
thing exist, it must necessarily co-exist with it. And in this respect, that of <hi>Boetius</hi>
may be true, that it is <hi>tota simul,</hi> because free from all <hi>mutability<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and not subject
any ways to any mutable Succession. Therefore, the Eternity of God infinitely
differs from the Successive Duration of Angels; yet the Duration of their Being
is the most perfect of all <hi>Created Durations.</hi> The <hi>Decrees</hi> of God, which have
things, <hi>ad extra</hi> out of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their Object, are not properly Eternal. For that
is Eternal, which hath nothing antecedent as a cause, and is absolutely necessary.
But the <hi>Decrees</hi> of God presuppose the <hi>Divine Essence</hi> and <hi>Subsistence,</hi> as ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
and the Will of God as the cause; and are contingent: Because it was in
the Free-will and good-pleasure of God, whether he would Decree any thing
out of himself or no; and also whether he would Decree this or that; thus, or
otherwise. If not so, all things would have been necessary, and as necessary as
God; and the World had been a necessary effect of his <hi>Eternal Power.</hi> How this
unity and infiniteness, in <hi>Immensity</hi> and <hi>Eternity,</hi> necessarily concur to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, is evident to any un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The proper Act of the understanding is <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and the <hi>Perfection</hi> is to

is to know himself, and all things besides himself, and his own being most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,

man to think, that there is any thing which man doth know, or can know,
that God can be ignorant of: For shall not he that planted the <hi>ear hear!

eminent and perfect manner then man can do; because he is the cause and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of all these unto man. The word of God is a <hi>Discerner</hi> of the thoughts,
and intents of the heart, neither is there any <hi>Creature</hi> that is not manifest in
his sight, but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him, with whom
<hi>we have to do,</hi> Heb. 4. 12. 13. These words inform us;</p>

things are in his sight and eyes.</p>
               <p>3. The knowledge of all things, even the most secret, is clear and full: For
they are manifest and naked, and opened to his eyes. <hi>Man</hi> may know many
things, uncertainly and imperfectly: He may know somethings certainly, and
clearly, yet few things fully. Angels may know many things clearly and fully;
yet many things they know not at all; much lesse know them, and all things,
clearly and fully.</p>
               <p>There are many other distinctions of this knowledge:<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> For it may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
either as Speculative of things Possible; or practicall, of things ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and both Antecedently unto the will and decree of this great King: And
consequently to his decree, he knows all things, because he knows the decree
it self perfectly: Therefore he knows all things, according to their future <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities</hi>
or their ordination. He knows all things in their present <hi>existence,</hi> and
all things, and every thing, after they cease to be and exist. He knows all things,
which upon supposition would come to pass, if he did concur, and not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
otherwise. This Knowledge is not acquired by Observation, Experience,
Discourse, or any other way of imperfection. For, because he knows himself
most perfectly, therefore he must needs perfectly know all, (as they use to
speak) intuitiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

things in an excellent and wonderful manner; and this appears most in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of future, free, contingent acts.</p>
               <p>The perfection of God's Will is that,<label type="milestone">

and hateth Iniquity.</p>
               <p>As the perfection of his understanding, eminently includes all intellectual
Vertues; so the perfection of his Will, all <hi>Moral Vertues,</hi> which are purely,
such. And there can be no vertuous act of the Will, either of Men or Angels
which doth not agree to God in a far more excellent manner and measure. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Vertues presuppose intellectual; and they arise and have their Spring from
the Will rightly informed and disposed. It's then rightly disposed, when it's
firmly inclin'd unto, and fixed upon that which is just, and hates that which is
unjust. This may be called <hi>integrity, rectitude, righteousness,</hi> as it includeth all
<hi>Vertues.</hi> But this Rectitude in Men and Angels, is accidental, and separable.
There<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore, both men and Angels may sin, and have sinned. The Rule of their
<hi>Acts</hi> may be in them, but not essentially, nor necessarily. That the glorified
Saints shall never sin, is not <hi>ab intrinseco,</hi> not from their <hi>Being,</hi> or any thing in
themselves; but from without, even from God, who will certainly, and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
support them; so, as to prevent all Errour, and all Sin. But the integrity of
God's Will is <hi>essential;</hi> and as his <hi>Essence</hi> is necessary, so his Integrity must
needs be. And he is necessarily just and holy, because he necessarily loves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who is righteousness it self, and hates every thing contrary to himself. In
this respect, some School-men have determined, that God could not make Man
or Angel impeccable. For then he should have made them Gods. Some Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
never sinned, nor shall sin; yet they are subject to sin, as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
This Integrity of the Divine Will, is manifested very much in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Men and Angels: yet God doth not necessarily love the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and hate the iniquity of these intellectual Creatures, as necessarily to
reward or punish them. He doth freely, and not necessarily will their Being;
therefore he doth not necessarily will any thing, belonging, or added to their
Being. If they be just, he loves their Justice, because he loves himself: If they be
unjust, he hates their injustice, because contrary to himself. He lovs sinful man, &amp;
shews him mercy, pardons him, rewards him, delivers him, makes him happy:
yet not necessarily but out of his free goodness, which he might deny, and would
deny, if it were unjust. If he gives Laws, execute them in rendring punishments,
or rewards: he doth all justly, and that necessarily; yet he neither gives Laws, or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64164:24"/>
executes judgments necessarily, but freely. The Judge of all the World must
needs do right, yet there is no necessity he should be a Judge, because there is no
necessity that there should be a World. All his ways, are Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of truth without iniquity, just and right is he <hi>Deut. 32, 4. He hates evil, and is of
purer eyes, then to behold evil; he cannot look upon iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1. 13. Unto this
Rectitude of Gods Will, many refer Mercy, Bounty, Clemency, and distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Justice: But these are not his <hi>essential justice</hi> and <hi>integrity,</hi> but <hi>emanations,</hi>
or acts of it, being exercised <hi>ad extra,</hi> out of <hi>Himself.</hi> And it's to be observed,
that to love, to shew kindness, to pardon, to relieve, to deliver, are not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vertuous acts and perfections, but as they agree with this rectitude and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity:
yet as they are agreeable to it, so they are excellent, and such as God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in. To punish, oppress, vex, torment, destroy, make miserable, are not evil,
except unjust, and inconsistent with this integrity: otherwise, God would never
punish, and that with <hi>Eternal Punishments,</hi> his most excellent Creatures. And as
it is impossible for God to cease to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Power,</hi> being the <hi>Essence,</hi> must needs be pure Act; and therefore not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called <hi>Power,</hi> but as we take <hi>Power</hi> for strength. And as this is in God,
it's difficult for us to conceive of it, as distinct from his Understanding and his
Will: And some have affirmed, that his <hi>Will</hi> is his <hi>Power,</hi> which is true, <hi>ad
intra,</hi> not <hi>ad extra.</hi> By this Power, as by an eternal and infinite strength, he
standeth fixed irresistibly, and eternally, in his own Being. It's that whereby
he acts Eternally, and necessarily upon himself. And this strength and Power
is exercised, and doth manifest it self in all his glorious Works; in some more,
in some less: Yet all that is exercised out of himself, is nothing to that power
and strength, which is infinite in <hi>Himself,</hi> and is <hi>Himself.</hi> The School-men
dispute much of this <hi>Power;</hi> but always understand it, as exercised out of <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:</hi>
And they distinguish of <hi>Producibile,</hi> and <hi>Factibile.</hi> The Application of
this distinction is. That God's power is Almighty in respect of <hi>Factibile,</hi> that
which may be produced made, done out of <hi>Himself;</hi> but not in respect of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducibile,</hi>
within <hi>Himself.</hi> For the Father produceth the Son, and the Father
and Son produce the Holy Ghost: And in this respect, the Father may be
said to be Almighty; but not the Son, nor the Holy Ghost. But the reason
of this <hi>Curious Speculation,</hi> an <hi>needless Conceit,</hi> is, the misunderstanding of this
<hi>Power,</hi> as referring to the <hi>Essence:</hi> And as it is too <hi>curious,</hi> so it may occasion

the Principal, but the first <hi>Coadequate</hi> Object of his Understanding (and
that from everlasting, to everlasting) is his own Being. The clear and full
contemplation of this most glorious Being, produceth an infinite and Eternal
Knowledge of himself, as most perfect, and most excellent: Thus he cannot
know himself and be known of himself; But he must love himself, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
and eternally <hi>enamoured</hi> with his own <hi>Beauty,</hi> which is sufficient sully
and perpetually, to satiate, and content himself within himself: And hence

For he is fully happy to all Eternity, without any Man, Angel; without Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Earth, the World, or any Creature, by acting thus upon himself. Therefore,
perfect and full happiness, is accounted one of the <hi>Attributes of God.</hi> And if he
were not happy, he could not make the intellectual Beings for ever happy, by a
more full communion with him, and enjoyment of him. From these imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
acts of the Deity upon himself, some conceive, arise the Relations of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son, and Holy Ghost; and that stupendious, and profound mystery of the
glorious Trinity: The Doctrine whereof, is so far above Natural Reason, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
to the highest pitch, that the greatest Wits in the World have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
in the search thereof; and many have denied, and are offended with
the Terms of Trinity, and Persons, as not found in the Holy Scriptures. But,
first, let us hear, what the Scripture saith of this great mystery. The Apostles
Commission and Charge from Christ, was, <hi>To teach</hi> (or Disciple) <hi>all Nations,
baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost,</hi> Math.
28. 18. <hi>And there are Three, which bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word,
and the Holy Ghost, 1 Joh.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
               <p>In the former place, we may observe.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label>
               </p>
               <p>1. One Name of three, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And whether we
take the Name for the <hi>Eternal Deity,</hi> (as the word in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> sometimes
signifies) or for Worship, or for Power: yet there is but one Name, one Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
one Power of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>2. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are three.</p>
               <p>3. That the Father is the first; the Son, the second; the Holy Ghost, the third,
in order.</p>
               <p>4. That the Father, as the Father, is not the Son, nor the Holy Ghost; nor the
Son, as Son, either the Father, or the Holy Ghost; nor the Holy Ghost, as the
Holy Ghost, either of them.</p>
               <p>5. The Father hath relation to the Son, as the Father of the Son: the Son, as
the Son of the Father, to the Father: and the Holy Ghost, being the Breath
and Spirit of the Father, and the Son, hath relation to both, and both to
Him.</p>
               <p>6. Here are three distinct Relatives, and three distinct Relative Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>7. The Father, as God, hath no relation to the Son, but as the Father: no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from both.</p>
               <p>In the latter place, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. we may observe,</p>
               <p>1. That there be three, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>2. That the Father is first, the Son is second; the Holy Ghost is third, in
order, (as before).</p>
               <p>3. He that, in the former place, was called the Son, is here called the
Word.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>That the Word was in the beginning, was with God, was God, and by it all
things were made.</hi> And by the Son it's said; <hi>All things were created, and all things
consist by him,</hi> Col. 1. 15, 16. From whence it follows, That the Father, and the
Son, are but one Creatour, and so but one God together, with the Holy Ghost,
to whom the <hi>incommunicable Perfections, and Works of the Deity,</hi> are attributed.
For as the Spirit of Man is the same <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> with man, and knows
the things of man; so the Spirit, which searcheth and knoweth the deep things
of God, must needs be one and the same <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> with God. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

And the Holy Spirit was the Spirit, before he sanctified either Man or Angel:
Yet the Father was more clearly manifested to be the Father, by sending his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64164:25"/>
Son into the World; and the Son, to be the Son, by the <hi>incarnation and work of
Redemption:</hi> And the Holy Ghost, to be the Holy Ghost, by the <hi>Work of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
The Word which was made flesh, was coeternal, and coequal with the
Father though the <hi>Humane Nature assumed by the Word, was neither coequal, nor
co-eternal.</hi>

later <hi>Latine Christian Writers.</hi> A <hi>Person</hi> was defined long ago by <hi>Occam,</hi> to be
<hi>Suppositum intellectuale,</hi> an <hi>individual intellectual Substance,</hi> subsisting by it self:
And in this strict Sense, <hi>three Persons,</hi> (as <hi>three Angels, three men</hi>) are three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<hi>individual Substances.</hi> But thus, the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> are not
<hi>Three Persons;</hi> for then there should be <hi>three Gods,</hi> whereas they are but one
God, and one <hi>Divine Substance,</hi> though they be considered, as they are represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
according to these three distinct Relations, and Relative Properties. These
three are so intimately united, that they are but one <hi>individual substance:</hi> And
this <hi>Unity of three,</hi> is called by the <hi>Greeks,</hi>

So that there can be no inequality amongst them, in respect of
Time, Power, Dignity, or any other ways. One may be considered before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in respect of order, or origination, (as some of the School-men speak.) The
Generation of the Son, and the Spiration of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and to us unsearchable, had no beginning of Time, nor can have end of
Duration; for they are Eternal. In these high and glorious Productions, the
<hi>Essence</hi> cannot properly be said to be <hi>communicated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the Ancients,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> and many of the Modern Writers, have denyed the
<hi>Trinity of Persons,</hi> and the <hi>Deity of the Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> The <hi>Socinians</hi> argue
against both:</p>
               <p>1. Against the <hi>Trinity of Persons,</hi> alleaging that three Persons are three <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
distinct Substances;</hi> and thence they infer, that if there be three distinct
Persons in the <hi>Deity,</hi> then there are three distinct <hi>Gods,</hi> In this Argument, they
take for granted, that in this great mystery, the word <hi>Person,</hi> is taken properly
and strictly, which no understanding Christian ever thought: And this is gross
and intolerable, especially in men otherwise learned and judicious.</p>
               <p>2. Against the second, they argue; That because the Father, in some places,
is said to be the onely true God; therefore, neither the Son, nor Spirit, can be
properly <hi>Summus ille Deus,</hi> that Supream God. For example, <hi>Crellius,</hi> one of
the most learned and judicious of them, from those words of our Saviour, <hi>This
is life Eternal, to know thee, the onely true God;</hi> argues to this purpose, That if the
Father be the onely true God, then the Son, and the Holy Ghost cannot be God.
This is so <hi>unworthy,</hi> that it deserves no answer. In that place, the Son is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as Man, and flesh <hi>assumed,</hi> and so sent; how el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e could he pray and make
intercession? For God cannot pray, or desire any thing of a Superiour. And
his Prayer is directed to his Father, as God, and the supream Cause, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of all those mercies desired in that Prayer; and, as such, he canot be perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
considered. And it cannot any ways follow, that because he, to whom
flesh <hi>assumed</hi> did pray, was the onely <hi>true God;</hi> that therefore the Word <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi>
flesh, which was in the <hi>Beginning,</hi> before there was any flesh to be <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
and the same with God, so that he was God, is not God. The Text, <hi>Joh.
1.</hi> 1. expresly saith, <hi>He was God, and that God by whom all things were made.</hi> But

make the Soul of man an Image of the Trinity. And <hi>Bacon</hi> is resolute,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64164:26"/>
according to his Title <hi>(Doctor Resolutus),</hi> and saith, that the Trinity is, <hi>Deus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectus,
et amatus, à Seipso; God understood, and beloved, of himself:</hi> Yet they
agree not, in what respect, the Soul is this Image, Whether in respect of the
Substance, or the Faculties; or the Substance, and two Acts; as <hi>Cameracensis,</hi>
and others, do determine: which is most probably the sense of St. <hi>Austin.</hi> If the
Soul understand, and love it Self understood, it's the <hi>same one individual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
which understandeth, which is understoood, which is loved: Yet the
Soul, <hi>as Understanding</hi> differs from it Self as understood; and, as understanding,
and understood from it self, as loving and loved: yet this <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
is very imperfect; not so much for <hi>Peter Lombard's</hi> Reasons: But,</p>
               <p>1. Because we do not understand, how the <hi>Eternal and infinite Deity</hi> doth act
upon it self.</p>
               <p>2. The Soul hath no perfect <hi>Knowledge</hi> of it self, as God hath of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Man's Soul,</hi> as the Object of it self, known and loved, is but the Soul <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally,</hi>
and so the <hi>Productions</hi> are not real, but imperfect; but the <hi>Divine
Productions</hi> are <hi>perfect.</hi> But it's our Duty to be wise and sober, and restrain
our inclination and propension to <hi>curious Speculations,</hi> in these great <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
And we must know, that the <hi>Predications</hi> and <hi>Expressions</hi> used in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
concerning <hi>God the Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> transcend the <hi>Rules of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Logick, Grammar, Rhetorick.</hi> And I am verily perswaded, that the
mystery of the Trinity is more fully and clearly delivered in Scripture, then we
understand it.</p>
               <p>By all this,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> we may clearly understand, that there is a vast, yea an infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
between God and all other Beings; and he is infinitely more glorious,
and excellent, then the best: For,</p>
               <p>1. He is absolutely, and every way most <hi>perfect:</hi> so that there is no imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
nor possibility of imperfection in him.</p>
               <p>2. That he knowing and enjoying himself fully, and for ever, must needs be
infinitely and eternally delighted with himself, and fully for ever content in
himself.</p>
               <p>3. That he is the most noble Object of the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Men</hi>
and <hi>Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. His Beauty is such, that if we could see but some little of it, it would ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and ravish our hearts, and wrap us into such an <hi>Admiration,</hi> that all other
things (even the most excellent) would appear to be base and vile in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of him. He is that Fountain, whence the streams of everlasting joy perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
issue. His Majesty is so excellent, as that he is worthy to be adored with
the greatest humility and reverence. But oh! How little of his Excellency
do we know? How seldome do our choicest Contemplations fix upon him?
How frozen and congealed are our hearts, and affections towards Him? Oh!
Let us improve our knowledge of him, that our love may be more ardent; our
desires of him more quick and lively; our Longings after him more vehement;
our Hearts more purified, that we may hasten to the full enjoyment of him in
<hi>Eternal Glory!</hi> The great business, in this life, we have to do, is to be <hi>cleansed
in the blood of Christ;</hi> that, in the end, we may be fully consecrated, and so fit to
enter the <hi>Temple of Heaven,</hi> and see the brightness of his glory; that so we may
be fully, and for ever happy, in the presence of <hi>this Great,</hi> and <hi>everlasting

               </p>
               <p>All his <hi>Perfections</hi> do inform us; <label type="milestone">

that he alone can contrive, and model the best <hi>Government,</hi> and administer it in
the best manner. His <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Rectitude</hi> is <hi>absolute:</hi> so that his Laws and

proper <hi>Prerogative:</hi> His <hi>Power,</hi> is <hi>Almighty</hi> and <hi>irresistible,</hi> and always regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

God first acquired his Power. It was, indeed, virtually in him, from everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting;

continues to this day; and shall be King to everlasting. But before I shew, how
the Subjection of the Creature, and the Dominion of the Creatour, did arise
from the <hi>Work of Creation,</hi> something must be said of the <hi>Works of God in general,</hi>
and, <hi>in particular,</hi> of <hi>Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Works of God</hi> in general,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> are the <hi>Acts of God,</hi> whereby he produceth

ascribed to his <hi>Active Power,</hi> in respect whereof he is said to be <hi>Almighty.</hi> These
Works, and this working, whereby God in some sort issues out of himself, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose
the <hi>Essence,</hi> and the <hi>Immanent Acts of the Deity,</hi> upon it self, and are the

               <p>2. As produced out of him, and standing in their own proper <hi>Being.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their actuall existence, they were virtually in the understanding, will, and

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> or Counsel of God, is, that whereby he contrived the
manner how, and the order according to which, all things were to be done and
effected: This Counsel presupposeth his absolute and perfect knowledge
not onely of himself, but of all things virtually in his <hi>Almighty power.</hi> And
it is often called in Scripture his Wisdom; and is conceived by us as an act of
<hi>Practicall Knowledge:</hi> It is not Counsel, as Counsel implies any defect or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
as in man it doth. That Counsel of man, which most clearly sees the
end, and the meanes and order of them, conducing effectually to the end, doth
most resemble it, though it come far short of it. The object of this Counsel
is not properly God, but the Works of God; and these not as done, but to be
done, or in doing. It appears and manifests it self in all the works of God,
and especially in those of the Government of Men and Angels; in which it is
so profound and wonderfull, that though we knew something of it, yet the
bottome we can never sound. So that exclamation of the Apostle implies;
<hi>Oh the depth of the Riches both of the Wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
are his judgments, and his wayes past finding out,</hi> Rom. 11. 33. That God
by wisdom made the World, and orders all his works, the Scripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in many places. The <hi>Psalmist,</hi> after his serious meditation and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
both of the Works of Creation and Providence, breaks out into these
words; Oh Lord! How manifold are thy works? In wisdom thou hast made
them all, <hi>Psal,</hi> 104. 25. And it is so far above the Wisdom of man, as his Works
are above the works of Man. This is the reason, why, when he beheld his works
of Creation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he saw that they were very good and beautifull. He saw no defect
or imperfection in them, because they were made and effected in perfect wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
And this is true of all his works: and as then, so now, he may look upon
his works, and keep his Sabbath when he hath finished them; which sinfull
man cannot do. And here is the proper place to say something of the <hi>Idea</hi> of
all things. For there are no first Samplars and Patterns of all things, but in the
counsel of God. For the World, and all Creatures were distinctly contrived
by the wisdom of God, before they did exist. The whole frame and System of
the World thus considered is called by some <hi>Mundus Idealis;</hi> And the severall
Creatures and things thus conceived are said to be <hi>Rationes rerum in Men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> &amp;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64164:27"/>
Cognitione Dei;</hi> the Creatures and things contrived and known before they
were effected or produced, which were not properly God, but things and
Creatures modl'd and known of God. Therefore said <hi>Occam,</hi> that <hi>Ideae</hi> were
<hi>Creaturae a Deo cognitae.</hi> And these may be conceived either Antecedently, or
Consequently to the decree of his will. There is a famous question held affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively
by some: <hi>An dantur in Deo rationes boni &amp; mali, aeternae &amp; indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabiles.</hi>
And as it is affirmed, it's opposed to another question, maintained
affirmatively by others: Whether things be good only, because God wills them,
and not because good in themselves. This controversy <hi>Bradwardine</hi> toucheth
upon, and seemes to determine it by a distinction. For he informs us, that
some things are morally good or evil, antecedently to the will of God; Some
consequently; Some partly antecedently, partly consequently. Yet this doth
not satisfie; because the Will of God may be considered, either as an attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
with the perfection and integrity thereof, or as a decree, or as a Law.
Now,</p>
               <p>1. No quality, disposition, habit, or act of Man or Angel can be morally good
or evil, antecedently to the will of God, and the perfection thereof, as it is an
Attribute.</p>
               <p>2. Nothing can be morally good or evil, antecedently to the decretive and
legislative will of God, except it have some intrinsecal conformity to the Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to the will of God, as an attribute; neither can it rationally be conceived
so to be.</p>
               <p>3. Nothing can be morally good or evil, so as to be immediately <hi>Praemia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
or <hi>Punishable,</hi> antecedently to the <hi>Legislative will</hi> of God. For the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to punishment, and right to reward, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ered as observed or violated, and expressed in the promises or
threats of the Law. By this the judicious reader, will be able to judge of the
controversy. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>intend not to trouble him with these Speculations. Let
this suffice us, firmely to believe that God is necessarily just, and though he
freely <hi>determins commands,</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> all things; yet all his <hi>Decrees, Commands,</hi>
and <hi>Works,</hi> are necessarily just, and there is no iniquity in him.</p>
               <p>The will of God is that,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> whereby he determins all things according to his
Counsel.</p>
               <p>By will in this place, is meant an act of Gods will in respect to things out of
himself; yet so that it presupposeth the will of God as an Attribute; And this
act is called a <hi>Decree.</hi> And here is the proper place to speak of <hi>Decrees</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
which in the Scriptures are called the thoughts and also the purposes of
God. That there are Decrees is evident out of the word; but how they are made
of God, we know not: the manner is unsearchable. This is certain, They are all
agreeable to his Counsel, and that most exactly: For as his Wisdom did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate,
so his Will determined, and no otherwise: and without this will and
determination, nothing could have bin done or effected. From it all things
future rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ututition, according to the School-mens expression. These
Decrees are not strictly and properly eternall, (as was observed before): Yet
they are Antecedent to all time as it measures the Existence of things: They are
said to be many, and may be conceived in a certain order according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and order of the things decreed. That this Will should first decree the
end, and then the meanes is but a fancy, and hath no ground either in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or in solid reason. Yet though they be many, yet they may be reduced to
two sorts: for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ey may be said to be generall or speciall.</p>
               <p>The general Decrees are those, which extend to all things: For there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was, nor is, nor shall be any thing which God did not <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:64164:28"/>
The special Decrees are such as are limited to Angels and Men, in respect of
their <hi>Spirituall</hi> and <hi>Eternall estate,</hi> and especially to men. These are called
by a <hi>Synechdoche, Predestination,</hi> and <hi>Reprobation.</hi> And these presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</p>

were to be directed to their final estate. The nature of them in speciall is to

               <p>These Decrees are free:<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> For there was no Law to bind, or morally necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
him, but his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and his <hi>Justice.</hi> Neither did these bind him to decree
any thing at all; but onely, if he did decree any thing to decree it wisely, and
justly. Both the Creature, and every thing in the Creature, were nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they did <hi>Exist;</hi> and as such, could have no influence to move or incline

any such thing as fore-seen; or actually existent, determine, much lesse necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<hi>God</hi> to passe the Sentence of Eternal Death upon them, or to execute the
same. The determination of <hi>Gods</hi> will is freely from himself, not from my
thing without Himself. <hi>God</hi> my foresee the highest degree of obedience
in the Creature, and yet be no wayes bound to reward it. There is no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
connexion between obedience, and reward; or between the foresight of
obedience, and the decree to reward: onely the decree it self freely ties them
together. There can be no efficient cause out of <hi>God</hi> of the decree of <hi>God:</hi> Some
materiall objective, Logicall cause, there may be. The decree to give Christ
unto Death for enemies; To call Wretched man dead in his sins and trespasses,
by repentance and saith unto eternall glory, was not onely free, but also the
issue of unspeakable love, and compassion; and to destinate man upon faith in
Christ, fore-seen is an act of free grace. Faith it self can be no efficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is not, neither can the fore-knowledge or prevision of this faith, (though
final) be any such thing: For <hi>God</hi> may foresee final faith, and yet not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
to reward it; though without prevision he cannot decree to do so. The
reason of all this is, because nothing but the Being of God, and the acting upon
himself is or can be necessary.</p>

and <hi>Knowledge</hi> are <hi>Antecedent</hi> to his <hi>Will;</hi> and must be conceived by us so to be;
otherwise we should affirm that He decreed things ignorantly and rashly: But
so to think is impious and absurd. There are many works (and so decrees) of
<hi>God,</hi> whereof we can give no reason, but his absolute will and power. He
may love <hi>Iacob,</hi> hate <hi>Esau,</hi> without respect to any merit or demerit in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and decree the elder to serve the younger: Yet thus, As it was done, so
it was decreed wisely and according to Counsel. We can give no reason of
this, yet He can: The reason indeed is secret to us, as not revealed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet known
to Him. And though many things may be done by him, above the Laws given
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64164:28"/>
in Scripture, yet they are not against them. Though his decrees may be truly
said to depend upon his knowledge, yet they depend not upon the things
known. As they are wise, so are they just, though sometimes they seem to us
to be otherwise. The wicked prosper many times, when the <hi>Righteous</hi> are
afflicted and chastened very much. And the innocent suffer, and sometimes
temporally perish with the <hi>Wicked;</hi> and the children often beare the heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of their Fathers sins, and yet are not guilty of their crimes. <hi>These</hi> things
may seem to be <hi>unjust;</hi> yet are not so, but exactly agreeable to the eternall
rules of justice. The reason why they must needs be just, is because he is <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi>
and necessarily <hi>justice,</hi> though his justice in his secret judgements doth not
appear to us. He made no Decree whereby man or Angels was necessitated
to Sin. He indeed did decree the freedome of their will, their subjection to
his power, their obligation by his Lawes. Yet as he did not Decree <hi>that they
should sin,</hi> so he did not decree to prevent all sin; but decreed, that <hi>if they should
sin, they should be liable to punishment.</hi> He made (as he decreed) the <hi>Will</hi> of man
mutable; Yet this mutability was no disadvantage to him, or any necessary cause
of <hi>Sin:</hi> And in the last judgement it will appear that <hi>Sin was from the Creature,</hi>
but not from the <hi>Decree of the Creator.</hi> They are also stable: For the Counsell
of his <hi>Will standeth for ever,</hi> and his thoughts to all generations, <hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 11.
And though there be many <hi>Devices</hi> in the heart of man, yet the Counsell of the
Lord shall stand, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 21. The reason hereof is because they are made in
<hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> and there can be no cause of alteration: Besides, he is <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi>
and cannot be hindered to do what he hath once determined. <hi>Upon</hi> the
stability of these decrees depends the stability of the world, and stability of the
Church, and the certainty of our <hi>Eternall glorification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The power of God is that whereby he is able to effect all according to the
<hi>Counsell</hi> of his Will.<label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>This power is not <hi>Passive:</hi> for God can neither receive nor suffer any thing.
It's <hi>active</hi> and efficient, yet truly <hi>Power,</hi> because <hi>it was not, is not, shall not ever</hi> be
totally <hi>in Act.</hi> For he doth not effect all things which he can, but those things
which he will. He is said to be pure <hi>Act</hi> in respect of his <hi>Essence,</hi> and eternall
acting upon himself. And this power as an Attribute is pure act, and in that
respect is properly <hi>actual</hi> strength, not power physically taken. It extends to
all things possible, and is able to produce them. But we must not think that
they are possible or producible in themselves, but in respect of this power. And
it's to be conceived, first as able to effect, before it actually effect any thing; as
it actually effecteth all things that are effected. It's the root and originall of
all created <hi>active Power;</hi> and all Created causes are effects of it, and act as acted
and moved by him. How it acts and concurrs with <hi>free Agents</hi> when they sin,
the Wit of Man cannot clearly understand and satisfie it self. But this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that as the <hi>Decree,</hi> so the <hi>Power</hi> is alwayes regulated by the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and
<hi>Juctice</hi> of God. It's great and <hi>irresistible:</hi> For though men and Angels may
disobey his Lawes, yet they cannot resist or hinder his power. <hi>For he</hi> is in the
<hi>Heavens,</hi> and hath done whatsoever he pleased, <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 3. And whatsoever
the Lord pleased, that did <hi>He</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and in Earth, in the Seas, and all deep
places, <hi>Psal.</hi> 135. 6. Therefore if God promise great things, and such as to
man may seem impossible, we may safely rely upon <hi>Him: What is said shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be done.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In this respect</hi> that's true that <hi>Opera Trinitatis ad Extra sunt indivisa:</hi> What
one is said to do, all are to be understood to do. The Father doth not create
without the Word, nor was the Word made flesh, nor did redeem without the
Father; nor the Holy Ghost sanctifie without the Father and the Word; neither
do the Father and the Son any thing without the Holy Ghost. For all the
Works of God, <hi>ad extra,</hi> do necessarily presuppose the immanent necessary
acts of the <hi>Deity</hi> upon it self. Yet we must not conceive them as any wayes
<hi>unequal,</hi> either in themselves, or in their working: nor as three distinct agents
uniting their forces joyntly to produce one and the same effect. For one <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall
Essence</hi> must needs, if it act, be one <hi>Individuall Agent,</hi> in the production
of all <hi>Creatures,</hi> and effecting all his works. Therefore we find the Creation
and other Works of God ascribed as well unto the Word and Spirit, as to the
Father, and for the most part to them all as to one God.</p>
               <p>The manner of their concurrence is that,<label type="milestone">

them both.</p>
               <p>This doth imply that the manner of their Work is distinct; yet it's very
difficult to conceive the distinction, or difference. We read that the Father
doth many things by the Word and Spirit, but never that the Word or Spirit
did any thing by the Father. All things were made by the Word, and without
him was not any thing made that was made, <hi>John</hi> 1. 3, And by him were all

by the counsell of the understanding, determines them by his will, and is ready

the <hi>Will</hi> commands, the understanding directs, and the power executeth. The

(as <hi>Occam</hi> and <hi>Bacon</hi> expresse it) and the thing created. It is a proper Act of
God, and can be truly affirmed of nothing else: if it were not so, God by this
work could not be distinguished from all other things, as, by this act, we read
in Scripture he is. The first part of the Creation presupposed no matter; and
the other parts no matter, immediately capable of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

draught, and imperfect Beeing, which was (as it were) the rudiment and Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
of this Lower world, as distinct from the Heaven of Heavens, and all things
therein. And if any thing may be called the first matter, this surely is it which
was so imperfect, that only the skill and power of God could inform it. And
he did inform it, and out of it made first the Elements, and out of them all
<hi>Mixt</hi> bodyes. The first Elements was light which may be called the fire, which
is the purest, the most subtil, and active of all the rest, and soared aloft into the
highest place; and the nature of it such, that it hath great affinity with a Spirit,
and is next unto it. The next was the Firmament, which we call the Ayr:
And it was spread like a Curtain round about the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
and takes up the space between them, an the <hi>Aethereal</hi> light or fire: a fit
receptacle or subject to receive the <hi>Beames</hi> of light, and being transparent
to transmit them to the earth. The third was the <hi>Water</hi> which first covered

of God was reduced to the fluid <hi>substance</hi> which now we see it to be; and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

               </p>
               <p>The last, the lowest, and the dullest Element, was the Earth: And with it
were created <hi>Minerals</hi> and <hi>Vegetables,</hi> as <hi>Grasse, Hearbs, Plants,</hi> and all <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

The Fourth, he returns unto the <hi>Aetherial Part,</hi> and creates the Sun, Moon,
and Stars: The two first, as greater Lights; the one, for the Day; the other, for
the Night, together with the Stars. These are the Lights and Lamps, placed
under the Roof, and highest part of the Lower-World. These were made not
onely for Beauty and Ornament, but also for the benefit of the <hi>Lower Globe;</hi>
upon which, by light and motion, they have great power: And, as the order,
wherein they were placed, and their motion in a certain Line, according to a
certain Rule, which they always observe, is excellent; so the use and benefit of
them is manifold and wonderful.</p>

               <p>The Creation of Man,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIII</label> is that whereby God, according to his Image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
made Man of the Dust of the Earth, breathing into his Nostrils the breath
of life, whereby he became a <hi>living soul:</hi> and Woman of a Rib, that they might
have Dominion over the <hi>Sensitive Creatures</hi> and the Earth, <hi>Gen. 1. 26, 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp; 2. 7,
22. Or more briefly, It is that, whereby he made man Male, and Female, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Image.</p>
               <p>To know the Creation of man, doth nearly, and very much concern us; not
onely because we are men, and also excellent Creatures; but also because this
knowledge gives much light unto the knowledge of this Kingdom, and tends
much to the glory of God, and our eternal happiness. He is the Abridgment of
Heaven and Earth, and is virtually the whole World; and therefore styled the
<hi>Micro-cosme</hi> or <hi>Little World.</hi> His Body hath affinity with the Earth; his Soul
with Heaven and Angels: Like those pretious stones, which, though Earth, yet
participate of Heaven. He is the <hi>Horizon</hi> of Time and Eternity, and dwells in
the Confines of both, as being contiguous both to the one and other. He was
stamped with the Image of God, and was made capable of Heaven, and Beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Communion with this Eternal King.</p>
               <p>To understand his <hi>excellency</hi> the better, we must consider his <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parts are two: the Body, and the Soul. The Body was made of Dust,
and Dust of nothing, at the first. As there was a great distance betwixt Dust and
nothing; so there is between Dust and the Body, if we look upon it but as
a Carkass; much more if we consider it, <hi>as animated by the presence, union, and
power of the Soul;</hi> and most of all, as glorified. This distance between Dust, and
a Body, is so great, that nothing but the Hand of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the Art of the
Almighty, could make it so excellent a piece. The Matter was base, the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
was excellent and will more gloriously appear, when God, who made
it out of the Dust, at first, a <hi>Natural Body,</hi> shall raise it again out of the Dust, to
make it a <hi>Spiritual Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Perfections of the Body, are these: The Organs, the orderly Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of them, and the Faculties: For though it be but a Body, and far inferiour
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64164:31"/>
to the Soul, yet of all other Bodies it is most excellent, as being a fit Habitation
for the Immortal Soul, as no other Body can be,—The Organs and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are many; their order, composure, and dependance one upon another, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and curious:</hi> the Faculties and Motions are wonderful: They who know
it best, admire it most; and know, that the very Conception, much more the
Creation is a kind of Miracle. It is not onely a fit Tabernacle for the Soul,
which was breath'd into it from <hi>Heaven,</hi> but also a fit Instrument and Servant to
perform the Works of Righteousness and Holiness, jointly, with the Soul, as
directed by it. And as it concurs with the Soul to do good or evil, so it shall
partake with the Soul in rewards and punishments: And no Body, but this of
man, can be the Temple of the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> and though it be <hi>corruptible,</hi> and
may <hi>die,</hi> and by reason of sin is condemned to the Dust, from whence it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
yet this punishment lies upon it but for a time: and as it is <hi>capable of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi>
so it shall be <hi>immortal and glorious upon the Resurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet that which doth more <hi>ennoble,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIV</label> and advance man, is his reasonable and
immortal Soul, which is a Spiritual Substance, and, as a Spirit, doth <hi>animate,
act,</hi> and guide it, being concreated and made with it, and may, and doth live,
when separated from it, The Union of them is wonderful, yet dissoluble, and
for Sin is dissolved. It's said, God breathed in his Nostrils, or his face the breath
of life, and man became a Living Soul. What Expositors say upon the place, I
will not now report; but onely observe,</p>
               <p>1. That these words speak of the Creation of the Soul; yet especially, as it
did animate the Body.</p>
               <p>2. That it was not created first out of the Body, and then put into it, but
created in it, as it always is: For God creates the Spirit in the midst of
Man.</p>
               <p>3. That though God breathed it into Man; yet it was no part, nor particle, of
God's <hi>Essence</hi> but an effect of his power.</p>
               <p>4. That his Soul was reasonable, and far more excellent then that of Beasts;
and therefore tearmed by the <hi>Chaldy-Paraphrast, A speaking Soul;</hi> for to
speak is a proper effect of Reason.</p>
               <p>5. This Soul was created immediately and invisibly from God, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
manner, as is signified by those words; <hi>And God breathed in his
face:</hi> And in the face it doth most appear, and manifest it self, according
to that saying, <hi>Vultus est index Animi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>By the Breathing,</hi> it was united to the Body, of which it might have kept
possession for ever, if Sin had not been <hi>a Cause of Dispossession.</hi> Yet the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Union by the Resurrection, when God shall breathe upon the <hi>Dust</hi>
again, shall be so firm, as that it never shall be dissolved.</p>
               <p>What this Soul of man is, we do not perfectly know: And it was well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
of Learned <hi>Vives,</hi> that God gives us these Souls, not so much to know
their <hi>Essence,</hi> as to use them. Something vve know of them, by Reason and
Discourse; something by Experience: but most of all, by the Holy Scriptures.
The Excellency thereof is clearly known by the Acts and Effects thereof; it
understands, and freely wills. The Understanding reacheth all things, and in
some manner and measure knoweth God, and reacheth Eternity. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
it's said to be all things; because it hath some affinity, and cognation, with
all Objectes; and a kind of <hi>magnetical,</hi> and <hi>attractive Power.</hi> By this, we discern
good and evil; and, according to the <hi>Representation</hi> made, the Will is affected,
or disaffected: For upon a simple Apprehension of a thing, as good or bad,
follows naturally and necessarily a <hi>Complacency,</hi> or <hi>Displicency,</hi> though not a real
and effectual prosecution. It hath also an <hi>Executive</hi> and <hi>Productive Power,</hi> to
work according to the knowledge of the Understanding, and Determination of
the Will, and can imitate the Works of God, though at a great distance. As it is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64164:31"/>
ingenuous in the imitation of Nature, so it models States and Kingdoms, and
resembles God, who hath given it so rare an active power, and a principle of its
own Actions within it self, without any necessary direction or determinati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n
from any Creature without. This active vigour, doth declare the curious and
excellent frame thereof; which, if we understood well and truly, we might from
thence conclude, that it is a Spiritual and Immortal Substance; and, in some
sense, a <hi>Ray of Eternal Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Perfection</hi> of this Soul and Body,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XV</label> which both make up the Being of a
man, is, this, that he was made in the Image and Likeness of God: <hi>For GOD
created Man in his own Image, in the Image of God created he him,</hi> Gen. 1. 27.</p>
               <p>This Image was the Habit of Righteousness and Holiness, arising from the
Spirit of God sanctifying him.</p>
               <p>The Perfection of his Understanding was this, That he knew his God, and
many things else; even all things needful for his Happiness, without any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
               <p>The Perfection of his Will, was the integrity thereof, whereby he was incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to an Universal Obedience unto all God's Commands, and to love that
which was just and good, and hate that which was evil, as he had a power truly
and certainly to know them.</p>
               <p>The Perfection of both in respect of the Body, was this, that he had a perfect
Dominion over it, and the <hi>sensitive Appetite;</hi> and there was no distemper and
disorder in the body to incline it unto evil, contrary to the direction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Soul: Neither was it apt to rebel against the Counsels thereof, as
now sometimes it is: so that both Soul and Body stood in a direct posture, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and moving towards God, as just and holy, and was capable of Eternal Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.
Yet this Harmony and Integrity of Body and Soul, at first, were not such,
as that man was indeclinably fixt upon that which was truly good, either
by Nature, or extrinsecal Confirmation, as one day he shall be: but there was a
Possibility to sin, and dye. To be essentially and necessarily holy and happy, is
proper unto God: To be confirmed in Righteousness, upon Obedience, by
prevention of all sin is a priviledge of the Holy Angels; and, in the end, shall
be the happiness of true and sincere Believers. This Integrity is that whereby
Man is so like unto God, who is essentially holy and just. This is that Image
which shall be restored and renewed upon the merit of Christ, by the operation
of the Spirit, which <hi>Adam</hi> had in the day of Creation. The Spirit wrote in his
heart the Precepts of the Moral Law, as purely Moral: yet this Perfection was
not Essential, but Accidental, because Man continued Man, after he had
lost it.</p>
               <p>Besides the Parts and Perfections of man,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XVI</label> so noble a Creature, a third thing is
to be considered, and that is the <hi>Sex,</hi> which was neither the of <hi>Essence</hi> of, nor
proper to man, but to all <hi>Sensitive Creatures.</hi> The end of it was <hi>Multiplication</hi>
by <hi>Generation.</hi> For though all the Angels were created as so many <hi>Individuals</hi>

of the same Felicity; and if she sinned with him, liable to the same punishments.
She differs onely in this, that she is a <hi>Woman,</hi> the <hi>Female;</hi> and he, the <hi>Male.</hi> He
must beget, she must conceive, bear, bring forth, give suck; and so both joyntly,
must propagate Mankind. She was made of a Rib of man, to signifie how near
she is to man; and how, as they were one flesh at first, so, upon Marriage, they
were made one again. And the Society of Man and Wife, is the nearest in the
World, and requireth the dearest love, and should be the sweetest comfort: And
this was the end why God created Woman; not onely <hi>Generation,</hi> but <hi>mutuall
Society, Help,</hi> and <hi>Comfort: For God saw that it was not good that man should be
alone,</hi> Gen. 2. 18. Man did no ways actually concur to the Creation of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
he was merely <hi>Passive.</hi> God took a Rib from man, without doing the
least harm: yet, of this Rib, none but God could make so excellent a Creature,
which was animated by a reasonable and immortal Soul, and beautified with his
Image.</p>
               <p>In this great Work of Creation finished, we may observe three things:
<list>
                     <item>The first, proper to man.</item>
                     <item>The second, to him, and the <hi>Sensitive generative Creatures.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>The third, common to all. The</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, Proper to Man, was the Dominion over the Creatures of the Lower
Part of the World: For he was made Lord over them, and the Earth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
God said, <hi>Subdue the Earth, and have Dominion over the Fish of the Sea, and
over the Fowls of the Ayr, and ever every living thing that moveth upon the Earth,</hi>
Gen. 1. 28. And he made him little lower then the Angels, and crowned him
with glory and honour. He made him to have Dominion over the Works of
his hands: He put all things under his feet, &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. 5, 6. And though this
same be in a special manner applyed to the <hi>Humiliation,</hi> and <hi>Glorification</hi> of
<hi>Christ,</hi> Heb. 2. 6. yet it did agree to man in the first <hi>Creation.</hi> The reason of
this <hi>Dominion</hi> was, because man was a more noble and <hi>excellent Creature,</hi> was
endued with Wisdom and Power, to subdue and order them: They were made
for his <hi>preservation, service, use<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> God gave them into his hands. And such was
the Power of God, that he put the fear of man upon them: and such was the
Majesty of Man, continuing in his Integrity, that his Countenance and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
did strike <hi>an awe</hi> into the greatest, stronget, and most comely Creatures.
Some make this Dominion a part of God's Image: and it's true, that man, in
this, resembled God, as Lord and King; and as God's <hi>Vice-gerent</hi> was a <hi>Petty
God,</hi> and Lord of the Lower-World. The</p>
               <p>Second thing common to man, with the <hi>Sensitive,</hi> and <hi>generative Creature,</hi>
which propagate, and perpetuate their kind by <hi>a successive generation,</hi> is God's
blessing of them, whereby he gave them a generative power to multiply, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish
the Earth, and the Waters. This power of <hi>Generation,</hi> is a wonderful
and strange <hi>Vertue,</hi> which God alone can give, and take away at pleasure: and
if he take it away, or deny it, then it's above the power of Nature to generate.
The</p>
               <p>Third thing is, That general quality of all Creatures, as they came from God.
For, <hi>God saw every thing that he had made, and it was very good,</hi> Genes. 1.
31.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:64164:32"/>
1. Every thing was good, beautiful, and perfect in it's kind: there was no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
or blemish, in the Being and Constitution of it.</p>
               <p>2. Every thing was good and perfect, for the end and use he had created
them.</p>
               <p>3. Every thing was good in it's order, by which all things were united, and
one subordinate to another, and did compleat the Beauty of the whole, and
made up the great and glorious Frame, which we call the World. The reason
of this goodness was, because they were made by a perfect Rule, and every
thing severally, and all things jointly did fully answer, and were exactly confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to that most excellent Model, and <hi>Idea,</hi> contrived by his Wisdom: So
that there was no need, that God should continue this Work of Creation any
longer, but might <hi>rest, and keep his Sabbath, and take content in his Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If God,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XVII</label> in the <hi>Beginning,</hi> thus created <hi>Heaven and Earth,</hi> then it follows,</p>
               <p>1. That the World had a <hi>Beginning;</hi> it was not from <hi>Everlasting:</hi> For
there was a moment, a first point and period when it began, and before which
it did not exist; and before which God onely had his Being from Everlasting,
fully perfect, and happy in himself, and could have no need of the World; for
it could add nothing to his happiness.</p>
               <p>2. That the World, in this respect, was a Work, and an effect, which must
needs have a cause, and depend upon it, for its very first Being; without which,
it had never been.</p>
               <p>3. The efficient cause and Work-man, which did contrive and make this
curious and excellent piece, was God: For nothing but God had any Being, or
Existence before this Work of Creation: Neither could there be any Power of
Wisdom, but his, sufficient to produce the least thing from nothing into
<hi>Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. This great Work, once made, must needs manifest the glorious Power,
Wisdom, and Perfections of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Maker: For, <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of
God, and the Firmament sheweth his handy-work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Psal. 19. 1.</p>
               <p>5. By this Work, God is sufficiently differenced from all other Things, as of
far more excellent, and of a far more admirable power: So that by this it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
there can be no other God but He: For whatsoever cannot make a <hi>World
is not God as he is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>Therefore He, and He alone, must needs be God: there neither is, nor
can be any other:</hi> For He is great, and doth wondrous things, and is God alone,
<hi>Psal. 86. 10. And before:</hi> Among the gods, there is none like to thee, O Lord,
neither are there any Works like unto thy Works.</p>
               <p>7. It's the duty of Men and Angels to behold these glorious Works, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
therein to observe his wonderful Power and Wisdom, that so they may
admire his glorious <hi>Excellency,</hi> and with all Humility, <hi>adore his Eternal Majesty,
who alone is worthy of all honour, glory,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> for evermore, even for this <hi>Work
of Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. If he created all things, and that first of nothing, then all things are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his: He hath an absolute Propriety in them, and full power to order them,
and dispose of them at Will and Pleasure. And by this we understand, how he
did acquire his Supream and <hi>Vniversal Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto Creation hath been considered,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XVIII</label> briefly, in it self, and as it is a Work,
and the first Work of God; and now Order requires, that we return unto the
principal and intended consideration thereof, according to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Method of my
Discourse, as it is the Foundation and first ground of that Regal Power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the World is governed. This Consideration, is expressed in the last conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
concerning the Power acquired by Creation. For the World was made,
that it might be governed; and none was fit to govern it, but he that made it;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64164:33"/>
and none can govern without Power acquired one way or other. This Power
was acquired by Creation, because, by it, God obtained an absolute and perfect
Propriety in the whole World, and every part thereof. Amongst men, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
makes any thing by his own proper Art and Labour, and that of his own
stuff, he must needs have a full right unto it, and a full power to dispose of it:
yet no Workman ever made any Work without some matter: yet God made
all things without any matter <hi>Pre-existent.</hi> And in this, is far above all other
Work-men, who never made their stust or matter. In this respect <hi>He is the sole
and total cause of the whole world</hi> and every thing receiveth its whole <hi>Entity,</hi> and
every <hi>Particle</hi> of it from the Creatour. From hence it follows, that seeing the
whole <hi>Entity</hi> is Gods, therefore his Propriety is <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>absolute.</hi> And if it be
such he must needs have <hi>an absolute Power</hi> to dispose of all things, and to order
them as he thought good. And because of this absolute <hi>Propriety</hi> it is, that they
wholly depend upon him for <hi>Being,</hi> and all things else, and are wholly <hi>subject
unto him.</hi> Therefore, he may give them what Rules he pleaseth, order them to
what ends he thinks good, and he hath made them capable of; and also by these,
<hi>regulate</hi> all their inclinations and motions, and bind them to observe his Order,
upon what terms he will. This <hi>Power,</hi> acquired by these means, and grounded
upon this <hi>Propriety,</hi> is <hi>original, absolute supream, universal, Monarchical everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.</hi>
It's originally and primarily in him, as in the Fountain: it's not in the
least measure derived from any other. It's <hi>absolute,</hi> and no ways <hi>limited:</hi> It's
supream, and no ways subordinate or dependent upon any higher, and above it:
It's univeral, and extended to the whole World, as his Territory: It's <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical,</hi>
because the <hi>Power</hi> wholly resides in one: It's <hi>everlasting:</hi> and after it's
once begun, it continues, and shall for ever abide.</p>
               <p>In these respects, it's not only different from, but most excellent, and far above
all other Power.</p>
               <p>And as it's acquired by Creation, so it's continued by <hi>Preservation,</hi> which
some make a part of <hi>Providence,</hi> as in some sense it may be. For by whatsoever
his <hi>Propriety,</hi> and the dependency and subjection of the Creature is continued,
by the same his <hi>Power</hi> is continued: And as by <hi>Creation</hi> all things were made;
so by <hi>Preservation,</hi> which is a continued <hi>Creation</hi> all things continue his.</p>
               <p>There is, indeed, some difference between <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Preservation,</hi> not
only in this, that <hi>Preservation</hi> presupposeth, and necessarily requireth, the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and all things <hi>existent</hi> in their <hi>Actual Being:</hi> But, <hi>Creation</hi> presupposed
nothing but his <hi>Almighty Power;</hi> but also in this, that in <hi>Creation,</hi> he made no
use of the secondary <hi>Causes,</hi> and means, as in Providence he doth: yet these
means and secondary causes are not used out of necessity: For what he doth effect
by them, he can easily do without them. Therefore, the use of them is merely vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary;
and to let us understand so much, he many times omits them. Some
things are preserved by Food, which is like Fuel to the fire, which continually
seeds upon it; and when it's wholly consumed, or with-drawn, it's presently
quenched.</p>
               <p>Thus the life of man is preserved by Bread; yet God makes this Bread, gives
it to whom he will, and denies it when he will: and his Blessings gives it Vertue
to preserve that Life; which it cannot restore, once lost; or give, where it is not:
Yet man lives not by Bread alone, but by every word which proceedeth out of
God's mouth. Where it's had and used, God is the principal cause; and when
life is preserved without it, He is the sole <hi>Preserver.</hi> The continuance of the
Creature's Being, doth so necessarily always depend on God, as well as his
Powers and Operations, that he need not let loose one contrary against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for their mutuall Destruction: but if he once with-hold his hand, the most
excellent and incorruptible Creatures return to nothing, and lose their <hi>entity</hi>
they obtained by Creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:64164:33"/>
For as 'tis said of <hi>sensitive Creatures, Thou takest away their breath, they dye,
and return to their Dust,</hi> Psal. 104. 29. So it's true of all other things, both seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and joyntly; Thou deniest thy preserving Power wholly; they cease to
be, and return to their former nothing. Therefore, God in the Holy Scriptures,
is so often said to <hi>uphold all things by the Word of his Power:</hi> and it's said, that by
him <hi>all things consist.</hi>

will be. Seeing therefore, all these concur most eminently in God, His
Government must needs be most perfect; as no doubt it is. This Government may be considered, as<list>
                     <item>General, of all things.</item>
                     <item>Special, of some special Creatures.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For God first constituted an exact Order; and, after that, administred and
disposed of all things, according to that Order: This Order was ready imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
upon the Creation: For he did not first make the Creatures without
any Order, but in an excellent way: For all and every one of them were made
<hi>Ordinable</hi> to some certain end; and to this they were inclined, and set in direct
Positure towards their Perfection. Yet, because Inclination was vain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Motion, he gave them power to move. But yet Motion, without a Rule,
might wander and come short of the end; he therefore gave every thing a
Rule, that the motion might be <hi>Regular,</hi> tend directly to, and so reach it's end:
and the Rule was imprinted in the Creature, as the <hi>Pure Morals</hi> in Men and
Angels. As there were several and distinct Ranks and Degrees of Creatures,
so there were several ends. And these ends were not separated at a distance,
nor contrary one unto another, but were disposed in an excellent order, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
like so many Links in one Chain. Some were Superiour; some Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
and one last, and supream, to which all the rest were subordinate; yet
like so many lines did tend unto, and end in that highest, as in one Center: And
that end was not the particular end of some particular Creature, or Creatures:
but the universal end of all, which some means did reach immediately; others,
at a distance.</p>
               <p>In the Administration, the Rules were, as Laws, prefixed by God; and the
Events of every Motion, were as Judgments and Determinations. And there
are some generals in Men and Angels, which come within the compass of this
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64164:34"/>
general Administration. And though the Supream Lord bound all Creatures,
by certain Rules, and limited them, yet be reserved a Power to himself, to act
above, and besides these Rules at Will and Pleasure; and, if his Wisdom should
think good, to new-model the whole Frame of his Government.</p>
               <p>Hence the Distinctions of mediate and immediate; ordinary, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Providence: under which last Head, comes in that of Miracles, which
are works of transcendent Power, above the activity of the Creature; wherin God
doth not observe the Order established in Creation, whereunto he bound the
Creature, but not Himself. They serve, as they are fit for these ends, to let men
know, that there is a great difference between his Works, and those of inferiour
Agents, though he may use their petty efficiency in doing of them: They rouz
and quicken the dull and drowsie minds of Men, who are not so much moved
with ordinary Works, though excellent.</p>
               <p>The Sun it self, that glorious Light of Heaven is no strange thing unto us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

Instincts. Vertues, Operations, Multitude, Variety, Order, and use of things orea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the universal extent of their Administration. As the Creatures are
many, and to us <hi>innumerable,</hi> and very various, according to their Forms and
Characters imprinted upon them; so their Instincts, Vertues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Operations, are
many and various, as their effects also be. And whereas this Multitude and
Propriety, might be a cause of Confusion, and turn them into their <hi>Old Chaos,</hi>
and also would distract and perplex all the Wit and Wisdom of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to prevent it; yet this Administration is such, that they are all, and every
one, by it, kept in order. Every one severally, and all joyntly, have their rule,
keep their place, observe their order, and by the <hi>Eternal Power,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom of
God,</hi> are governed with <hi>ease,</hi> as though they were but one single Creature. The
use of all this is, to make them all, and every one subservient to the main end, to
minister unto man; to be Instruments in the Execution of the Judgments, and
Collation of the Benefits, which the great and everlasting King doth distribute
in that higher Administration of his special Kingdom; and to manifest that
there is <hi>a supream, intelligent Agent,</hi> who makes, moves, orders all things. Yet
we take little notice of this, but look upon the Works of God like Children, or
rather <hi>irrational Brutes:</hi> Otherwise, we might see the hand of Heaven in every

and considered in his <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Capacity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rules are properly Laws, binding to <hi>obedience,</hi> or <hi>punishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The End, is a more <hi>eminent Manifestation,</hi> of the <hi>Divine Perfections,</hi> in the
Rewards and Punishments, not onely <hi>Temporal,</hi> but <hi>Eternal,</hi> of those noble and
most <hi>excellent Creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, it may be described to be,
<hi>An Ordination of God, whereby the Intellectual and Immortal Creatures
are directed, or ordered to an Eternal state of Felicity, or Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Government,</hi> properly so called, according to some, is <hi>an Order of Superiority,</hi>
and <hi>Subjection.</hi> And to govern, is a <hi>Moral Act,</hi> and presupposeth a Superiour
invested with Power, and certain persons subject to this Power. The general
nature of this special Government, is Ordination: and herein it agrees with
the former <hi>Providence.</hi> This Ordination necessarily required, that an Order
should be established, and then observed. The subject of this Ordination, is the
<hi>intellectual</hi> and <hi>immortal Creature,</hi> endued with <hi>Free-will,</hi> as he is such. For the
subject must be <hi>intellectual,</hi> or else he cannot understand a Law; and must be
Immortal, or else he cannot be capable of <hi>an immortal</hi> and <hi>eternal estate.</hi> And
must be endued with <hi>Free-will,</hi> or else he can neither voluntarily submit unto a
<hi>Superiour Power,</hi> or so obey, or disobey, as to be capable of <hi>Punishments,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rules of this Ordination, are Laws binding to <hi>Obedience,</hi> which is the
condition of <hi>Reward promised;</hi> or unto <hi>Punishment,</hi> upon <hi>Disobedience</hi> threatned.
The Rewards and Punishments, are rendred by a just Judgment, upon certain

               </p>
               <p>For these onely are Intellectual and Immortal, and capable of an <hi>Eternal
Estate.</hi> The first, is that of Angels, whereof the Scripture speaks little, as being
revealed and written for man. In this Government, the power of God was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
both by the Constitution of some certain Order, and observation of the
same. The Constitution delivers and determines that Fundamental Law of
his own <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> and the <hi>Angels subjection.</hi> As by Creation, God acquired a
Properiety in them, as well as in other <hi>Creatures,</hi> and a power of Dominion over
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64164:35"/>
them, and by it they were absolutely subjected to him, as intellectual Spirits.
This subjection was natural and necessary: for God could not create them <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi>
upon his <hi>absolute Power</hi> because then they had not been Creatures: yet
he might make them subject unto himself, and not bind them to subjection, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some positive <hi>Penalties,</hi> as he might bind them unto it, without any promise
of Reward.</p>
               <p>Again, he might, by Law, bind them to obedience or punishment, without
any solemn Contract or Covenant, wherein they should engage themselves by
a voluntary submission to his Power: yet it's very likely, as in all Government,
the first thing is, the establishment of the <hi>Soveraign Power of the Prince,</hi> or <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;</hi>
and the <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Fealty</hi> of the People; so it was here. This was the
order which God observed in the Constitution of the Polity of <hi>Israel.</hi> They
must enter into a Solemn Covenant, and promise subjection and obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him as their Lord and God before he publish his Laws, <hi>Exod,</hi> 19. 8. This
Fealty they likewise promised unto <hi>Joshua,</hi> before he took upon him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them <hi>Josh.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18. So likewise <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> though both desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
by God, yet must first, before they can resign, be acknowledged by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>And it's most suitable and agreeable to the Government of intelligent and
free Agents; That the subjection, which doth arise and result naturally, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, so as to signifie and include, not onely Jurisdiction, but Legislation
too. Whether this be the common signification of the word, in most Authors, I
do not much weigh, seeing I have given mine own sense. In this Government of
Angels, which no doubt is wonderful, we have</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Legislation.</item>
                  <item>2. The Judgment of God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For (no doubt) God gave them Laws; and according to their obedience, or
disobedience, judged them: for both these are evident out of Scripture. What
Laws God gave them, in particular, we know not: That they were bound to
continue righteous, and holy, as God made them, and to love God, and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
there can be no question. These were Principles written and concreated
(if I may so speak) with them: yet, that upon the <hi>Performance, Eternal Glory,</hi>
and <hi>Security</hi> of the same would follow; or, that upon the <hi>non-Performance,
eternal punishments</hi> would be inflicted, could not be so clear, by Creation, unto
them.</p>
               <p>There was another Law, whereby they were obliged to observe that order
amongst themselves, which he at first instituted: For there is an Order and
Polity amongst the Angels; but whether Monarchical, or some other, we
know not. If the Devils, those Apostate Angels, do observe the order of their
Creation, it seems to be Monarchical: For we read of the <hi>Prince of Devils,</hi> the
<hi>Prince of the World,</hi> the <hi>Prince of the Power of the Air</hi> (or <hi>Darkness</hi>) as the Word
doth sometimes signifie. What their Duty was, in respect of Man, or of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64164:35"/>
other Creatures, is not so evident. It's certain that the Holy Angels are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring
Spirits for the good of Gods servants, and Sons, since the fall. Though
the <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Generall</hi> Morals of the Decalogue did bind them; yet, as that Law
was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Israel,</hi> or to the Church-Christian, it could not bind
them. For therein there be Duties proper to Man, and such as no ways can
agree to Angels: And here I might take occasion to explain the <hi>Morall Law,</hi>
but this I reserve till I come to speak of the Laws of God as Redeemer by Jesus
Christ, exalted at his right hand, and reigning in the Brightnesse of eternall
Glory. For there were <hi>Laws</hi> of Righteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nesse, and Holinesse, and morall
duties given to Angels, to <hi>Adam,</hi> to the Heathen, to <hi>Israel,</hi> to the Church-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
as shall be made manifest hereafter.</p>
               <p>After Laws Moral and Positive,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> follows Judgment: and upon the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and violation of the same, God began to exercise his Jurisdiction and to judge
the Angels: And this was the first Court God kept, and the generall <hi>Assises,</hi>
wherein all the <hi>Angels</hi> were convented, and rewarded to punished according to
<hi>Observation</hi> or <hi>Violation,</hi> of the Laws given to them. The rule of this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were those <hi>Laws;</hi> The Object, <hi>Angels,</hi> obeying or disobeying; The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
was, of Rewards or <hi>Punishments.</hi> That many of the Angels sinned
and transgressed those <hi>Laws,</hi> and many did obey them, the Holy Scriptures
make evident. And here it's to be noted, that the Sin of Angels was perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
For in one sinning, <hi>all did not sin;</hi> in one condemned, all were not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
though by one man sin entred upon all mankind; and by sin, death:

their example and Perswasion pervert many. That vision of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and
his Angels, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 7. may seem to imply some such thing: But whether
it be so, or otherwise, it's certain, a multitude of Angels sinned and revolted
under one Head and Prince, under whom they continue <hi>Revolters</hi> unto this
day. And here I might take occasion to speak of sin in general: but I defer it
till I speak of the fall and sin of <hi>Man.</hi> What the first sin of these <hi>immorall spirits</hi>
was in particular, is not so clear, as it's clear they did sin. And therefore we

               <p>As God by Creation became an absolute Lord, and had an unlimited power,

though he bounded and limited them, yet he sometimes exerciseth an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

therefore when men had Violated the order and Laws of Creation, he was at
liberty, and took occasion to alter, and new model his goverment. And hence
the twofold government of man, which take up the greatest part, and, in some
respect, the whole book of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Historicall,</hi> the <hi>Doctrinall</hi> and the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi>

these two governments are many: For in the <hi>Civil</hi> the <hi>Governour</hi> is man; his

is imperfect; his immediate end is justice and honesty amongst men for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<hi>Peace;</hi> His Laws, Judgment, Execution tends no further; He is subject
to God and accountable; and his power is perpetuated by Succession, and in the
end shall totally determine, and be dissolved. In this government, God is the
Governour, the souls and consciences of men the Subjects; the wisdom, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and power thereof perfect, the end is Spirituall Righteousnesse and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
peace, to which the Laws and judgments do effectually tend; it continues
for ever; and the estate which it orders men unto is everlasting; and it
hath the Civill goverment subordinate unto it, and in some respect a part of
it.</p>
               <p>That there is a first,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> and second government, I take it for graunted, and shall
afterwards prove it. The description of the first, is this:</p>
               <p>It's Gods ordination of man, whereby he bound all mankind, in one man,
made holy and righteous, and subjected to Him, unto <hi>Perfect</hi> and perpetuall
<hi>Obedience,</hi> or death: and according to his <hi>Obedience</hi> or <hi>Disobedience</hi> passed judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon him.</p>
               <p>That there was such a government may be proved from many places in Gods
book. I will instance in that one: <hi>As by one man, sin entered into the World, and
by sin death: As death passed over all men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14. In which
words we may observe,</p>
               <p>1. That there was sin entering into the world:</p>
               <p>2. That sin presupposeth a <hi>Law;</hi> a <hi>Law</hi> the power of the <hi>Law-giver,</hi> and the
subjection of the party sinning.</p>
               <p>3. We have the sin of one man, and the sin of all men.</p>
               <p>4. That this sin entered by one man, and was from him derived unto
all.</p>
               <p>5. There was death which is Punishment, and the death of one man, and
the Death of all, and that for sin, and the sin of all.</p>
               <p>6. This death presupposeth Judgment, and the execution of the same because
death passed and reigned.</p>
               <p>7. This sin and judgment began with one man, and that was <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. As there can be no judgment or punishment but of sin, so there could be
no sin without a <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. This Law was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and it was the Law of the Tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of good and evil, <hi>annexed</hi> to the morall Lawes: All this may be clearly
understood by the History of <hi>Moses, Gen.</hi> the 2d. and the 3d. Chapters.</p>

               <p>The two latter add nothing to Gods Power, which by his absolute Propriety
is absolute, and so great that it cannot be greater: yet it may add unto the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
and bind man more strongly both to subjection and obedience. There
is some resemblance of these degrees of subjection in the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who though
they were subject unto God by Creation, and Preservation, as all other men
were, yet as they were free men, they received a new and better kind of Being,
by that great deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, and so</p>
               <p>1. Became Subject to God in the first degree.</p>
               <p>2. They voluntarily submit, and receive him for their Lord and God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
themselves, to serve him and obey him, <hi>Exod. 19. 8. Deut.</hi> 5. 27. And
they avouched the Lord their <hi>God, Deut.</hi> 26. 17. This was their allegiance
and fealty, whereby they became his Servants and Vassals.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>God</hi> commanded, and said, They must have no other <hi>Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Voluntary submission, and Promise of obedience on mans part, and the
<hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>Protection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and reward on Gods side, seemes to be a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and together with the condition, <hi>a Covenant.</hi> That there was any foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derall
contract between God stipulating, and man restipulating at the first, is
not so expresse in Scripture. But that, in the constitution and fundamentall Law
of Gods Soveraignty, and mans subjection unto God at first, there was something
<hi>Positive,</hi> wherein God limited his absolute <hi>Power;</hi> is certain. And this is evident
from the tree of Life, and the Law concerning the tree of knowledge of good
and evil, and the threatning of Death, and that God made <hi>Adam</hi> the head of
mankind, and as such did stipulate with him, and bound both him and his, by
the same Law. And the Contract seems to have bin confirmed by solemnities:
For the two Trees in the midst of the Garden imply so much. And whereas
some make the <hi>Promise,</hi> and the threat to be <hi>a Sanction</hi> to confirm the Law,
it's certain that the Command of God did bind with full power without any
such <hi>Sanction:</hi> onely the Promise did bind God upon mans performance of
his Duty; and the threatning made man liable to Punishment upon Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

liable to punishment. So <hi>Jethro's</hi> advice to <hi>Moses,</hi> as Governour of
the <hi>People</hi> as subjects, directs him,</p>
               <p>1. To teach them Lawes, then</p>
               <p>2. To appoint officers, and judges, and so to proced to judgment.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Legislation</hi> was the first part of the <hi>administration,</hi> whereby God bound
man holy and righteous, to perfect and perpetuall obedience, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Life upon that condition, or unto death, if he once diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.</p>
               <p>The party to whom God gave these Lawes was <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him all <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:</hi>
and he being made in the Image of God, righteous and holy, had power
to understand, and perfectly obey these Lawes, and continue in subjection and
obedience. The obligation was strict, and required perfect obedience; without
any promise of Pardon, if he once offended, and by constant obedience he might
obtayne Life.</p>

unto <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> and holinesse, and issue more immediately from
the Love of God, and our Neighbour, which are the <hi>Principall</hi> dutyes of that

               <p>
                  <hi>Positive</hi> are such as require obedience in things <hi>intrinsecally</hi> neither good nor
evill, but indifferent. That there were <hi>Morall Lawes</hi> given to <hi>Adam,</hi> no man
can doubt, because he was certainly bound to continue Righteous and holy as
God made him, and to love his God and his Neighbour, and to performe such
acts as were intrinsecally, and necessarily just. That he was bound by <hi>Positives,</hi>
is clear and evident, as appeares by the <hi>Prohibition</hi> to eate of the Tree of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
of good and evil. The morall precepts required the continuance of mans
<hi>Fealty</hi> and <hi>Subjection,</hi> and prohibited <hi>Revolt, Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>Apostacy</hi> in the first
place; and in the next place <hi>Obedience</hi> to all other dutyes depending upon, and
derived from that loyalty and fidelity, and forbad all other <hi>disobedience.</hi> The

               </p>
               <p>1. To signifie the absolute Power of God whereby he could bind man to

from the thing, but meerly from the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleasure</hi> of God.</p>

and renounce his own <hi>Will,</hi> &amp; wholly resigne up himself to the <hi>Wisdome</hi> &amp; <hi>Will</hi> of
God: and in these two respects the breach of a Positive law may prove most hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.
Mans dominion over the Creatures, and giving them names, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
are rather reducible to the more generall Providence, though the dutyes

besides these, concerning the Tree in the mid'st of the garden is not easily
determined, neither is it needfull to know them, if there were any other. But
these <hi>Moralls,</hi> and <hi>Positives,</hi> were the rules of mans obedience, in respect of the
precepts and prohibitions: The one bound man unto good, and so to conform
to the <hi>Will</hi> of God; The other bound him, not to do evill, or any thing that
God did not approve.</p>
               <p>These Lawes are a rule of Gods judgement in respect of the Promises,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.
By Promises God bound himself to Man, to reward and blesse
him for his encouragement to obedience: and the reward being sweet, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and very desireable, was a mighty <hi>Motive</hi> unto <hi>Performance</hi> of duty. By
the Commination, he made man liable to punishment, if once he disobeyed:
and death was so terrible, that, to the rationall Creature, it was a mighty and
strong restraint. The thing promised was Life, and the same not onely bodily
and spiritual, but eternall: Yet this life was not a new being, but the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the former <hi>Being.</hi> And this happinesse was not meerely a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that present estate, he enjoyed in Paradise but a farr higher condition
which might reach Heaven, and come neere the blisse of Angels: This seemes
to be intimated, because the Tree of Life is used by the Spirit to signifie that
<hi>Eternall Life</hi> which is to be enjoyed in the Heavenly Paradise, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7. Death
which was threatened, was not onely <hi>a dissolution</hi> of Soul and Body, begun in
the miseryes of this Life, but also spirituall and eternall punishments. For it's
opposed to that eternall Life we obtayne by Jesus Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 21. and 6.
23. Without this Promise man could not have had upon his obedience any
right unto, or certain hope of, eternall Life, and that felicity which was suitable
to his intellectuall and immortall being. And if man obeyed, God was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
bound by this promise to reward: If he disobeyed, Man was liable to be
punished, though God was not absolutely bound to <hi>Punish:</hi> Yet to vindicate
the honour of his Law, his will was, that some punishment must be suffered
before he would <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Save.</hi>

               <p>AFter that God had given man Lawes,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>I</label> and man began to observe or violate
the same, God began to exercise his universall, and supreme <hi>jurisdiction,</hi> not
by <hi>Delegates</hi> and inferiour <hi>Judges,</hi> but by <hi>Himself.</hi> The proper <hi>subject</hi> of this
judgment was man, as subject to Gods Power, under his Laws, and observing
or violating the same. For, As the Law determins <hi>jus observandum,</hi> and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
mans duty; So judgement considers <hi>jus aut Observatum, aut Violatum,</hi> as
Observed, or Violated already. The Act of this judgement was to render to
man according to his Works in generall; and in particular as mens workes are
good or bad, agreeable or disagreeable to his Laws, to reward, or punish. For
judgement is a Retribution, and the end of it is <hi>justice</hi> in the execution of his
Laws, for the happinesse or misery of <hi>Man,</hi> according to his doings. And here
by the way we may observe, that as the Law is <hi>de actibus futuris,</hi> of future works;
So judgment is of <hi>Acts past.</hi> And here it may be doubted, Whether God gave
any command of <hi>Habits?</hi> And this is easily resolved: for God bound man to
habituall righteousnesse, and holinesse, so farr as Habits did depend upon Acts:
For as an habit is acquired by Acts, and former habits strengthened and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
and demerit prevented; so by disobedient <hi>Acts,</hi> the <hi>Active Power</hi> to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64164:40"/>
righteousnesse is not only <hi>Weakened,</hi> but in danger upon demerit to be taken
away by the <hi>just Judge.</hi> God gave man sufficient power to continue such as he
made him, and to perform perfect obedience, if he by sin did not deprive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of that <hi>Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to mans obedience,<label type="milestone">

to judgement, first in rewards, then in punishments? For man did not <hi>sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,</hi>
and immediately upon his Creation, but continued subject and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for a certain time. But how long we cannot punctually determine. But
long it was not before he was tempted and did transgresse. Whilst he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his duty, and observed his Creator's Laws, his condition according to Gods
promise was very comfortable: <hi>His Dominion</hi> over the Creatures was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
Paradise his habitation; the holy Angels his Friends; the Creatures his
Servants. He had free accesse to the Tree of Life; enjoyed sweet Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with his God, who continued his Sanctifying Spirit in him, and all necessary
assistance unto him, His peace, joy, content, hope, were excellent, He was
free from that fear, shame, misery, pain, curse, and punishment which followed
upon his Sin: and happy he and his had been if he had walked constantly with
his God. And thus whilst he was innocent without any fault, and obedient
without any sin; God dwelt with him, and made him happy, without any mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Only this was wanting, that as he had not perfected his obedience, so he
was not confirmed and secured in his blessed estate, as the holy Angels are, and
the Saints shall be in glory. What his happinesse should have been, and when
consummate, if he had <hi>Persevered,</hi> we do not certainly, and distinctly know.
The hour of Temptation seems to have been the hour of <hi>Triall;</hi> and it's very
<hi>Probable,</hi> that if in that conflict he had proved <hi>stedfast</hi> and <hi>Victorious,</hi> he and his
might have been <hi>blessed for ever.</hi>

                  </gap>ed of his Honour, and depriv'd of his happy estate.
And here <hi>Divines</hi> take occasion to speak of sin in generall: And though I might
have entered upon this subject, when I spake of the fall and condemnation of
many of the Angels, yet because the Scripture speaks most of the sin of man,
therefore I will follow their example and practise; and</p>
               <p>1. Speak of sin in generall.</p>
               <p>2. Of the particular Sin of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The generall nature of sin, is, disobedience to the just command of a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:
and because disobedience is opposed to obedience, therefore it will not be
amisse to enquire a little into the nature of obedience. Obedience is not of
Physicall, but morall and politicall consideration. For it presupposeth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent,
and free agent, and the same subject to the Power, and bound by the
Laws of a Superiour: for where there is no Superiour Power, there can be no
Law; and where there is no Law, there can be no obedience, or disobedience.
Whether the immediate subject of obedience be acts or habits was formerly
determined in some manner: but here you must observe, that intelligent and
free acts, inclinations, habits, especially Acts, are the subject immediat and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of obedience: and the proper and first subject of it is the will, and heart, the
acts whereof are intelligent and free, and no other acts else. This is the reason
why God so much requires the heart, and will not accept any, the greatest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
and services if performed without the heart. To this obedience 'tis
necessarily required, that the will freely subject it self to the power of the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
and exactly conforme unto his will, and command in all inclinations
and motions, so far as it is bound: in which respect the will must be no will in
it self. In this particular whereof we speak, the <hi>subject</hi> is man, who is an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64164:40"/>
and free agent; The superiour is God according to the power acquired
in Creation: The rule of obedience is the Law, both <hi>Positive,</hi> and morall:
and his obedience is a conformity both in subjection and acting, according to
the will and command of God. <hi>The Principal subject</hi> of this obedience as an
adjunct, and cause of it as an effect, is the <hi>Will</hi> and heart of man; which is the
proper seat of Integrity, and Perversnesse: For other <hi>Acts</hi> are so far good or
bad, as they depend on the <hi>Will,</hi> and are so called <hi>extrinseca dominatione,</hi> and by
Participating their qualification from the <hi>Will.</hi> As it is in, this particular obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
required of <hi>Adam</hi> at the first, so it is in all the other acts of obedience
<hi>performed</hi> to God.</p>
               <p>Sin in generall is opposed to this obedience,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> and is a disobedience to the
Laws of God, not of Man, or any other superiour, in strict sense. Otherwise in
a large sense, the Laws of men may be the lawes of God, and their power his
Power, and it's Gods law and will that they should obey their Laws, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to their Power. For as the Wisdome of God is the first rule, so the will
of God expressed in his law, is the first binding law. That sin is a disobedience
unto a Law, and the Law of God, the Apostle informs us in these words, <hi>Sin</hi> is
the transgression, or rather disobedience to the Law of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 4. For
so the Apostle is to be understood as appeares by the context. This Sin is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beseeming
that nature, and place of men and Angels, wherein God created
them, as nothing more; and so staines them, that when they see themselves,
they loath and abhor themselves, so as they cannot endure to look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
It's the basest thing in the world, and most pernicious unto him that is
once guilty of it. It's a <hi>Deviation</hi> from the best rule of divine <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and a
disagreement with the most just and holy God: It's a contempt, or at least a
neglect of the eternall power of this glorious King. It makes our own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
and the suggestions of the <hi>Devil</hi> our rules, and our own lusts our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
as though we were not subject unto God. It deprives us of eternall light,
and is the perpetuall fuel of Hell-fire: and the desert thereof is very dreadfull.
For these reasons God hates it, forbids it, threatens it, gave both men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
at the first, power against it; and for it, not repented of &amp; pardoned, he casts
both men and Angels out of his presence into utter darknesse, and torments
them with eternall fire.</p>
               <p>Yet all Sinnes are not equall,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> as the punishments deserved are some lesse,
some greater. And here I might enlarge and discover the severall sorts, the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations;
the Consequents of Sin in generall.</p>
               <p>1. For the kinds and distinctions, they are many: For we hold that some
sins are against the Law, some against the Gospel, some against God, some
against man; Some of omission, some of Commission <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And these distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may be tolerable in some sense.</p>
               <p>2. The degrees and aggravations are very many, and might be observed out
of Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reduced into method as is done by <hi>the Learned and most ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Doctor Chappel,</hi> in his <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Preaching.</hi> The Crucifying of Christ,
the Lord of glory was an heynous crime; yet some who had an hand in it were
ignorant. For so our Saviour prayes, Father forgive them, for they know not
what they do, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 34. Yet others did it maliciously, and contrary to the
clear light of their Conscience: and concerning these the supreme Judge is sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited,
and desired to add iniquity unto their iniquity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 27. And
there is a sin against the Holy-Ghost, which according to the rules of Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
justice renders the partyes sinning incapable of remission. Such is the
Blaspemy against the Holy-Ghost, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 31. and the Apostacy of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
having once received the knowledge of the truth, <hi>Heb. 10. 26, 27. Paul</hi>
was a Blasphemer, a Persecutour, and injurious, yet he sinned ignorantly, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64164:41"/>
in unbelief: and upon his repentance obtayned mercy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 16. The
knowing Servant neglects to do his Masters will; so doth the ignorant Servant
too: yet the sin of the former, is greater then the sin of the latter; and their
punishment must be commensurable to their sin, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 47, 48. These
places I observe, to let you understand and put you in mind,</p>
               <p>1. That sin is not in the outward act properly and immediately: for severall
persons may do the same act, and yet not be equally sinfull: there may be a great
inequality in the sin.</p>
               <p>2. That there are degrees of sins, as there shall be of punishments.</p>
               <p>3. That the more of will there is in any sin, the more heynous the sin is and
it's the principall, and intrinsecall aggravation of it.</p>
               <p>This greater measure of Will appeares to be, and manifests it self</p>
               <p>1. In such as have helps, meanes, power to do that which is just, and many
and powerfull restraints from sin, and yet commit it.</p>
               <p>2. In such as have many helps, meanes, motives to repentance, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
senslesse and secure.</p>
               <p>3. Those are most heynons, which proceed not from ignorance and infirmity
within, nor from violence of temptation, opposition, and impediments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
but from the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>mere</hi> malignity of the <hi>Will.</hi> Ignorance, infirmity, and
strength of temptation, make sin, lesse, the more excusable, and pardonable.
Yet we may willfully, or at least carelesly cast our selves upon temptation; be
ignorant through out negligence or willfulnesse; we may go on in sin, till it
prove habitual, and make us <hi>Slaves</hi> unto our own lust; We may give way to
one sin, as Drunkennesse, Covetousenesse, or Ambition; and so necessarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
our selves in other sins, which those once having possessed our hearts
make unavoydable. In these cases sin is lesse excusable, because we are the
cause of our ignorance, infirmity, and disadvantage. If any say, that to intend mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and act it, is more then barely to intend it; the Answer is easy: That if
any not only intend it, but proceed, if not hindered, to act it; that doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
more of will and inclination to be in the heart, then if he should only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it, and yet when he hath power, doth not act it. And so of Adultery and
other sins.</p>
               <p>3. There be aggravations <hi>extrinsecal,</hi> as from the qualification of the party
offending; from the party offended; from the circumstances of time and place,
and such like; which I passe by, and come to the consequents of sin: And they
are of three sorts: Such as follow,</p>
               <p>1. In respect of sin it self.</p>

                  <item>2. Shame, because it's base.</item>
                  <item>3. Weakning the inclination to good, because it's contrary.</item>
               </list>
               <p>2. In respect of the Law-giver and the law, the Consequents are,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Offence.</item>
                  <item>2. Blame; for it makes the party accusable and chargeable with it.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Guilt,</hi> because it makes liable to punishment.</item>
               </list>
               <p>3. In respect of the Judge and judgement, the consequents are, fear, sorrow,

               <p>This sin in respect of the matter, and the outward <hi>Act</hi> of eating the fruit of
the tree seems not to be heynous. And certainly if there had been no divine
prohibition, the act was in it self indifferent: <hi>Morally</hi> and <hi>intrinsecally</hi> it was
neither good nor evill. But to eate of that fruit contrary to Gods prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and peremptory commination, was heynous; as being a contempt of Gods
absolute powers and a breach of the first and great command, from which all the
rest derive their morality. And it was a contempt not onely of his absolute po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
but of his severe justice. And he that doth not regard the supreme and
legislative power of any Prince, will not feare to disobay any of his Lawes. And
it was more grievous for other reasons: For the observation of that Law was
very easie, because the thing commanded was the forbearance of, and abstinence
from, the fruit of one onely Tree, whereof he had not the least need, as having
such plenty and variety of so many kinds of delicates. He that will not yearly
pay a pepper-corn in acknowledgment of the eminent dominion of a chief-Lord,
for a vast estate freely given him upon such easie termes is most unworthy
of it. Againe the law was cleare, and easie to be understood, and he knew it
well, and had full and perfect power to keep it, and that without any difficulty.
Besides, upon this petty act of obedience the eternall welfare of him, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
his Posterity did depend and if he once tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>grest it, he had not the least co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to expect any thing, but absolute condemnation to eternal death. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could all the <hi>Powers</hi> of darknesse force or necessitate him to touch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ast
the forbidden fruit. To eare it therefore must be a complication of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of heynous sins, as ingratitude, unbelief, cruelty to himself and his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Yet though it was so heynous, yet it came short of, and was lesse grievous
then the first revolt of Angels. For he was tempted, surprized, circumvented;
but so they were not.</p>
               <p>After that we know,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> what the first sin in particular is, let's consider the
causes: and they are, 1. Blameable. 2. Blamelesse.</p>
               <p>Blameable were the persons tempting, and the Persons tempted. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
tempting were the Devills united in a body Politick under the Prince of
Devills, their Generall and Commander in chief. To understand this better,
I will enquire into the nature of temptation; examine, <hi>Who</hi> the tempter, and
what this temptation in particular is.</p>
               <p>1. Temptation unto evill and Sin is opposed to the truth of God, to his law,
and therein to his Precepts, prohibitions, promises, threats, as they are meanes
to inform the understanding in the truth, and move the <hi>Will</hi> unto obedience.
The end of it, is to blind the understanding, and pervert the <hi>Will.</hi> It blinds the
understanding, either by taking away or hindering the clear light of the truth, or
deluding it with falshood or errours, by representing that as good and just which
is evill and unjust, or that which is just and good, as evill and unjust; and if it
once cause the mind to doubt of, or deny the truth, it's likely to prevayl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. For
by this meanes it takes away the feare of punishment threatned, and allures the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64164:42"/>
heart with some hope of good which God did never promise: and this is the
way to deale with man, being an intelligent and free creature, whose will in
matter of practice can neither be forced, nor necessitated. The weaknesse of the
party tempted, is from the imperfection of knowledge, and integrity. And the
more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, active, resolute, importunate the tempter is, the greater must needs
be the danger of the party tempted. Yet this is to be observed, that no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
though violent and subtile can necessitate the will of man. Thus
<hi>Bradwardine</hi> proves excellently and fully, that <hi>Voluntas non potest necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari
à causa secunda:</hi> No second cause, no not the Devill himself, can
do it.</p>
               <p>This is the generall nature of temptation,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> but</p>
               <p>2. Who was the Tempter? The History, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. makes mention onely of
a Serpent: Yet no doubt the principall tempter, was far above that Serpent
which was a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ast of the Field, and irrationall. Yet from other places we are
informed, that there is a Dragon Captain-generall with his Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 7.
And lest we should be ignorant, who this Dragon is, it followes that it was the
old Serpen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, the Devill, and Sathan, who deceives the whole earth, <hi>verse</hi> 9. For
he is the grand-impostor and cheater-generall, as all his temptations are cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
cheats and juglings. He it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who by his lyes deceived <hi>Eve</hi> at the first,
and, by her, en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iced and surprized <hi>Adam,</hi> and so murdered all mankind: For
this cause is he said to be a Lyar, and a murderer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. Though the great
temper was the Devill, yet in this temptation he used, or rather abused a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
which was more subtile then any beast of the field: In which respect our
Saviour adviseth us to be as wise as Serpents, <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 16. A Subtile Creature
was a fit instrument of a subtile <hi>Devil.</hi> Why he should not immediately tempt
the Woman, without making use of a Serpent, is not mentioned in that short
History, where the heads of things are onely and that briefly related. Whether
it was because he being a Spirit could not so well converse with Woman a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Creature, without a body assumed: or because the Devills, and so good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
can do many things by bodyes assumed, which without them they cannot:
as by man they act farr more upon man for good or evill, then without them
they could do. Yet in this designe, if he must make use of a bodily Creature,
and he was not permitted, neither could it then be convenient, to assume the
body of man; a Serpent of all other was the fittest for his turn. And it is strange
that in many places, almost in all times, he should be worshiped in the form of a
Serpent, as we are informed, he is at this day in many parts of the <hi>East-Indian
Countryes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the</p>
               <p>Third place the temptation is chiefly to be considered.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. IX.</note> It was a conflict and
encounter between Angels, and all mankind, and the <hi>event</hi> was of greatest conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:
and no battle like this; till, many generations after, the Son of God
made man did encounter the Prince of Devills, and all his power of darknesse
upon the Crosse, gave him a fatall blow, and foyled him for ever, in revenge of
this cursed design, whereby he intended the eternall ruine of mankind.
This businesse was contrived, and managed with greatest power, and pollicy.
For</p>
               <p>1. He makes use of a Serpent, the most subtile beast of the field: and though
we do not understand it, yet he certainly knew there was some special advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in it.</p>
               <p>2. He doth not encounter Man and Woman joyntly, and at once; but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally.</p>
               <p>3. He begins with the Woman.</p>
               <p>4. He doth not single out any of Gods <hi>Moral</hi> precepts or prohibitions: For
these were too deeply imprinted in the soul, and of clearer light, but he makes
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64164:42"/>
choyce of that positive precept which was not so obvious to reason, and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have some mystery in it, and to admit some latitude for a <hi>Subtile
discourse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. He doth not instantly deny this <hi>Positive Law,</hi> but begins to question
the sense of it, till at length he caused the Woman to doubt.</p>
               <p>6. In the end he assures her, there was no danger, as she seated and fondly
surmised in eating of that fruit, but certain hope of some great good: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
perswades her to look upon that goodly fruit, and consider whether there
was any probability of the least evill to follow thereupon.</p>
               <p>7. By the Woman he perswades the man, who dearly loved her, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his affection could suspect no evill in any wise from her. And here it is
observeable that the first advantage the Woman gave him, was, in that she did
not <hi>strictly,</hi> &amp; <hi>peremptorily</hi> insist upon the plain and simple sense of he <hi>Law.</hi> For
when we once forsake the simplicity of the Word of God, the subtlety of Sathan
is such, that he will speedily and easily deceive us. This was <hi>Paul's</hi> fear, lest
by any meanes, as the Serpent beguiled <hi>Eve</hi> through his subtlety, so the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
11. 3. And now it is the grand designe of Sathan by his Agents to detaine
people in the ignorance of the Scriptures, or, if that cannot be, to <hi>Question the
Divine authority</hi> of, them; or if they be perswaded of it, yet to put them to prove
it, and prove it evidently and demonstratively to them. Yet if notwithstanding
all this, they will adhere to these records as <hi>Divine,</hi> they will argue against the
sufficiency of them without unwritten traditions. But let the sufficiency be
proved, they will controvert the Transcripts and Translations, and make the
sense, in plain and necessary things, to be obscure; or divert them from necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
to doubtfull disputations in things needlesse, and no wayes conducing to
Salvation. The Scriptures are the great and mighty <hi>engine</hi> of God against all
the power of Sathan and if we clearly understand, certainely beleeve, and
constantly practise the <hi>Saving Truths</hi> thereof, then we may foyle him, he cannot
prevayle against us. His endeavour therefore is to puzzle our understanding,
shake our Faith, hinder our practise, and perswade us that there is no danger,
but safety, and advantage in sin, or at least tempt us to presume upon Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
The inward motive which set the Devill on work in this cursed, damned
designe, was envy, malice, and delight in doing mischief, which presupposed his
<hi>Revolt</hi> from, and <hi>Rebellion</hi> against God: And in this respect he is said to be a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at:
For this was the first grand lye and <hi>Sophism</hi> in the World: and also a
<hi>Murderer;</hi> for by this meanes he slew mankind, and had for ever undone him,
if God had not prevented it.</p>
               <p>By this attempt the partyes tempting had made themselves deeply guilty,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>X</label>
though it had never taken effect. Yet the cursed damned designe prevayled
against the partyes tempted, and first against the Woman. For she admitted
conference, forsook the simplicity of the truth, began to parly, then to doubt,
and in the end to encline so farr as to look upon the fruit, to cover it, to touch
it, and tast it too: And so the <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nome</hi> of the Serpent infected Soul and Body.
Neither staid it here, but did diffuse, and Communicate it self to man, who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
to his Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, and did eate, and so transgresse: Upon which the victory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
compleat. And though the temptation and plot was deeply laid, and
managed with greatest subtlety, yet they could not be excused. For the law was
plain, the power to observe it sufficient, and God did in no wayes desert them
in any thing necessary. They did both willingly consent and yield. They
were too precipitate, and did too hastily determin and resolve, before they had
sufficiently considered the matter either severally, or joyntly together. And
their sin was, in the issue, so much the more heynous, because they believed the
false suggestions of the Devill, and harkened to his damned Counsel, contrary
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64164:43"/>
to the clear Command, and peremptory Commination of their Creator: In
all this they had not the least cause to complain of God: Their Sin, and misery
was from themselves: and there was much of will in the transgression. The
Woman was first in the sin, and was deceived: Yet the Man followed her exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:

doth discourse of this subject, and observes the acts of <hi>Divine</hi> providence about
sin to be reducible to three heads:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In respect of the Beginning.</item>
                  <item>2. Of the Progress.</item>
                  <item>3. The Consummation of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In respect of the Beginning, the <hi>Acts of Providence,</hi> are either permission or
hinderance;</p>
               <p>In respect of the Progress, Direction, and Limitation;</p>
               <p>In respect of Sin, Consummate Punishment, or Remission.</p>
               <p>But he that will accurately discuss this Point of Doctrine, must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish;</p>
               <p>1. Between the first sin of Angels, and the first sin of Man; and other sinnes
following these: For in respect of these later, that which we call permission,
may be a <hi>Desertion,</hi> and to a <hi>Punishment,</hi> which in the first sinnes cannot
be.</p>
               <p>2. He must put a difference between a <hi>Moral,</hi> and a <hi>Physical</hi> permission;
and also between the sinful Disposition, and immediate Act of the Will, as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and such Acts as follow; and are not formally and intrinsecally sinful, but
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> participation.</p>
               <p>3. He must discern, which of these Acts belong to Judgment; as the two
last evidently do; and which not.</p>
               <p>4. It should be distinctly known what this <hi>Permission</hi> is: For it's not any
Licence or Liberty to sin given by God to the Creature; nor any toleration,
connivence, indulgence; much less any approbation of sin. The proper and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
first subject, and cause of sin, is the Will as free: Therefore, when <hi>Scotus</hi>
had defined sin to be <hi>Carentia justitiae actui inesse debitae; Occam</hi> corrects him,
and defines it to be <hi>Carentia justitiae voluntati inesse debitae.</hi> And whereas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

and doth positively <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffirm, that God is the Author of every sin of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
because in Commission there is something positive, which is forbidden
by the Law directly as well as that which is privative; yet gives the reason, why
man is guilty, and God not, because man is under a Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bound; God is
not. And whereas some, in sins of Commission, distinguish between the <hi>Act,</hi>
whereof they grant God to be the Author; and the Sinfulness of the <hi>Act,</hi>
whereof he is not the Author; He answers, That in sins of Commission, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Act</hi> is forbidden; and therefore the very <hi>Act</hi> is so sin, that you cannot
make it the subject of sin, is any ways different from sin. In this making of God
the Author of all sins, he seems to be very bold, and <hi>heterodox,</hi> though very <hi>acute.</hi>
But let his Judgment, in this, be true or false, these things are certain:</p>
               <p>1. That all the difficulty, in this point, ariseth from our ignorance, of the
manner how God concurs with the <hi>Free will</hi> of man in sin.</p>
               <p>2. That God could prevent all sins, and every sin, though he doth not:</p>
               <p>3. That God doth not necessitate, much less force the intelligent Creature to
sin; for then sin could be no sin.</p>
               <p>4. That let <hi>Permission</hi> be what it will, yet he so permits sin, that he can just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64164:43"/>
punish it in the Parties guilty who alone are chargeable with it.</p>
               <p>5. The reason why God doth not, cannot sin, is not onely because he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
no Law, but because he is absolutely just, and holy, and hates sin; as he doth
forbid it, threaten it give power against it, and punisheth it.</p>
               <p>6. We must not think that God doth so permit sin, as not to order the sinner,
and out of evil bring good; as once out of <hi>Darkness,</hi> he created <hi>Light.</hi> To think
that God, who is the <hi>Universal Judge,</hi> is a bare Spectator of sin, must needs be an
<hi>Errour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The cause of this sin,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XI</label> which was <hi>blameless,</hi> was the Law, which did forbid sin,
command obedience, promise life to the Obedient, threaten death to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient.
This could not by any inward native power or quality, be a cause of
Sin or Death; for it was spiritual, holy, just, good, and so contrary to sin: For
every thing acts according to the <hi>inward power,</hi> and quality: And how should
that be for sin, which was the <hi>Rule of Holiness;</hi> and for <hi>Death,</hi> which was given
for <hi>Life?</hi> Yet a cause of sin it might be, though not <hi>per Se,</hi> yet <hi>per Accidens,</hi>
(as the <hi>Logicians</hi> speak): Not by any thing in it self, yet by something from
without, in Man, or the Devil. Some, instance in the <hi>dashing of a Pitcher against
a Wall,</hi> so that it's broken: The breaking of the Pitcher is an Effect; but the
Cause thereof is rather the force of him who purposely casts it against the wall,
then the Wall it self: yet this <hi>Comparison</hi> is not so fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had been no Law, there had been no sin: <hi>For where there is no Law, there is no
Transgression<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. An if no transgression then no
guilt, no punishment. If there had been no Law, man might have done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worthy of punishment; yet without a Law, he could have contracted no
guilt, so as to be bound to suffer punishment.</p>
               <p>And though God knew, that if he did give a Law, it would be disobeyed, yet
he might justly give it: For as he knew man would transgress it, yet he knew
likewise that he might keep it. No Governour will forbear to enact Laws, to
regulate his People, because he knows many will disobey them. That the Law
tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gressed by man at first, could be no <hi>blameable</hi> cause of sin, is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was just, easie to be observed; man had power given him to keep it, and
the Law it self did express, what, and how great the evil would be, whereunto
man should certainly be liable, if he transgressed: and this was done to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
man from sin for his own good. By all this, it's evident that the first sin
was neither from God, nor the Law of God, so as they could be blamed, but
from the Devil, Woman, Man who were justly chargable with it, and punishable
for it. Let no man therefore charge God, who is most holy, nor the <hi>Decree of
God,</hi> nor the Law of God with sin, as any ways a proper cause thereof: Let God
be true, and every man a Lya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thy saying, and overcome when thou art judged,</hi> Rom. 3. 4. But let every one charge
his own heart, and with all humility and grief confess his own sin. It's true,
that the temptation of the Devil tends directly to sin; yet that could do us no
hurt, if we did resolutely reject it, and not consent unto it.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>I</label> I have spoken briefly of Sin, in general, and the first sin of man, in
particular, as the Object of the Judgment of God, which followed upon
the perpetration of that sin. In this Judgment, God was the Judge; Man the
Party judged: the Rule, not onely the Moral, but positive Law of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64164:44"/>
not bound to this Rule; and therefore, though in many things he observes it;
yet, in some things, he acts above it, as supream Lord above his own Law, and
allays the severity of his Justice, with abundance of Free-grace. The Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

no mercy, if man disobeyed: yet he promiseth mercy, even in the midst
of Judgment, and upon fairest terms. This Judgment is described exactly, in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Wherein we may observe the sin of man, and the judgment of God. The
sin, with the causes thereof, and the first effects thereof before judgment, the
observant Reader will easily understand in the first part of that Chapter. The
Effects, were two:

                     <item>2. Fear.</item>

                  <hi>Fear;</hi> For they heard the Voice of God, and were afraid.</p>
               <p>They sought to cover their shame, and to hide themselves from <hi>God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;</hi>
but both in vain. In the Judgment, or judicial proceedings, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive things
are most observable;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Summons.</item>

                  <item>4. God's Sentence.</item>
                  <item>5. The Execution of the same: God being Supream, and absolute
Lord, was no ways bound to observe <hi>Formalities;</hi> yet he omits no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>essential</hi> to <hi>judgment:</hi> And this was the first great Court, and
<hi>Solemn Assizes,</hi> kept on <hi>Earth.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1. We have the Summons in these words: <hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> The
end of Summons is Appearance; which, in respect of God, was needless, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his <hi>Omnipresence:</hi> And where could man disappear, or hide himself
from his <hi>All seeing Eye?</hi> Yet because man had a foolish and fond conceit that
he mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ht conceal himself, God calls him out, and by these words, lets him know
that 'twas in vain to hide himself: For let him be in the darkest, and most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
place in the World, yet there God was present, and he did appear before
his Tribunal. For these words were not of ignorance, as though God knew not
where he was, but a judicial Summons commanding him to appear before him,
where he should have full liberty to plead for himself: Yet these words were
not a bare Summons, but a Charge: For they implyed,</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Adam</hi> did hide himself; And,</p>
               <p>2. There must be some cause of it; and there could be no cause but sin. For
why should <hi>an innocent</hi> person hide himself, or seek to escape the <hi>presence</hi> of a just
Judge? The Righteous are as bold as a Lyon, and dare look the greatest Judge
in the face. By this flying Gods presence he accused himself as guilty, and
sought to decline the Tryall. This is a generall charge. <hi>Adam</hi> upon this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
and exuseth his hiding of himself, but so, that he rather <hi>accuseth</hi> himself
by pretending that the cause of his hiding himself was his <hi>Nakednesse,</hi> and the
<hi>Presence</hi> of God; whereas it was guilt of Conscience. <hi>Therefore</hi> God taking
hold of his own words, proceeds to a <hi>Particular</hi> charge; That surely he had
transgressed the Law, and had eaten of the Tree whereof God had commanded
him that he should not eate: Who should tell him that he was naked, or how
should he know it, except he had offended? This came so home, and the <hi>crime</hi>
was so <hi>evident,</hi> and his own conscience so full a <hi>Witnesse,</hi> that he could not deny
it. And therefore confesseth his offence, yet so that he endeavours to <hi>attenuate</hi>
it, and <hi>excuse himself.</hi> Thus the man was convicted; yet so, that he <hi>accuseth
his Wife.</hi> Sin is so odious, filthy, base, that the Sinner himself is <hi>ashamed</hi> to
<hi>own</hi> it; but would charge it upon some other, he cares not whom, so that he
might free himself. And if man cannot deny his fact, or prove it not to be a
Sin, yet he will endeavour to make it appeare lesse then it is, that his shame
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64164:44"/>
and punishment may be lesse. For we are not asham'd or affraid to Sin; Yet
when our Sin is charged upon us, we are both <hi>ashamed</hi> of it, and affraid of the
<hi>punishment deserved.</hi> Thus whilst <hi>Adam</hi> excuseth himself to no purpose, he
<hi>accuseth his dearly beloved Spouse:</hi> and she indeed was two wayes guilty:
Not onely.</p>
               <p>1. Because she had eaten the forbidden fruit, but</p>
               <p>2. Because she had given it her husband to eate. She therefor is summoned,
accused, and convicted: For she could no wayes plead <hi>Not guilty.</hi> Yet she is
willing to excuse her self; and pleads she was deceived, and the Serpent, that
is, the Devill had deceived her: Yet this could by no wayes clear and acquit
her, seeing she knew the Law; and the words were plain, and she had power
not onely to resist, but to overcome the Temptation. For the controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Devill and her (if she had well considered) proved in the issue to be
this, whether she should believe God, saying, If thou eate of that Tree, thou
shalt surely dye; or the Devill, saying, Though thou eate thereof thou shalt not
dye, in plain contradiction to the Words of God. The old Serpent the Devil
and Sathan had no excuse; none to cast the blame upon: His crime was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and notorious. And thus the cause was evident, and the partyes clearly
convicted.</p>
               <p>After conviction followes sentence,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> declaring the Will of the supreme Judg,
concerning the Delinquents. And</p>
               <p>1. We must think, and know that the Spirit in this History condescends unto
our capacity, and after the manner of humane judgements, describes the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, as in severall places of the new Testament our Saviour doth; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in <hi>Math.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>2. The order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Sin, the Tryall, the Sentence is observeable.
In the sin, the Devill is first; the Woman the second; the man third and
last.</p>
               <p>In the Tryall Man is first, Woman the second, the Devill the third.</p>
               <p>In the sentence, the Devill is first, Woman second, Man last.</p>
               <p>3. The partyes sentenced are not one Devill, one Serpent, one Woman,
one Man; but the whole body and society of Devills, all Serpents, all
Mankind.</p>
               <p>4. Yet some kind of Serpents was accused above all the rest; the <hi>Prince</hi> of
Devills was principally judged, and so <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were sentenced, as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
root, head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all mankind: And though the seed of the Woman did
comprehend a vast multitude, yet they had one Head, and one principall
amongst them, which must break the Serpents head.</p>
               <p>5. The subject of this judgement, being guilty persons doth inform us, that
the sentence did not determine any reward to be rendered, but onely punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be inflicted by God, and suffered by offenders. It was a sentence of
condemnation not of justification.</p>
               <p>6. As there was difference in the partyes sinning, so there was in the
punishments: For the punishment of the Serpent was one, of the Woman
another, of the Man another; though there might be some punishment generall
to them all.</p>
               <p>7. The pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shment of Man was great, of Woman greater, of the Devill
the greatest: For the degrees of punishment were equally proportioned to the
degrees of Sin.</p>
               <p>These things premised in generall,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> I proceed to discourse of, and unfold the
sentence passed upon the Devill, and the Serpent: and its certain, that as the
naturall Serpent is here expressed; so he is accursed, and most part of the words
agree directly to that kind of Creature; which is cursed above all the beasts of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64164:45"/>
the field, goes crawling on his belly, and licks the dust. And there is emnity
and Antipathy between Woman &amp; the Serpent, between all kind of Serpents &amp;
the Posterity and seed of the Woman; and Man doth often break his head to
take away his Life: and he stings man in the Heel and foot, and by his poyson
sometimes endangers, sometimes takes away his Life. This by constant and
universall experience is sound true: and yet the curse was not at the first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For then God blessed the Creatures, and every thing was good. Nor was
this <hi>enmity</hi> from the Creation: For man was Lord over these Creatures, and
they subject unto him, so as there was neither <hi>harme</hi> nor feare from any of these
Creatures. And though this <hi>Beast</hi> was irrationall, merely an instrument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
abused; yet, to signifie his detestation of sin, God did thus <hi>accurse</hi> him. Thus
the earth is cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed for mans sake: and for the sins of <hi>Israel</hi> the Land must
mourn, the inhabitants with the Beasts of the field, and the fowles shall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
and the fishes shall he take away, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 3. So Christ cursed the Figg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

because fruitlesse.</p>
               <p>Yet,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> this must needs be understood of the Spirituall Serpent, the Devill too,
and that more principally yet in a spirituall sense. The Devill was accursed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but much more now: Therefore some think, that, after this, their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
became desperate, and unalterable, And surely, As, to their former sin they
had added <hi>Lying,</hi> and <hi>Murder;</hi> So God, in this sentence, did add unto their
punishment, and their condition became very bad and miserable. This is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
more plainly in the latter part of the sentence, <hi>verse</hi> 15. Wherein with
some learned Commentatours we may observe.</p>
               <p>1. A perpetuall <hi>emnity,</hi> and thereupon <hi>a perpetuall War,</hi> and the issue of this
War. The <hi>emnity</hi> is</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Between the Serpent, the Devill, and the Woman.</item>
                  <item>2. Between the Serpents seed, and the Womans seed,</item>
                  <item>3. Between the Prince of Devills, and some speciall seed of the Woman,
which was Christ. The issue of this <hi>emnity,</hi> and opposition was the ruine of
the Serpent, and the hurt of the Womans seed: More plainly, the ruine of
Sathans Kingdome &amp; the suffering of Christ, and the persecutions of his Church.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The first <hi>emnity</hi> is between the Devill and the Woman, both present at Gods
tribunall: and this emnity was by a divine decree made irreconcileable: for
though they could agree and converse together in sin to the transgression of Gods
Law; yet now it was Gods will that they should for ever stand at a distance
hereafter. And it's very likely that <hi>Eve</hi> being a true Penitent did for ever hate
as much as any other did, the Devill, who had deceived her; as she did abhor
the Serpent, and detest him, as most abominable, because he had been an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
in that damned and dangerous designe against her. And the more
penitent and pious she was, alwayes expecting when God should give her a
Child, who should take eternal vengeance upon him, so the <hi>Devill</hi> did the more
hate her, and seek her ruine. Yet notwithstanding this decree of <hi>eternall emnity,</hi>
how many <hi>Cursed Witches</hi> have familiarity with the <hi>Devill?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second <hi>emnity</hi> is between the seed of the Serpent, and the seed of the
Woman. And by (his seed) is meant not onely all the rest of the Devills, and
Powers of Darknesse, but also all Wicked Persons; especially enemyes, and
Persecutours of the Power of Godlinesse in the Saints. These are called <hi>A
generation of Vipers,</hi> that is, Serpents, the <hi>Brood</hi> of the <hi>Devill, Math.</hi> 3. 7. To be
of their Father the Devill, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 8. So <hi>Cain</hi> was of that Wicked one, the
Devill, <hi>verse</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>By the seed of the Woman is not understood her mere <hi>naturall Posterity:</hi> for
many of them, as <hi>Cain,</hi> were of the <hi>Devill:</hi> But <hi>her</hi> posterity according to the
Spirit, the <hi>Regenerate, Penitent, Pious,</hi> and <hi>Beleevers,</hi> as she was. Yet, these are
her seed as under Their Head and <hi>Generall Jesus Christ.</hi> And here, as the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
is <hi>bitter,</hi> so the opposition is cruel, and bloody; and the contrariety so
great that they seek the mutuall destruction one of another. The more of God,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64164:45"/>
and <hi>Heaven</hi> is in the seed of the <hi>Woman</hi> the more they <hi>Hate sin,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eek to break
the Power of Sathan, both <hi>in themselves and others.</hi> Yet all their strength is in
God, and Jesus Christ. These the Devill and his brood hate with a dearly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred;
and if they cannot overcome their souls, they <hi>Persecute</hi> their <hi>Bodyes:</hi> And
hence so many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>earfull <hi>dissentions, Wars,</hi> and <hi>Bloody Persecutions.</hi> But the
highest degree of this <hi>emnity</hi> is between the <hi>Prince of Devills,</hi> and the Son of
God made Man, and so, the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Woman,</hi> that he was not <hi>immediately</hi> the
seed of any <hi>Man.</hi> He suffered more from the Devill, and his Angells and
Agents, then ever any did: and the more holy he was, the more he was hated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And the more wicked the Devill was, the more Christ did oppose him; and
prevayled against him according to his <hi>excellent, divine, transcendent Power,</hi> and
holy <hi>Policy,</hi> more then <hi>all men</hi> and <hi>Angells</hi> could do. The <hi>issue</hi> of the great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to as many as his Father
had given him. By him the Prince of the World was cast out, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 31. For
this end he was partaker of flesh and blood with his Brethren, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
him that had the <hi>Power</hi> of death, that is, the <hi>Devil, Heb</hi> 2. 14. And for this
end the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
1 Joh.</hi> 3. 8. And so profound was the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God that he turned the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and policy of Sathan to his own ruine. For whilst he did <hi>bruise</hi> Christs heel,
and put him to death, he overthrew his own Kingdome, and gave <hi>Christ</hi> a <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Victory.</hi> And by him having foyled the <hi>Devil;</hi> in his Power, all the
Saints <hi>overcome the Devil,</hi> and obtayne a <hi>final Victory;</hi> yea, are more then <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours.</hi>
Other Places of Scripture give us so much light as to understand these
<hi>Words</hi> in this <hi>manner;</hi> which certainly <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> understood better then
we can do. Yet this <hi>enmity</hi> and <hi>glorious Conquest</hi> was expressed in few Words,
and some what darkely, because the full <hi>Knowledge</hi> of this great Victory was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
till the Son of God was glorified, and the Gospel revealed. This was
that dreadfull sentence passed upon the <hi>Devil, all his Angells, and his wicked
brood,</hi> which began to be executed then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>shall be Consummate,</hi> when the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
Death</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> shall be cast into the <hi>Lake of fire,</hi> where they shall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
for ever.</p>
               <p>The Sentence,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> passed upon Woman, followes. And her proper punishments,
besides those that are <hi>Common</hi> to <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman,</hi> are two:</p>
               <p>1. God determines to multiply her sorrow in conception: In sorrow she
must bring forth her Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>2. Her desire must be to her <hi>Husband,</hi> and he must rule over her. Both these
are cruel punishments: For many times the birth and life of the child is the
death of the Mother, after that she hath suffered many paines in conceiving,
and bearing, and most cruel pangs in her Travaile: Sometimes the safety of the
Mother is the death of the Child. The latter, is the more grievous because of
the Proud cruel and domineering Spirits of crooked and unfaithfull Husbands:
and by the wickednesse of both partyes, that society, which should have been
most comfortable, proves most miserable. If woman had never sinned, she must
have brought forth Children, yet without paine; and bin subject to her <hi>Husband,</hi>
but without any discomfort. Women should remember this sentence; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
Gods great displeasure against sin, and humble themselves: Yet they
must not despair, but hope for eternall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>life by Jesus Christ their Saviour; and be
thankfull to God, who mitigates the <hi>rigour</hi> of his justice, and in these two things
many times shewes great mercy.</p>
               <p>The sentence passed upon <hi>Adam</hi> is the last; And his <hi>Poenalties</hi> are many:
The ground was cursed for his sake; in sorrow <hi>He</hi> must eat of it all the dayes
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64164:46"/>
of his life; Thorns and Thistles it must bring forth unto him; <hi>He</hi> must eat of
the <hi>Herb</hi> of the field; In the sweat of his face he must eat bread, till he return
to the ground; For out of it he was taken, and being <hi>Dust,</hi> unto <hi>Dust</hi> he
must return. <hi>The sum</hi> of all is, <hi>Misery</hi> and <hi>Mortality: He</hi> must be in misery,
and suffer many afflictions in this Life, and soul and body must part at death,
and death will turn his body in the end to dust. These penalties are fearfully
inflicted upon many; yet with many God deales mercifully, and <hi>removes</hi> or <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents</hi>
many of them, and in the end by the Resurrection gives a full, and finall
deliverance from all.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Sentence</hi> follows <hi>Execution,</hi>

together; so that the Sentence and execution are all one, though the execution is
not finished at the first, but continues afterwards. This execution began instantly
with the Sentence; &amp; Gods word was his deed: For the Serpent instantly was
accursed, and began to suffer all the penalties denounced: So likewise the Devils
did. The punishment of <hi>Woman</hi> began to be executed in her first conception, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
&amp; bringing forth of Children; &amp; man became instantly miserable, and mortal:

at the <hi>Last Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Punishment of the <hi>Woman</hi> shall not determine till the <hi>last</hi> child be born:
And</p>
               <p>The Punishment of <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi> shall not be totally removed, till the
<hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>finall Glorification</hi> of all the Children of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Here,</hi> severall Particulars are considerable:</p>
               <p>1. That this was <hi>A Generall Assizes,</hi> wherein passed Judgment upon <hi>Beasts,
Millions of Angels, and all mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. In the Sentence passed upon the Devil, <hi>CHRIST</hi> was promised; and
by that promise, The Government of mankind was altered; And God <hi>did
new-model his Kingdom:</hi> For thereupon followed <hi>A New Constitution, New
Laws,</hi> and Judgment did proceed afterwards in a <hi>New Manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. By this promise the Covenant of <hi>Works</hi> was made <hi>voyd,</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> as
promising life onely upon condition of <hi>Perfect, Personall,</hi> and <hi>Perpetuall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
without any Promise of <hi>Pardon</hi> of any the <hi>least sin</hi> was repealed; And
the <hi>Positive Law of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> did cease.</p>
               <p>4. Though the Law of works was repealed, yet the Sentence passed upon
man for the sin he Committed against that Law of works (as unrepealed) stands
in force, and shall in part continue unto the Resurrection.</p>
               <p>6. Though the Law of Works as a Condition, and only condition, of life be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed,
yet the pure Morals continue in force to bind man to obedience or pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment
in generall, but not to obedience perfect, as the condition of life; or to
punishment, as no wayes removeable. To argue, that because the matter of the
morall Laws continues in Precepts and Prohibitions, therefore the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues,
is vain. For it may continue, yet in another manner, and to an other
end, and both the manner and the end far different. To say, that man is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law of works as <hi>Adam</hi> was at the first until he be in Christ, is very false
It's true, that he is under the execution of that sentence, which passed upon man
for his sin, against that Law both morall and positive given to <hi>Adam;</hi> and he
cannot passe from death to life, from the State of <hi>Damnation</hi> to the State of
<hi>Salvation,</hi> till he be in Christ, by a true and lively faith. And when we are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64164:46"/>
once in Christ we are not wholly freed from that Sentence, because it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
partly in force untill the Resurrection. But of these, more fully hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

and whereunto the Sentence made it liable.</p>
               <p>2. The extent of sin and death in respect of the subject, and the Derivation
of the same from <hi>Adam</hi> to his posterity; Where something shall be said of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
sin.</p>
               <p>3. The Attributes of God chiefly manifested in this Judgment.</p>
               <p>1. For the punishments; we must know, they were lesse then the desert of
this sin: For in strict justice man had deserved far more, and more grievous,
punishments then this Sentence did determine: For (as you shall hear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after)
God punished man <hi>Citra condignum,</hi> far lesse then he deserved. And
he in great mercy ordained meanes, whereby many of these Judgments might
be prevented, and all in the processe of time removed; as he reserved a power
to <hi>abate</hi> them, or aggravate them at will and pleasure: So that, man hath cause
to blesse God, that though he might, <hi>Yet he will not always chide, neither will he
keep his anger for ever. He hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us
according to our iniquities,</hi> Psal. 103. 9, 10. Where we may observe the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
interruption, and mitigation of his Justice.</p>
               <p>1. The intermission of his chiding. He sometimes chides but not alwayes (as
he might).</p>
               <p>2. The abruption of his anger: He chides sometimes and is angry; yet he
breaks off, and continues not his wrath as he might do for ever.</p>
               <p>3. The mitigation: He punisheth, and sometimes grievously, yet not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our sins, and so much as we deserve. And thus his Sentence is to
be understood: For his execution is the best intepretation of his own mind,
which he knew best himself, when he passed this Judgment.</p>
               <p>Besides the punishment formerly mention'd,<label type="milestone">

exepressed, but either implied, and that darkly in that Scripture, or more fully
expressed in others. These are either spirituall, and such as immediately affect
the soul of man, and tend to it's spirituall and eternall misery; or such as referr
unto his body, and temporal estate in this life; or such as afflict both body and
soul for ever, in the world to come (if not prevented). The first and great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
spiritual, was the losse of Original Righteousness, and Holiness, when God
took away his sanctifying Spirit. By this it came to passe, that the <hi>active</hi> free
power of man, to do good, and that which was pleasing to God, was not onely
weakned, but wholly taken away. For though the essence and faculties of man
remained, yet the Spirituall and divine vigour was lost: A natural, but not
a spiritual free will he hath. The Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> tells us, that <hi>Liberum Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

might be for ever, so far as man is capable for ever to suffer them.</p>
               <p>3. Though every son of <hi>Adam</hi> be subject to these, yet God doth not inflict

<hi>Jews</hi> transgressed; Against the Gospel, which Christians violate. And many
of Gods own Children may justly suffer: For all <hi>actuall</hi> sins are not merely from

which God gave <hi>Adam</hi> in the day of his Creation: So that it is a want of it in
the subject, where it should be and was at first. Yet this privation may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
actively or passively. Actively, and so it's a taking away from one that had
it; or denying it to one who never actually received it. In the first sense, God
took it from <hi>Adam:</hi> In the latter sense, he denies it to all his Posterity. In
what manner God is in this Act to be considered, or what was the reason why
he did thus, I do not here inquire.</p>

his qualities, nor his Acts; but the perfection and excellency of them all: and
doth necessarily presuppose the Being Qualities, Acts, as the Subject. All this
doth imply, that this Right<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

continue it; as also upon cause take it away. And if once the Soul lost it upon
demerit, or any other ways, it was made imperfect, defective, and base: and the
inclinations and motions were unworthy so noble a Creature: and so much the
more, because a Superiour Spirit had power to delude and deceive the mind, and

Flesh, Concupiscence, Sin the Body of Sin,</hi> &amp;c. properly a Sin? That it is from sinne,
called sin, and is a cause of sin, is generally confessed. But that it is a sin, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

                  </gap>e, is denied absolutely by <hi>Pighius:</hi> But he is singular, and differs from
his own Church; which generally acknowledgeth it to be a sin, but not in such
as are baptized: Because Baptism being a Sacrament of Remission and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
takes away the nature of sin from it, so that the formal part of sin is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, but the material remaineth: For so I understand them, because they
call that which remains <hi>Concupiscence,</hi> and the <hi>Fuel of Sin.</hi> This were something,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64164:48"/>
if <hi>Regeneration</hi> did always accompany, or immediatly follow upon Baptism,
which cannot be proved: or if it did so accompany, and follow Baptism, as to
be perfect, and make the soul perfectly righteous, and holy, which it doth not, as
experience in God's own Children teache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> us: yet this Doctrine doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
plainly, that it was sin, before the formal reason and nature of sin was taken
away: and by the same reason it will follow, that so far as it is not taken away, it
is <hi>properly sin.</hi> It is placed by many of them, especially in the <hi>Sensitive Appetite;</hi>
but certainly it's found in the <hi>Rational Appetite,</hi> and the <hi>Will;</hi> and must needs be
<hi>morally evil:</hi> and they confess that it must be resisted and subdu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d. Some <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants,</hi>
and <hi>Corvinus</hi> amongst the rest, deny it to be properly sin upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account; because; though it be materially contrary unto the Law, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
it is not so: And why? Because the Law forbids future ill acts, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.
But yet this is not precisely true; because the Law forbids to all such as are
under a Law, not onely the future evil acts, but also dispositions and habits, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
such as depend any ways on Acts.</p>
               <p>But to give a more perfect Resolve of this Question,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> we must,</p>
               <p>1. Distinguish of Sin Habitual, and Actual: And Actual Sin it is not.</p>
               <p>2. We may consider it, as it's in us by Conception and Birth, and a Naturall
Habit (if I may so speak); or as improved, and increased by many Actual Sins; and
so become an acquired vitious habit; and thus, in this latter sense, <hi>Paul</hi> seems
to take it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and elsewhere. In this latter sense, few will deny it to be sin;
and by the same reason, it may be sin in the former sense.</p>
               <p>3. We may conceive of this Original Corruption, and the want of Originall
Righteousness, as taken away, or denied upon a former demerit, and so it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a punishment; or absolutely in it self, as a quality, disposition, or habit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in us, and so it's not properly a punishment, but a sin: Yet it's not so
a sin in us, as it was in <hi>Adam:</hi> For <hi>Adam</hi> once had Original Righteousness en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
we have not. <hi>Adam</hi> lost it by the demerit of an actual sin, but Infants have
not actual sin, for which it's denied unto them. It seems to be rather a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then a sin (though both) in them, who never were perfectly and personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
righteous, especially in such, as never had the use of reason. It's certain, that
God never allowed in Man, or Angel, any vitious quality or disposition contrary
unto his Law. But the reason, why it is a sin in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Posterity, is singular; as
will appear in the Derivation of sin from <hi>Adam,</hi> which is the next thing.</p>
               <p>In the third place,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> this which we call <hi>Original Sin,</hi> is derived from <hi>Adam</hi> to his
Posterity, with many evils besides. And, first, we must prove that it is derived.
Secondly, shew how it is derived from him to us.</p>
               <p>1. The [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] that it is so, seems to be evident from those words; <hi>By one man
sin entred into the world; and, by Sin, Death; and so Death passed over all men, in
that</hi> (or as some turn it) <hi>in whom, all men have sinned,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. And by those,
<hi>As in</hi> Adam <hi>all die; so in Christ shall all be made alive,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 22. The meaning
is not, as some conceive, that one man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the first man <hi>Adam,</hi> was the first that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and so by his Example, sin entred into the World: As though his Posterity
were sinners onely by <hi>imitation.</hi> But the plain and clear sense is, that by the sin,
offence, and disobedience of one man, many, yea all men were made sinners, and
so liable to death, as appears by the words following. This sin was his first sin,
in eating the forbidden fruit: For his after-sins were personal, and not derived to
Posterity in that manner as the first sin was. So that the person from whom sin
was derived, was one man, even <hi>Adam;</hi> the means whereby it was derived was
sin, one sin, the first sin of that one man, that first man. The parties to whom it
was derived were, All men: The thing that was derived by this one sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was
Death, the death of all. This sin, offence, disobedience, is opposed to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Christ unto Death, the death of the Cross: and the Death from this Sir
is oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed to that Eternal Life, which Believers obtain by Jesus Christ. So that
the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> is the sin of all; and the guilt of <hi>Adam</hi> is the guilt of all.

But the great difficulty is,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> How <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin and guilt is transmitted and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to all. The ordinary determination is, that it's derived by Propagation. It's
true, that without natural propagation it's not derived, because without it we
cannot Be; or if we could have our Being without it, yet we could not be his
children: and except we be his children, we cannot be any subject capable, so as
to derive any thing from him. Yet this natural propagation doth onely make
us subjects of this derivation of sin, and guilt from him. Therefore, this participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sin, guilt, death from him, is an Act of just Judgment. This therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth,</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Adam</hi> was sinful, and guilty.</p>
               <p>2. That we are descended from him, as sinful, by Natural Generation.</p>
               <p>3. That we are some ways, one person with him, either by Nature, or Law,
or both, and God did so account of us.</p>
               <p>4. That in <hi>Adam</hi> innocent, God judgeth us innocent; in him guilty, us guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And though we be descended immediatly from our next Parents, yet we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive
the sin and guilt from <hi>Adam</hi> immediatly, though we have our Being from
him mediately by intermediate <hi>Ancestours,</hi> and <hi>Parents.</hi> All men were one man
in <hi>Adam,</hi> and in none else. We were in him by Nature, and Law: By Nature,
for he was the Root, and all men the Branches; and it was God's Will, that all
Mankind should descend from him: By Law, for as all Nations account the
Parents and Children, as one person in many things, and Children part of their
Parents; so that Children and Parents make but one body: So likewise God
did account <hi>Adam,</hi> and all Mankind as one. And so far as God judged him one,
and made <hi>Adam</hi> the Head and Representative of all; so far in <hi>Adam</hi> all men
might be bound to obedience or penalty; and so far judgments or rewards
might be transmitted from him to all, and no further. And if God had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<hi>Adam,</hi> and all his posterity as one person, By one man sin could not
have entred into the World, and by sin Death, so as to pass upon all men.
That this derivation was an act of judgment, is evident from the Apostle; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Sin and Death, which is punishment, presupposed a Law. To impute sin,
and punish for sin, and that with Death, are Acts of Judgment, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to a Law, which was in force, when <hi>Adam</hi> sinned, and long before <hi>Moses.</hi>
Otherwise, how could sin have reigned even over <hi>Adam,</hi> and that from <hi>Adam</hi>
to <hi>Moses?</hi> and this by a Sentence of Judgment, in force to this day, according
to a Law in force when <hi>Adam</hi> transgressed it. For upon that transgression,
God condemned <hi>Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and in him all Mankind. In this respect, the doubt,
how the Soul, being made by God, becomes corrupted, is <hi>vain;</hi> and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that it is polluted by entrance into the body, or from the body, is false.
For,</p>
               <p>1. God in the Creation of the Soul of every individual person, is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as a Creatour, and a Judge: As a Creatour, he makes a Soul, and gives
it <hi>Essence,</hi> and all things necessary flowing from the <hi>Essence,</hi> and appertaining to
it: As a Judge, he denies that person, as one with <hi>Adam</hi> sinning, his sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spirit which <hi>Adam</hi> received for him, and his; and in him sinning, was lost
to him and his.</p>
               <p>2. It is evident, that the Soul is not so much polluted by the body, as the
body by it, and it from it self. For there are many Spiritual sins; as <hi>Pride,
Envie, Malice,</hi> and such like, which are purely from the Soul, and in the Soul, as
they are in Angels, who have no bodies, but are spirits. And those sins which
have their <hi>Rise</hi> from the sensitive appetite, could not pollute the Soul, except it
were depraved in it self. And the first sin began in the Soul, as may easily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
from <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. and was there compleatly moulded, before <hi>Eve</hi> looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the forbidden fruit to covet it, and desire it as a bodily food. Yet whilest we
discourse of the <hi>Derivation</hi> of Original Sin, as it is a Deprivation, and a depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
following thereupon, because man falls under the power of Death; yet
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64164:50"/>
we must consider, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Posterity derive not onely that original corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from him, but many other evils, together with their Being. All the evils are
reduced to Sin and Death. We participate with him in some manner in the first
sin; and in him sinning, we sin; and in him being guilty, we are guilty; in him
dying, we die. And by <hi>Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> all Punishments God sentenced us to in him, are
understood: not onely that which we call Original Sin, but all Actual Sins vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
included in it, and issuing purely from it, by vertue of the first <hi>Desertion.</hi>
And here we may wonder at the severity of God's Judgment; yet we must in
no wise question the Justice and Equity thereof.</p>

               <p>THE last thing to be considered in this Judgment and Execution is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of the <hi>Attributes,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>I</label> and perfections of God, and of his Supream
Power judicial, as well as Legislative. The Attributes manifested, are these:
His Wisdom, his Holiness, his Power, his Knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but principally his Justice
and Mercy. His Wisdom was wonderful in this particular; in that he laid
the Foundation of man's Eternal Life to be recovered again in sentencing the
Devil to Eternal Death, and in a wonderful way: so that the Devil himself
should be powerfully active, to the ruine of his own Kingdom, whilest he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eeks
to confirm and enlarge it.</p>
               <p>His Holiness was evident in this, that he spared not sin in his most noble
Creatures, punishing the Devils, without mercy, as first in the sin; not sparing
man made in his own Image, though tempted to sin; and in accursing the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
though an irrational Creature, and but onely an Instrument abused. All
this signifies, that he detests and abominates sin; and being holy Himself, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
holiness in Men and Angels made holy: and if by sin, they pollute
themselves, he casts them out of his presence.</p>
               <p>His Power appeared, in that he so presently, and so fully executed his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and makes it good to this day, and none can hinder him.</p>
               <p>His Knowledge is as exact: for he evidently knew the sin of Men and Angels,
with the measure and circumstances thereof, and proportions his Judgment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>But principally his Justice and Mercy shined forth in this judicial Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label>
               </p>
               <p>First, his Justice must be considered: The Justice of God is Legislative, or
judicial: Legislative Justice determines man's duty; and binds him unto the
performance thereof, and also defines the rewards and punishments, which
shall be due upon the Creatures obedience, or disobedience.</p>
               <p>His judicial Justice, which is called distributive, is that, whereby he renders
unto the intellectual Creatures, according to their Works. This is remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
or vindictive: For taking cognizance of their cause, he rewards the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and punisheth the disobedient, The justice manifested in this judgment,
was <hi>punitive</hi> and <hi>vindictive;</hi> and it did appear, in that</p>
               <p>1. He spared not sinners, much less rewarded them.</p>
               <p>2. He punished none but sinners, and such as did concur in this sin.</p>
               <p>3. He punished onely for sin, and not out of any absolute and arbitrary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.
Therefore, God said to the Serpent, Because thou hast done this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64164:51"/>
thus and thus shalt thou be punished. The Woman suffered, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
because she hearkened, and gave consent to the Serpents temptation.
The man is judged to death, because he had hearkened to the voyce of his
wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e.</p>
               <p>4. The punishments determined and executed, did not exceed the measure
of their sin.</p>
               <p>5. The Devil sinned most, and therefore his punishment is the greatest, and
no ways mitigated or allayed by mercy. The Woman and Man sinned, being
tempted, and their sin was less, and it was allayed by mercy: yet the womans
sin was greater then <hi>Adam's,</hi> though less then the Devils: For she was first in
the transgression, and brought man into the snare, being instrumental to the
Devil, and therefore she was adjudged to two punishments, to which man was
not liable.</p>
               <p>This Justice is not an Attribute, but the exercise and manifestation of an
Attribute, as here it's taken. It's called Anger, Wrath, Fury, Rage, Jealousie,
Indignation, as the sin is more or less heinous, and he more or less displeased.
It's called Revenge, in that it renders the evil of punishment for the evil of sin.
It's Judgment, because he proceeds according to Law, upon the evident know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the violation of the same. It's punishment, as God inflicts it, and the
Creatures suffer it.</p>
               <p>The principal Attribute which God did exercise,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> and manifest in this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
passed upon man was his Mercy, which is his free love of man, who had
made himself unworthy. For after that he had sinned, and made himself mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
though his misery were an object of compassion, yet his sin did provoke
to anger, and deserved vengeance. God looking upon man in this condition, was
more willing to pitty him, then to punish him; to remove the sin, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the sinner. He was unwilling all Mankind should perish, as they must
needs have done, if he had proceeded in strict justice against them. The sin in
it self was no fit subject of mercy: yet seeing that Woman was deceived by
the subtilty of the Devil; and Man, by Woman, his dearest Wife brought into
transgression, God took occasion to pitty them; yet there could be no mercy
for them, except it issue out of the abundant goodness of God, who is slow to
anger, and so much inclined to compassion, and willing in this particular rather
to manifest the glory of his mercy, then of his justice. Man had made himself
unworthy, and liable to eternal misery, and God might have eternally punisht
him, and that justly too, yet mercy kept justice back, mitigated the rigour of it,
and confined it in a narrow compass, to inlarge her self more abundantly. This
mercy was the Fountain, from which issued the Promise of Christ, the ruine of
Sathan's Kingdom, the Redemption of Mankind, the Relicks of God's Image,
the means of Conversion, the patience, long-suffering, bounty and clemency of
God, the gifts of the Spirit, the remission of sin, and eternal life. And that God
might be placable, Sin pardonable, Man saveable; he accepts Christ's propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
reverseth the Law of Works, as requiring, (and that strictly) perfect and
perpetual obedience, as the condition of life, and makes a new Law and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
which determines Faith to be the condition of life, and that condition to
be performed by the power of the Spirit, merited by, and restored for Christ's
sake.</p>
               <p>This mercy did appear in this great Judgment many ways:<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label>
               </p>
               <p>1. God sentenced the Devils in the first place, and that without any mercy,
and for this very cause, even because they had attempted the eternal ruine of
man, which upon the success of their damned Design had proved unavoidable,
and the recovery of man impossible, if God should not have done some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
work to prevent it. Upon this fiery indignation of God against these
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64164:51"/>
Liars and Murderers of Mankind, expressed in this Sentence, it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<list>
                     <item>1. That the punishment to be suffered by these cursed <hi>Fiends,</hi> was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
unavoidable, and unremovable for ever.</item>
                     <item>2. That God was highly displeased at their malice shewed against, and
the mischief done to Mankind, in that he takes so fearful <hi>vengeance</hi>
upon them.</item>
                     <item>3. That there was some pitty in God towards poor man trembling at
the Bar of God: for though their folly was inexcusable, yet their
condition, considering the temptation, was lamentable.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>2. This mercy was manifest in an high and extraordinary degree and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
in that; (in this Sentence he) promiseth, or at least implies, a most certain
promise of Jesus Christ a Saviour and Redeemer. It's true, that this great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
was folded and wrapt up in a few words, and the same very mysterious, as
we read them in <hi>Moses, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. But those very words inform us,</p>
               <p>1. That the Redeemer should be the Seed of the Woman; that Woman,
whom the Serpent had so deluded, and who now stood guilty before God's <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That this Seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpents head, and so be
the ruine of his Kingdom, and Dominion over Man.</p>
               <p>3. That he should not obtain this Victory without Blood; for his <hi>Head
must be bruised</hi> and he put to death. And there is not onely an <hi>Emphasis,</hi> but a
<hi>Mystery</hi> in those words <hi>[The Seed of the Woman.]</hi> The <hi>Emphasis</hi> is in this;
That God doth not say an Angel or Spirit, or some man more excellent then
<hi>Adam,</hi> whom he should create instantly; but the <hi>Seed, a Child, a Mortal Man,</hi>
born of that sinful Woman (though now contemptible and miserable) should
encounter the Devil with that power and policy, as to foil him.</p>
               <p>The Mystery seems to be this: That it's not said the Seed of Man, nor the
Seed of Man and Woman; but the Seed of the Woman, signifying (though dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
that Christ should be the Seed, and Child immediate, of a Woman, but of
no Man. For as he was Man, he had an immediate Mother, who conceived, bare
him, brought him forth; but no immediate Father. Upon these words, as the
condition of Man and Woman became more comfortable; so the Kingdom and
Government of Mankind began instantly to be altered; and a second <hi>Adam</hi>
was appointed their Head to redeem them, as the first <hi>Adam</hi> had undone
them.</p>
               <p>We must needs think, that our first Parents being sinful, guilty, and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
before the Supream Judge of Heaven and Earth, stood with sad and heavy
hearts, expecting their doom and condemnation, to Eternal Death, until they
heard these words <hi>[The Seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpents Head].</hi> Then
their <hi>Despair</hi> was turned into <hi>Hope,</hi> and their sinking-dying-hearts began to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive.</hi>
For to them these were words far above all expectation of sweetest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
<hi>Never better words spoken! never better heard!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. This mercy was evident, in that God did not send the Spirit of <hi>Despair,</hi> nor of
Slumber and Security upon them,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> nor deliver them up to a reprobate mind, (as
he might justly have done) and so made their condition desperate, and irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable;
nor presently execute his judgment Eternal upon them, either by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away their lives in their sin, or making their bodies immortal to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in body and soul for ever. Neither did he take from them the Light of
Nature, and the sense and power of Conscience, but gave them the saving-light
of the Gospel, and the means of Conversion, with the promise of the Spirit. All
this is evident by the promise of Christ, the ruine of Satan's Kingdom, a final
Victory after a Bloody War, in this Sentence of the Devil: and it doth further
appear, by the Education of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> and especially in the Faith of <hi>Abel.</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:64164:52"/>
That the means of Conversion have been denied several persons, whole Tribes,

and of the generality of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and many of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> since the preaching
of the Gospel to all Nations. And the very <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not delivered up unto
a Reprobate mind, before they abused the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> Yet the very outward
means of <hi>Conversion,</hi> were a gift of <hi>Free grace</hi> for the merit of Christ, who was
promised of pure and abundant mercy.</p>
               <p>The Sentence of Justice past upon them was allayed,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> and tempered with
great mercy too: For he doth not say to our first Parents, <hi>Go ye cursed into
everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> But you shall suffer Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
punishments; yet so, that through my Grace, and sanctifying Spirit, they
shall be Corrections and Chassisements for <hi>Humiliation, Mortification,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</hi>
and you shall be banished out of <hi>Earthly Paradise,</hi> and from this
<hi>Tree of Life,</hi> that you may more earnestly long after: and seek the <hi>Paradise,</hi> and
<hi>Tree of Life</hi> in <hi>Heaven:</hi> For you shall know, that it's a bitter thing to forsake
your God, and disobey his Command. Yet this was the great punishment, that
the Spirit of Sanctification and Comfort was departed, and no ways to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
but by Jesus Christ, the great Redeemer, as a gift of Free-grace.</p>
               <p>And now consider all Mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> as innocent and obedient; they are
innocent and obedient: Consider them, in him, as sinful, guilty, convicted;
they are sinful, miserable, convicted, and in a lost condition: Consider them in
him, as receiving the Promise of Christ; they are in a possibility of Salvation
and Deliverance. And all such as are born in the Bosome of the Church, and
under the means of Conversion, are in a better condition, then such as are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
from the Covenants of Promise, as all Children or Apostlates are. Yet we
must understand, and take special notice of it, that after the Fall, there is not
any thing in man tending either to holiness or happiness, or the abatement of
sin or misery, but from the mere mercy of God, which doth shine forth most
clearly in two things:</p>
               <p>The first is, the giving of Christ, or the Promise to give him; and this was not
upon any merit, no nor of Christ himself. And howsoever all other Spiritual
Mercies may be promised, and given for, and in respect of the satisfaction and
merit of Christ; yet the gift of Christ was from purest love, without any respect
to any merit at all.</p>
               <p>The second is in calling, wherein he prevents, both by giving the means of
Conversion, and the grace of his Spirit, to make them effectual: Therefore, the
Scripture so much magnifies God's abundant love, and free grace manifested in
both.</p>
               <p>1. For the first it's said <hi>God so loved the World, that he gave his onely begotten
Son,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. And God commendeth his love towards us, in that Christ died
for us, while we were yet sinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. And in this was manifested the love
of God towards us, because that God sent his onely Begotten Son into the
World, that we should live by him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but
that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the Propitiation for our sins, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 9,
10.</hi> For some mercies we receive from God, loving us before we love him; as
these two: Some, after we begin to love him.</p>
               <p>2. For the second, we read that God who is rich in mercy, for his great
love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickned us
together with Christ (by grace we are saved) and hath raised us up together,
and made us sit together with Christ Jesus in Heavenly places, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6. Yet
this latter is merited by Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:64164:52"/>
Besides, the manifestation of these Attributes, it's remarkable that God exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
his transcendent and absolute power above his Law: For to reverse the
Law of Works, to require and accept satisfaction, and the same made by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
even Christ, and not the Delinquents; and thereupon to promise <hi>Pardon,</hi>
and <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> upon condition of Faith were acts of Him, as above his Law,
and dispensing with it in his judicial proceedings. For if he had according to
his ordinary power made the Law of Works, requiring perfect and perpetuall
obedience, as the onely condition of life, the rule of judgment; he could have
done none of the fore-mentioned Acts, but must have condemned man unto
Death, and punished him according to the demerit of his sin: which if he had
done, neither <hi>Adam,</hi> nor any Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> could have had the least possibility
of Salvation. So that in this Judgment, the Foundation of the second Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of greatest mercy was laid; and then, even then, God began to constitute
another Form of Government over Man, and to administer the same: And
the former continued but a little while; and the latter hath continued long,
and shall be, <hi>An everlasting Kingdom.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>I</label> the second did begin:
For, after the Fall of two of God's most noble Creatures, there
followed a great alteration in the World; and such, that if God
had followed strictly the Rules of his former Government, all
Mankind must needs have perished. But this, his Mercy could
not suffer: therefore, his Divine Wisdom contriveth a way how
to recover Man f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llen, and began to govern him, according to such Rules, as
that he might attain <hi>Eternal Salvation.</hi> For there was a Foundation of this new
Government laid in that Judgment God passed upon the Devil, and he began
<pb facs="tcp:64164:53"/>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:64164:54"/>
instantly to act according to the same. Yet though he abolished the former Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
yet he continued the memory of it, and revealed the Doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
unto the Church, and it remains in the same; and it serves to let men see
their misery, and humble them, that they may seek for remedy, and vehemently
desire it, and follow the Directions God hath given: And by this, he may and
ought to know, that in strict Justice he can expect nothing but Eternal Death,
and that all hope of life depends upon the mere mercy of God, and the merit
of a <hi>Second Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Second Government</hi> did not abolish the power acquired by Creation:<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> for
that continues still, and will continue, whilest man receives his Being from
God, by Creation, and the continuance of his Being by preservation, Yet God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a new power superadded unto the former, and did exercise the same af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a new manner. In this respect, there must needs be a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the former and this latter Government. For in the former, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
was God-Creatour, by the Word not incarnate, or made flesh: but in
this he is not onely Creatour, but Redeemer, by the Word made Flesh. The
subject of this latter is not man, holy, righteous, innocent, as he was created;
but sinful, guilty, miserable, in <hi>Adam</hi> fallen. The Laws thereof do not bind man
as the former did to perfect and perpetual obedience, as the condition of Life,
but to Faith in the Redeemer. Neither in this New-Model doth God alone,
without a President-general, as in the former<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> govern Mankind, but doth admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
all things by his Son made Lord and King, at his Right-hand, after the
Incarnation.</p>
               <p>This Government is that Act of Divine Providence,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> whereby he orders sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
man, redeemed by Faith in Christ-Redeemer, unto Salvation; or, upon his
Unbelief, unto Eternal Death unavoidable.</p>
               <p>This is evident, out of the sacred Writings both of the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For all the Holy Patriarchs from <hi>Adam,</hi> were saved by their Faith in
God Redeemer, and the Seed of the Woman: And after the exhibition of the
Redeemer, and his manifestation, he himself faith, That <hi>God so loved the World,
that he gave his onely begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him, should not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
but have Eternal Life:</hi> And <hi>He that believeth on him is not condemned;</hi> And,
<hi>he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the onely
Begotten Son of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Joh. 3. 16, 18. <hi>John</hi> the Baptist testifieth, that the Father
loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand: <hi>He that believeth on
the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but
the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> Joh. 3. 36. <hi>And all power in Heaven and Earth was
given to Christ,</hi> Math. 28. 18. And from this Power, the Apostles received
Commission and Command to go to all the World, and to preach the Gospel
to every Creature; And, <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; and he
that believeth not shall be damned,</hi> Mark 16. 15, 16. In all which words, we have
a New Power, a New Government, New Laws, both as a Rule of Man's Duty,
and God's Judgment, differing much from the former. This might be called the
Government of Mercy, as the former the Government of Justice.</p>
               <p>Whereas many tell us, that the former Government continues; that the
Laws are still the same; that God, as Rectour, by Substitution, transferred the
punishment, merited by transgressions, of the Law, upon Christ; and for, and in
consideration of satisfaction made by him, remits sin; and this is nothing but a
relaxation, or interpretation of the former Law, they are much mistaken, and
reach not the truth in this particular. And this shall be made evident, when
we come to speak of the Administration of this Kingdom from the times of
<hi>Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> till the preaching and baptizing of <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> and the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of Christ's entring upon his Publique Office.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Person</hi> by whom God acquired this new Power, was the Word made
Flesh: for as by the Word he made the World, and in particular Man, and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a Properiety in Man, and a Dominion over Man, as a rational free Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
So by this Word incarnate, and made Flesh in a wonderful manner, he
acquired a new propriety in Man fallen, and a dominion over him, as capable of
Spiritual and Eternal Felicity, to be recovered by a new way. The work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
this Power was acquired, was, the <hi>Humiliation of this Son of God.</hi> So that now

               <p>For his Person, in a large sense, as here I take Person; He is the Word which

were made, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1, 2. The onely begotten Son of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. The Image of

               <p>By these places it evidently appears, that the Word did exist before the
World was; and so exist, that He was with God, and God. To be with God,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64164:55"/>
implies some distinction; to be God, an identity of substance: and this is that
which we call <hi>Circumincession,</hi> the nearest Union that can be with any distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the World.</p>
               <p>In the Natures,<label type="milestone">

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Natures are two:
<list>
                     <item>1. Divine.</item>
                     <item>2. Humane.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Divine,</hi> is He was the Word: The <hi>Humane,</hi> as He was Flesh. For if He
was that Word, which was in the beginning with God, and was God, so that
all things were created and upholden by Him, He must needs be God, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is God: yet not the Father; yet one God with the Father. If He be Flesh,
He must needs be Man. As God, and the Word, He is Eternal; as Flesh, and
Man, He is not Eternal. That Jesus Christ was Man, and that such a man there
was, both <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans</hi> confess: Yet Orthodox Christians onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him to be God, and that according to the Scriptures; which, in these
great Mysteries, are the onely infallible Rule. And, in them, we do not read,
that ever the Word assumed the Nature of any irrational Creature, nor of any of
the Intellectual, but the Nature of Man: For he took not on him the Angels,
or the Nature of Angels; but he took on him the Seed of <hi>Abraham, Heb. 2. 16:</hi>
For the Children being partakers of flesh and bloud, he also himself likewise
took part of the same, that, through Death, he might destroy him that had
the power of Death; that is, the Devil. For,
<list>
                     <item>1. He redeemed not Angels.</item>
                     <item>2. He redeemed Men.</item>
                     <item>3. He redeemed them Onely.</item>
                     <item>4. He redeemed them by Death.</item>
                     <item>5. Because the Word, as the Word, could not dye; therefore the Word
was made Flesh, that he might dye. This seemed good unto the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisdom; and this was determined in the secret Counsel of the
Eternal Deity.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Union of these two Natures is personal.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> The Person, and one Nature,
was Divine: The other Nature was Humane. This Union was by assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
the Person assuming was the Word; the Nature assumed was that of Man.
This <hi>Assumption</hi> was begun in Conception, consummate in Birth. As His
Birth was both mean on Earth, and glorious from Heaven; so his Conception
was wonderful: For He was so conceived, that He had a Mother, and the same
a Virgin in her Conception; yet he had no immediate Father who begot him;
and because his Mother was descended from <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> therefore in
respect of his Humane Nature, he was the Son of <hi>David,</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
according to <hi>Divine Prediction,</hi> and Promise, and the Seed of the Woman in a
special manner.</p>
               <p>Concerning this Conception, we are informed, That the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> after
she was espoused and before she and <hi>Joseph</hi> came together, was found with child
of the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> and to satisfie him, an Angel was sent from Heaven, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
unto him, that that which was conceived in her, was of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and
that according to a Prophesie, <hi>Behold a Virgin shall conceive,</hi> Math. 1. 18, 20, 22.
And we read in another <hi>Evangelist,</hi> that an Angel answered to this <hi>Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi>
demanding, how she should conceive such a Son, seeing she was a Virgin,
and knew no man, That the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> should come upon her, and the power
of the Highest should over-shadow her: therefore, that Holy Thing which
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64164:56"/>
should be born other, should be called the Son of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 34, 35. So that
this Conception was singular, extraordinary, and supernatural, and no ways to
be paralle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d.</p>
               <p>And there was a two-fold end, why it pleased God to have him thus concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<list>
                     <item>1. That he should be holy.</item>
                     <item>2. That he should be called the Son of God.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly these two things followed upon it.</p>
               <p>1. He was holy, and so free from Original Corruption; either as conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in it self; or, as a punishment for the first sin: For this Originall
Sin was prevented
<list>
                     <item>1. By the Sanctification of the Spirit.</item>
                     <item>2. By this extraordinary Propagation.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For two things concur to this Native Corruption:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the man be in <hi>Adam</hi> as sinning, and so sentenced for
sin.</item>
                  <item>2. And also descend from him by naturall propagation: But neither
of these did agree to him: For though he was the Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the seed
of the Woman, yet he was not in <hi>Adam</hi> sinning, nor the Son of <hi>Adam</hi> in
that manner as all other men were.</item>
               </list>
               <p>2. He was called the Son of God, not onely because he was conceived in
a divine manner by the Holy Ghost, but also as the Word was the Son of God,
and had that relation to his Father, so this Nature assumed being personally one
with this Word must have the same relation to the father too. This incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Word, and Son of God is a great mystery. That Jesus Christ is the
Word, and not only flesh; and not onely the Word, but the Word
made flesh; is plain and expresse Scripture: But the manner of this union is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable.
And we must simply believe what is plain, that it is so, not curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
enquire how it is, for that's above our capacity.<note n="a" place="margin">lib. 4. c. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>Aquinas, contra Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
endeavours to exemplify this by the union of the Soul, and body: As the
body is the instrument of the Soul; and supposeth an universall reason or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect
which assumes and unites it self to the<note n="b" place="margin">Conceptui humano.</note> 
                  <hi>nature of man,</hi> so as to use it
as a <hi>Proper instrument,</hi> as the hand is to the body, and by the same worketh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
works proper to God, and that, not sometimes transiently, but after the
manner of a constant, and permanent Act. This is the Sum of his exemplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which, as he confesseth, is very imperfect, and farr too short. This <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi>
was an act <hi>(ad extra);</hi> and therefore both Father, Word, and Spirit
must concur in it; yet so that the Word did in a special manner <hi>assume,</hi> and was
the proper terme of this Act. And that word in which was life, which life
was the light of men in the Creation, did <hi>assume, possesse, dwell in,</hi> and act
by the Soul, and body of man; so as to be a Fountaine of Life and Spiritual
light to man for ever.</p>
               <p>This Word,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> so became and was made flesh, as that he assumed not onely the
body, but the Soul of man, even whole man, and the same at first subject to
frailtyes, and infirmityes, to violence and death, yet without sin. And this
union was indissoluble for ever. And many were the consequents of this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as</p>
               <p>1. The communication of <hi>Idioms</hi> in predication: So that because the
Word, which was God, was flesh; and word, and flesh are one; therefore what
is true of the word may be affirmed of that flesh; and that which was properly
true of that fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh, might be truly affirmed of that Word, which was God. So
that it may be truly said, That the flesh, and man did that which God did;
and <hi>God</hi> might be said to suffer that which the flesh did suffer, and that by a
Metonymy, and such as no Rhetorick ever taught us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:64164:56"/>
2. A neare relation between the Word and that flesh, and such as is not to
be found in all the world.</p>
               <p>3. The excellency and dignity of that Nature, and flesh, not onely above all
men, but all Angels.</p>
               <p>4. The concurrence of the Word and flesh in the acts of <hi>Redemption,</hi> and the
same singular, and extraordinary. But whether the gifts of the Spirits confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in holinesse, universall power, glory and happinesse which Christ attayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
did necessarily and instantly follow upon this <hi>Union,</hi> may justly be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>That the redeemer should be the <hi>Word,</hi> and so <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Flesh</hi> too; <hi>One,
and the chief Reason, was the Wisdome and Will of God.</hi> And other
reasons not clearly contayned in Scripture are better forborne then menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
               <p>After <hi>the number</hi> and union follows the distinction of the two Natures,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IX</label> for
although they were personally united, which union is extrinsecall, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
really distinct. The Word was not changed into flesh, nor flesh into
the Word: but the Word is the Word still, and flesh flesh still, and that essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially.
It's true, the word before the conception of the humane nature was not
flesh, but then it was flesh, yet so that it continues the Word. Neither was
there any mixture or composition of these two to make one substance different
from both: nor any such union of both, that so a third thing should arise by
way of resultancy; except we may say and that according to the Scripture that
the word and flesh were so united, that thence did arise a third thing, which we
call Christ, and some call <hi>God-Man.</hi> Yet still he was so God that he was Man,
and so man that he was the <hi>Word,</hi> and God; and so shall continue, blessed for
evermore.</p>
               <p>Jesus Christ our Lord is the word made flesh; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>X</label> and this is the definition that
the Scriptures give of him; That which followes is, his office as he is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>An office is a derivative power, and therefore cannot be supreme, but subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate:
and as an officer by commission with a Mandate receives his power, so
he is liable to account. In this respect, and for this cause it is, that though
Jesus Christ of <hi>Nazareth</hi> be the Word, and so God, yet as God he cannot be an
officer: as flesh, and man, he may be, and was such. This the Scripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
plainly when it saith, that he was sent, received commandement from his
Father, was sealed, annoynted with the Holy-Ghost, and with power, did not
glorifie himself, that his Father gave him power over all flesh, and that all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
in Heaven, and earth was given him: all these things are true of him only
as man. His office was the greatest and highest that ever was: Because he
was supreme and universall governour above the Angels, and all other
creatures next unto <hi>God.</hi> Therefore his place upon his investitute, and solemn
inauguration was at the right hand of the eternal Throne of <hi>God:</hi> And in this
particular Joseph advanced by <hi>Pharoah</hi> was a lively type of him. In him as an
officer, we may consider.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. His Ability,</item>
                  <item>2. His power and Authority.</item>
               </list>
               <p>His Ability is expressed, in that metaphor of being annoynted with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost: for he was endued with all the gifts of the Holy Ghost, and in the
highest degree that any creature was capable of: therefore it is said God giveth
not the Spirit in measure unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34. but in fullnesse. So that of his
fullnesse we all have received grace for grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. And the Spirit of the
Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of Wisdome and understanding, the spirit of
counsail and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord, <hi>Isay.</hi> 11.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64164:57"/>
And at his Baptism the Heavens were opened, and the Holy-Ghost
was seen in the likenesse of a Dove to descend and rest upon him. These gifts
and endowments he received with a power to communicate in a certain mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
unto others,</p>
               <p>The Spirit in this fullnesse was given him not only to sanctifie him, but to
enable him for the undertaking, managing and accomplishing the great work
of Redemption, which was committed unto him. Besides these Abilityes he
received power, and authority accordingly, and so had plain right to do such
things, as neither men nor Angels had right to do.</p>
               <p>He had power to command all the Angels of Heaven, the Devils, and all
Creatures, and they must obey him, because they were subject unto him. And
because he must discharge this Office; for that end, was required an high degree
of wisdom, and the knowledge of the deep and secret Counsels of God, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerning the Eternal Salvation of sinful man, whose Nature he had taken
upon him. Therfore, he must be a Prophet, able, fully, infallibly, and with Power,
and Majesty, to declare the Mind and Will of God. In which capacity, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
he was more excellent then all the Prophets, then <hi>Moses,</hi> then the Angels,
who have the Spirit of Prophesie, as being in the Bosome of the Father, and
more intimate then the Angels were. And he could reach men not onely
outwardly, but inwardly, and speak, by the Spirit, immediately unto the Souls
of men; and that not onely ordinarily, by imprinting the Doctrines of the
Scripture outwardly upon the Tables of the Heart; but also extraordinarily by
Inspiration, and immediate Revelation of the Mysteries of Gods Kingdom. Thus
he taught Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists: And he is the Head and Lord of all
Prophets; and all Angels, Prophets, Apostles, Pastours, Teachers, are his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and subject unto him as a Prophet: and his Doctrine must be heard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
obeyed; and he that will not submit unto it, must be cut off, and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly
accursed.</p>
               <p>Because Man is guilty,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XI</label> and God angry, and Justice requires Eternal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to be executed, if not prevented: therefore, there must be some to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
between the just God, and unjust Man, and make satisfaction unto justice,
procure his favour, and plead the cause of penitent sinners before the Throne of
God in the Heavenly Temple. Therefore, Christ, if he will be a Redeemer,
must do all this, and be a Priest; and, as a Priest, offer a Sacrifice, for the Eternall
expiation of sin; and, as an Advocate, plead his bloud and sacrifice before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for all such as come to God, by him. And he must not onely be a Priest,
but an Universal, and Eternal Priest, holy without any sin, who may have free
and immediate access to the Throne of God, and such, who is sensible of the
Peoples misery; and, in that respect, willing and ready to make reconciliation
for their sin. Such a Priest, Christ, and onely Christ Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> is made
so by God, and now confirmed by Oath, to minister in the Heavenly Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
there to appear before God for us. Therefore, he is more excellent, and
above all other Priests, even <hi>Aaron;</hi> nay, above <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Priests on Earth; and also, above the Highest Priests of Angels, if there be
any Priest-hood amongst them. Besides, because he must have Subjects of all
Nations, in times successively, unto the end of the World; and He, and His,
shall have many Enemies, both Men and Devils, and of great power and policy:
therefore, he must be a King, invested with Universal, and Eternal Power, to
make Laws and Officers, to judge, and to execute Judgment, in rendring eternal
rewards and punishments, according to the Works of such as shall be judged,
that so he may subdue all Enemies, even Death it self, protect his people, and
give Eternal Peace and Felicity, to such as shall unfeignedly submit unto his
Power, and continue loyal and obedient Subjects to the end. As God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
before the World, <hi>upon the fore-sight of man's sin,</hi> that the World should
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64164:57"/>
be made flesh: so he likewise decreed, that he should be invested with this
three-fold power, and to confer it upon him, as Flesh united to the Word. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> this Office was promised: in his Conception and Birth, he
was designed unto it: in his Baptism, he was declared to be the Son of God:
Upon his manifestation, after his Baptism, he began to act in this Three-fold
Office: Upon his Resurrection, he was constituted a compleat Priest, Prophet
King, and all power in Heaven and Earth given Him: Upon his Ascension, he
was solemnly invested, and confirmed in the place, and began at the right hand
of God to exercise his Power more gloriously.</p>

or Sacriledge to be equal with God: yet he made himself of no reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeness of
men, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 7. This state and condition of a Servant taken upon Him, was
the first part of his Humiliation. But here it's to be noted,</p>
               <p>1. That He was not a Slave taken in War nor sold, nor born of Servile Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
or Parent.</p>
               <p>2. As He was the Word, and equal with God, He could not be a Servant, but
as He was flesh, and made Man, For as Man, He was a reasonable Creature, and
so subject to God, and bound to Obedience.</p>
               <p>3. Yet to be Man was not all: For He was a Servant, in respect of the mean
condition of His Humane Nature: For He was born of a Mother, though of
Royal Extraction from the house of King <hi>David,</hi> at a great distance, yet poor
and mean, as appears in that she was espoused and married to <hi>Joseph,</hi> a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and so a Mechanick, and of the lowest Rank of Subjects, and also by his
poor Birth in a Stable.</p>
               <p>4. He, as Man, for the time, laid aside, or did not assume the Robes of Glory,
the State and Dignity which did agree unto Him, as He was the Son of God;
neither did He take upon Him any Civil Command, or Jurisdiction, much less
that Universal and Supream Power, wherewith He was invested after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>5. He was born, not onely a Man, but a Jew, under the Bondage and Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Law, as was manifest by His Circumcision, and Presentation in the
Temple.</p>
               <p>6. He subjected himself unto the Ecclesiastical Power of His own Nation,
and the Civil Power of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> so far as to be tried and condemned by
both, though He was innocent; and was willing to be obedient, not onely in
doing the good commanded, but to suffer the evil, even Death, the death of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
nay of Slaves, nay of <hi>Dogs,</hi> which He no way deserved. So that He wholly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64164:58"/>
denied Himself, renounced his own Will, even in things lawful, and was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to his Father in one of the hardest, and lowest services that ever was, the
service of Sin excepted. This was a way, which the <hi>unsearchable depth of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Wisdom</hi> contrived, to acquire a new transcendent Power.</p>
               <p>It's true, that alter He appeared in publique, He took upon him some power,
and acted accordingly. He began to preach the Gospel with power and majesty,
not onely in private, but publick: He gathered Disciples, and made Apostles,
and other Officers, instituted Sacraments, and gave Laws and Commissions, and
signified that He was the Son of God, and should one day come in the Clouds
of Heaven; yet still He was a Servant.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second degree</hi> of his <hi>Humiliation</hi> was,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> that as a Servant he was obedient
unto Death, the Death of the Cross. He was always obedient both to God and
Man, in all things so far as He was bound: He observed not onely the Moral,
but the Ceremonial Laws of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Civil Laws of the <hi>Romans,</hi> so far
as they were just. He many ways manifested himself to be the Word made
flesh, and the onely Begotten Son of God, and that not onely by his eminent
Vertues but by his Heavenly Doctrine, and glorious Works. So that never any
gave better Example, taught better Doctrine or did greater Works so beneficiall
to Mankind, and to destructive to Sathan's power. Yet he manifested himself
in this manner, onely amongst his own people, seeking earnestly not onely their
Temporal Peace, but their Eternal Salvation. And all this may be called his
<hi>Active Obedience;</hi> which, though so excellent and perfect yet could not free
him from obedience in sufferings, which were many; and ended in the death
of the Cross. The History hereof I will</p>

               <p>Though he suffered by the Determinate Counsel, and sore-knowledge of <hi>God,</hi>
and God had shewed before by the mouth of all his Prophets, that he should
suffer; yet the Counsel of God, and Predictions of the Prophets, were fulfilled
in the manner following:</p>

                  <item>1. By his Sufferings before Judgment.</item>
                  <item>2. By his Sufferings in Judgment.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. Before Judgment, He by his Example, Doctrine, Works, gathered many
Disciples, and the people followed him in great multitudes. This was a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to the <hi>ambitious Rulers</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> many of whom were <hi>Pharisees,</hi> a Sect,
in those times, in great account and admiration with the people, for eminent
Piety and Learning, wherein they seemed to excel. And this did grieve them
much, that He did neither comply with them, nor their Designs, nor receive any
Commission from them but did reprove their Hypocrisie, and took off their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of Sanctity, and open before the people their Ambition, Covetousness,
Cruelty, Oppression, and other enormous Sins; confuted their false Doctrine,
and denounced most fearful Woes against them. His <hi>eminency</hi> and respect with
the People, with the multitude of Disciples in all places, especially at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
were matter of <hi>Envy;</hi> and the rest, intended for Reformation, ended in their
malice, and his suffering. Out of this envy and malice, they traduce him
amongst the People, Censure and condemn him amongst themselves, and design
his death most unjustly, though under pretence of Justice, and the Publique
good. Sometimes they are ready to stone him: Otherwhiles they tempt
him by Questions cunningly devised, to intangle him in his Answers: so that
they might have some ground to accuse him before the Governour. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they lye in wait for him, and otherwhiles seek to take him by <hi>violence:</hi>
yet none of these take effect, till his hour was come. And he suffered all these
things with patience, and a constant mind. Those were but the beginning of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64164:58"/>
sorrows: The night wherein he ate his last Supper with his Disciples, instituted
the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> for the perpetual remembrance of this <hi>Death,</hi> and
came to <hi>Gethseman,</hi> then they began to be more bitter: For after he had washed
his Disciples seet, fore-told that one of them should betray him, <hi>Peter</hi> deny him,
and all forsake him, made his farewell Sermon so full of <hi>Heavenly Comfort,</hi> and
concluded it with a most excellent Prayer; he entred the Garden, and the fatal
place. There his Soul began to be troubled, and was heavy unto death; and so
that <hi>bitter agony,</hi> above all other most grievous, began: wherein, He thus had the
greatest power and patience to suffer more then Man or Angel was able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
seemed to stoop, and He fell groveling and pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rate upon the ground, as
though He had been a Worm, and no Man, and prays earnestly, with strong cries
and tears, unto his <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> three times, that this <hi>Cup of his Passion</hi>
might pass from Him: yet He limited his vehement desire, and resigned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
wholly to his <hi>Hevenly Father's Will,</hi> and was resolved to drink the very
dregs of it, if his Fathers Will was so. So unwilling was He to disobey His <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father's Commandement,</hi> and so willing to save sinful Man, though it cost
him dear. And such impression, this Conflict of His Soul made upon his Body,
that He did sweat, and His sweat was as it were great drops of bloud falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ground. In this saddest condition, none of his Disciples, no not the three
nearest unto Him, though earnestly desired, could watch and pray with Him one
hour. Even <hi>Peter,</hi> who so resolutely promised to dye with Him, failed to be
any comfort to his Master, in this <hi>exigency.</hi> So that He had not any comfort
from any Creature, or from any Man, or from any of His Disciples, or Apostles,
or nearest and most intimate Friends, till an Angel from Heaven was sent by
His Father, to comfort, strengthen, and encourage Him. What was the particular
distinct case of this trouble, is doubted by many, and many have fancied many
things: yet this is certain, that He had a lively apprehension and sense of this
<hi>Bitter Cup,</hi> which He did so much deprecate, and did clearly fore-see,</p>
               <p>1. That God would smite him, would him, and put him to death, by laying
upon him the iniquities of us all.</p>
               <p>2. That all kind of miseries would rush upon him, as it were in one violent
stream, to over-whelm him.</p>
               <p>3. That all sorts of people would conspire against Him, and that with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
and most cruel malice to torment and confound <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im.</p>
               <p>4. That the <hi>Prince of Darkness,</hi> with all his <hi>Damned Power,</hi> would be let
loose, and permitted with greatest violence to assault Him: for it was the <hi>hour
of the power of Darkness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That in all this, his Father, for a time, would with-draw his sweetest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
and suffer his Enemies to prevail, and put him to a shameful death. And
that which He most feared was, left by impatience, or distrust, or some other
way, He should offend His <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> and so have made void the great
Design of <hi>Redemption,</hi> and given the Devil the Victory. For Satan's chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
was, not to torment his body, and put him to a Temporal Death, but to
tempt him to sin, and herein he was disappointed: For Christ, in the days of his
flesh, when He had offered up Prayers and Supplications, with strong crying
and tears unto Him, who is able to save Him, was heard; that is, delivered from
what He feared, though not from the <hi>Death of the Cross.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These were His Sufferings before judgment.<label type="milestone">

The <hi>Preparatives</hi> for <hi>Trial</hi> were, <hi>the betraying of Him:</hi> His <hi>Attachment,</hi> the
bringing of Him bound to the <hi>Place of Trial.</hi> For He was most unworthily
betrayed by one of His own Disciples, yea one of His Apostles, who being cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
became treacherous, and receiving the Devil into his Heart, when no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
would divert Him from His cursed Enterprise, contracted with the
<hi>High-Priests,</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> for 30 pieces of silver, to betray <hi>His Master,</hi> who was
better then the <hi>whole world:</hi> and according to the Damned Contract, unto his
own Eternal Woe, he directs a Company armed to the place where Christ was;
and, lest He should escape, or not be taken, he betrays Him by a Kiss, a sign of
love in it self; but, in this business, <hi>an effect,</hi> and <hi>act of horrid treachery.</hi> After
He was betrayed, and so discovered, they apprehend, and attach him in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful
way. For though He never hid, or concealed Himself, but taught
openly, and often; and, but the day before, in the greatest and chiefest City, and
in the Temple, the most publique place, and so was ready at any time to appear
before the Rulers to clear his own innocency; yet, as though he had been a
Malefactour, a Thief, a Murtherer, conscious of his Crime, who hid himself, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
Judgment, and sought to escape, so they deal with him. Thus he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to be guilty of some capital crime, and therfore not fairly summoned, and
dealt withall as a free subject. This Christ told them of, and charged them with
it. After He is apprehended, they bind him as a prisoner to secure him, and lead
him to the place of Trial. A very great Trial it was, wherein God did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
and punish: Mankind in his own Son; and though He proceeded justly,
yet the judgment of man, in this particular, was abominably unjust. His Trial is
two-fold, before

               </p>
               <p>The Ecclesiastical Court had Cognisance of false Doctrine, Blasphemy, and
such like Crimes, and accordingly proceed in the examination of the party, and
the Witnesses, and with that care and diligence, as though they feared lest they
should not find sufficient Evidence against Him, and such as might satisfie the
Procurator <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi> When they failed of all sufficient proofs, the <hi>High-Priest</hi>
took a new and uncouth way to convince him from his own words, and
so adjures him to tell them plainly, or expresly, <hi>Whether He were the Son of God.</hi>
To this, He answers directly, that He was the Son of God, and the day would
come, when they should see him sitting on the right hand of power, and coming
in the Clouds of Heaven. This answer they expected, and from his own words
condemn the Judge of Heaven and Earth to be guilty of Blasphemy. After his
most unjust condemnation, He, as one out of all Protection, and unworthy of
any benefit of Law, is exposed to the abuses of the vilest Wretches, who did
hood wink him, mock him, spit upon him, blaspheme him, who was now alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
betrayed by <hi>Judas,</hi> presently denied by <hi>Peter,</hi> and forsaken of all his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
These miseries, this ingratitude, these indignities, the glorious Son of
God, and Lord of Angels, did endure.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Trial</hi> in the Ecclesiastical Court,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> being finished, He is brought before the
Civil Judge, and tried there again. What the Reason hereof was, is not so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
It may be, the <hi>High-Priests</hi> still were afraid of the People, lest they
should rise against them, if they shou'd proceed to publique and open executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
or it might be, because the <hi>Romanes</hi> denied them Jurisdiction in Capital
Causes. This seems to be implied in their words to the Procurator, <hi>It's not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for us to put any man to death,</hi> Joh. 18. 31. He is brought before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and
sent by <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Herod. Herod</hi> finds in him no cause of death; neither doth
<hi>Pilate:</hi> and therefore, out of <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>Natural Conscience,</hi> and other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
justifies him as unworthy of death several times, and several times seeks to
release him. And as he was unwilling to condemn him, because there was no
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64164:59"/>
cause, and for that He knew the Rulers out of Envy had delivered Him into His
hands; so He was afraid to do it, is admonished by His Wife, and that in some
sort from Heaven to have nothing to do with that righteous man; but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when He heard He was the Son of God. Yet they accuse Him vehemently
of haynous crimes, as Sedition, and High-Treason against <hi>Caesar,</hi> and importune
him to do justice; and seeing him unwilling to pass judgment against Him, and
willing, and very earnest to release Him, they perswade the people to desire <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas,</hi>
a cruel Murtheret, to be delivered to them, according to the Custom; and
to cry, without ceasing, <hi>Crucifie, crucifie Jesus;</hi> and that which was of greatest
force, they tell <hi>Pilate</hi> plainly, that if He released Him, He was not <hi>Caesars</hi> friend;
and, in these words, imply, that they would accuse Him, if he let Him go. So in
the end, the cries of the tumultuous Rabble, the fear of a Tumult, and much
more of his <hi>Masters</hi> displeasure, prevail with him to condemn him to death,
against all Justice, all Admonitions, and his own Conscience, though he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y
scourged him. So vile a thing it is in any (Judge especially) to fear
Man, more than God, and Temporal more than Eternal punishments. Thus <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas</hi>
is released, the guilt of Christ's bloud charged upon the Jews; who take it
upon them, and their children, to their condemnation, and confusion; And <hi>Christ</hi>
is delivered to the Souldiers.</p>

               <p>As He was accused, and so condemned for this cause alleadged, that He said
<hi>He was the King of the Jews;</hi> so they accordingly abuse Him. They divest Him of
His outward garments, crown Him with thorns, array Him with a purple gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as signs of Royal Dignity, put a Reed, for a Scepter, into his hands, bow
before him, and salute him, as King of the Jews; and withall, smite Him on the
Head, to make the Thorny-Crown pierce into His Temples. And after they had
made themselves sport, with His miseries, and satiated themselves, they take off
those Ornaments of derision, and lead him to the place of Execution: which
followed immediately upon this unjust Judgment, and so many indignities of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him. He is led out of the City, as a prophane, unhallowed person, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to abide in that holy place and he must carry his cross; which yet <hi>Simon</hi>
of <hi>Cyrene</hi> was afterward compelled to do. Being brought to the place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
he is divested of his garments, which are divided amongst the Souldiers,
who cast lots upon his seamless coat; which done, He is nailed to the Cross, and
suffers cruel torment. Instead of ease and comfort, they give him gall to eat, and
vinegar to drink, they mock him, give him vile and cutting words. In midst of
this condition, He is deserted for a time, the sweetest comforts of Heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
from Him, the Devils of Hell permitted to exercise their malice, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and power upon Him. And that we might understand his sufferings to be
far greater then we can imagine, He cries out <hi>My God my God, why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
me?</hi> and complains of such miseries as never any suffered. <hi>Job</hi>'s afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were many and grievous, and came nearest unto these of Christ, yet were far
short. He suffered thus upon the Cross, from the 6th, unto the 9th hour of the
day, and then died, and commended his Soul into the hands of his <hi>Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
Thus the <hi>Consecration</hi> of the great <hi>High Priest</hi> was finished, the things
fore-told concerning his <hi>Suffering</hi> fulfilled, and his <hi>bitter suffering</hi> had an end.</p>
               <p>That day, his body being dead, pierced by a Souldier, though no bone of this
true <hi>Paschal Lamb</hi> was broken, sent forth water and bloud: and being taken
down from the Cross, yielded by consent of the Governour, into the hands of
<hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> was by him, and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> decently and honourably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
in <hi>a new Sepulchre,</hi> where never any man was buried, continued separate

               <p>Many with great Eloquence and Art have methodically set forth the <hi>Passions</hi>
of our Saviour; and their intention was, to affect the <hi>Hearts</hi> of their <hi>Auditors,</hi>
and stir up to <hi>sorrow</hi> and other <hi>passions:</hi> Yet these four things are matter of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
moment give a clearer light to understand the great mystery of <hi>Redemption,</hi>
and are effectual to melt our hearts with godly inccour for our sins, to make us
sensible of God's wonderful love, to revive our hearts with heavenly comfort,
and to mortifie our corruptions.</p>
               <p>1. Therefore, this <hi>Humiliation</hi> was an Act of Obedience unto God his <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father,</hi> who out of his unspeakable love gave him this command to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
for a while and suffer death for sinful man's salvation. This was an Act of
transcendent power, to give such a Law; and <hi>Christ</hi> willingly out of pitty unto
his Brethren, submitted to this power, and was willing to be bound by this Law,
and become a servant and was obedient unto this Death. Therefore it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<hi>Loe I come to do thy will;</hi> that is, this great Command of <hi>suffering death,</hi> not
for himself, but for others, being guilty, and bound in their own persons to <hi>suffer:
which was an act of greatest love that possibly can be expressed. In that it was an act of
obedience it signifies his willingness and doth teach us that he suffered freely: For all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
is free and willing or else no obedience.</hi> That it was willing and free is many
ways evident: <hi>For no man</hi> (saith he) <hi>taketh my life from me, but I laid it down of
my self</hi> Joh. 10. 18. No man took it from him because no one could do it, if he had
not bin willing to have parted with it. His Prayer, wherein he so earnestly three
several times deprecated the Cup of his Passion, makes it clear by that clause,
wherein he corrected his natural desire, <hi>Thy will, not mine be done.</hi> It was often
attempted, both by fraud and force, to take away his life, but it could not be
done before that hour-wherein he was willing to lay it down himself. He offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himself unto the <hi>Band of Souldiers,</hi> which came to apprehend him, and said

resently, at that word, they went backward &amp; fell down to the ground. Besides,
he could have called for 12 <hi>Legions of Angels,</hi> to defend, or rescue him, and yet he
would not do it. To be a servant, and suffer the death of the Cross, was an act of
greatest <hi>humility:</hi> For, the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the <hi>Word made flesh, Humane Nature</hi> united
so nearly to the <hi>Deity,</hi> to <hi>deny himself</hi> so far, as to be below the <hi>Angels,</hi> below so
many men, to be a Servant in the meanest rank of men, subject to the Law, to
Civill, and Ecclesiastical Power; and, though <hi>Lord of Angels,</hi> yet to abase <hi>himself</hi>
so low, as to suffer such reproach, and all kind of indignities, from the basest sort
of Abjects, and Refuse of the people, and as it were to be trampled upon, as
though he were a Worm, and the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

though he was most innocent, was <hi>humility indeed,</hi> and <hi>a stupendious humiliation.</hi>

                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:64164:60"/>
This Act of Obedience, was performed with greatest patience and charity that
ever any was: For he opened not his mouth, was dumb as the sheep befor the
<hi>Shearer:</hi> When he was reviled, he reviled not again. They curse him, blaspheme
him, deride him, and many ways abuse him, yet he is quiet, and his Soul so calm,
as though he suffered nothing, though he suffered more than ever any did. And
this was his Charity, that he humbled himself, and suffered all this for unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
ungodly sinners, and enemies, even for the Eternal Salvation of those who
did afflict and crucifie him, praying to his Father to forgive them, for they knew
not what they did.</p>
               <p>In that,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> as a Servant, he was obedient unto Death, the Death of the Cross, and
endured such cruel pains, and so shameful a death, though he was so excellent,
and innocent; this doth give us occasion to think and consider of many things:
For,</p>
               <p>1. By this we may understand, that his sufferings were very great, not onely
in respect of the multitude of them, the quality of the persons from whom, the
parts wherein he suffered, and the nature of his sufferings: But from this, that
he died the death of the Cross. And this Death was,
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Violent,</hi> not Natural.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Cruel,</hi> and full of Pain.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Ignominious</hi> and most Reproachful.</item>
                     <item>4. Most accursed.</item>
                     <item>5. Joyned with far greater Torments, and trouble of the Soul, then
we can conceive.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>2. Seeing Death is the wages of Sin, it must be for Sin; and seeing he had no
sin of his own, it must be for the sins of others. And because where there is no
Law, there is no sin, therefore must there be some Law transgressed, whereby He
became liable to this punishment of death. The Law, of it self, made none
liable to death, but the parties violating it, which Christ never did; therefore,
there must be a Law-giver, and a Judge above the Law, who had power to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the punishment, from the guilty, upon One innocent, who was willing to
take it upon him. The Law-giver was God, and He was the Judge, and gave a
Command to Jesus Christ, to suffer this death due to sinful man, and he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
submitted, and became Surety or Hostage for man. And by vertue of this
Command, and Christ's Voluntary Submission, the Law transgressed had power
over him, and he became liable to this death: <hi>And so he who knew no sin, became
sin for us, that we might be the righteousness of God in Him, 2 Cor. 5. ult.</hi> So that in
this suffering of death, though the Devil, and the Jews, with <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> were
active in crucifying Christ, We must consider, God, as Supream Judge, did pass
the Sentence, and execute the same. Christ is the Head of, and Hostage for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and a general person suffering for many, that the benefit might redound to
many. In this respect, that Christ suffered for the sin of others, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that his suffering was a punishment in proper sense; and, that God, in
threatning death to <hi>Adam,</hi> and Mankind, sinning, reserved a power and liberty
to himself to punish the party sinning, or some other for him. Yet because the
thing, in the obligation, was the punishment of the guilty offending, and not
the Innocent; it must needs be an Act of Grace in God, by his Command, to
substitute another, and also to accept his Suffering, as an Expiation of their sins.
It was Justice in Him, that He would punish Sin; but free Mercy to punish it
in Christ, and be satisfied with that death of another person. But of these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
more hereafter, when I shall declare how, and how far the benefit of this
Redemption, may be derived to others.</p>

                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:64164:61"/>
This <hi>Death was Death,</hi>

of God, and the desert of sin, which is shame, pain, a Curse. For this death
was shameful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> painful, accursed. Therefore, it is said, that Christ endured the
Cross, and despised the shame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. and that he became a Curse for us,
<hi>God.</hi> 3. 13. Therefore, the bitter passion of our Saviour, may perswade us all for
ever to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ear, and hate that sin, which so much offended the just God, that He pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
it so severely in our Saviour. For he never suffered death, neither did
he lay upon him the iniquities of us all, to this end, that we might have liberty
to sin, but that we should repent with godly sorrow, and ever mortifie corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; the very root of sin in us. The death of Christ should be the death of sin in
us; and the remembrance of his sufferings should break our hearts, humble us,
and separate us from sin.—That Christ should die, and we should live, and his
death should be our life, was often signified by the ancient Sacrifices, wherein
the bloud and death of the thing sacrificed, was a kind of expiation of the sin of
man. Man sins, and Beasts suffer, to signifie, that there must be a far better Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to purge away the sin of Man, and purifie his Conscience. Therefore Order
requires, that we consider the death of the Cross, so willingly suffered as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:
And, if it was a Sacrifice, as no doubt it was, we must observe

               <p>The Parties to be sanctified, <hi>SINFVL MEN,</hi> for whom He suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
               <p>That Christ was a Priest, the Apostle proves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 6. For there he first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
a Priest to be a Mediatour between God and Man, in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
and in his Offerings and Prayers, represents the People: In blessing of
the People, He represents God: though of this He saith nothing in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
yet in the 7th, in <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> blessing and tithing <hi>Abraham,</hi> he implies,
that in both these <hi>Acts,</hi> a Priest represents God. And because a Priesthood is
an Office, and a Priest and Officer in Religion, and things pertaining to God, he
informs us, that, very one cannot be a Priest, but one taken from amongst
men, and ordained for men. And as an Officer is made by the Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the Supream Power, and must not presume upon, and usurp the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
therefore Christ did not glorifie himself, but was chosen, called ordained a
Priest, and that immediatly by God. And his Commission he finds in <hi>Psal. 2.
7.</hi> &amp; 110. 4. And his Priesthood was powerful, most excellent, personal, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable,
made so by Oath, and Eternal, and he himself holy without sin. He
must minister in the Heavenly Tabernacle, and his Ministery must be Spiritual,
and himself the Mediatour of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> to procure and dispose of the
Spiritual and Eternal Blessings promised in the same. Amongst many other
Services to be performed by a Priest, one, and a principal, was Sacrifice; and in
the <hi>Levitical Service,</hi> that of <hi>Expiation,</hi> yearly offered on the 10th day of the
7th Month was most eminent: and this the Apostle singles out as the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Sacrifice to typifie the death of Christ, as far more excellent then that
Sacrifice of the <hi>Levitical High-Priest,</hi> Chap. 9. Therefore, the death of Christ
was a <hi>Sacrifice Ilastical,</hi> and <hi>Propitiatory.</hi> His willing-suffering of death was the
Offering: the Thing offered, was Himself: For he offered himself without
spot. The Party to whom he offered himself was God, considered</p>
               <p>1. As Law-giver offended.</p>
               <p>2. As Judge, who had power to refuse or accept the Offering; and upon the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64164:61"/>
same accepted, to pardon sin, and give Eternal Life. The Parties to be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by this Offering, were sinful, and guilty Persons, acknowledging Christ alone
to be the Priest, and this Death the full and onely expiation of sin, and resting in
the same alone. So that this Sacrifice so was offered unto God, and this Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
was an Act of Christ, as a Priest; and, in particular, it was an Act of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to that great and transcendent Command of His Heavenly Father, that
He should suffer death for the sin of Man; and the intention of it was to take
away, and expiate the sin of Man: and, in this respect, it's said, that by His own
blood He entred in once into the <hi>Holy Place,</hi> and obtained Eternal Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or Remission.</p>
               <p>Christ entred two several times into <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Immediately upon His Death, when His Soul separated from His Body,
was received into <hi>Paradise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. When He was risen, He ascended both Soul and Body, as immortal into
the <hi>Heaven of Heavens,</hi> where He doth, and shall continue until the time of the
Restitution of all things. The first entrance seems to be that which obtained
Eternal Redemption. For as the High-Priest, presently upon the slaying of
the Sacrifice, takes the blood, and enters into the <hi>Holy Place,</hi> and appears before
the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rcy-Seat; and when that was done, the expiation of the sins of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was finished: So Christ being slain, and dying upon the Cross, His Soul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the <hi>Holy Place of Heaven</hi> as separated from the Body, and so presented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
before the Throne of the Eternal Judge, as having suffered death, as God
commanded, humbly demands that which God had promised, and so speeds. For
He obtained <hi>Eternal Redemption.</hi> And lest this Death of Christ should seem
to be an ordinary thing, <hi>The Sun was darkened, the Earth did tremble, the Rocks
were torn asunder, the Veil of the Temple was rent from the top to the bottome;</hi> and
all this to signifie, that the <hi>Great High-Priest</hi> was entered by His Death and
blood into the <hi>Holy Place</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and had obtained Eternal Remission; the
great Encounter between the Son of God, and the Prince of Darkness was past,
and Christ obtained the Victory, and the sin of Man was now punished in the
Surety and Hostage of Mankind; and the greatest Execution in the World was
ended, and by the same an entrance was made into the place of Glory.</p>
               <p>After that it hath been made evident,<label type="milestone">

                  </gap>he next thing, in the
second place, to be inquired, is, what the effects of this Sacrifice were. And they
are of two sorts:
<list>
                     <item>1. Immediate.</item>
                     <item>2. Mediate.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Immediate are reduced to two: The
First is called satisfaction. The Second, Merit.</p>
               <p>And both these, in respect of man, are called <hi>Propitiation:</hi> yet the immediate
effect, in respect of Christ, is <hi>Merit,</hi> and onely <hi>Merit.</hi> In respect of man, it's
written That God set forth Christ the Propitiation for our sins, by Faith, through
His Blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. And He is the Propitiation for our sins, and the sins of
the whole World, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2. And that God did manifest His love, in sending
His Son to be the Propitiation for our sins, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 10. To be a Propitiation, is
to make God offended, propitious unto guilty Man. This Propitiation, therefore,
in respect of sin, which is also called <hi>Redemption,</hi> may be truly said to be <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi>
made to the Supream Judge offended, so as to free the party guilty from
the obligation unto punishment. Neither need we scruple the word, <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</hi>
as not found in Scripture: for it's expresly used by our Translators,
<hi>Numb. 35. 31. Moreover, ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64164:62"/>
that is guilty of death</hi> &amp;c. The word in the Original, is, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, used in the <hi>New-Testament,</hi>
and translated <hi>Redemption, Ransome,</hi> &amp;c. And it signifies a gift or
price, or something offered to him that hath power of life and death, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as a sufficient satisfaction: it frees the party liable to death, because an
Enemy, or guilty of some capital Crime, from Death, and that Obligation unto
Death. The word, <hi>Lutron,</hi> comes from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because it doth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
free from death. That which made sinful man liable to death, was the Will of
the <hi>Law-giver,</hi> expressed in the Law, and binding man to Obedience, or Death.
Man disobeying justly deserves Death, and God the Supream Judge might justly
condemn him, and nothing could free man from the Obligation, but Pardon,
Pardon might be granted two ways; either, <hi>ex nudâ voluntate,</hi> absolutely and
freely out of meet mercy without any consideration of, or respect unto, His Law
and Justice; or, <hi>à Satisfactione,</hi> upon consideration of something done, suffered,
offered for satisfaction, unto Divine Justice violated. And this satisfaction might
be made, either by the Party offending, or some other, taken as a Surety or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stage,
whose life is engaged for the life of another. In this particular case par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
is granted, not without consideration: For that could not stand with the
honour of the Law and Divine Justice, but upon satisfaction to be made. This
satisfaction could not be made by the Parties offending, who were guilty and
unworthy: Therefore it was made by another, Christ Jesus, the Word, made
flesh, who became an Hostage for sinful Man, and engaged His life. And as He
had engaged His Life, so He gave Himself a Ransome for <hi>ALL, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 6.
And here, many things are observable:</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Christ</hi> being the <hi>Word,</hi> made <hi>Flesh,</hi> and Innocent, was fit, and onely
He was fit, to be a Hostage:
<list>
                     <item>1. As Flesh.</item>
                     <item>2. As Flesh united to the Word.</item>
                     <item>3. As Innocent.</item>
                     <item>4. As freely, upon God's Command and Commission, offering Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>2. That God, in strict Justice, might have refused the <hi>Hostage,</hi> and the <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi>
and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> offered and made, because neither the one, nor the other,
were in the Obligation of the Law.</p>
               <p>3. Yet He, in free mercy, accepted both, in behalf of, and for sinful Man.</p>
               <p>4. The proper effect, in respect of God, which followed upon the <hi>Ransome,</hi>
or <hi>Lutron</hi> given and accepted, was, that God was propitious, and willing to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and save.</p>
               <p>5. Yet <hi>Divine Wisdome,</hi> in respect unto His Justice and Holiness, determined
the tearms, upon which Pardon should be actually given; and expressed the
tearms, in the Promise, which was grounded upon the Death of Christ accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>6. For God to be propitious, was to be willing to turn away His Wrath,
and forbear to punish, and also to be favourable unto Man. In respect of the
former, Christ's Death is called Satisfaction; of the latter, Merit: yet both are
really the same, and was a changing of Justice into Mercy, which took away, or
rather immediately made the Punishment of Pain and Loss removable: And
Christ's Death accepted, may be said onely to merit: Yet because this <hi>Merit</hi>
was upon a Wrong done, and presupposed it's called Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Seeing the immediate <hi>Effect</hi> of this Sacrifice is <hi>Merit,</hi>

               <p>4. The power of the sanctifying Spirit, to enable man to keep the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

and sanctifie, and free from sinne, that so we may be fit to serve our God; and
when our Purification and Consecration is finished, that we may serve the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Heaven.</hi> The</p>
               <p>3d <hi>Effect,</hi> is the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> or <hi>Testament,</hi> as <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,</hi>
and <hi>Priest</hi> thereof. For as the <hi>Promises</hi> of <hi>Remission,</hi> and the <hi>Eternal Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance</hi>
formerly made to the <hi>Called,</hi> for, and in the consideration of the Death
and Sacrifice of Christ, had been void, and of none effect, if Christ had never
dyed: So upon this Death and Sacrifice, they were firmly established, and of
full force, to convey the <hi>Inheritance</hi> upon the <hi>Called;</hi> so that if they obey the
<hi>Heavenly Call,</hi> they may certainly expect, as they shall certainly receive <hi>Remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and the <hi>Eternal Inheritance,</hi> ver. 15, 16, 17. The</p>
               <p>Fourth Effect is, His entrance into <hi>Heaven,</hi> to appear in the <hi>Presence</hi> of God,
for Us, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. For upon our <hi>Repentance, Faith, Prayers,</hi> upon Earth, He, as our
Advocate, and Intercessour, pleads before the Throne of God with His own
Blood, to obtain Remission and Acceptance for Us. This Intercession made by
Him, as an ever-living Priest, is made effectual for us, by vertue of this <hi>Sacrifice,</hi>
and the efficacy and success depends upon this <hi>Vnspotted Blood.</hi> Therefore is it
written for our comfort, <hi>That if any man sinne, we have an Advocate with the
Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, who is the Propitiation for our sins,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1,
2. And His Plea is this; That though His Client hath sinned and deserved
death, yet he ought not to suffer and dye, because He Himself hath suffered, God
accepteth His Death; the sinner confesseth, repenteth, and believeth, and God
his Father, and supream Judge, at whose Bar He pleadeth, hath promised
Pardon and Salvation upon those tearms. The</p>
               <p>Fifth and last Effect, is the <hi>Actual Collation,</hi> and enjoyment of <hi>Eternal Glory</hi>
For unto them, who look for Him, He will appear the second time without sin,
(that is, suffering for sin) unto Salvation. For the <hi>Actual Enjoyment</hi> of <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and <hi>Eternal Glory,</hi> is granted, as merited by this Death, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. All these
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64164:63"/>
are summed up, in that one of the <hi>Eternal Consecration</hi> of the <hi>Sanctified,</hi> Chap.
10. 14.</p>
               <p>Seeing Christ merited many and glorious things for sinful man,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> he must needs
merit some greater thing for himself, and so he did. For because he humbled
himself so low, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was obedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
death, the death of the Cross: Therefore God highly exalted Him, and gave
Him a Name, which is above every Name, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9. And God advanced Him
far above all Principality, and Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every
Name that is named, not onely in this World, but in that which is to come: and
hath put all things under his feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to
the Church, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 21, 22. By which, we may understand, that He merited to
Himself a Supream and Universal Power in Heaven and Earth: and not onely
power over all flesh, but over all Creatures, &amp; even over all Angels. And He was
invested with this power immediately upon the Resurrection: for then He was
made universal Prophet Priest, and King; and upon His Ascension, followed His
<hi>Solemn Inauguration,</hi> and <hi>Coronation,</hi> as we may so speak, when He was set at the
right hand of God; and then His Eternal and unchangeable <hi>Priest-hood</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
unto Him by an Oath.</p>
               <p>2. He merited Immortality, the Place and Throne of Glory, fulness of joy in
His Fathers presence and pleasures at His right hand for evermore. He attained
Immortality upon His Resurrection; the Place and Throne of Glory, fulness of
joy and Eternal Pleasures upon His A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>3. He merited a Judgment to be passed upon the Devil, to lose his power
over Mankind, and the same to be transferred upon Himself; and a strength to
rescue him out of Sathan's possession a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> will and pleasure.</p>
               <p>4. He merited a power, to send down the Holy Ghost to reveal the Gospel,
and in a special manner to head His Church, protect it, guide it, give it everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
peace; and, in respect of His highest Dignity, that not onely Men, but An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

                     <item>1. An Obedience unto the Death of the Cross,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> and a Sacrifice; And</item>
                     <item>2. Having many and glorious Effects, one and the same principal being
the Acquisition of a new Power over Mankind. The</item>
                     <item>3. Thing, in order, is, the manner and measure of the communication
of the benefit thereof unto others.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>That the benefit of this Death and Sacrifice, is communicable to sinful Man,
is express Scripture: For as by the offence of One, Judgment came upon all
men, unto condemnation; even so by the Righteousness of One, the free gift
came unto all men, unto justification of life: And again, As by one man's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
many were made sinners; so by the obedience of One, shall many
be made righteous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19. And since by man, came death; by Man
came also the Resurrection of the Dead: for as in <hi>Adam</hi> all dye, so in Christ
shall all be made alive, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21, 22. From which places, it's clear, that as
from <hi>Adam,</hi> Sin and Death were derived upon all men; so Righteousness and
Life are derived upon Mankind by Christ.</p>
               <p>But the Question will be,
<list>
                     <item>1. How?</item>
                     <item>2. How far this Benefit is derived?</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. If we enquire of the manner, how Righteousness and Life is derived
from Christ being One, unto so many, we shall find that this cannot be, except
Christ be a general Head of Mankind, and one person with them, as <hi>Adam</hi>
was. And this He could not be, as He was the Word properly; but as the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64164:63"/>
Word, made Flesh: for if He will sanctifie them, he must take Flesh and Bloud
with the Sanctified, and so be Man. Yet He may be Man, and not a general
Person, so as to be one with them: and we do not read of any, but onely two,
who were general Heads, and, in some respect, virtually all Mankind, <hi>the first and
second Adam.</hi> Such Christ, was not but by the Will of God, and His own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Consent. The Will of God appoints Him to be the Head of Mankind,
and their Surety and Hostage, and so accounted Him; and He did willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
and took upon Him the Person of others. And the principal cause of this
Representation, whereby He is one Person with us, is the Will of God, who,
as Lord, made Him such; and, as Law-giver, and Judge, did so account Him.
But</p>
               <p>2. How far is He One Person with us? The Answer is.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>In general;</hi> so far as it pleased God to make Him so, and no farther.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>In particular;</hi> He, and We, are One so far,
<list>
                        <item>1. As to make Him liable to the Penalty of the Law, which He
suffered not for Himself, but for us.</item>
                        <item>2. So far as to free us from that Obligation, and derive the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of His Death to Us. I may instance in a Debtour, and his
Surety, who are one person; and the Law so accounts them, so
far as<list>
                              <item>1. The Surety becomes liable to the Debt; And</item>
                              <item>2. If he pay it, the Principal is freed from the Obligation. Yet the
Surety is not the Principal; nor if he pay the Debt with his own
money, doth the Principal pay it with his.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>So, though Christ be so far one with us, as to be liable to the Penalty of the
Law, and to suffer it, and upon this Suffering we are freed; yet Christ is not the
sinner nor the sinner Christ. Christ is the Word, made Flesh, innocent, and
without sin, an universal Priest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and King; but we are none of these. Though
we be accounted as one person in Law with him by a <hi>Trope;</hi> yet, in proper sense,
it cannot be said, that in Christ satisfying, we satisfied for our own sins: For then
we should have been the Word, made Flesh, able to plead innocency, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and perpetual obedience, have dyed upon the Cross, when He was crucified;
and by our own blood, entring into the Holy Place, to have obtained Eternal
Redemption.</p>
               <p>But all these things are false, impossible, blasphemous, if affirmed by any. It's
true, that we were so one with Him, that He satisfied for us, and the benefits of
this <hi>Satisfaction</hi> redounds to us, and is communicable to all, upon certain
tearms, though not actually communicated to all.</p>
               <p>From this <hi>Vnity,</hi> and <hi>Identity,</hi> of Person in Law, if I may so speak, it follows
clearly, that Christ's <hi>Sufferings</hi> were not onely <hi>Afflictions,</hi> but <hi>Punishments,</hi> in
proper sense. For it is not material, whether He suffer for His own sins, which
He could not, because He was innocent, or for the sins of others: For if He suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for sins, then His Sufferings were Punishments. For Poena is <hi>Vind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Achan</hi> commits Sacriledge: not onely He, but his Sons and Daughters are
stoned to death for it. But I shall have occasion, hereafter, to say something
more of this Particular.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Socinians,</hi> in opposing this truth, deny plain Scriptures, and charge God
with injustice, by consequence: and whilest they deny Christ's Sufferings to be
Punishments, lest they should make God unjust, they charge Him with injustice.
For if it be unjust to punish Christ, being innocent, for the sinnes of others, for
whom He voluntarily suffered, according to the Appointment and Command
of His Heavenly Father; much more unjust it must needs be, to afflict him, and
that so grievously, without any cause at all, or demerit of others. And whereas
they say, That though some may suffer for the sins of others, when they are sinful
themselves, and not otherwise, they do but trifle. For if one may justly be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
for the sin of another, whereof he is not guilty, then an innocent person
may justly suffer for another, who is guilty. This was the case of <hi>Israel,</hi> when
<hi>David</hi> sinned. He, out of <hi>Pride,</hi> numbers the People: God is offended here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and punisheth for this sin, and that with death, 70000 of his Subjects.
The King sins, the People suffer, and they suffer death for the Kings sin, whereof
they were not guilty; as appears by those words of <hi>David's</hi> Repentance. <hi>But
these sheep, what have they done?</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 17. That is, I, not they have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
They are innocent in this particular. By all this we may understand how,
and how far Christ's Sacrifice is communicable to us. How we come to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Partakers of these Benefits, shall be shewed hereafter.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> I will take occasion to examine the <hi>Extent</hi> of Christ's
Death: Whether He died for all men, and so Redemption be universal, as some
use to speak; or no.</p>
               <p>1. That Christ dyed for all, in some sense, must needs be granted; because the
Scripture expresly affirms it. <hi>For by the Righteousness of One, the free gift came
upon All Men, to justification of life,</hi> Rom. 5. 18. And if One died for all, then
were all dead.</p>
               <p>2. That onely Believers actually enjoy the Benefit of this Death unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is as clear also.</p>
               <p>3. Neither God's love, in giving Christ; nor Christ's love dying for Man, do
exclude any, <hi>as love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The benefit of Salvation is communicable to all, upon certain tearms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the Covenant, which yet limits the actual benefit of Remission, and
Eternal Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, by prescribing a qualification in the Parties, to be saved by Christ's
death.</p>
               <p>5. The Qualification is such, that it excludes no man, <hi>as a man, or a sinful
man,</hi> but as impenitent, and not believing at least. So that it may truly be said,
that by Christ's Sacrifice, all men are <hi>save-able</hi> some way, though all shall not
be saved: And if any become not <hi>save-able,</hi> it's upon some demerit, and speciall
cause antecedent. The immediate Effects, called Satisfaction, and Merit, both
signified by the word <hi>Propitiation,</hi> make God propitious; and, in that respect,
man in a capacity of Salvation, or <hi>save-able,</hi> and do not precisely <hi>exclude,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any:</hi> But <hi>Justification, Reconciliation, Adoption, Glorification,</hi> are so simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </p>
               <p>This Question is needless, if men would content themselves with the plain
and simple truth of the Scriptures, and rather, <hi>use all means to believe then dispùte.</hi>
For if I once sinc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:64164:65"/>
There is another question, and the same <hi>unprofitably</hi> handled <hi>[Whether the
Propitiation which includes both satisfaction and merit be to be ascribed to the active
or passive obedience of Christ?]</hi> (as their distinction, and expression proposeth
it).</p>
               <p>For solution whereof its to be observed.</p>
               <p>1. That both his active, personal, perfect, and perpetual obedience, which by
reason of his humane nature assumed, and subjection unto God was due; and
also that obedience unto the great and transcendent command of suffering the
death of the Crosse, both concur as causes of Remission and justification.</p>
               <p>2. The Scriptures usually ascribe it to the <hi>Blood,</hi> Death, and Sacrifice of
Christ, and never to the personall <hi>active obedience of Christ</hi> to the <hi>Morall
law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That yet this active obedience is necessary, because without it he could
not have offered that great sacrifice of himself without spot unto God: and if it
had not been without spot, it could not have been <hi>Propitiatory,</hi> and effectuall
for <hi>expiation:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. That if Christ as our surety had performed for us perfect and perpetual
obedience, so that we might have been judged to have perfectly and fully kept
the law by him, then no sin could have been chargeable upon us, and the death
of Christ had been needlesse, and superfluous.</p>
               <p>5. Christs propitiation frees the <hi>Believer,</hi> not onely from the obligation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
punishment of sense, but of losse; and procured for him not onely delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from evil deserved, but the enjoyment of all good necessary to our full
happinesse. Therefore there is no ground of Scripture for that opinion. That
the death of Christ and his sufferings free us from punishment, and by his <hi>active
obedience, imputed to us,</hi> we are made righteous, and the heyres of life.</p>
               <p>6. If Christ was bound to perform perfect and perpetuall obedience for us,
and he also performed it for us; then we are freed not onely from sin, but obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
too: and this obedience as distinct and seperate from obedience unto
death may be pleaded for justification of life, and will be suffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ient to carry the
cause. For the tenour of the law was this: <hi>Do this and Live:</hi> And if man do
this by himself or surety, so as that the law-giver and supreme Judge accept it,
the Law can require no more: It could not bind to perfect obedience, and to
punishment too. There never was any such law made by God or just men.
Before I conclude this particular concerning the extent of Christs merit, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation,
I thought good to inform the Reader, that as the Propitiation of Christ
makes no man absolutely, but upon certain terms pardonable, and savable; so
it was never made, either to prevent all sin, or all punishments. For it presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
man, both sinful and miserable. And we know that the guilt, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment
of <hi>Adams</hi> sin lyes heavy upon all his posterity to this day. And not
onely that but the guilt of actual, and personal sins lyes wholly upon us, whilst
impenitent and unbelieving, and so out of Christ; and the regenerate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are not fully freed from all punishments till the finall resurrection and
judgement. So that his propitiation doth not altogether prevent, but remove
sin, and punishment by degees. Many sins may be said to be <hi>remissible</hi> by vertue
of this sacrifice which never shall be remitted: In this sense it may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that some deny that Lord that bought them, 2 <hi>Pet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 1. For Christ by his
death acquired a right unto, and so a power over all flesh; but so that he must
give eternall life, onely to such as his Father gave him. For one immediate
effect of Christs death was to make God placable, and sin pardoned: yet he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
merited that any sin should be actually pardoned but upon such terms, as
his heavenly Father should prescribe. It may also in a sense be said that <hi>Christ
dyed onely for the elect;</hi> That is, that onely they shall obtayn actual pardon. Yet

Therefore he sends his son, his dearly beloved, his onely begotten son,
whom he esteemed above all men and Angells: He smites him, wounds him,

must he learn obedience by suffering: and, before all these things were endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
his Soul seperated from his Body, and his Body layd in the Grave, he must
not rise again to Glory. And he makes an unchangeable decree, that whosoever
will not be willing to deny himself, take up his Crosse, be obedient, not onely
in doing good, but also in suffering evill, even death, the most cruell, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting

with his own blood: and the sinner must be washed in that blood, and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>The Mercy,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XI</label> Love, and free Grace of God appears, in that he was willing to
save man, though a grievous offender; that he would transfer the punishment
due to us, and deserved by us, upon another; and he must be his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that must bear it; that he doth all this freely, when there was nothing out

Wretches, enemies, ungodly, miserable, base, polluted, deserving to be
cast out of his presence, and condemned to eternall death. Upon the very
foresight of our sin, and misery, he, out of love decrees to send his Son, and
give him unto death, and in him elects us and predestinates us unto eternall
Glory. When man was created, &amp; had sinned, he promiseth Christ, renews this
promise often: in fulnesse of time he sends him, and severely punisheth our
sins in him; accepts his suffering and sacrifice as a sufficient satisfaction for all
our sins, and meritorious of Remission, and eternall life.</p>
               <p>He reveales him in the Gospell, offers him unto us, calls us, gives his Spirit,
and with patience and long-suffering waits for our Repentance, abrogates the
law of works, and promiseth eternall life, anew upon fairest terms; consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
him an High-Priest in Heaven, and ever hears his Intercession, which he
ever lives to make for us. Nay upon this suffering of Christ foreseen, and fore-accepted,
he gives his Spirit who justifies, and saves all Believers of the World,
who lived before his Incarnation, and the finishing the work of Redemption.

charge given him to receive us, have a care of us, protect us, guide us, raise us up
at the last day, and give us everlasting life: Angells must be ministring Spirits
to guard us, &amp; all things must work together for our good. And this is strange:
The Son of God must be punished, that we might be spared; must be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that we may be justified; dy, that we may live; be humbled very low,

               <p>The subject of this discourse is the Acquisition of a new Power:<label type="milestone">

                  </gap>th appear not onely that another power is acquired, and added to
that of Creation, and preservation, but also that it was acquired by the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the Son of God made Man. And now man, in respect of his spirituall
capacity, and eternall estate, is wholly Gods, and subjected to him anew: and
now are we not our own: for we are bought with a price, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19, 20. And
Christ hath given himself a Ransome for us, 1 <hi>Timothy. cap. 2 ver.</hi> 6. And
we are redeemed by his pretious Blood, as of a Lamb without blemish, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate.
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. And as God acquired a new right unto us by Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so likewise by Regeneration, which is a new creation; so that our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
being is wholly his; and he hath acquired a new power to dispose of us,
and give us laws, and bind us to obedience and his service, upon another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
For wee are delivered out of the hands of our enemies to serve him,
without fear, in holinesse, and righteousnesse, before him, all the dayes of our
life. This power being acquired, we must consider to whom it was acquired,
and to whom it was communicated. God acquired this power unto himself,
and he communicates it to Christ as man, so farr as he is capable. That God
did acquire it, 'tis evident; for he sent Christ; he gave him; he transferred the
punishment of our sins upon him; he accepted his death, and sacrifice, as a full
propitiation; He regenerates, and renews us by his spirit, and gives us our new
being. And if althese be his works, then the Power, as also the Glory, is his;
and he hath a new prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

work of Redemption and Humiliation of this son was his work: Therefore we
are said to be purchased by his Blood, his own Blood, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. We are
said to be his workmanship created anew in Christ Jesus, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 10. All that
we are in respect of our spirituall estate, we are wholly, wholly his: and al things
that we have, as New-creatures, are from him, who quickned us, raised us up,
set us in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p>Though it be said that Christ is our Lord,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XIII</label> our Head, our Saviour, who hath
washed us in his blood, redeemed us out of all Nations, made us Kings, and
Priests, to God for ever, and reconciled us to the Father, so that whether we
live or dy we are the Lords, because, to this end, Christ both died, and revived,
and rose again, that he might be Lord both of the living and the dead, <hi>Rom. 14.
8,</hi> 9. Yet God did all this likewise, and put him to death, and raised him up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and made him Lord and King. This power therefore is Christs, but so
as that it is derived and communicated unto him from his heavenly Father. For
he gave him power, as he himself confesseth, over all flesh; he exalted him, and
gave him a name above all names: he by his mighty power raised him from the
dead, and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places, farr above all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality,
&amp; power, and might, and Dominion. And though he had all power in
heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; earth; yet he acknowledgeth it as given him. The son hath an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
jurisdiction; yet all judgment was committed unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22. so that he
hath it by commission. From all this it's evident, that God acquired this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and Christ acquired it. God hath it; Christ hath it. God hath it originally,
and primitively; Christ hath it derivatively, as man, and by commission. God is
the principall cause of the work of Redemption, Christ, as man united to the
Word, is the ministeriall agent. And as God by Christ did redeem and save
man, so he gave this power to Christ, and set him, not in the Throne, but, at
the right hand of the Throne of Glory, and by him, and his Spirit, doth exercise
this power, and will exercise it to the worlds end: which Exercise shall be the
subject of the discourse following.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>I</label> so He doth exercise it Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
For He both constitutes this Kingdom, and doth administer it. Yet
in the Administration, which was always by the Word and Spirit, he useth the
Ministery of Angels, Men, and other Creatures. Angels and Men are made by
Him not onely Instruments, but many of them are Officers: Some whereof
are ordinary; and some extraordinary; and some trusted with a greater, some
with a lesser power. And in this Exercise of his power, he always had a special
charge of the Church, and made use of Angels, in reveasing his Word, in the
protection, guidance, deliverance of them, and the destruction of their Enemies.
His most eminent Officers amongst men, were Priests, and Prophets. After Jesus
Christ was exhibited, and had finished his Humiliation, he was made the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Officer, and invested with a supream Power, next to that of the <hi>Deity,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d was
Lord of Angels, and all Creatures. Whether before the Incarnation, <hi>Michael</hi>
the Arch-Angel, or any other, did represent him, as having the primacy of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and power, is not so evident: but that he had both Men and Angels, who
both were types of him, and did represent him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is clear enough. In this respect,
he is said many times to have appeared to the Fathers, and that the <hi>Israelites</hi>
tempted him in the Wilderness, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 9. Some think, that the Angel which
appeared to <hi>Abraham, Isaac. Jacob,</hi> who brought the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
and conducted them in the Wilderness, was at least a Type of Christ, whom
they tempted not onely as the Word, but as represented and typified by some
Angel.</p>
               <p>This Power is exercised,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> either in the constitution, or the administration of
this blessed and glorious Kingdom. A Kingdom must first be constituted and
have the form, and essence of a Kingdom, before it can act, and move, or do any
thing as a Body Politick. The constitution, is the laying of the Foundation, and
the Laws and Rules thereof are called the Fundamental Laws. These Laws de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the person, or persons to be invested with the Supream Power, and the
manner how it resides, or is to be exercised by him, or them, and also defines
who are Subjects, with the manner and measure of their subjection, and who
shall be accounted strangers, and who enemies. In this Constitution, God is
the Supream Lord, invested with supream, universal, and absolute power, to be
acquired by the Conquest over the Devil, and reducing sinful Man, and chiefly
by the humiliation of the Word, made flesh. In which respect, he is Lord, and
Monarch, not merely as Creatour, and Preserver; but, most properly, as Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
This Power so resides in him, that he communicates some measure of it
unto Angels, and Men; but chiefly and in the highest degree to Jesus Christ, if
once exhibited. This Government, therefore, is <hi>Monarchical,</hi> yet rather <hi>Regal,</hi>
then <hi>Despotical,</hi> though his Power be absolute, and arbitrary, and as such he
might exercise it. The Subjects are, all Creatures in a large sense; but strictly,
sinful Man, in respect of his Spiritual Estate. And all men that have not subjected
themselves to him, as Redeemer, by Christ, are strangers at least, if not enemies.
Those are Subjects, and to be admitted as such, who renouncing the Devill, the
World, and the Flesh, submit themselves to him, as Lord; not onely <hi>Creatour,</hi>
but <hi>Redeemer;</hi> and, after that Christ was manifest in the flesh, such as should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him to be the Son of God, and the Prince of Salvation: For being
consecrated, He became the <hi>Author or Prince of Salvation,</hi> to all that obey him.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64164:68"/>
The perpetual Enemy, with whom there must be <hi>Eternal feud,</hi> is the Devil,
with His Agents. Yet this Constitution will be better understood by the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration.</p>
               <p>Yet,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> because the Law of Subjection is Fundamental, and belongs unto the
Constitution, I will take liberty, in this place, to speak more largely of the same.
By Subjection, in this place, I understand a voluntary submission; and, the same,
a Moral Duty required by God, and to be performed by Man, and that unto <hi>God</hi>
as <hi>Redeemer.</hi> For we must not confound <hi>passive subjection,</hi> with this <hi>voluntary sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</hi>
All Creatures, at all times, were subject, that is, under the power of
God, as Creatour and Preserver; and, amongst the rest, the Devils themselves,
though Revolter, and Rebels, are not exempt from His Dominion: So that its
one thing to be actively, another to be passively subject unto God. <hi>God-Redeemer</hi>
hath power, and is Lord of all; yet He acquired a special Right unto, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
in Man, and a peculiar power over him, in respect of His Spiritual Estate:
and therefore a special subjection is due from him unto His Saviour. And the
Angels, and all things, were subjected unto Christ, upon His Exaltation; yet this
was not by reason of <hi>Redemption,</hi> as though He had bought and redeemed them,
but upon another account: For their Service and Mini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ery was very useful, in
the administration of His Kingdom. Though in the Constitution of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the proper Subjects are men; and God, as Redeemer, by Christ, hath a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
right unto all and every of them: yet there is not any one of them admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as a Subject of this Kingdom, so as to receive Protection of the Soveraign,
the Priviledge of God's people, and have an actual right unto the Eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the same, before his voluntary submission be made. And if any submit,
though not fully; and, after that, fall away, and prove Apostates, they yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
under His Dominion. The reason why this submission is due unto Him
as Redeemer by Christ, is, because man wholly depends upon Him, for Spiritual
Being and Happiness, ever since he lost Righteousness and Life, by the Fall of
<hi>Adam;</hi> and God required it, since He promised, that <hi>the Seed of the Woman
should bruise the Serpents Head:</hi> And seeing God is not Redeemer, but by
Christ, either promised, or exhibited, therefore whosoever submits to God as
Redeemer, must submit unto Christ; and whosoever submits to Christ, submits
to God, who sent Christ. This submission pre-supposeth, &amp; necessarily requireth,
a firm and <hi>Practical Belief</hi> of the Redemption by Christ, and by none else:
Which <hi>Belief</hi> was first implicit, and after the Revelation of the Gospel more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit,
according as the <hi>Revelation</hi> of this <hi>Mystery</hi> was less, or more clear and full.

and Eternal Life. From this Description it's evident, that a Divine and
Effectual Belief of Redemption by Christ alone, and a total dependence upon
Him for Salvation, is necessarily required; so that there can be no sincere sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
without this Faith; no sincere Faith without this Submission. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Submission is sometimes taken for Faith, and Faith for Submission, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Faith is the Foundation of it. And here we must note,</p>
               <p>1. That by Subjection, we bind our selves to be His perpetual Servants and
Vassals.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:64164:68"/>
2. By it we renounce all other Powers, Lords, Masters, Redeemers; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Devil, the World, and the Flesh, so as to account them our <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That we resign our own Understanding, Will, and Power, to His Wisdom,
Will, and Power, in all matters of Eternal Salvation.</p>
               <p>4. That seeing the Party submitting, is a guilty person, this cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
without an acknowledgment of his own sin, guilt, baseness, misery, with
godly sorrow, a detestation of sin, and a returning to obedience again.</p>
               <p>5. That in this resignation, we renounce all confidence in our selves, and all
other things, so as wholly to rely upon his mercy, and Christ's merit; as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, we must perish everlastingly.</p>
               <p>6. That upon a clear and distinct knowledge, and firm belief of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
sufficiency, and perfection of power, and readiness in Him to save sinful Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
liable to Eternal Death, the Soul doth rest in Him alone as a compleat
Redeemer, and doth love, esteem, and admire Him so, that it accounts all things
most vile and base, in comparison of Him; and is willing for His sake, to lose the
best and rarest contents the World can give, and suffer the greatest evils, and
miseries, the Devil or Man can inflict upon Him.</p>
               <p>7. That it's the Root and Ground of all Obedience and Service. All these
things are plain, from the Doctrine and Example of Christ and His Apostles.
For Christ denyed Himself, and took up His Cross, and informs us, that we must
do so too: <hi>That we must forsake Father and Mother for His sake; and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hateth not Father and Mother, and dearest Relations of this Woold, for His
sake, is not worthy of Him:</hi> He is that Pearl, for which we must give all, or
else never purchase Him. And the Apostles forsook all, and followed Him,
<hi>Math. 19. 27. Paul</hi> counted all things loss and dung, in comparison of Him.
We have the like Examples in <hi>Abraham, Moses,</hi> the Prophets, and all the
Saints of old. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And there is none on Earth
that I desire besides thee.</hi> Psal. 73. 25. was the confession of them all. In Christ
Jesus we have Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, Redemption; and all
things, to make sinful man fully, and for ever blessed.</p>
               <p>This Submission,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> is the principal and proper Duty required in the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
understood Evangelically, <hi>Thou shalt have no Redeemer besides
Me:</hi> And it's solemnly testified in Baptism, Wherein we renounce the
Devil, the World, and the Flesh, and engage our selves to God the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>This is our Allegeance and Fealty, whereby we give our selves wholly to
our God, who hath redeemed and bought us, that He might give Himself to us,
for to make us Eternally Blessed. Though this Duty was always the first, and
principal which God required, yet it was more distinctly and clearly revealed
and urged, after the Exhibition and Glorification of Christ.</p>
               <p>The first Lesson that Christ taught His Disciples and Apostles, was, That He
was the Son of the Living God; and their first and chief Duty was, <hi>To deny
themselves, take up their Cross, and depend upon Him for everlasting life.</hi> And that
His own people might believe this Truth, and perform this Duty, <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi>
was sent before Him; He was manifested to the World by His Doctrine
and Miracles. But after He was once set down at the Right-Hand of God, and
the Gospel was preached, the first thing taught, was, that He was the <hi>Universal
Officer,</hi> by whom God would administer His Spiritual Kingdom, and dispose of
Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>And the first Duty pressed upon <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> was to receive Him as their
onely Priest, Prophet, King, and depend upon God, by Him, to be for ever sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:64164:69"/>
This might be made evident from many places: For <hi>Peter,</hi> in his first Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
preached, after he had received the Holy Ghost, would have the house of
<hi>Israel</hi> to know, that God had made that same Jesus, whom they had crucified,
both Lord and Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 36. He was the Prince of Life, and that Prophet,
whom God had promised to send, and threatned with destruction every one
that should not hearken unto Him, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 15, 22, 23. He is the Head of the
Corner, neither is there Salvation in any other: <hi>For there is no other Name under
Heaven given amongst men, whereby we must be saved,</hi> Act. 4. 11, 12. Him God exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with His right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to
<hi>Israel,</hi> and forgiveness of sin, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. The <hi>Eunuch</hi> must believe and profess,
that Jesus is the Son of God, before He could be baptized, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37.</p>
               <p>This was the principal point, which <hi>Paul,</hi> converted, did assert and prove,
That Christ is the Son of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 20.</p>
               <p>This was the principal truth proposed to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> That Jesus was He,
whom God ordained to be Judge of the Quick and Dead; and that, through
His Name, all such as believe in Him, shall receive remission of their sins, <hi>Act.
10.</hi> 42, 43.</p>
               <p>This is the principal scope of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> in several passages of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and especially in the first and second Chapters of that to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> to
manifest the excellency and sufficiency of Christ. And in that to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
it's made manifest, that He was a Prophet, far above all other Prophets, above
Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Moses;</hi> and a Priest above all Priests; and especially in this, that by
one Offering He had consecrated the <hi>Sanctified</hi> for ever.</p>
               <p>By this we may understand,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> what this Subjection, required by a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Law of the Kingdom of <hi>God-Redeemer,</hi> is: yet because the performance of
this Duty, is above the power of sinful Man, as born of sinful <hi>Adam;</hi> therefore,
in the second place, we must consider, by what meanes Man is reduced, and
brought back unto his God again.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures inform us, that we must be called, and born<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quickned, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
up by some Divine Power given out of free mercy for Christ's sake: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Subjection may be said to be a Work of Vocation or Calling. This
Vocation is sometimes taken for a Work of God's Power, whereby He redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
Man: Sometimes for a gracious admission, and acceptation of the sinner
submitting himself for a Subject, to enjoy the Rights and Priviledges of His
Kingdom: Sometimes for both. In this place, I take it for an Act of Divine
Power, as it is a cause of subjection which must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o before admission. To under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this, we must consider the Subject of it, and that is Man, as <hi>sub alienâ pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,</hi>
under the power of Sin and Sathan, and so out of God's King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om, and
as an Alien to this <hi>Heavenly Common-wealth:</hi> and such is every one by Nature,
as he is out of Jesus Christ. Yet there are degrees of this distance: some are
further off: some nearer to this Kingdom. This is evident, from the condition
of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in former times, and always, especially since the times of the
Gospel: Because all men are either in the <hi>visible Church,</hi> or out of it. And
men may be out of the Church two ways:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As never admitted into the same: Or,</item>
                  <item>2. Such as being in the Church prove Apostates.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The <hi>Gentiles</hi> once were not <hi>Gentiles:</hi> For their first <hi>Apostate Fathers</hi> were in
the Church: and the <hi>Jews,</hi> in former times, were God's people; but for their
unbelief are cast out, and continue <hi>LO-AMMI.</hi> none of God's people: and
this shall be their condition, till such time as the fulness of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be
come in. And we must distinguish of such as are in the <hi>visible Church;</hi> for some
are sincerely subjected unto <hi>God-Redeemer,</hi> according to their <hi>Allegiance:</hi> Some
are Subjects onely by Name and Profession; and by their ignorance unbelief,
disobedience, are little better then <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Aliens:</hi> Some are subject in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64164:69"/>
some measure, but come short of that degree, which is required to admission.
All these, excepting one sort, are out of this Kingdome, as it consists of reall
Saints, and living members of Christ. Apostates shall never be called, much
lesse admitted if they be personally, and wilfully such. For if we sin wilfully,
after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more
Sacrifice for sins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. and if no more Sacrifice, then calling is in vain,
and to no purpose. Yet the posterity of Apostates may be, and have been call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And if once God vouchsafe the meanes of conversion to Idolators, who
have forsaken, not only God as their Redeemer, but as Creatour and Preserver,
he requires of them to renounce the Devil, and turn from their Idols to the
living God first, and then unto him as Redeemer by Jesus Christ. They which
have forsaken Jesus Christ, or deny him as their Saviour, and yet acknowledge,
and worship God alone as the <hi>Creatour of Heaven,</hi> and Earth, the Preserver
and Governour of the World, as <hi>Turks, all Mahumetans,</hi> and the unbelieving
Jews do at this day, are bound to acknowledge Christ as their Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and sure his incarnation, and glorification, as already come into the
World. The case of the Jew in the times of Christ, and the Apostles was sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.
For the sincere Proselyte and Jew had onely this to do to believe in
Christ already come, as before they believed in him to come: and so they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
compleat members of the Church Christian, and perfectly subjects of
the Kingdome of Christ glorified. The Ignorant, and Prophane, as also the
Hypocrits must forsake their wicked wayes, and sincerely submit themselves.
Yet none of these things can be done without a power from Heaven, and a
Vocation; which is a gracious work of God Redeemer, wherein he by his
Word and Spirit reduceth man to subjection, so that he is fitted to be a subject
of his Blessed Kingdome. For by Calling we are delivered from the power of
darknesse, and translated into the Kingdome of His Dear Son, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13.
Therefore said to be called out of darknesse into his marveylous light, 1 <hi>Pet.
2.</hi> 9. And upon this they who were not a people, are made the people of God,
<hi>verse</hi> 10. For God will put his lawes into their mind, and write them in
their hearts: and thereupon He will be their God, and they shall be to
him a People, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. In all these Passages, and many more, it's
evident,</p>
               <p>1. That by nature, and as born of sinfull <hi>Adam,</hi> we are in darknesse, out
of Gods Kingdome, none of Gods People.</p>
               <p>2. That we passe out of darknesse into light, and into Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>3. This is not a work of our own merit or power: For it's God that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
us, translates us, writes his lawes in our hearts; and this of his free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and by his great and wonderfull power.</p>
               <p>4. By this we become Gods people, and subjects of Christ's Kingdom.
And all this is said to be by calling: For he called us out of darknesse into his
marvaylous light. All these particulars are expressed or implyed in those
words of the Apostle, who signifies that God would send him to the Gentiles
to open their eves, and to turn them from darknesse to light, and from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of Sathan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins, and as
inheritance among them, which are sanctifyed by saith in Christ, <hi>Act. 26.
17,</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>This Vocation,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> as it is an act of power, and great mercy, and free grace (for
by grace we are saved) so its a work which is effected by the Word,
and Spirit: For, as we are regenerate, so we are called: and we are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</p>
               <p>1. By the Word.</p>
               <p>2. By the Spirit. By the Word: For of his own will he begat us with the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64164:70"/>
word of truth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18. By the Spirit: For, except a man be born again of
water, and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 5. In
the Word God commands, and promiseth. The command binds man to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit:
The promise is a motive to enforce the performance of the precept. This
we ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> understand and observe in the Call of <hi>Abraham:</hi> For,</p>
               <p>1. He is commanded to get him out of his Countrey, and from his kindred,
and from his Fathers house unto a land that God would shew him; and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him God promiseth to make him a great nation, and to blesse him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But the principall promise was, that in him all the familyes of the earth should
be blessed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 1. 2, 3. This precept implyes that man is under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion
of sin, and Sathan, and therefore commands him to forsake his sin, and
Sathan, and turn from Satan unto God. In this God makes use of the Doctrine
of the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Morall Law as given unto him, and binding him to
perfect, and perpetual obedience, and upon disobedience threatning Death.
And by the precept is discovered mans sin, and by threatning his misery to
humble him, break his heart, make him weary of sin, and desirous of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and willing upon any termes to accept a Saviour. Yet this gives him
no Comfort, nor any Power to do that which is his duty; though God make
use of it to prepare mans heart. The first dutyes commanded, are</p>
               <p>1. A sight of sin, as sin, in our selves, whereby we are miserable. The</p>
               <p>2. Is saith, whereby we believe that God being satisfyed, and attoned by the
blood of Christ, will be mercifull, and pardon sin. This faith presupposeth
knowledge of the promise, and a serious consideration.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That it's God, who promiseth.</item>
                  <item>2. That the thing promised is everlasting life, and all things necessarily
conducing thereunto.</item>
                  <item>3. The termes upon which it is to be obtayned and enjoyed:</item>
               </list>
               <p> And the
principal is, sincerely to submit under the Power, and wholly rely upon the
mercy of God, Redeemer by Christ, for remission of sin, and eternall Salvation,
which Christ hath merited, and God will give. This Remission, and eternall
life are promised for Christs sake, and the Promise it self is made for and in the
consideration of his death, and these things as promised are a mighty motive,
and powerfully work upon the heart of man, to incline it to submission: and if
ever they prevayle, this submission will follow. The promise binds God, gives
hope, moves mans heart, and presents unto the soul the unspeakable benefit
to follow upon the Performance of the duty; and that certainly without any
doubt. This submission presupposeth certain dutyes antecedent, and includes
virtually all Particular dutyes following.</p>
               <p>This word as written in a book,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>VIII</label> or uttered outwardly by man or Angel, may
represent unto sinfull man, both what he must do, and what God upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
will give, and by the senses be conveyed to the soul of man, and cause
him to understand, and approve of the justice of the duty, and excellency of the
benefit promised, and may incline man to some moral submission. Yet such is
the blindnesse of mans understanding, in respect of these heavenly mysteryes,
and perversenesse, and depravation of the will, that without some power to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and rectifie the soul, this word of calling will prove insufficient. Both
this blindnesse and depravation are the greater to such as are at age, by reason
of false notions, and errours, and the habits of sin. Therefore with the word
is required the Spirit, and divine power, not onely to convey the word close
unto the soul, but also to prepare, qualifie, and fit it for the reception and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of the Word. This is evident by the experience of all times: For
the very words of our Saviour Christ, who spake as never man spake, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
his Doctrin not only by his holy life, but by such works as never man
did, or could do, proved not effectuall upon the greatest part of his hearers.

his Spirit within us, and so causing us to walk in his Statutes, and keep his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to do them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. And before this can be effected, he must

Word, and the same more immediate, and in an higher light. This cannot be
done except it free the soul from false notions and errours in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
This sanctification of the heart doth certainly subdue, if not wholly
take away predominant lusts, and elevate and perfect the rationall appetite, by
giving and imparting a divine sense, and Vigour, whereby it more effectually
doth relish heavenly things, but reject and abhorr evil, and sin. I will not
here dispute whether this Spirit be a distinct thing, or power different from the
Word of God, as spoken immediately by himself to the soul of man, or it be the
very same. No doubt, the Word of God, as the word of God, is power. For
as it is said of Thunder naturally, so its true of this Word spiritually: The voyce
of the Lord is powerfull, the Voyce of the Lord is full of Majesty, and it break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Cedars, and shaketh the Wildernesse: So this word, as his, is powerfull,
and full of Majesty, able to break the most stony, and senslesse stubborn heart,
and shake it in pieces: If it come close unto the soul, it cleares the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
dispels the mists, and foggs of errour, pierceth the inward parts, and makes

                  </gap> Reader, nor amaze him with the controversie concerning the manner of
conversion, the resistibility or irresistibility of grace, and the necessitation of
the Will of man. The manner of conversion is to us unsearchable; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are ignorant of the nature of the immortall Soul, and because much
more are we ignorant of the manner of Gods working upon that immortall
Spirit. As for the resistibility or irresistibility of grace, we know that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of God is Almighty, and cannot be resisted by any created strength, if he
please to exercise it to the full, or in some high measure: But if God give power
to the creature, or work by that created power given, it may be resisted by a
contrary created power: And so grace or the power of conversion, as a created
thing in man, may be so given as to be resisted by the Will of man. And both
the understanding of man, will and doth, either deny or doubt of divine truths
represented to the soul, and the Will will wrangle, oppose, and reject, or not
sincerely affect, and submit unto the divine commands, and promises. And
hence, the many conflicts not onely in conversion, but after we are converted.
As for necessitation of the will in this work of divine calling, its certaine, and
granted of all, that the illumination of the understanding may be necessary so
farr as the soul in respect of the same is onely passive, though in the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and judgement concerning the truths represented by the Word it be <hi>active.</hi>
Besides God may give an active power to the Will, and it may be passive in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of it; and also necessitated to an act of complacency in generall, so
that it necessarily may approve by a generall approbation of the justice and
equity of the command, and the excellency of the good promised. For even
a wicked <hi>Medaea</hi> may truly say, <hi>Video Meliora Proboque.</hi> And a simple ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of a thing, as good, much mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

act of approbation, complacency, and volition in generall: and the good repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
may be not onely approved as good in respect of the contrary evill, but
as better in respect of that good which is apprehended as lesse. For it's not

possible to apprehend good, as good, and not approve it because, as <hi>Bradwardine</hi>

blessed as to live in the Church, and enjoy the meanes of conversion dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
to use the meanes, and exercise that power which God hath given
them, and also earnestly and constantly pray for the regenerating Spirit, which
God hath promised to them that seek him in an orderly way. For upon this
done, Regeneration will follow; and by the Divine, and Spiritual power given
them together with Gods speciall assistance, and concurrence, after all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

most willingly submit to God Redeemer, which is the ultimate product of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Vocation: The parts whereof are the outward Word, and the inward pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Spirit which go together, according to the promise of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and make up the <hi>essence</hi> of it. Though its true that for the circumstances,
and accidentalls, the calling of particular men, and severall persons may vary
much: Some are called sooner, some later; some in an ordinary, some in an
extraordinary way; some with lesser, some with greater power; Some with
many afflictions, and long tryalls, some otherwise; some speedily submit, some
stand out long. In all this the divine wisdome ordereth, and disposeth all
things so, as shall be most congruous, and fitting to this work, and the persons
called. Yet this congruity which many talke of, is nothing without the Word,

do, but for the neglect and abuse of that power God had given them. And we
must not thinks but God calls, and that seriously, all those to whom the Gospel is
preached, and is ready to communicate his grace, and by his Spirit works some
preparatory effects which are the same with those he workes in them which are
converted: others call them <hi>Common graces.</hi> And we cannot find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that God denyes his Spirit to such as heare his word, till they give God
cause either by their neglect, or perversnesse, or Apostasie from that degree of
grace they have received to withdraw the same. By all this we understand that
Christ findeth his subjects, to whom God hath given him a right, to be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes,
and he enlargeth as he beginneth his Kingdome by a kind of spirituall
conquest, dashing in pieces all such as will not submit, and are bound to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
with his <hi>Iron Rod</hi> &amp; irresistible strength, reducing the rest unto subjection,
after some time of standing out. Therefore God said unto him; Rule thou in the

Thou shalt break them with a rod of Iron, and dash them in pieces, like a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

of this Kingdom, wherein he manifests his title; declares his just and gracious
commands, threatneth eternal <hi>Punishment,</hi> and promiseth eternall protection
and rewards. And this publication of his Lawes is accompanyed with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
power of his Spirit, whereby together with the word of the Kingdom,
he pierceth the mindes of men, and breaks their stony hearts in sunder, as an
hammer doth a Rock: In this respect the Lord saith, Is not my word like as a

Because by this Vocation,<label type="milestone">

to speak of Election, and Predestination: And,

                     <item>1. I will enquire into the signification of the words.</item>

               </p>
               <p>And, 1. I will not take <hi>Predestination</hi> to be the <hi>Genus of Election,</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi>
as many do; for so it's not used in Scripture. It's true, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies to
determine, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a determination of the Will: and in this general
signification, <hi>Predestination</hi> may signifie a <hi>Pre-determination,</hi> or <hi>Decree,</hi> to <hi>Elect</hi>
or <hi>Reprobate:</hi> But thus we do not find it used in the Book of God.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Predestination,</hi> in Scripture, doth signifie a Decree and Determination of
God's Will, concerning the Eternal Estate of sinful Man, wherein He decrees to
bring him, in a certain Order, by certain meanes, unto Eternal Glory. And
this Decree was made, though not executed, before the Foundation of the
World.</p>
               <p>3. This <hi>Predestination</hi> is in Christ, to Eternal Life, not to Eternal Death, as used
in the <hi>New Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>Predestination,</hi> and <hi>Election,</hi> are sometimes, if not, for the most part, taken
for the same.</p>
               <p>5. When they are differenced, <hi>Election</hi> is a Decree to <hi>Call; Predestination,</hi> a
Decree to <hi>adopt, justifie, glorifie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>Election</hi> is sometimes the same that <hi>Calling</hi> is; sometimes a Decree of
<hi>Calling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Sometimes <hi>Election,</hi> the purpose according to <hi>Election,</hi> and <hi>Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
and <hi>Fore-knowledge</hi> alone, are taken and used for the same. We read that
all things work together for good to them that love God, the called according
to purpose: For whom he did fore know; he also did <hi>Predestinate</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to the Image of his Son, that He might be the first Begotten amongst
many Brethren. Moreover, whom He did <hi>Predestinate,</hi> them He called; whom
He called, them He justified; and whom He justified, them He glorified, <hi>Rom. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
28,</hi> 29, 30. Where we may observe,</p>
               <p>1. That there is a <hi>Calling,</hi> according to a purpose and decree, and that is such,
as upon it follows Conversion, Admission, Justification.</p>
               <p>2. That, in this place, <hi>Fore-knowledge</hi> is distinct from <hi>Predestination,</hi> and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
not onely an Act of the Understanding, whereby God doth fore-know
particular persons before they did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exist; for, in that respect, it's called <hi>Fore-knowledge:</hi>
Nor also what they would act or do under the means of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but an Act of the Will, whereby He did approve, love, elect them freely;
not for any merit of their own, but out of His mere good-will. To KNOW,
in this place, is to elect, or chuse, and seems to be taken from that place of <hi>Amos
3. 2. Thee have</hi> I KNOWN <hi>of all the Families of the Earth.</hi> To know, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Chaldee-Paraphrast,</hi> and <hi>Vatablus</hi> following him, is, to Chuse:
<hi>You have I chosen.</hi> And so likewise <hi>yra,</hi> and <hi>Mercerus</hi> understand it. Yea, the
Apostle himself informs us, that the people fore-known, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 2. are a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
according to the Election of Grace, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. And the Election, that is, the
persons elected, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. So that, to fore-know, is to decree to <hi>Call,</hi> and is the same
with the decree of <hi>Election</hi> strictly taken.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Predestination,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>X</label> in this place, is distinct from <hi>Election,</hi> or <hi>Fore-knowledge,</hi> and
is a decree to justifie, adopt, and glorifie the Elect or Called. For in these words
of the Apostle, <hi>To be conformed to the Image of his Son,</hi> is to be glorified. For
Image, in several places of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> is taken for Glory. <hi>So, O Lord,
when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their Image;</hi> that is, their Glory, <hi>Psal. 73. 20.
When I awake, I shall be satisfied with thy likeness;</hi> that is, thy Glory, <hi>Psal. 17. 15.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64164:72"/>
The similitude of the Lord shall He;</hi> that is, <hi>Moses; behold!</hi> that is, his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 8. In both places, the <hi>Septuagint</hi> turn the word, which signifies,
<hi>likeness,</hi> or <hi>image, glory.</hi> And in the <hi>New Testament, Man is the Image, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God; 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 7. And though not here, yet in another place, God is said
to predestinate us to Adoption, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 15. Where, Adoption may be glory:
for so sometimes it's taken. And it's implyed, That we are Predestinate unto
an Inheritance <hi>ver.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>4. Election <hi>signifies both, when it is written,</hi> That God hath chosen you, <hi>that is,
the</hi> Thessalonians, to Salvation, through Sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of
the truth, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
               <p>5. The Subject of Election, is Man; but not as Man merely, nor as man
made, nor to be made nor as fallen <hi>in massâ corruptâ,</hi> though man may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
under all these notions; but the immediate subject of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination</hi>
is every person, considered in that condition as God shall find him,
when he calls him. For the execution of <hi>Election</hi> begins in that <hi>Calling,</hi> upon
which follows the first sincere Conversion. And because in many, this Calling
goes long before final Faith, as final: Therefore man, as finally believing, is
not the immediate Object of <hi>Election,</hi> though final Believers be the immediate
Subject of Glorification. The first Compilers of the Articles of Subscription
for the <hi>Church of England,</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th His Reign, do understand
<hi>Predestination,</hi> and <hi>Election,</hi> for two distinct and different <hi>Acts of God,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the 17th Article: For they make the Elect to be the Object of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination,</hi>
and imply, that Election is Antecedent to <hi>Predestination.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they meant by <hi>Election</hi> a <hi>Decree</hi> to <hi>Call,</hi> is difficult to determine. Neither
need we trouble our selves in the search thereof, because our Rules is the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and their words are capable of a good sense.</p>
               <p>Thus much may be sufficient for the explication of the words:<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>X</label> The thing
signified by the Words, in the next place, is to be examined. <hi>Election</hi> taken in
the larger sense, both for the Decree of <hi>Calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Predestination</hi> too, may be
defined from 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 13. to be, <hi>A Decree of God,</hi> whereby He determined to
chuse certain persons unto Salvation, through Sanctification of the Spirit, and
Belief of the Truth. Or thus more at large: It is a Decree of God, whereby
He decreed, according to His good pleasure, before the Foundation of the world,
to call certain particular persons; and, by Christ, to justifie and glorifie
them.</p>
               <p>First, the general Nature of <hi>Election</hi> is a Decree. A Decree is an Act of
the Will, that act which we call a determination or resolution to do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and this is an act of God's Will: and according to our manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and the expression of the Scriptures, it doth pre-suppose his counsel
and practical knowledge directing the Will. For we are said to be predestinate
according to the good pleasure of Him, who worketh all things according to the
counsell of his will, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 11. Where observe,</p>
               <p>1. That the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is turned <hi>Purpose,</hi> signifies, sometimes,
<hi>good pleasure,</hi> and so its to be understood there.</p>
               <p>2. That Counsell is antecedent to the Will, and directs the determination
thereof. As the general Act is a Decree: So,</p>
               <p>Secondly the Decree was passed by God before the Foundation of the world,
and the <hi>existence</hi> of things; and in this respect is not onely <hi>Destination,</hi> but <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination.</hi>
Yet this Decree is not properly Eternal, as the <hi>existence</hi> of the <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and the immanent Acts of God upon Himself are.</p>
               <p>3. This Decree was not onely a free act, but an act of free and abundant
grace and mercy in Christ, therefore said to be according to the good pleasure
of His Will, to the praise of the glory of His Grace, wherein He hath made us
accepted in His Beloved, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:64164:72"/>
4. The Object or Subject of this Decree, is sinful man; yet considered, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
by Christ: For otherwise He could not be eligible, or predestinable to
Salvation, and Eternal Glory; seeing that by the first Law of Works transgressed,
he was a <hi>Vessel of Wrath,</hi> and, as such, in no possibility of Salvation: For once
guilty, he was no way <hi>save-able,</hi> but by Christ's <hi>Redemption,</hi> and the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
Therefore we are said to be chosen in Christ; to be predestinate unto
the Adoption of Children by Jesus Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 4, 5. And from hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
that there was no merit in man fore-seen, nor any cause out of God, that
might move God, or determine His Will. The merit of Christ fore-known,
could not necessitate His Will; yea, neither final Faith fore-seen, nor the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
it self of Faith could any ways pre-determine God's Will. But this Will
did freely determine it self both in general to chuse any, and much more to
chuse these or those particular persons. The fore-knowledge of Christ, Faith,
good-works, final perseverance as possible, could not make the Salvation of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
man to be future: for the futurition of it depended merely upon his good
pleasure, yet directed by his Wisdom. And the Object of this Decree was not
man in general, but certain single persons, and the same not onely guilty by
the first Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> but by many other actual sins; even all their actual trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
which they had committed before God's effectual Call, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.
Yet this is to be understood of such as are <hi>Adulti,</hi> and at age before
their Conversion. This is evident, both out of the Epistle to the <hi>Romanes;</hi> but
especially in that to the <hi>Ephesians, Chap.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 11. and that to the <hi>Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
2 Chap.</hi> 2. 13. For we find the subject to be persons, and such as were guilty
not onely of the first sin, but many proper actual sins before their Conversion:
and their <hi>Election</hi> pre-supposeth Christ, the Redemption, the Covenant. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants
inform us, that the Decrees of <hi>Predestination</hi> are these:</p>
               <p>1. A Decree, to give Christ, to redeem sinful man.</p>
               <p>2. A Decree to save all those, who shall sincerely and finally believe in
Him.</p>
               <p>3. A Decree to give grace sufficient, and necessary, and effectual to work
repentance and faith in Christ.</p>
               <p>4. Upon his fore-knowledge of the event of these means administred, to
choose single persons, fore-seen finally to believe. Yet if we will understand,
consider, and speak accurately. The</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Is the Decree of Redemption; The</item>
                  <item>2. Of the Covenant; The</item>

                     </hi> But none of these are the Decree
of <hi>Election.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Nor is the 4th, as delivered by them. Others imagine <hi>Election</hi> to be a
Decree to save certain single persons, without respect to sin, Christ,
the Covenant-grace for keeping the Covenant. And these, for the
most part, make this Decree antecedent to the Decree of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the Covenant. All these forsake the simplicity of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which teach us, that this Decree <hi>essentially</hi> includes single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
the means, the end, and pre-supposeth the Providence, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Man, first innocent in <hi>Adam,</hi> then fallen, afterwards
continuing in sin, till God call him, according to purpose. And also
the Dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ee of sending Christ, of the Redemption by Christ, and of
the <hi>New Covenant.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>5. This Decree hath something of absolute and arbitrary power, according to
that Similitude, <hi>Hath not the Potter power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 21. For as He could have
called and converted all; so He could have decreed to have saved all: yet He
hath done neither. He hath passed by many. And this Prete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ition, which is
rather <hi>Non-Decretum,</hi> than <hi>Decretum</hi> is made by some to be Reprobation. Yet
Reprobation, according to Scripture, is a <hi>Positive Decree;</hi> according to which,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64164:73"/>
God not onely in His absolute power passeth by certain single persons, but also
decrees to order them, according to His Laws and Judgment, unto Eternal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.
That there is such a Preterition, is certain; but that this <hi>Preterition</hi> is
the whose Decree of Reprobation, upon which follows necessarily, and unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably,
Eternal Death, who can evidently prove out of God's Word.</p>
               <p>7. As this Decree of <hi>Election</hi> doth con-note an absolute and arbitrary power
of God's Will; so no reason thereof can be given, but from his good pleasure:
and we must say with the Scripture, <hi>he will have mercy upon whom He will have
mercy; and whom He will, He hardeneth.</hi> Yet in God's Eternal Wisdom, there
may be many Reasons of both, and the same weighty and preponderant perhaps,
though they are concealed, and not made known to us. For there is no act of
Ordination, of intellectual and immortal Creatures unto their final estate of
felicity and misery, that is an act of mere <hi>absolute Power,</hi> as abstracted from all
<hi>Mercy, Wisdom, sustice.</hi> In the execution of the Decree, there is given a plain
reason of the Rejection of the Jew, and that is <hi>Vnbelief,</hi> Rom. 9. 31, 32. &amp; <hi>Chap.
11.</hi> 20. Yet no reason or cause in the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> why God called them, but His
absolute power, free-will, mere grace: yet of their first Rejection, the moral
cause in themselves, was their Idolatry and Apostacy: Yet</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Why did not God prevent the Apostasie of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but reject the
generality of them for two thousand years, and chuse the Jew, and the
Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Jacob,</hi> and continue them His people for
so many hundred years; And</item>
                  <item>2. Why He should reject the Jew, and take away from the generality of
them both the Word of the Gospel, and the Spirit, for these sixteen
hundred years and upward, and chuse the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> And</item>
                  <item>3. Why in the end, He should choose both, in one main Body; no Wit of
man can give a reason. Therefore the Apostle cryes out, <hi>O the depth of
the riches both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God! How unsearchable
are his Judgments, and his ways past finding out!</hi> Rom. 11. 33. Which
place implyes,
<list>
                        <item>1. That there were weighty Reason, why God did thus: for they
were Acts of His profoundest Wisdom.</item>
                        <item>2. That these Reasons to Man, and perhaps to Angels are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable.</item>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>7. These <hi>Decrees</hi> are no ways contrary unto, but exactly agreeing with the
Redemption by Christ, the tenour of the New-Covenant, the Execution, and the
final Judgment, if we truly understand them, as they are revealed in Scripture.

               <p>1. These do not agree unto God; but applyed unto him, derogate from His
glorious Perfections.</p>

be <hi>Aver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oes,</hi> or some other, is falsly understood, and otherwise interpreted, than
the Author first meant it, as <hi>Occam</hi> tells us. For thus some expound it: That
which is the chiefest thing in intention, is, that to which all things in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
are ultimately referred. And what's this to their purpose, who use, or
rather abuse it?</p>
               <p>4. The second is by the School-men, and such as follow them, applyed to the
<hi>Decree of Election</hi> in this manner: That seeing God is the most orderly Agent,
He must needs first intend glory unto sinful man as the end. Secondly, grace as
the means for glory. Yet as that excellent School-man saith well, <hi>That glory is
not the end of God predestinating, but of man predestinated:</hi> and it was indifferent
to him, whether to will Glory the end, or Grace the means, first in order: and
as He gives Grace first, and then Glory, so no doubt He decreed to do so. To say
and affirm, that first God absolutely chose such persons, then decreed to give
them glory; thirdly, that they might attain glory, He intends and decrees to
give them Christ, and grace; are groundless speculations, and the imaginations of
mens hearts, who conceive of God, as they do of themselves. But here we may
truly say, How far are God's thoughts above the thoughts of silly, sinful, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
men? That there are <hi>Decrees of Election,</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> Free-will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and Grace, is evident out of Scripture; and most men, even such as differ
amongst themselves, do grant: but how to reconcile these, hath been the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the subtillest Wits, and is not yet so clearly done, as to satisfie others.
The manner of Conversion, the manner how God fore-knows and decrees all
things, especially the contingent, and free acts of Angels and Men, cannot be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

known by us, neither is it needful. <hi>Scientia media, decreta ex hypothesi,
vocatio congrua,</hi> are much controverted: yet, <hi>Sub judice lis est,</hi> to this day. We
have no perfect notions of God's Knowledge and Decrees, nor of His manner
of Working in the Souls of men: Therefore, it were wisdom to be silent. If
we desire to know our own Election, we must not curiously pry into God's se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Counsels, nor search the Records of Eternity; for that we cannot do: But
let us diligently examine our selves, and if our hearts have been sincerely obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the Heavenly Call, wholly subjected to Christ, and feel the power and
comforts of God's sanctifying and adopting Spirit, having dominion over Sin,
then we may conclude, that our names are registred in Heaven, and enrolled in
the Book of Life, and we are Subjects of this glorious Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Thus you have heard,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XII</label> what Subjection is required by the Fundamental Law
of this Kingdom, and the means whereby we are reduced. And this Subjection
must be free, not forced; sincere, not seigned. It's true, that Man upon the first
Summons and Call will stand out, and be unwilling to change his old Master,
and forsake his bosome sin. Yet such is the power of this Heavenly Call, that in
the end it will prevail. For when the glorious power of the Spirit, with the
purest light of the Gospel, shall penetrate the inmost parts of the Soul, discover
unto him his vile, base, mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Death, the unspeakable Love of God, the bitter Sufferings of Christ, the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of him his Saviour, the great Deliverance from Hell and Eternal Death,
and the blessed and glorious Estate which will follow upon his submission, then
the heart, by the power of Grace, of unwilling, is made most willing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
with all readiness, his Lord as onely Redeemer, and will do any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>After this brief Discourse of <hi>Predestination,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIII</label> which is the first beginning of
man's <hi>Eternal Salvation,</hi> and the <hi>IDEA,</hi> and Model of God's special Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
according to which He calls Converts, admits sinful man, as a subject
of His Kingdom, and directs him unto the full enjoyment of Eternal Peace, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64164:74"/>
also of Calling, whereby this Decree begins to be put in execution, and sinful
Man is reduced; it remains, that we enquire what the condition of man, upon
his sincere submission, proves to be. For this end, we must observe,</p>
               <p>1. That God, according to His absolute power, calls whom He will: For
He is bound to none; and therefore, without any injustice, He may pass by,
not onely particular persons; but whole Nations, yea, the greatest part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
especially upon their demerit.</p>
               <p>2. That to whomsoever He vouchsafeth the means of Conversion, them He
may be truly said to Call.</p>
               <p>3. That the issue and event of this Call is two-fold; for some stand our,
some come in. Those who stand out, either by their secular employments,
Earthly care, and love of the World are kept back: or being spiteful and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious,
oppose, persecute, and murther God's Messengers. As these voluntarily
refuse to submit; so they are for ever shut out of this Kingdom: and all of
them, especially the malicious, wilful Wretches, are counted Rebels, and so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
Enemies, and so to be dealt withall: For here is no different, and third
sort of people, which may be reckoned Neuters: For all are either Subjects, or
Enemies. Of such as come in, some submit in Hypocrisie, some imperfectly,
some with all their hearts sincerely: and the Hypocrites are either gross, or not
so palpable. All this we may learn from that Parable of our Saviour, <hi>Math.
22.</hi> 1, 2, 3. &amp;c. Of those who submit, is made the visible Church on Earth,
which universally considered, since the first publication of the Gospel to all
Nations, are,</p>
               <p>1. Christians.</p>
               <p>2. Reduced into several Societies and Flocks, for Doctrine and Worship,
over which are set Ministers; and their Priviledges, are Word and Sacraments.
And the Universal Church, in all the several parts of the World, wheresoever
they are dispersed, make one Political, and Organical Body, and are all subject
to Christ their Head; and to their Ministers, as His Officers. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
the Government of the Church is Monarchical: And as the Word and
Sacraments are Priviledges of the <hi>Universal Church;</hi> so Ministers rightly and
du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y called are Officers of the same. And we are first Subjects unto Christ, and
Members of the great Body, before we be Members of this, or that particular
Church. But of this I have spoken in another Treatise.</p>
               <p>3. They are associated for Discipline, the end whereof is to preserve the
Doctrine and Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ship pure, and the body free from scandalous and infecting
Members. The Power of the <hi>Church</hi> thus associated is four-fold.</p>
               <p>1. To declare and constitute Canons.</p>
               <p>2. To make Officers.</p>
               <p>3. To exercise <hi>Jurisdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. To dispose of the <hi>Churches</hi> stock, made up of the <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Benevolence</hi>
of the People. This power is in the whole <hi>Church</hi> and Body associated. It's exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
by Officers chosen and constituted, according to the Rules of Christ for
that purpose. The acts of <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> are to admonish, suspend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
or absolve, according as they shall see just cause. The whole <hi>Church</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
may trust one man, or more, with a general inspection, without giving any
jurisdiction. Many particular Congregations, instituted for Worship, may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociate
into one Body for Discipline: and then the power is not derived from
the particular Congregations to the whole; but from the whole Association to
the Parts. These <hi>Associations</hi> may be of too narrow, or too vast an extent, of
too small a number, or too great a multitude. And the Parts and Members
are most fitly united, and conveniently disposed by vicinity of Habitation. These
particulars, I have at large made evident, according to my Talent, out of the
Scripture, in a former distinct Discourse. All these Associations, the great and
glorious Lord Redeemer makes use of, in administration of His Kingdom. But
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64164:74"/>
one onely part of these make up the Body of His Spiritual Kingdom, which shall
inherit the Eternal Glory of the same; and they are such as submit at the first
sincerely, and with their whole heart. Yet there be degrees of this Subjection;
and the best may and must improve their submission, until their corruptions be
fully subdued, and they perfectly sanctified. For before, they are not capable of
full communion with their God, and the perfect enjoyment of Eternal Peace.
Besides, there be several degrees of Preparation, before we attain to sincere sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and admission into this blessed <hi>Common-wealth of Israel.</hi> The condition
of such as sincerely acknowledge their Soveraign and Lord Redeemer, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
here in this life, and glorious hereafter. For the present, as they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Subjects unto God their Father; so they who were far off, are made
nigh, and by Christ have access, by one Spirit, to the Father: are no more stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Forreigners, but Fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and Houshold of
God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 13, 18, 19. And by reason of this union with God the Father, and
Jesus Christ, and the Saints, they are become the Temples of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi>
and being washed in their Saviours bloud, are the adopted Sons of God, the
Heirs of Glory come under the Divine Protection, and have a general right to
all those Mercies and Blessings which Christ hath purchased, and God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
as shall more particularly be shewed hereafter. For as this Subjection is
virtually all obedience, so it receives a right to all Blessings limited to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of several Duties. And before I conclude this great Duty you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this one thing, that this Subjection is that whereby we submit our selves
to Christ, and so to God, not onely as King, as some conceive, but to Him, as our
onely Priest, for expiation and intercession; and also to Him as our onely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
to teach us not onely outwardly by the Word written, but inwardly by the
Spirit.</p>
               <p>From this Subjection,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIV</label> we understand what the nature of the Church as visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and of the Church mystical, as consisting of real Saints, is. The Church, in
general, is a Society, or community of all such as subject themselves to <hi>God-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi>
by Jesus Christ. The Church-mystical is the community of such
as subject themselves sincerely unto <hi>GOD-REDEEMER.</hi>
So that this Subjection is the very essence of the Church. To believe, and
subject to Christ to come, and to Christ already come is accidental: So to be
National, or Universal, is, To be under a Form of Discipline, or to be without
any setled outward Government, is not essential: nor to be militant or trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
(though it as such and such, differs much) is of the <hi>Essence.</hi> To be Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
and Strangers on this Earth, seeking an abiding City in Heaven, and to be
militant fighting against the Devil, the World, and the Flesh, is the condition of
this Society in this life. To obtain a final and full Victory over Sin, and be secure
of Eternal Bliss, is in some measure an estate of triumph. But to rise again, be
immortal, and fully glorified in one full body, after that all Enemies are totally
and eternally subdued, is the most perfect triumph. And this is the Order that
God hath decreed and established, that first we must be militant, obey and suffer
in an estate of Humiliation, till we prove finally victorious; and after that, we
must except a reward, and a Crown of Glory, which in due time we shall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receive. So Christ, our Head, was first humbled, afterwards exalted, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the Cross to the Crown; so must, we His members, do. In this life we
must be consecrated, and in the life to come, we shall be compleat Kings and
Priests, and reign with our Saviour, and serve in the glorious Temple of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
These two conditions differ much, and very much; yet the difference is not
essential, but accidental. Thus far the constitution of this Kingdom, in the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
of <hi>God-Redeemer,</hi> and subjection of sinful Man redeemed and called.</p>

               <p>This administration for the substance was the same alwayes, and it began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
even in the dayes of <hi>Adam,</hi> after that promise of the seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which should break the Serpents head. Yet there was a great difference,
in the same, in many things after that Christ was exhibited and glorified, from
that which was before. Yet in all times, God as Redeemer was the supreme
Lord and King; man sinfull, the subject; Faith, and subjection to Christ, the
Law; and the judgment was according to that Law. And though the humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Son of God to be made man was yet to come, and Christ onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and represented in the promise, yet as this humiliation was accepted from
the beginning for the benefit of man, so that power which was alwayes virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in God, was exercised by the word not incarnate, and by the Spirit, as though
it had been acquired already. That this administration began so early, might
be made evident from severall texts of Scripture rightly understood. Neither
was the promise of Christ made first to <hi>Abraham:</hi> for this promise was passed
in the sentence of the Devill. The Sacrifices and offerings of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi>
taught them, and used before by their Father, and instituted by God, did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
the same. That they were instituted by God the acceptation of <hi>Abel's</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
doth prove: For no service is accepted of God which is not instituted
by God. The Faith of <hi>Enoch</hi> whereby he pleased God was Faith in Christ:
otherwise he could not have sought God, so as to have found him, nor expected,
or received so glorious a reward, but by the merit of his Saviour believed upon.
Without this faith <hi>Noah</hi> could not have been the heir of the righteousnesse
which is by faith, and partaker of that eternall deliverance, which was typifyed
by his deliverance from the flood. This administration after the time of
<hi>Abraham</hi> was more clear. Yet God had his Kingdome, and his Church long
before: yet he did administer the same without any <hi>Vice-gerent</hi> or President ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
except some emine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t, and principall Angel was his universal deputy, as
was hinted formerly. Yet in the Church on earth God by his Word eternal,
and the Spirit in the Patriarchs, and extraordinary Prophets, did supply Christs
propheticall office, and by them at certain times made known the lawes and
judgements of his Kingdom: but ordinarily he used for this purpose ordinary
teachers. Yet besides these he gave the Spirit of Prophecy to the Angels, and
by them he instructed Patriarchs, and other Prophets. His Sacerdotall office
was executed by the Patriarches, the first born of the familyes, and at length
by the Leviticall Priests, and they were typicall mediators between God and
man. The most eminent Priest &amp; lively Type of Christ both as King, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
as Priest was <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> who lived at <hi>Salem,</hi> in the day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
He was a righteous King, who by the just administration of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
procured the peace and prosperity of his subjects, when the neighbour-Countryes
were invalded, and spoiled by War. In this respect he did represent
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64164:75"/>
this King of perfect righteousnesse, and eternal peace. And as a Priest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had
no predecessour from whom, nor successour to whom he might derive his Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal
power; For he was not a Priest by birth, nor did he transmit his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
by death unto another, as the Leviticall Priests did. And in this respect
he might be truly said to be without Father, and Mother, and descent, so as to
receive his Priesthood that way, and without end of dayes, and so was the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
of all others to represent that Priest Jesus Christ, who had no Predecessour,
from whom he might derive his right, nor successour, because he live in Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his people, and blesse them with spiritual, and eternall blessings. And the
Throne and Scepter of <hi>David,</hi> and his successours in his Kingdome did shadow
him, whose Throne is for ever, and ever, and his Scepter a right Scepter. Faith
and obedience to pure morals to be performed to God Redeemer, by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of the renewing Spirit, were alwayes required by the Lawes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
for the Lawes of Faith, and obedience to pure Morals were alwayes the
same. Yet to these Lawes of Faith, and obedience in pure morals were added
from the beginning divers positive and ceremoniall precepts, especially that of
sacrifice. And when the promise of the <hi>Messias</hi> to descend of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

command to be administred to Infants born in the Church. When <hi>Israel</hi> came

But after that the posterity of <hi>Abraham, Isacc, Jacob,</hi> being multiplyed into a

upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> they entred into a solemn Covenant with their God. He
promiseth to be their God, to protect, and blesse them, and they engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
solemnly to be his loyall subjects. Upon this Foundation of a Kingdom
once layd, God proceeds as their Lord, and Soverenig to give them morall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
ceremoniall Lawes. In the morall he reduceth all morall dutyes to
certain heads, in a brief, exact, and excellent method: in the Ceremonials he
reduceth all former rites, and ceremonials Instituted by himself into order, and
adds many more, as he saw convenient for that people in that time. In the
judicials he dilivered them a perfect body of the civill Law. These judicials were
for direction in judgment, and the adminstration of their civil state. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls
and ceremonials were for the Church, and looked far higher. The moralls
tended to give them a more perfect knowledge of morall dutyes, to be a rule
of moral obedience, to let them see their inability to keep it, their impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to be justified by it, to make them sensible of their sin, and seek a Saviour,
who should deliver them from the curse, and paenaltyes threatned by the Law,
and deserved by their disobedience. The ceremonial was more mysticall: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and cause them to long for their <hi>Messias,</hi> who should free them from those dark
and mysterious shadows, give them a clearer and more glorious light, and a
perfect liberty and ease from this <hi>servitude.</hi> This time was the time of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
and minority of the Church: for as the Heyr so long as he is a Child dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
nothing from a Servant, though he be Lord of all, but is under Tutours
and governours, untill the time appointed of the Father: So they, when they
were Children, that is, under age, were in bondage under the elements of the
world. But when the fullnesse of that time, that was appointed by God their
Father was come, God sent his Son made of a Woman, made under the law to
redeem them that were under the law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore after that, they were
no more Servants, but sons, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 7. The time of the Gospel,
therefore, is a time of emancipation, and liberty, not onely from the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials,
but from the curse, and servitude of the law of works, which that law of
<hi>Moses</hi> did threaten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and could no wayes free them from it. For in that law
there was no promise of the Spirit to enable them, for to obey the morall law;
nor of pardon, though they did transgresse it. Neither was there any Sacrifice,
Priest or Service that could expiate sin, and purge the conscience from dead
Works: For though their expiations, lustrations, and purifying ceremonyes
might free them from legall pollutions, yet from sin they could not.</p>
               <p>This covenant was not the same with that of the seed of the Woman,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> which
should break the Serpents head, nor with the same renued more explicitly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Abraham;</hi> That in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed;
much lesse was it the same with the promises of the Gospel made in Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.
And by the way we may take notice that the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. puts a
difference between the Promise, the Law, &amp; Faith. The promise looks at Christ
to come, and was made more particularly to <hi>Abraham.</hi> The Faith is the same
with the Gospel, and looks at Christ already come. This law comes in between,
along time after the promise, and a longer time before the Gospel. And one
end why it entred in between both, was, that sin might abound, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 20. and
it was added because of transgression, till the seed, that is Christ, should come:
and before Faith that is Christ and the Gospel came, they were kept under the
Law, shut up unto the Faith, which should afterwards be revealed. So that the
Law was their School-Master, or Tutour unto Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. 23. 24. By
all this we may easily understand that this Law, and Covenant made onely with
the Jew, of whom Christ was to come, considered as God intended it, was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
against the Promise, nor the Gospel, but subordinate to both. And though
it was not the same with the Law of works given to <hi>Adam</hi> innocent, yet it had
much affinity with it. For it's said, Do this and live; and, Cursed is every one,
that continueth not in all things, written and contained in it: yet it promised
no power to observe it, nor pardon if not observed, as was said before. And
the Jew was much mistaken, when he conceived that it made voyde the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
For the Covenant which was confirmed before of God in Christ, the
Law which was 430. yeares after, could not disannull, that it should make the
promise of none effect. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. If it had been given for to give life, it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
had made voyd the promise: But that was not God's intention in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Law. And the regenerate Saints of God, who lived under the Law
were sanctified justified, and saved, not by vertue of the Law, but of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
confirmed of God in Christ. The law was proper to the Jew, and Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes
incorporated into that state and Church, and bound them, and no others
unto the Ceremonialls to be performed by them in the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And
though the moral law doth alwayes bind all men to obedience upon certain
terms, yet it was given in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> to them alone, and in special relation
unto them, as appeares by that preface to the decalogue, I am the Lord thy God,
which brought thee out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the house of Bondage. The law is
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64164:76"/>
called the law of workes, and the first Covenant in respect unto the Gospel,
preached first unto the Jew, and to be renned unto them in the latter
dayes.</p>
               <p>From all this,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> it is apparent, that from the times of <hi>Adam,</hi> after that God had
said, The seed of the Woman shall bruise the Serpent's head, the fundamentall
lawes of God-Redeemer were the same. After that <hi>John Baptist</hi> appeared in the
Wildernesse, God began to administer this Kingdome in a different manner.
For all the Prophets, and the law prophesied unto <hi>John, Math.</hi> 11. 14. He
was the <hi>Horizon,</hi> as some expresse it between the Old and New Testament.
<hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets foretold Christ more darkly, and at a great distance:

                     </item>
                     <item>5. Upon the Baptism of our Saviour, he discovers him to the people,
and perswades his disciples to believe in him, and gives an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
testimony of him. Yet these things neither tooke away the
law, nor brought in the Gospel, but were a preparative for the
same.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>After that Christ was initiated by Baptism,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> and entred into his Office, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to act publickly. He baptiseth, teacheth the Doctrin of the Kingdom,
more clearly reveales the mysteryes of Heaven, gathereth Disciples, ordaines
Apostles, adds 70 Assistants to them, layes the foundation of the Church Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and by his miracles manifests himself to be the Son of God, and Saviour
of the world. Yet all this was done in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and amongst his
own People. For he was sent first to gather the lost sheep of <hi>Israel.</hi> Thus he
continued to administer the Kingdom in his own person till his death. After
and immediately upon his Resurrection, he receives universall power, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests
himself to his Apostles, and many of his Disciples, gives commission to
his Apostles to go and preach to all Nations, after that he had given them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
and commanded them to stay at <hi>Jerusalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> till he should send down
the Holy-Ghost, and begins to exercise his universall power. And, so that
administration which shall continue to the end of the World without alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
did commence.</p>
               <p>But before I speak of this more particularly,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> order requires, that I say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his Exaltation, which as the Scripture informs us was a reward of his
humiliation: For because he taking upon him the forme of a Servant became
obedient unto death, the death of the Crosse, therefore God exalted him, and
gave him a name above every name, <hi>&amp;c. Philip.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10. This exaltation
was properly in respect of his humane nature: For as he that exalted him was
God, so the nature exalted was Man. The Power of the Godhead was infinite
and eternall, and could neither be increased, nor communicated. The Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Christ is made by many to be the first degree of his exaltation. Yet
this considered in it self did give him no power, but it freed him from mortality
and all kind of sufferings, and by it he was made immortall. Yet instantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his resurrection he was made an everlasting Priest and King, and ready and
fit as a Priest to Minister, and as a King to reign in Heaven. This Resurrection
for the manner was glorious and wonderfull, and for the manifestation of it full

and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of his grave was tumbled away; an Angel descends with a glorious
light, the guard that kept the Sepulcher was terrified and fled, the bodyes of
the dead aro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e out of their graves, and divers of the Saints, raised up together
with Christ, did appear in the Holy City. Thus did God manifest the working
of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from
the dead, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 19, 20. This manner of Resurrection became him who
was the first fruits of them that slept, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20. and the head of all those
which rise again to glory: and his rising is a pattern of the universall Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
God is said in many places to have raised him from the dead, yet so,
that his own immortall soul might have some hand in that work. For he had
power to lay down his life, and power to take it up again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 18. He did
not rise to dy again as <hi>Lazarus</hi> did, but to be immortall. For being raised
from the dead, he dyeth no more; death hath no more dominion over him,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 9. The time of his Resurrection was no sooner, that he might appear
to be dead and no later, lest his Disciples Faith, already shaken, should have
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ayled. This day was a day of greater blisse and glory, then any since the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
It was the beginning of the new World, and the foundation of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Sabbath celebrated in all times since, by the universall Church in memory
of this blessed and glorious work. This was his justification, the confirmation
of his satisfaction and merit, and Gods acception of that great sacrifice; and
an absolute Conquest of death, which is the last enemy to be subdued in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
of the Saints, who are his Church. By this also sin, and Satan received a
fatall wound; and Regeneration, and the hope of eternall glory depend upon
the same. They depend upon it not onely in respect of divine institution, but
because as he had merited, so he received a power to regenerate all such as
should believe in him, and to raise them up to eternall Life. For, to whomsoever
he gives his Regenerating Spirit in this Life, that very Spirit once dwelling in
us, is an evidence and assurance that we shall rise again to glory. For if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in us; He that raised up
Christ from the dead, shall also quicken our mortall bodyes by his Spirit that
dwelleth in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11.</p>
               <p>The manifestation was full and clear,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> and for this end he stayed 40. dayes
on earth after his resurrection. His body was now become spirituall, and
could appear when, and to whom he pleased. And he appeares. 1. To <hi>Mary
Magdalene.</hi> 2. To two Disciples going to <hi>Emaus.</hi> 3. To <hi>Cephas.</hi> 4. To
the twelve. 5. To 500 Brethren together. 6. to <hi>James.</hi> 7. To all the
Apostles, and that, severall times. <hi>Thomas</hi> must not onely see him but
with his hands, and fingers feel the print of the nailes, and the scars of
his wounds. They eat, and drink with him, receive instructions, and commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from him, and see him taken up into Heaven. <hi>Steeven, Paul,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the
Divine, see him after he was ascended into Heaven. The Souldiers, who were
set to guard the Sepulcher are forced to be witnesses as of death, so of his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
The comming down of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles, the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
done, the gifts of the Spirit received in his name, &amp; the Faith of the world
in him do testifie the same. So that there can be no reason in the world to doubt
of this Resurrection. The persons to whom he most of all appeared were the
Apostles, to whom he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible
proofs, being seen of them 40. dayes, and speaking of the things pertayning to
the Kingdome of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 3. And the reason hereof was this, that they might
be witnesses to him both in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and in all <hi>Judea,</hi> and in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and
unto the uttermost parts of the earth, <hi>verse.</hi> 8. And its remarkable that he severall
times appeared on the first day of the week as though he intended not onely by
his Resurrection, but his several apparations to consecrate and honour that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:64164:77"/>
After that Christ was risen,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> and had continued fourty dayes on earth, he
takes with him, to Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> his Disciples, gives them commission to go
to all Nations, promiseth the Spirit, blesseth them, and, in their sight, from
that place ascends into Heaven in a cloud. For the Angels which appeared unto
them in the likenesse of two men in white apparell, told them that he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up into Heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 10, 11. This Ascension added nothing to his
power, though it might be a part of his Glory and Honour. The place from
whence he ascended was the Mount of <hi>Olivet,</hi> at the foot whereof he suffered so
much in his bitter Agony, where he was betrayed, apprehended, &amp; deserted. The
place to which he did ascend was Heaven, the highest, and most glorious place
in the world. For he ascended far above all Heavens to fulfill all things, <hi>Eph.
4.</hi> 19. The manner of this Ascension was glorious, and by way of <hi>Triumph:</hi>
For, accompanied with Angells, he led <hi>captivity</hi> captive, and gave gifts to men,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 18. And, no doubt, hee made open shew of the Principalityes and
Powers of Hell, which he had conquered. It was the greatest, and most stately,
Triumph that ever was in the World. Great was the joy of Angells, and the
Honour of that day wherein the Son of God, mounted in his triumphant chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,
a bright and glorious cloud, ascended into that glorious place, where, in his
Fathers presence, he, after his biter sufferings, hath fullnesse of joy, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
for ever more! Where he hath taken possession of those blessed mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of eternall rest, not onely for himself but in our behalf. And, Oh that
our minds were lifted up above the world, and our affections so placed that we
might seek those things above, where he sitteth at his Fathers right hand; that
we might have a certain hope, that one day he would descend, from that holy
place, and take us with him, that we might be where he is, and so behold his
Glory, and be eternally freed from all sin and sorrow. And surely, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him, it was expedient he should depart, and leave this Earth, not onely
for his own Glory but for our comfort, that he might send down his Spirit to
sanctify, comfort, and guide us into all truth, <hi>Daniel</hi> saw in his Night-Vision, &amp;
behold, one like the Son of man came in the clouds of Heaven, and approached
to the ancient of dayes, and the Angells brought him neer before him. This
Vision was fulfilled in this Ascension, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 13. The Heaven of Heavens
was the fittest place, not onely for his enjoyment of eternall pleasures; but it
was a stately Pallace from whence he might exercise his universall Power, and
administer his eternall Kingdom, and be ettended, and guarded, by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
powers. For the Chariots of God are twenty thousands, even many
thousands, and he is in the midst of them, as in <hi>Sinai,</hi> even in the holy place,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 17. There he, as a Priest, for ever liveth to make intercession for
us, and continues our Advocate to plead our cause, and make it good before
his Fathers Tribunal.</p>
               <p>After that Christ ascended into Heaven,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>VIII</label> God set him at his right hand. For
God said unto him, <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, till I make thine Enemies thy Foot-stool.</hi>
To sit at God's right Hand is to reign as King: So the Apostle expounds
it 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 25. Therefore by those words we understand, that the highest
degree of Honour and Power, next unto God, was solemnly conferred upon
him, and he was instantly to begin to exercise the same. The Angells and all
things, were subjected unto, and put under, his power: and he became <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrator-Generall</hi>
of this spirituall and everlasting Kingdom. This Power was
given him before; For he said that All Power in Heaven &amp; Earth was given him
whilst he was on Earth. Yet now in Heaven he receivs full Possession, and
was solemnly crowned, and enthroned, before all the Angells and the Host of
Heaven, by vertue of these Words: <hi>Sit thou at my right Hand.</hi> He was made
Law-giver and Judge, and could bind men to obedience or punishment, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64164:78"/>
judge them accordingly, and determine of their final and eternal estates, so as to
give them eternal rewards, or afflict them with eternal punishments. This
was part of <hi>Daniel's</hi> Vision: For when one, like the Son of Man, was brought
neer before the ancient of days, there was given Him <hi>Dominion and Glory,</hi> and a
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> that all People, Nations, and Languages, should serve Him: His
Dominion is an everlasting Dominion, which shall not pass away; and His
Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</p>
               <p>The success and issue of His <hi>Administration,</hi> was a final Victory over all
Enemies, and a total subduing of all opposite and contrary Powers: and also the
Eternal Peace and Felicity of His loyal and obedient Subjects. As upon His
Entrance into the glorious place of Heaven, His everlasting Kingdom was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in His hands; so His Priest-hood was made an everlasting Priest-hood,
and confirmed upon Him by a Solemn Oath. For God sware unto Him, and
would not alter, <hi>That He should be a Priest for ever after the Order of Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck:</hi>
So that now He is made <hi>Vniversal, Supream, Eternal King</hi> and <hi>Priest;</hi>
and as He is next unto God, by <hi>Personal Union,</hi> so He is by <hi>Power.</hi> Ten dayes
were spent in this Solemnity and the Preparation for the <hi>Administration</hi> of this
Kingdom: and upon the 10th day after His Ascension the Holy Ghost was sent
down from Heaven upon the Apostles, and the Son of God made Man, having
by Death acquired this Power, and now received it, began by the Holy Ghost to
exercise the same.</p>
               <p>After that Christ was exalted,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>IX</label> and thus glorified, the <hi>Administration</hi> differed
much. For Christ, as King, sends down the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles,
and so makes New Officers, new Laws, and executeth judgment accordingly.
As Prophet, reveals clearly and fully the great Mystery of the Gospel. As
Priest, begins His intercession in Heaven. He begins this <hi>Administration</hi> in
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the first tender of Eternal Life by Him, as Saviour, is made to the
Jew. For the Rod of His Power must go out of <hi>SION.</hi> So it was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
of old. He abolisheth the Temple-Worship: and for the sin of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
destroys the Temple and the City, and both lye desolate to this day. And
He not onely took away the Customs and Rites of <hi>Moses,</hi> but all mystical and
typical Ceremonies and Sacrifices, used from the times of <hi>Adam;</hi> and also the
Sacraments of Circumcision, and the Passover. The Levitical Priests and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and all such as served in the Temple, or in the Tabernacle, He removed.
In stead of the Sacraments of Circumcision and the Passover, He instituted the
Sacrament of Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord: Of Baptism, as a Solemn
Rite of Regeneration, and admission into His Kingdom; the Lords Supper, as a
Rite of Commemoration, of the great Sacrifice of His Death, and of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of their subjection unto Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and communion amongst themselves. His
Territory is enlarged: For He takes in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and all Nations, unto the
ends of the Earth. The Synagogue Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Moral-Services remained: yet this was to be performed unto God, in the
name of Christ glorified. And now they were neither bound to worship in
the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> nor in the <hi>Temple,</hi> according to the words
of our Saviour, to the Woman of <hi>Samaria: Believe me, the hour cometh, when ye
shall neither in this Mountain nor in</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>worship the Father,</hi> Joh. 4. 41. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we may worship and pray every where, lifting up holy hands without wrath
&amp; doubting, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. The Officers, in stead of the former Priests and Prophets,
ordinary, and extraordinary, are Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists, Pastours
and Teachers. The extraordinary, besides Prophets and Evangelists, were the
Apostles, who being Universal Officers, invested with transcendent power, laid
the Foundation of the <hi>Church-Christian,</hi> not onely amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the

in the use of the Keyes, this is no place to speak of particularly. So that now,
by Christ glorified, all Laws are made and published; all judgment exercised, all
Officers ordained. By Him, as a Priest, all Petitions, Thanksgivings, Praises,
Doxologies, Services, are presented to the Father, and to be performed in His
Name. Nay, Glory and Worship are given by the Universal Church to God
and the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 13. &amp; 7. 10. By Him all Pardons and Spiritual Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
are dispensed and disposed of: and all the Promises are performed by
Him, and in His Name, and for His merit. No man can come unto the Father,
but by Him, nor any service be accepted, but for His sake. By Him, we have
access into His Fathers presence, and by Him we come with boldness and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
unto the Throne of Grace. And this <hi>Administration</hi> shall not be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but shall continue, till Death shall be destroyed; and then Christ shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

               <head type="sub">Concerning the Parts of the Administration and the Laws.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Administration</hi> in particular follows, and it refers either to Enemies,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>I</label>
or Subjects. In respect of the end of this Administration, and the ultimate
Effect, it's safety and preservation; and the same, in the end, is full and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Peace. The <hi>Church,</hi> which is the number, and Society of God's loyal and
sincere Subjects, hath always had Her Enemies. How else could she be mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant?
And if not first militant, how could she prove in the end victorious and
triumphant. The principal Enemy is the Devil, the old Serpent, ever since God
put emnity between him and the Seed of the Woman. His design is their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
and Eternal Ruine: and his opposition is very terrible, and so violently
managed with such power and policy, that nothing but destruction could be
expected, but that God is our defence, and by Jesus Christ, our General, will
not onely defend us, but dash in pieces all his power. His Instruments and
Agents are wicked men without, or Hypocrites within the <hi>Church:</hi> The one,
are like Forreign; the other, like Domestick and Intestine Foes. The one, by
Persecution without; and the other, by Heresies, Schisms, and Scandals within,
assault us. Both these have a great advantage, because of our corruptions in
our Bowels.</p>
               <p>The greatest hurt God suffers them to do us, is, to chastise us, and exercise our
Spiritual Graces, and Heavenly Vertues. And Death it self, whether Natural,
because of the first sin, or violent from them, can but destroy our bodies for a
time, which God will raise again; but they cannot take away our Eternal
Estate, nor deprive us of Eternal Glory. Nay, such is the Wisdom of God, that
He can order all their opposition, so as it shall further, and not hinder our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
and such will be His care of us, out of His dear and tender love unto
us, that it shall actually tend unto, and end in our everlasting peace. And in the
end, all Enemies shall be subdued; Death, the last Enemy, shall be destroyed.
The Devil, and all his Angels, with all his Agents, shall be cast into the Lake of
Fire and Brimstone, there to be tormented for evermore. This shall be done,
in Justice and in Judgment. And after this follows our Eternal Peace and
Triumph, and we shall be Kings and Priests, and reign with God for ever. This

Saints, and their glorious Victories mentioned in the Scripture, would require
a whole Volume, and be an excellent Subject of some <hi>Sacred Pen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As this <hi>Administration</hi> refers to the <hi>Church,</hi> the Subjects of <hi>God-Redeemer,</hi> by
<hi>Christ;</hi> the Parts thereof are,
LAWES,
<hi>And</hi>
JVDGMENT.</p>
               <p>For as there be two Branches of this Supream Power; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> the one, of <hi>Legislati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and the other of <hi>Jurisdiction:</hi> so the Parts of this <hi>Administration,</hi> which
is the Exercise of this two-fold Power, are Laws, or rather, giving of Laws,
or judging according to these Laws. For these Laws, are the Rules of this <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration</hi>
of the Subjects Duty, and of God's Judgment; as the Judgment puts
the Laws in execution, according to the obedience, or disobedience of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>Concerning these Laws, we may observe</p>
               <p>1. That they bind the Conscience, and the Immortal Souls, to obedience;
and make men, upon their disobedience liable not onely to Temporal, but Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and Eternal Punishments. And in Judgment, God takes cognizance of
all causes, even the most secret and spiritual, and rewards and punisheth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Church</hi> was never without these Laws, since God made the first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Christ.</p>
               <p>3. They were made known, and promulgate before the Exhibition of Christ,
by Angels and Men; and by men either immediatly inspired, as by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Prophets, or by ordinary Prophets, Priests, and other Teachers. The <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi>
which we call the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> was once delivered by God, in wonderful
manner, upon <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi> And after Christ was exhibited, they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated
by Christ, His Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists; and, after that, by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Pastours and Teachers. The Gospel began to be made known by our
Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>4. They are delivered to us, and reserved in the Church by Word and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>5. They are not bare Precepts, Prohibitions, Threatnings, and Promises, but
have annexed many Admonitions, Reproofs, Exhortations, Dehortations, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Denunciations of Judgments, and Examples. The Examples are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Historical Part; and they set before us the Obedience and Vertues of
some, and their Rewards, with the Disobedience, Apostacy, Rebellions of
others, and their Punishments. And all these are further illustrated by Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and Similitudes; and the same Commands and Prohibitions repeated of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in several parts of the Scriptures. The final and universal Judgment, with
many other particulars of this <hi>Administration,</hi> we may read in the Prophetical
Part.</p>
               <p>6. All these are Laws of <hi>God-Redeemer,</hi> who doth not expect from sinfull
man, perfect and perpetual Obedience, nor promise Eternal Life upon that
condition, but upon the Faith of Christ's Satisfaction and Merit.</p>
               <p>7. They presuppose man sinful, and destitute of all power to observe them.
Therefore, they require obedience, by way of Return, to be performed by the
power of the Spirit, merited by Christ, and restored in great mercy unto us. And
which is strange, Obedience, as Obedience, and performed by us, gives us no
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64164:79"/>
Title unto everlasting life: For it's derived by the Promise of God, from the
merit of Jesus Christ; from, and for which, we receive our Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>8. Some of these Laws were Temporary, and to stand in force onely for a
time: Some perpetual, and after they were once given to continue unto the
Worlds end.</p>
               <p>These Laws must be considered,</p>
               <p>1. As a Rule of Man's Duty.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label>
               </p>
               <p>2. Of God's Judgment: In respect of the Commands, they bind man to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and are the Rule thereof: In respect of the Promises and Threatnings, they
are the Rule of God's Judgment. As they are the Rule of Man's Duty, they
are either <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Positive.</hi> The Moral require, or presuppose Subjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, not onely as Creatour, but Redeemer, in the first place. The Moral Law,
as such, is of perpetual obligation, and was given to <hi>Adam</hi> innocent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
in force for ever yet, as it is purely <hi>Moral.</hi> Yet the obligation thereof,
which followed the Promise of the Redeemer, differed much from the former,
as it bound <hi>Adam</hi> innocent, as shall appear hereafter at large.</p>
               <p>This Law is called Moral, not merely, because it's <hi>Regula morum,</hi> a Rule of
Humane Actions, for so other Laws may be; but to distinguish it from Laws
Positive, as Judicial, and Ceremonial be; and because the Acts commanded by
it are intrinsecally just. For we must not so much attend to the proper signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as the use of words. And it's so called, not by the Prophets, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
but by Latine Christian Writers, especially of later times. The reason why
it is of perpetual obligation, is, because God having made man righteous, and
holy, never gave him liberty to be unrighteous, and unholy: and He always
bound him to love his God, himself, his neighbour. The Duties thereof arise
from the Natural Relation of Man unto God, and unto his Neighbour; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called the <hi>Law of Nature.</hi> The very frame and constitution of his reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and immortal Soul, and of his Body, did dictate the Equity and Justice of
this Law. Some therefore say, that this Law did result from the Image of God,
wherein Man was created. Yet there are degrees of Morality: For some acts
are more immediately <hi>Moral:</hi> Others derive their Morality from some other,
and are such at second hand. In the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> all the Commandements de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
their <hi>Morality</hi> from the first: And all the Precepts of the second Table,
receive their Morality from the last, as that receives Morality from the first of
the first Table. Some are Moral in this life, which shall cease to be so in the
life to come. And we must diligently consider what Duties are purely Moral,
and of perpetual continuance. Consider the matter of this Law, as consisting
in so many Rules or Propositions of Divine Wisdom and Justice, as abstracted
from the Nature of a Law, and the commands of God's <hi>Legislative Will,</hi> and the
same known unto man; if he act according to these Rules, he may be capable of
reward, yet can have no title to it; if he act contrary, he may be worthy of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
yet not bound to suffer it. But consider the Parts and Branches of it
not onely as Rules and Acts of the Understanding, but of Gods <hi>Legislative Will,</hi>
so they have the form of Laws, and such God's Will hath determined them to
be unto Man. The nature of them, as Laws, is to bind unto obe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ience, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
disobedience unto punishment. This is that which they call <hi>active obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which is the essential act of a Law. Passive obligation, whereby Man is
bound, flows necessarily from the <hi>essence</hi> of it. That this Law should have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of <hi>Eternal Life</hi> annexed unto it, upon condition of obedience, and a
threatning of Eternal Death, upon Disobedience, was accidental unto it.
That if Man sinned, he should actually suffer the punishment threatned was so
too.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:64164:80"/>
That the particular Precepts thereof should be Articles of a Covenant, was
not essential, And, that perfect and perpetual obedience should be that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
upon which per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ormed, it was God's Will, Eternal Life should follow, and
no ways else, was accidental. So likewise it was, that the sin of one should be
the sin of all, and His Death, their death. For the Law might have been a
Law, without any such thing.</p>
               <p>This Law may be considered,<label type="milestone">

               <p>2. As continued, yet with several accidental, and extrinsecal alterations in
the Kingdom of <hi>God-Redeemer.</hi> As it was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> it's of a two-fold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,

               <p>
                  <hi>Adam,</hi> as Innocent, received this Law; and it was given unto him, as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and holy, by Creation, and he was able to keep it: And he was bound to
perform it perfectly, and perpetually, together with other Positives. And this
perfect and perpetual obedience, was the onely condition of life to him, and
his; and one sin one committed, made him, and his, liable to death. After that
<hi>Adam,</hi> and in him all his, had sinned, it was a Law of Sin and Death unto them;
and if God had made it a standing Rule of Judgment, in strict Justice man must
needs have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en condemned to Eternal Death, and there was no hope or possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Eternal Life by this Law. For suppose God had pardoned this first
sin, and yet continued this Law in force, man could not have been saved by it.
For he lost the Spirit of Sanctification: and if God had continued to say, <hi>Do
this, and live;</hi> because he could not do this, he could not live. Neither was there
any Promise of a Saviour to expiate his sin, nor of the Spirit, to enable him to
keep it, nor of <hi>Pardon,</hi> upon expiation made, if he afterwards transgressed it.</p>
               <p>After that God in passing Sentence upon the Devil had said,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> that the Seed of
the Woman should bruise the Serpents Head, this Law continued, but with a
great alteration in respect of man. A Redeemer who should satisfie God's
Justice, and merit God's favour unto man was promised, his satisfaction accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the Spirit restored, pardon and eternal life promised; Faith in the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
made the condition of life; the Law of the forbidden Fruit, ceased; the Law
of Works as the condition of life and rule of judgment, for punishments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
repealed. And all this was done in great mercy by God, as Supream and
absolute Lord above his own Law, which bound not Him, the Soveraign, but
Man, His Subject. Thus much I observed, when I spake of the Judgment, which
God passed upon the Authors of the first sin. But how the Law-Moral continued,
you shall hear-anon.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of this Law,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> as applyed to the Acts, Dispositions, Habits of
men is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> common<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y called <hi>Conscience:</hi> which is nothing else, but the knowledge
of a man's Acts, Dispositions, Habits, as agreeable, or disagreeable, to this or
other Laws of God. This Knowledge, in respect of acts future, is the Law of <hi>God</hi>
within him, to bind him to obedience, and restrain him from disobedience. In
respect of acts past, it's a Judge within himself, or a Witness for, or against him,
before the Tribunal of God. This it is properly; yet tropically, in Scripture,
it's several times taken in another sense, according to the several adjuncts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
For the practical judgment of man is sometimes more, sometimes less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
and great is his Ignorance and many his Errours, both in matter of Law,
and of Fact; and most of all in applying the Law unto the Fact; or Fact unto
the Law. Sometimes it's a false Witness, and an unjust Judge: and hence man's
Security, in greatest Guilt; and Despair, when there is hope of Mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:64164:80"/>
This <hi>Knowledge,</hi> of this Law-Moral, in <hi>Adam</hi> innocent, was more perfect; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> in
his Posterity, more imperfect. For the enlightening Spirit, was taken from him;
it was not so purely, diligently, constantly, taught; neither was the outward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
thereof renewed to all. Besides, the erroneous Traditions without,
the Corruptions of man's Heart within, with other vicious Habits, together
with God's just judgment, had much impaired this <hi>Knowledge,</hi> though not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
razed it out. For even the wicked <hi>Heathen,</hi> who had not the Law written, yet
by Nature did something contained in the Law, and were a Law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which did shew the Works of the Law of God written in their hearts,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 15. Yet the knowledge of it was always preserved in the Church
by constant Teaching and reiterated Revelations, improving the Natural Light
of Reason. Yet some Positives and Ceremonials were always added, and it was
joyned to the Law of Faith. God renewed the Doctrine of it more perfectly,
and in a more solemn manner unto <hi>Israel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> both by an audible Voice, and by
writing it in Tables of stone. <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, Christ and His Apostles,
more fully and clearly explain it. And by outward Teaching and inward Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
God writes it by degrees in the hearts of His people.</p>

               <p>In respect of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had other positive Laws and Customs, either
by Tradition, or the invention of the Devil, and wicked men, this Moral-Law, so
far as it was left written in their hearts, taught them their Duty to the onely
true God, and also unto Man. For it was a Rule in matters of Religion, and in
matters of Justice unto them, both as they were single persons, and also associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a Family, or a Common-wealth. It was the Rule of their Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
both in making Laws, and in Judgment. And according to the violation
of this Law, God judged single persons, Families, Nations, and Kingdoms. And
the knowledge thereof which they had, or might have had, though imperfect,
did manifest in their own Conscience, the justice of God's Judgments executed
upon them. And so much the more, because by His patience, long-suffering, and
bounty, together with this law, he sought to draw them to Repentance, But they
holding the truth of God in unrighteousness, and continuing impenitent, were
inexcusable, and justly delivered up unto a Reprobate mind; as may appear,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. from <hi>ver. 18. ad finem,</hi> &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. from <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to the 17th. And they that
disobeyed this clear light of Nature, were justly punished by God, with the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

special application to that People.</p>
               <p>3. It was Supernaturally written in two Tables of Stone, that it might be
reserved in the Ark, as a rare and lasting Monument from Heaven.</p>
               <p>4. It had annexed the whole Body of the Judicials and Ceremonials to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

the glorification of Christ, and the Revelation of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>5. It had joyned with it many Temporal Promises and Curses, Yet, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>

1. It did minister no power of the Spirit to keep it.</p>
               <p>2. It promised no Pardon, or Spiritual Blessing: for those belonged unto the
Law of grace in Christ, who was promised to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. It had no Priest that could expiate Sin or Sacrifice, which could purge the
Conscience from dead Works.</p>
               <p>4. It ran in strict tearms; as, <hi>Do this, and live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. It was given in such a manner, as to strike a terrour into them; as guilty
Wretches, who seemed to be summoned before God, not so much to receive a
Law as to hear the Sentence of Death passed upon them. The special use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unto them, was, to give them a clearer, and more perfect knowledge, as of
their duty, so of their sin and misery: Of their Sin, by the Precepts; of their
misery, by the threatnings: And this, to humble them, cause them to desire a
remedy, and have recourse unto the Promise of Christ, and that with a longing
after his Exhibition. And seeing there was no promise of power to keep it, or
of pardon; and the Priesthood, Sacrifices, and other Services, being in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
an heavy burthen, could no ways be able to free them from the guilt of
sin they had the greater cause to rely upon him, and expect his coming. It was
also a Rule of their lives, both as single persons, and as Members of a Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
that by obedience unto it, they might live happily in that good Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> and not be obnoxious to those fearful judgments God had threatned,
and their Posterity for their sin, did afterwards suffer. Other uses of it, as joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the Ceremonials, I have formerly delivered. That many of them
sought Righteousness, and Justification by this Law, together with the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
was their great mistake: For,</p>
               <p>1. There was no power in the Moral Law, to justifie them, except they could
keep it: but seeing they could not do it, it was added for transgression, <hi>Gal. 3.
19.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Law Ceremonial had no power to sanctifie them, and free them
from sin: For the Law was weak, and unprofitable, and made nothing perfect,
that is, it justified and sanctified no man, <hi>Heb. 7. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 19. The Priests, by their
Offerings and Sacrifices, could not take away sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 11.</p>
               <p>The use of it to the <hi>Church,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>X</label> especially Christian (who have a clearer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Moral Duties, by the example of our Blessed Saviour, who was the
perfect Mirrour of all Heavenly Virtues, and by the Doctrine of the Gospel)
is,</p>
               <p>1. To discover Sin.</p>
               <p>2. To be a Rule of Obedience. And of this use it was always both to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,
to <hi>Israel,</hi> and to all Christians.</p>
               <p>The first end is, to discover Sin: For, as where there is no Law, there
is no Sin; so where there is no knowledge of the Law there is no knowledge of
Sin. Therefore it is said, that by the Law is the knowledge of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20.
And the more clearly and distinctly God in his Law shall represent our Duty;
and that measure of Righteousness and Holiness, which God requires at our
hands, and we by the Law of Creation were bound to perform, or else suffer eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
death, the more vile, abominable, and miserable, we plainly see our selves to
be; We easily understand what need we have of Christ's death and intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
God's mercy, and the Spirit of Regeneration, lest we run on endlesly upon
this heavy score. The more we know our vile and sad condition, the more we
know the freeness of God's grace, and the abundance of his mercy, if He will
be pleased to deliver us. And lest the Law should work despair, it was always
in the <hi>Church</hi> joyned with Christ either to come or else exhibited. Therefore
it's said, <hi>That the Law entred, that the offence might abound; but where sin aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
grace did much more abound.</hi> From which words we may understand,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:64164:81"/>
1. That the Law was not given to justifie us.</p>
               <p>2. It's never to be separated from Christ, and God's abundant grace in Jesus
Christ our Lord. And this is one use to be made of the Law, not onely before
we are in Christ to prepare us for him, but also after that we are in Him, that we
may renew our Faith and Repentance, till we be fully sanctified. Yet the Law,
without the power of the Divine Spirit, can never so clearly and distinctly
represent unto us our sins, and make us sensible of them, or keep us from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair.</p>
               <p>In this respect, the Law may be said to be <hi>Evangelical,</hi> because subservient to
the Gospel.</p>
               <p>He that shall preach the Law without Christ is truly a legal Preacher: And
he that shall preach Christ without the Law to discover sin, is an <hi>Antinomian.</hi>
This use cannot be made of the Law without <hi>Self-examination,</hi> and a serious and
distinct Review of our lives laid to the Line of this Law. And though the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law be the principal in this use; yet all positive Laws in force, serve to the
same end.</p>
               <p>This was not the proper and first intended end: for as it found man holy,
and righteous at the first; so it required he should continue. Obedience and
life were the end: To discover disobedience, and man's sad condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
and to cause him to look and cast about for a Deliverance, and desire
Christ represented as a Saviour, was not intended at the first, but made an end
by <hi>God-Redeemer</hi> in Christ to prepare him for Christ. This use was merely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
to the Law, and was super-added by the Divine Wisdom and Mercy: and
in this respect it can no ways belong to the first Covenant of Works. To strike
terrour into guilty man, &amp; cause him to despair of life might be an effect of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Covenant. And now if it be represented, as first given to <hi>Adam,</hi>
it can have no other effect. But thus it was not to be understood, after God had
signified that He would provide a <hi>Redeemer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another use in the second place,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XI</label> is, to be a Rule of Obedience. But</p>
               <p>1. It's not a bare Rule to inform our Understanding of the Duty, and so
give direction; but it's a binding Rule, as every Law is. It's not merely given us
for Advice, Exhortation, Perswasion, but with a strong Obligation.</p>
               <p>2. This Obedience is performed by sinful Man, by way of Return. For
this Law finds man sinful, guiltys and disobedient, both by Nature and Practise.
Therefore, the Scripture calls so often for turning to the Lord; which implies
two things:</p>
               <p>1. That turning from our sins, we should for time to come, subject our selves
to God, as our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and acknowledge Him.</p>
               <p>2. That being subjected, we should be obedient unto His particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
And this Obedience; by way of Return, is called Repentance, which
cannot be without sorrow for sin past, Humiliation, hatred of sin, a love of God,
and desire to please Him.</p>
               <p>3. This Obedience cannot be performed without the Spirit merited by
Christ, and restored unto us; first, to prepare us, then to dwell in us, by degrees
renewing the Image of God, and imprinting it upon us.</p>
               <p>4. We must be in Christ, as the Branch in the Vine, and be conformed unto
His Death and Resurrection, before we can perform any obedience acceptable
to God, so as to tend towards the attainment of <hi>Everlasting Life. For without me,</hi>
(saith Christ) <hi>ye can do nothing, Joh. 15. 5. And we are God's Workmanship crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Christ Jesus, unto good works,</hi> Ephes. 2. 10. It's one thing to do that which
is Morally good, as the <hi>Heathen</hi> might do, and be rewarded Temporally; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to perform Christian obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:64164:82"/>
5. It presupposeth Faith, whereby we are united unto Christ, and sincere
Faith is virtually Repentance, and all Obedience, and a part and beginning
thereof.</p>
               <p>6. This Obedience is imperfect, and defective in the best man living upon
Earth; and therefore is not the condition of life. For if the Moral Law should
be in force, so as it was to <hi>Adam</hi> at the first, to require, and bind man unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and perpetual obedience; or else upon one act of Disobedience unto Death,
no man could be saved. Therefore, that manner of strict Obligation, ceaseth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
sinful man for ever. To think that the Promises, Threats, and Obligation
of the Law of Works continue under the Gospel, or remain at any time in the
Kingdom of <hi>God-Redeemer,</hi> is an errour, and a great mistake. It's one thing to
bind unto perfect obedience; another to bind unto perfect obedience, as the
condition of life. This latter was essential, even to the Moral-Law, as given to
<hi>Adam</hi> at the first, and in that respect it's truly and properly said, that the Law of
Works is ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ogated. The Law binds according to the will and pleasure of the
Law-giver, and no otherwise. If Man perform not perfect obedience, and yet be
bound unto it, he is in the hands of his Judge, above the Law, to dispose of him
as he pleaseth.</p>
               <p>7. This obedience is performed to <hi>God-Redeemer,</hi> as satisfied, atoned, and
propitiated by the bloud of Christ, who hath merited, that it should be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and rewarded. In this respect it's not proper; nay, it's not true, to say that
God in the Moral Law binds man to perfect, or perpetual obedience: For so
He doth not. He binds to perfect and perpetual obedience, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he neither doth
nor can perform; or to punishment suffered by his Saviour, and, upon Faith in
him, removable; not to obedience and punishment too. For time-past, Man
hath been already disobedient; and for time to come, he will not be perfectly
obedient, till the time of glory. Yet the Suffering of Christ doth not free man
sinning from all suffering: For it's the Will of God, that even regenerate men
should suffer much for their own sins. Yet man's suffering cannot satisfie; it
may dispose him through the help of God's sanctifying Spirit to Repentance,
and make him capable of the benefit of that Suffering, which hath satisfied the
Justice of God, who hath accepted it for sinful disobedient Man, pleading his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
suffering. This Obligation of the Law is purely <hi>Evangelical;</hi> and in this
respect, the <hi>Precept,</hi> and the <hi>Condition,</hi> are of equal extent, as well as they were in
the time of the Law of Works.</p>
               <p>8. Faith and Repentance, as they are Acts of Obedience in general, are
commanded in the Moral Law: Yet, as Faith is in <hi>God-Redeemer,</hi> and <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
a return to obedience, to be performed to God in Christ, by the Spirit of
Christ, they are not to be found in the Law at all: as such, they are purely
<hi>Evangelical,</hi> and conditions of life, even to sinful guilty man. Though Faith,
and Obedience, as different from Faith, be conditions of the <hi>New-Covenant;</hi> yet
there is both a difference, and an inequality between them, as a condition.
Faith unites us unto Christ; from whom immediately, by viture of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
we derive a right to Justification, and so to Life. In which respect, it may
be said, to be a <hi>Title-Condition;</hi> that is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a condition upon which follows imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
a right to Righteousness and Life. Faith, considered as Faith in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
in it self cannot be a Title, without reference to Christ's merit, and God's
Promise: For Faith, this Faith is terminated upon both, and as such, and no
ways else is <hi>Saving.</hi> The <hi>Promise</hi> is a kind of <hi>Donation of Righteousness,</hi> and
<hi>Life,</hi> as purchased by Christ: and God's the <hi>Donour,</hi> and the <hi>Believer</hi> by his Faith
becomes the <hi>Doneè:</hi> Good Works are a condition; and all obedience which
follows and flows from Faith, as distinct from Faith, yet virtually included in
Faith, is so too.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:64164:82"/>
Obedience is two-fold:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In <hi>Morals.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. In <hi>Positives.</hi>

               </list>
               <p>Obedience in <hi>Morals,</hi> and good Works, as morally good, are a condition not
to give a right, but to render a man capable of communion with God, and make
him fit for the possession of that life Christ hath purchased: For without Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
we cannot see God: and except we walk in the light, as he is light, we
can have no communion with him: and till our obedience in Morals be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
we can have no full fruition of him, Obedience, in <hi>Positives,</hi> is a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
yet neither as giving right, nor making man capable, but because God's insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
makes them binding, except in case of necessity, wherein God dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
with Man. This is so far a condition, that life follows thereupon, if it be
joyned with Faith and Obedience in Morals; and in case of Contempt, life will
not follow, not be communicable. From all this we may understand, that there
is a twofo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dness of the Moral Law, Evangelically considered;</p>
               <p>1. To discover sin.</p>
               <p>2. To be a Rule of Obedience. Thus the Composers of our Liturgie did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it, and that rightly according to the Scripture, when they added this
short Petition <hi>[Lord have mercy upon us; and incline our hearts to keep this Law]</hi>
after every Commandement.</p>
               <p>This Petition is two-fold: For,</p>
               <p>1. Pardon of sin that is past.</p>
               <p>2. For Grace to enable them, to keep it for time to come: The first includes
a confession of sin a, Belief in Christ, and a Petition for pardon: The second, an
acknowledgment of their inability to keep it, a necessity of the sanctifying Spirit,
a Petition or the same, and the end and effect thereof obtained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
their hearts to keep it. And after all the Commandements, and every
particular, they desire God to give them a general pardon of all sins against this
Law; and such a measure of Grace, as that they might perform an Universal
Obedience: For so the Petition runs, <hi>Write all these thy Laws in our hearts we
beseech thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XII</label> let us consider what hath been the binding force of it, in all
times since it was first given to Man. To this purpose, we must observe many
things:</p>
               <p>1. That as purely Moral, it is always in force: and God did never at any
time dispense with it, but made it the Foundation of all other Laws; and it
shall continue in force in Heaven. For in the very estate of perfect glory, all the
Subjects of that eternal glorious Kingdom shall be bound eternally to love their
God, themselves, and one another.</p>
               <p>2. God bound <hi>Adam,</hi> in the day of Creation, to the perfect and perpetual
personal obedience of this Law, and of other <hi>Positives,</hi> as the onely condition
of life; and so, that upon one sin, he and all his should be liable to death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any remedy, as from that Law. This was the highest obligation.</p>
               <p>3. After that <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him all his had once sinned, this Law, with the
Positives, did render him liable and bound to death.</p>
               <p>4. After that Christ was once promised, as a Surety, and Hostage, to satisfie
God's Justice, offended by the sin of man, it made him liable to death, and all
such punishments as God should inflict upon him.</p>
               <p>5. After the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> it was in force so fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, as to bind all such as were
out of the <hi>Church</hi> to Temporal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Eternal Punishments for their sins against
it, without any hope of <hi>Pardon:</hi> and all such as were in the <hi>visible Church</hi> to
Temporal and Eternal Punishments, no ways removable, but upon Faith in the
Death of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:64164:83"/>
6. It is in force always, since sinful Man received the New Law and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace to bind him to repentance, present repentance, and return unto
the sincere obedience of it, to be performed by the power of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>7. It always is in force, to bind the <hi>Regenerate Children</hi> of God here on
Earth, to endeavour and aym at an universal, perpetual, and perfect obedience;
and, upon defect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or default, presently to return to <hi>God-Redeemer,</hi> for mercy and
pardon of what is past, to be obtained by a Plea of Christ's Satisfaction and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and, also further, for the continuance and increase of His Sanctifying
Grace.</p>
               <p>Lastly, after that Man is perfectly sanctified, it's so far in force, as to bind him
to perfect and eternal obedience unto it.</p>
               <p>Such is the excellency of this Law, as purely Moral; that</p>
               <p>1. If Man had kept it, God would give life by it.</p>
               <p>2. That God never gave Man a liberty to be free from the Obligation of
it.</p>
               <p>3. That God would never pardon any sinne against it, without satisfaction
made by the Blood of Christ, believed and pleaded by sinful Man.</p>
               <p>4. That Christ merited, and God restored the Spirit of Sanctification, that
Man might keep it.</p>
               <p>5. That He will not spare His own children, when they transgress it by hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
and especially scandalous, sins.</p>
               <p>6. That no Man can have union with <hi>Christ,</hi> except he willingly separate
from sin, and return to the obedience of this Law.</p>
               <p>7. That no man can have full communion with God before he perfectly
obey it.</p>
               <p>8. That there is one great change, in respect of this Law. First, perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
unto it, with other <hi>Positives,</hi> was made the onely condition of life:
But afterwards that Promise of Life, upon those strict tearms, and that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
commination of Death upon Sin were abolished, and Faith was
made the onely condition of life. So that it may be truly said, that the
Law of Works is abrogated; but not the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> considered
in it <hi>Self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Yet this change was but accidental (as before).</p>
               <p>These things premised,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> concerning the <hi>Moral Law</hi> in general, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
unto the Exposition of the <hi>DECALOGVE;</hi> which, though it was
given to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> contains the Heads and Method of the Morall
Law.</p>
               <p>And it may be considered, either as a part of the Law of Works, or merely
as the Moral Law in general, or as part of the Gospel, in an <hi>Evangelical No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:64164:83"/>
As it was delivered in that terrible manner (with these Clauses, <hi>Do this,
and live;</hi> and, <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things written in this
Book</hi>) it had something of the Law of Works in it; As it was annexed to the
<hi>Promise</hi> made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and joyned with the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> typifying
Christ, it was <hi>Evangelical.</hi> As considered in general, abstracted from both
these, it was an Abridgement of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> respecting Man in this life,
not in the life to come.</p>
               <p>It's to be understood not strictly, as given to <hi>Israel</hi> at that time; but in a
<hi>Latitude,</hi> as it is explained in other parts of the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> especially in
<hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> in the Prophets, and most of all, as in the <hi>New Testament:</hi>
where it is explained by our Blessed Saviour, and the Duties thereof pressed
by Him, and the Apostles, upon all Christians. And this is an Argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
some ways it continues in force, in the Gospel. As delivered in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and
repeated in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> it rather contains the Heads, to which other Duties,
not there expressed, may be reduced, rather then the Principles from whence
they may be deduced. It's abridged in many places of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophets,
and Apostles. Yet that of our Saviour is most perfect, wherein, according to
<hi>Moses,</hi> he reduceth all to <hi>Love:</hi> For Love is the whole Law. This Loves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of God, or of our Neighbour.</p>
               <p>To love God above all, is the first and great Commandement of the first Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
To love our Neighbour, as our Selves, is the last Commandement of the
second Table.</p>
               <p>These two are purely Moral, especially the former; and the rest are such by
participation, as before: Therefore, the first is said to be the great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement:
The last, to be like it.</p>

Laws of any Nation in the World. And seeing He spake these, and these one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
these, and all these, it's not for Man to add and diminish: And all
and every one are <hi>authentick,</hi> and of <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> in an high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>The second <hi>Preface</hi> we have in these words <hi>[I am the Lord thy God, who
brought thee out of the Land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>out of the House of Bondage.]</hi> This second
<hi>Preface</hi> is of God Himself, wherein we have both His absolute and relative Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
whereby He asserts both His own absolute and supream Power, and their
dependence upon Him.</p>
               <p>The Titles are three:</p>
               <p>The first is absolute <hi>[I am the Lord]</hi> which signifies His absolute and most
perfect Being in Himself, who is worthy of all glory, honour, power, and subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for evermore. For all glorious and most excellent perfections agree to
Him, who is so glorious and so excellent in Himself, and the Basis and immova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Foundation of the World, and of all created Beings, which issue from His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
and Almighty Power; and, without His sustentation, return to nothing:
From this we understand, that this Lord and Law-giver is onely one, and there
can be no other: For He is the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</p>
               <p>The second Title, which together with the third being relative is <hi>[Thy God].</hi>
To be the God of <hi>Israel</hi> was not onely to be creatour, preserver, and governour
in generall, for so he was the God of all mankind; but it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cludes some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
relation to them. For he was their God, and in such a manner as He was
to none others. He was their God by Election, Promise, and their voluntary
submission, and engagement, so that they were his Peculiar People. By
this also we understand their total dependence upon him; his absolute power
over them; and that whatsoever degree of subjection and duty he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
it was justly due unto him, and that not onely by vertue of his Power
but their solemn engagement, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:64164:84"/>
The third Title is, <hi>Who have brought thee out of the land of Aegypt, out of the
house of Bondage.</hi> This doth put them in mind of their Bondage and sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and deliverance out of the same. <hi>If we</hi> consider their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
before this deliverance, <hi>We</hi> shall find</p>
               <p>1. They were but Sojourners in that Idolatrous nation; had no Countrey
or habitation hereditary of their own, in any place under heaven.</p>
               <p>2. They were under a cruel bloody Tyrant, and had neither governours, nor
governments independent of themselves.</p>
               <p>3. Their male Children were born to be murdered, and to lose their life
so soon as they began to enjoy it in the light of the World.</p>
               <p>4. They were made absolute slaves and drudges, and bound to base and hard
service, which they were no wayes able to perform; and yet liable to grievous
punishments, if they performed it not. Yet out of this sad condition God did
deliver them in a wonderfull and glorious manner. For</p>
               <p>1. God fearfully plagued and punished their enemyes, and took vengeance
on them for their cruel oppression.</p>
               <p>2. Brought them out with an high hand.</p>
               <p>3. They were no sooner departed out of that cursed Kingdome, but God
took them into his special Protection: A Cloud must cover them by day, and
be a guide, and Pillar of fire and light by night. The Angels of Heaven not
onely going before them, but bringing up the reare.</p>
               <p>4. When <hi>Pharoah</hi> with the power of <hi>Egypt</hi> pursued them, and took them
in the straites; he divided the Sea, and made way for them through the deep,
wherein he drowned the host, and strength of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with their King, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
them.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>His Providence</hi> over them being a continued course of <hi>Miracles</hi> had
brought them thus far towards that goodly land, wherein he intended to settle
them, and give them peace and prosperity till their Saviour and Redeemer
should come and be exhibited. And as that land was a type of their heavenly
inheritance, so this deliverance was of their spirituall and eternall redemption
by Jesus Christ. So that as Gods benefits were unspeakable, so their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
unto God were high, and very great, and so great as they could never be
sufficiently thankfull: And if he should give them any lawes, they were bound
in the highest degree to observe them, not onely for his glory, but their own
happinesse. For God had delivered them out of the hands of their enemyes,
that they might serve him in holinesse, and righteousnesse before him all their
dayes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 74, 75. This preface was of greatest force to engage them and
the fittest that possibly could be to prepare them for this law, and perswade them
to obedience. And to this end, it includes a multitude of most powerfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives:
and though it hath speciall reference to the first and great commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet it referrs to all the rest as depending upon it. And seeing this law
was given 430 yeares, after the promise of the Blessed seed made to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Abraham,</hi> they might have understood, that it was not given for justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and life, but to be a School-Master, or Tutour to order and direct unto
Christ, in whom they were to seek <hi>Remission</hi> of their sins and eternal
life. Though many of them understood it not in this manner. Yet we
Christians who have a clearer light can have no excuse if we be ignorant
hereof.</p>
               <p>These Commandements were written in two Tables; and</p>
               <p>1. Are reducible to two heads: Such as determine</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Our duty towards God.</item>
                  <item>2. Our duty towards our Neighbour.</item>
               </list>
               <p>2. These bind the conscience, and reach the very will, and heart of man, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64164:85"/>
not onely acts inward, or outward issuing from the heart.</p>
               <p>3. As they are delivered unto us, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. They were given to <hi>Israel</hi> in
particular, and the word <hi>Thou</hi> used in every Commandement, signifies, that
God in them spake unto <hi>that Israel,</hi> whom he brought up out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and
stood before <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> when God spake these words; and it signifies all <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
joyntly, as one person collective, and every one of them severally in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>4. As given then at that time to <hi>Israel,</hi> it did neither promise <hi>Pardon</hi> of any
sin, nor power of the Spirit to keep it: Both these were to be expected from the
promise made to <hi>Abraham:</hi> and, annexed to that promise, it did serve to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sin, and to direct to Christ promised.</p>
               <p>5. When we find the dutyes of the law pressed upon Believers in Christ, we
must know that they are to be performed to God Redeemer by the power of
the Spirit of Christ, (as hath been said before).</p>
               <p>6. There are some dutyes mentioned in Scripture, which are so generall, as
to comprehend all the Commandements. Some that extend to all the first
table, and some to all the second, as we use to speak; Some are expresly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the severall Commandements. Some deducible from the express words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Some onely reducible unto these heads by way of <hi>analogie,</hi> or some trope in
<hi>Rhetorick,</hi> yet expresly mentioned in other Scriptures: and one and the same
thing may in severall respects be commanded or forbidden in severall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>This law</hi> is distinct both from the <hi>Judicial,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> yet both are
reducible to it. The first commandement virtually includes all the rest, and
is purely morall in the first place, as the last is morall in the second place, and
all the rest derive their <hi>Morality</hi> from these two (as was before hinted). Other
rules delivered by severall authours for the better understanding of this law,
I passe by.</p>
               <p>The first commandement is,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods but me,</hi> and it
is negative, and so a Prohibition. It presupposeth that there is <hi>One onely true,
and living God,</hi> most glorious, and blessed in himself, the great <hi>Creatour, Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Law-giver,</hi> and Judge of the world, who as he delivered <hi>Israel</hi> out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and called them to be his peculiar people, so hath redeemed sinfull man
by Jesus Christ, and hath called us out of darknesse into his marveylous light,
and made those that were <hi>Lo—ammi,</hi> not his people, to be <hi>Ammi</hi> his people,
and the Sons of the living God. This commandement <hi>Evangelically</hi> understood
doth presuppose him to be such. The thing prohibited is either to deny or
doubt that there is such a God; or not to acknowledge him as such: or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
there is another God, or Gods, and to acknowledge him or them so to
be. This deniall, doubting, false belief, and not acknowledging him, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
any other, may proceed from negligent, or wilfull blindnesse, which
both are inexcusable.</p>
               <p>So that the sins here forbidden may be reduced to <hi>Atheism,</hi> or <hi>Idolatry.</hi> The
one seemes to be negative, and a sin of omission, though it is not alwayes so:
the other affirmative or positive, and a sin of commission. And though the
having of other Gods besides him seemes onely to be forbidden, yet from the
affirmative part it doth appear, that though we should have none other God,
and yet not have him as God and our God, is a sin against this law: And upon
<hi>accurate</hi> search, it wil appear that every one that hath not him as God, his God,
must needs have another God. And here it's to be noted, that though many
translate the words of this Commandement. Thou shalt have no other Gods
<hi>before me,</hi> yet the principall meaning is, <hi>besides, or but me,</hi> as they are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the <hi>Chaldy paraphrast,</hi> and the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and may be expounded by
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64164:85"/>
those words of <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 23. Thou shalt not make, <hi>With me,</hi> Gods of Silver,
<hi>&amp;c:</hi> These words presuppose,</p>
               <p>1. That none ought to be so accused, as to deny the Lord his Maker, in
whom he lives, moves, and hath his <hi>Beeing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That to have another God doth not imply that there is another God, but
that men may account other things which are no Gods to be Gods.</p>
               <p>3. That it was the custome, and practise of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and most nations of the
World to worship other Gods.</p>
               <p>The first sin here forbidden,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> as you heard before, is <hi>Atheism,</hi> which is more
grosse, or not so palpable. The more grosse is either to doubt, or deny, or not
acknowledge, that there is one glorious, and eternal Being, for ever blessed in
himself; or if there be, yet he is not the Creatour, and preserver of all things,
or, if he be so, that he is not the universall Lord, Law-giver, who takes notice
of all mens hearts, acts, doings, to reward, or punish them accordingly. These
usually deny the immortality of the Soul, the Resurrection of the Body, and the
eternall rewards, and punishments. These are not to be confuted, so much
by any kind of arguments, as by such as are drawn, <hi>è concessis,</hi> from something
they themselves grant to be true. This <hi>Atheism</hi> doth not arise so much from
the want of the light of reason within, or sufficient representation of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
as from negligence, or wilfull blindnesse, contracted by former sins, and sent
upon them by the just judgement of God, who hath delivered them up to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
mind. <hi>Atheism</hi> lesse palpable is, when men professe they know God,
but in works deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good
work, reprobate, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16. And all such as know him <hi>Speculatively,</hi> and yet
do not acknowledge, and respect him <hi>as God,</hi> the onely God, are in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
guilty of this Sin. For the commandement requireth us not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to know God, but to <hi>acknowledge,</hi> and respect him, and him alone, as
God.</p>
               <p>Idolatry,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> which is the other sin here prohibited is a belief, acknowledgment,
and worship of that as God, which is no God. For here I do not understand
by <hi>Idol,</hi> an image as the Word doth often signifie, but a false God. For to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
that there is any God but one, or that any but he that made Heaven, and
Earth is that God, and to give the Worship due unto the onely true God unto
it, is <hi>Idolotry.</hi> So that the object of Idolatry is a false God, that which is no
God, yet conceived to be such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and set up as God in the <hi>vile</hi> hearts of men. An
<hi>Idol</hi> saith the Apostle, is nothing in the world: for there is none other God but
one, 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4. Some give Divine Worship to those who are no Gods, and
deny it, or do not give it to the true God: Some give Divine honour to the
true God, and to false Gods too: Both are guilty. As one that hath worn
<hi>allegiance</hi> to his own <hi>Soveraign,</hi> and yet continuing his subject swears unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is guilty of <hi>high-treason:</hi> much more <hi>He</hi> that denyes fealty unto his own
Lord, and yet sweares unto another. <hi>Honour</hi> properly <hi>Divine,</hi> as such cannot
justly be given to any but God: and to give it to any other is not to glorifie God,
as God, the onely God. When its said in the Place fore-alleaged, <hi>that an Idol
is nothing in the World,</hi> its not so to be understood, as though an <hi>Idol</hi> were no
real <hi>Being,</hi> or had no <hi>existence</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> for the matter of an <hi>Idol</hi> is some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
thing for the most part; but that it's no God in it self, but onely in the
conceit and judgment of the Idolater. The Gods of the <hi>Gentils</hi> are said to be
<hi>Idols, 1 Chron. 19. 16. Where</hi> the Word translated <hi>Idols</hi> by the <hi>Septuagins</hi>
and others signifies, <hi>not-Gods,</hi> or <hi>no-Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Idolatry is more grosse, or not so palpable as <hi>Atheism</hi> was. The more
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64164:86"/>
gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se is, when men Worship, as gods, either the <hi>invisible Creatures,</hi> as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
or the Spirits of men deceased; or visible, as <hi>Living men, Birds, Beasts,
creeping things, the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Moon, the Stars of Heaven, the Elements.</hi> These
all are <hi>reall Beings:</hi> But some fancy things that are not both to be, and to be
gods. The lesse palpable Idolatry, is from the basenesse, and deceit of our own
hearts, as when we do acknowledge, and professe one onely true God, yet so
love and affect the <hi>World,</hi> and the things thereof, as <hi>Honour, Glory, Power,
Riches, Pleasures,</hi> and this bodily life, as though there were some Power in
them to make us happy, which God onely can do. And we love, fear, trust in
men, or other Creatures, and not in God, or more in them then in God, or as
much as in God. We often forge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> our God, and rely upon our own Strength,
Wisdome, and other outward meanes; and give the glory of our good successe
to our selves, and not to Him. This to do, is inconsistent with the love of the
Father, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15. And we cannot serve <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mammon, Math. 5.
26.</hi> As there cannot be two Kings in full power in one Kingdome; So there
cannot be two Gods in one heart at one time. To us Christians, who make
the Gospel the rule of our Worship, it's not sufficient to acknowledge God as
Creatour, Preserver, and Governour of the World: For so <hi>Turks, Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
and <hi>Jews</hi> do: we sin if we do not acknowledge him, and Him alone as our
Redeemer by Christ exhibited, and glorified. Therefore to deny Christ thus
represented unto us, or to acknowledge another Christ with him, or besides
him, or to give any <hi>expiating</hi> power to any <hi>Sacrifice</hi> but his; or make any
other Sacrafice the same or equall with his, or to make any other our Advocate
in Heaven, and the propitiation of our sins, is against this law evangelically un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
For to us Christians, there is but one God the Father, of whom are
all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things,
and we by him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6. Neither is there <hi>Salvation</hi> in any other: For
there is none other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we can
be <hi>saved, Act.</hi> 4. 12. In this respect all <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and such as
Worship God, and not by Christ are offenders. Yet not onely they, but all
such to whom the Gospel is preached, and yet receive not Jesus Christ for
their Lord and Saviour, or receive him, and pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esse him, and not fully, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
with their whole heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as God requireth, are guilty and can in no wise
be excused from the <hi>Transgression</hi> of this <hi>Commandement.</hi> Hitherto is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
all <hi>Positive unbelief</hi> of those to whom Christ hath been sufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
by the light of the Gospel. For he that receives not Christ, and refuseth
to submit unto him, refuseth to receive, and submit to that God, who sent him.
Impenitency as it is an obstinate <hi>continuance</hi> in sin, against the meanes, and
<hi>Motives</hi> to repentance, is reducible to this head; Because all such
impenitents deny to return unto their God, as mercifull in Christ.
<hi>These</hi> are <hi>Enemyes</hi> and <hi>Rebels,</hi> against the <hi>Supreme Monarch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Idolatry of such as depend upon, or have compliance with, or give any
<hi>Honour</hi> to the Devil is most heynous:<label type="milestone">

<hi>Witches,</hi> and <hi>Conjurors,</hi> who have familiar Spirits, and contract with them
must needs be great Transgressours: And such as <hi>seek</hi> unto them, or depend
upon them, cannot be <hi>innocent.</hi> Of this sin of worshipping <hi>Devils,</hi> the <hi>Idolatrous
Gentiles</hi> were guilty. For the things they sacrificed they sacrificed to <hi>Devills,</hi>
and not to God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 20. The Apostate Jewes also sacrificed their Sons
and Daughters unto Devills, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 37. And so in one Act made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
guilty, not onely of Idolatry but <hi>unnatural murther.</hi> Apostacy, whether
from God the Creatour, once acknowledged; or from Jesus Christ, once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
comes in here: And such Apostates as turn <hi>Persecutors,</hi> are the most to be
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64164:86"/>
abhorred of all others. Under these two heads of Atheism, and Idolatry, all
<hi>Pride, Prophane</hi> contempt or neglect of the Divine <hi>Majesty, distrust, disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
are concluded. And the habitual predominancy of any one sin is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the <hi>Evangelical</hi> obedience unto this Commandement.</p>
               <p>The Affirmative part of this Commandement presupposeth,<label type="milestone">

pre-re-quireth a <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>belief</hi> of one onely supreme Lord, and
Soveraign God, Blessed for evermore: And the principall dutyes,
are,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>An</hi> acknowledgement of him as such against Atheism, and subjection to
him alone, as our Supreme, and onely Lord. And though we be subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and depend upon him, though we should never thus voluntarily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
yet by this <hi>Voluntary submission,</hi> we freely yield our selves unto him, as
his <hi>Servants,</hi> and his <hi>Vassals.</hi> This is the great law of <hi>Fealty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi>
which is first promised, and after that really, and continually to be performed.
In performance of this duty, we wholly give and resign up our selves, even our
very hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we who are Christians must subject our selves unto him, not onely as <hi>Creatour</hi>
but <hi>Redeemer.</hi> Therefore that faith whereby we so receive Christ as our onely
<hi>Redeemer,</hi> so that we are ready to forsake all things to gain him is reducible to
this Commandement, as Evangelically understood.</p>
               <p>This subjection includes and implyes many dutyes more particular.<label type="milestone">

many, yea all his perfections, and also many of his glorious Works. His

other dutyes are to be performed. Without all these (as occasion requireth)

in Heaven: And all other vertues and <hi>acts,</hi> required in other Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are so far just, as they do agree with this. Love of Father, Mother,
Dearest relation, Life it self, if once they come in competition with this, are no
dutyes; are unjust. We may exceed in the love of any thing, but in the love
of Him we cannot. He deserves infinit Love; yet he alone can infinitely love
himself. Therefore though he deserve it as infinite, yet he requireth it not of
his Creature, which being finit cannot love infinitely. To love him in the
<hi>Highest degree,</hi> and above all is <hi>sincerity,</hi> yet not perfection. For though we
may love him above all, yet we may, and must love him more. But love
him, so perfectly as this law requires, we cannot, till we see him face to face,
know him fully, and are fully <hi>sanctified.</hi> Yet the highest degree of love in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and the glorified Saints, is but finite.</p>

them may receive power and dignity above others, so as in that respect to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
God; honour, service, and subjection may be due unto them from their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Servants. In this sense, higher powers are called Gods, and as such are not
fellow-Servants, and subjects, but Superiours; and in honouring them; we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God, whose persons they beare. And as there may be an inequality, and
also a difference of this communicated power and dignity, so there must be in
the honour and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have <hi>Spiritual;</hi> some have civil and temporall power; and this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
and according to the degree and quality of the power, such must be the
Worship and Subjection. For according to the power and dignity must the
service and <hi>honour</hi> be both for quantity and quality. In matters <hi>Civil</hi> and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
<hi>Civil</hi> and temporall honour is due either in a family, or a City, or a state.
In matters spiritual, honour is due in a Church. What honour and service may
be due to Saints departed, and to Angels, we know not, because we know not
what Power and Commission <hi>God</hi> hath given them over us living upon the
earth; Neither do we converse with them, nor do they ordinarily appear unto
us, so as ordinarily to converse with us. Honour them we may in generall; as
participating an higher degree of spirituall excellency. But to subject our
selves unto them, obey them in particular, and present our petitions unto them,
we have no warrant; neither do we know that they have any such place or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
as to require it of us, or we be bound unto it. But this we certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Christ is at his Fathers right hand, is Lord of Angels, and men, who
hath received and doth exercise <hi>all Power in Heaven,</hi> and earth: and therefore
to him as <hi>Man,</hi> the highest degree of subjection, honour, service, next unto that
which is due to God, as <hi>God,</hi> is due to him, and none else. And it's strange that
the <hi>Socinian,</hi> who denyes his <hi>Deity,</hi> and believes him to be <hi>a meere man,</hi> though

                  </gap>ighly exalted should affirm that <hi>Divine Honour</hi> in proper sense,
which is due onely to the supreme <hi>God,</hi> should be due unto him, and ought to
be exhibited. Yet the <hi>Orthodox Christian,</hi> who acknowledgeth him to be <hi>God</hi>
should give unto him as man an inferiour honour, as sitting at the right hand
of the Throne of Majesty, and not in that Throne it self. For the Divine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
and perfections cannot be communicated to any Creature; and such
as he, as man, is, and no more. And the <hi>Lutheran</hi> who asserts the Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietyes
to be not onely <hi>Communicable,</hi> but <hi>communicated</hi> to Christ, as <hi>man,</hi> must
needs place him higher then the right hand of the Throne, and set him in the
Throne it self. And if they worship him as man with supreme Worship, as
invested with supreme power which is properly <hi>Divine,</hi> they cannot be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from Idolatry. The power of an Officer is derivative and cannot as such be
supreme: But the Scripture makes it evident that Christ is but an Officer,
though the <hi>Universall,</hi> and supreme Officer in the administration of Gods
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> and according to a <hi>Commission</hi> which one day <hi>He</hi> must deliver up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>The reason of this Commandement is very clear:<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XI</label> For the Kingdome and
government of <hi>Gods</hi> is <hi>purely Monarchical,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> himself is the absolute Lord
and Monarch. As he onely and alone made the World; so he alone doth
govern it; and he alone hath power to do so. For among the Gods, saith the
Psalmist, there is none like unto thee <hi>(O Lord!)</hi> neither are the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

things; Thou art God alone, <hi>Psal.</hi> 86. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Therefore to transgresse this Commandement, and worship the Servant, and
creature, above the Creator, who is <hi>God blessed for ever,</hi> must needs be, <hi>Crimen
laesae Majestatis,</hi> High Treason: and to deny him, and refuse to submit unto
him as Supream Lord, must needs be Rebellion. And as <hi>Subjection</hi> is virtually
all obedience, so <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> are the root of all iniquity. For, <hi>the
Fool hath said in his heart, There is no God,</hi> and then he became <hi>Corrupt,</hi> and did
<hi>abominable things.</hi> And the <hi>Gentiles</hi> changing the glory of the incorruptible
God into an image, and his truth into a Lie, and worshipping and serving the
creature more than the Creator, were delivered up unto <hi>Vile affections,</hi> and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
mind, and then they were filled with <hi>all Vnrighteousnesse, Fornication,

               <p>That which is contrary to this Subjection is <hi>Pride,</hi> whereby man contemns

               <p>This hath so near connexion with, and such a dependance upon the former
Law, that many have taken them for the same; and no man can Violate this,
without violation of the former. It had reference in Special, to the Israelites
as newly come out of Egypt, where this Image-Worship was a custome, and a
law; and to those times, when it was generally practis'd in other Nations. For
men began betimes after the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cursed posterity of <hi>Ham,</hi> and <hi>Canaan</hi> his son. It was even then an universall
practise. And this may seem to be the reason, why God so much enlargeth
upon this particular, and useth such powerful reasons to disswade the people
from it, who were so much inclin'd unto it, that notwithstanding they had so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
engaged themselves to obey the Lord in all his Commandements, &amp; had
heard God speaking these Words with great Majesty and terrour, yet before
<hi>Moses</hi> returned from the Mount, they had set up a Molten calf, and did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

               <p>Several Authours have delivered several occasions of the first beginning of
this <hi>Image-Worship;</hi>

the thing. Yet of a universal custome, it's probable there was an universal
cause and occasion: and the same perhaps not bad in it self, but accidentally
through the corruption of man, and the suggession of the Devil abused. God

Worshipped. <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> whilest Pilgrims, and Sojourners
erected their Altars in such places as God appeared unto them, and there did
worship. And it might be, that the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the flood had some vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

From this, <hi>Laban</hi> and others might take occasion to make their

these things be so or no, it's certain man naturally desires the presence of
his God, or some <hi>visible</hi> or evident sign thereof at least, not onely to help his

The meaning therefore is, that we must not make these, or cause them
to be made, or use them being made in or for religious Worship. For we must
observe that the subject of the first 4. Commandements is, <hi>(Cultus Dei)</hi> the
Worship of God, and to understand this making to our selves, without reference
to this is to mistake.</p>
               <p>1. Therefore these Images and Likenesses must not be made to represent
the true eternal and invisible God. For this cause <hi>Moses</hi> saith, That <hi>Israel saw

                  </gap>igious form is to represent <hi>a Deity</hi> after
the false conceit of mans corrupt heart. It's true that every creature made by
God doth speak Gods wisdome and power: and the Heavens, and in them the
Sun declares the glory of God in an eminent manner, and measure. And the
Souls of men, and the Angels those glorious and immortall Spirits resemble
him most of all his works. Yet these stand at an infinite distan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> we have not
farr higher apprehensions, and more excellent notions of him, we cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
worship him aright. How therefore should the Image or visible likenesse
of any bodily, and visible being molded and fashioned by the hand or art of man
represent him so glorious? The stock is a Doctrin of vanityes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10, 8, In
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64164:89"/>
this respect the Molten Image is a teacher of lyes, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 19. It's falshood,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 14.</p>
               <p>2. As an Image must not be made to represent God, lest our conceits and
worship o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> him be base and corrupt; so we must not think that there is any
Divine power in an Image made and consecrated by man, or at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of man. For the power of things made by Gods own hand must needs
be farr more excellent, then the power and vertue of any thing made by Man.
For the works made and consecrated by God, are as far more <hi>excellent</hi> as the
Heaven is above the <hi>Earth.</hi> Yet there is no <hi>Divinity</hi> nor divine power in
them, no not in the <hi>Angels of Heaven.</hi> Images may indeed be conceived by
some to have some strange power, when the <hi>Devil's</hi> in them, or by them, or near
unto them work some strange effect: But these are but the <hi>Delusions</hi> of the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Spirits,</hi> and the cheats of his damned <hi>Flamins</hi> and Priests. The Image
it self can do nothing: neither could the <hi>Brazen Serpent:</hi> for it was God that
healed such as being stung with fiery Serpents looked upon it.</p>
               <p>3. We must not think that any Image, or any other thing made by man,
without warrant, direction, command and promise from God can be a sign of
his special presence, as the Ark, the Tabernacle, the Temple were. God may
voluntarily bind himself to be present in a speciall manner, in some special
place to his people worshipping him in that place, according to his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.
But it's not in the power of any Man or Angel, either to tye God's
special presence to any <hi>Image</hi> or to any place. The Devil (if God permitted
it) might by compact with the <hi>cursed Conjuring Priests</hi> bind himself to be in an
hollow Image to speak out of it, or appear or do some strange thing near unto
it. Thus the Heathen (no doubt) were deluded and confirmed in their Image-worship:
And its lamentable that Christians should be thus inchanted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
by their jugling Priests.</p>
               <p>4. We must not make an <hi>Image</hi> or similitude, in Belief that it wil help or
further our religious Worship, or make it more acceptable to God: neither
must we use them, or rather abuse them, to that end. To worship the true
God <hi>in or by</hi> an Image is a <hi>Corruption</hi> of his <hi>Service,</hi> as any rational impartial
man may easily understand. Therefore <hi>Moses</hi> said to <hi>Israel;</hi> Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unto your selves, for you saw no manner of similitude on the day the Lord
spake unto you in <hi>Horeb</hi> out of the mid'st of the fire, lest you corrupt
your selves, and make you an Image, <hi>&amp;c: Deut,</hi> 4. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>5. We must not think either that an Image consecrated, or the use of it in
religious Worship hath any sanctifying power. For nothing can be effectual in
this kind, or conducing to mans spiritual good which is not instituted by God,
with a promise of his concurrence thereunto.</p>
               <p>The second <hi>act</hi> or <hi>acts</hi> prohibited are,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> 
                  <hi>Bowing down unto an Image,</hi> or <hi>serving</hi>
it. These imply that the former act of making these Images and resemblances
is here forbidden as relating to religious worship.</p>
               <p>1. To bow down is an act of Worship and Adoration, wherein by some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
gesture or carriage of the body before the thing to be worshipped, we testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the inward acknowledgment of the excellency of that thing, and our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to it. These outward reverentiall acts are testifications of the inward
deportment of our Soules: and they are specified not meer from the object, but
the inward recognition of the Soul. Some of these are common, so that the
same outward acts may be performed to God or man; the inward cannot: For
they must of necessity be either <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Religious:</hi> One and the same cannot be
both. If it be the custome of any people, or nation, or persons, to make some
of these outward <hi>acts,</hi> and testifications proper unto <hi>a Diety,</hi> and to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereunto, then to use them to any thing else is <hi>Idolatry.</hi> These are many,

                  </gap>s bowing the head, kissing the hand, kneeling, prostrating the body, and such
like; all signified here by the word, <hi>Bowing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The other act here mentioned, is so serve or worship; and so sometimes
may be the same with the former: But it's here understood as distinct, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<hi>Sacrificing, Burning Incense, Praying,</hi> and the like. Both these acts are usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tendred to, and before Images, and that several way:
<list>
                     <item>1. To the Images, as gods, endued with a Divine Power, able to hear
Man's Prayer, bless him, and deliver him: and this is directly to
terminate the Worship upon it, as a god, against the former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</item>
                     <item>
                        <p>2. Some direct this Worship to the Image, as representing some other
thing besides, and the same more excellent then it self.</p>
                        <p>The thing represented, may be either the true God, or some Saint,
or Angel, or Soul of Man departed; or the Devil, yet not conceived
to be the Devil; or some other thing.</p>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. To perform any Worship any ways unto the Devil, is abominable.</p>
               <p>2. To direct Divine and Religious Worship to, and terminate it upon any
thing, but the true God, is Idolatry.</p>
               <p>3. To terminate Worship any ways upon an Image, is not onely unlawful,
but irrational and absurd: for an Image is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a thing made by the
Art and Device of Man, and there is no excellency in it to make it a fit Object
of Worship.</p>
               <p>4. To terminate Worship partly upon the Image, as a partial Object, and
partly upon the thing represented, is impossible, if the act of Worship be one
and the same individual Act.</p>
               <p>5. If any perform the Worship onely before the Image, without any
thoughts of the Image, and terminate it onely and merely upon the thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
it is to make no use at all of the Image, as altogether needless, and vain to
that act. Yet thus to do, hath a colour of Superstition, if not of Idolatry; and
can no ways be excused, because that Image was no sign of God's special pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
by Institution or Promise from God.</p>
               <p>6. To worship God, in, or by an Image made by the hand and art of man,
must of necessity be a corruption of that divine performance: and there is no
Warrant or Command from God, to make or use an Image with that intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Men may make Images to represent other things, and by looking upon
these Images, they may be another act of the Mind remember the things repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
if they know them distinctly as such: and the more lively the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and the more perfect the knowledge of the things represented are, the
greater help it is to the Memory. Yet it doth not follow from hence, that in
matter of Worship, the Worship performed to the Image, redounds unto the
Samplar. For though a man may intend in Worshipping the Image, suppose
of God, to worship God: Yet</p>
               <p>1. We must consider, that this <hi>Proposition</hi> presupposeth, nay expresly saith, that
the Worship-Divine is first given to the Image, which needs must be Idolatry;
it onely redounds unto the Samplar.</p>
               <p>2. The Image and the Samplar are really and infinitely distinct and diffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rent,
and cannot possibly make one Object.</p>
               <p>3. God did never promi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to any man to accept that Worship, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to the Image, as performed to Himself. So that this <hi>Image-Worship,</hi> is
an <hi>obscure perplexed absurd, irrational dangerous thing,</hi> and altogether unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
Though this <hi>Image-Worship</hi> be so expresly and peremptorily forbidden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
both here, and in many other places of Scripture; and God saith, <hi>Thou sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, and worship or serve them.</hi> That the <hi>Heathens</hi> should do this, is not strange:
but that <hi>Christians</hi> should be guilty of this sin, cannot but be matter of <hi>amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:64164:90"/>
It's the Publick Doctrine, and the general, and constant practise of the
<hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and all her Adherents, to make and set up Images in their
Churches and Places of Publick Worship, to bow down before them, and to
worship them <hi>several ways.</hi> And to justifie this Practise and Doctrine, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<hi>Wits</hi> have been set on work.</p>
               <p>1. Some of their private Catechisms, and Books of <hi>Devotion,</hi> omit these
words of <hi>making and worshipping Images.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Some acknowledge the words, as part of this Law given by God; but say,
This part was but <hi>Positive,</hi> and onely bound the Jews.</p>
               <p>3. Some so interpret and expound the words, as that they may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to forbid their practise.</p>
               <p>4. They make many distinctions of <hi>Worship,</hi> and of the manner of <hi>Worshipping
Images,</hi> that so they may perswade men, that though some manner of <hi>Image-Worship</hi>
be forbidden, yet theirs is not.</p>
               <p>5. Some tell us, that the Worship onely of Idols, and false Gods, are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
here to be made and worshipped; though this be very false and contrary to
the <hi>Trent-Catechism:</hi> Yet notwithstanding all this,</p>
               <p>1. They, even their greatest Schollars, and Clerks, in this particular, differ
amongst themselves.</p>
               <p>2. It's difficult for their Schollers, impossible for the illiterate and Ignorant
people, to understand these distinctions, yet both of them must believe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
their Doctrine, and practise it.</p>
               <p>3. Suppose they do all agree, as they do not, and could determine clearly
some manner of <hi>Image-Worship,</hi> which might be lawful, as they cannot; yet this
<hi>Image<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>Worship</hi> is needless and unprofitable.</p>
               <p>4. This practise was always dangerous, and an occasion, at least, if not a
cause of Idolatry; and it's certainly known, that many of the ignorant sort make
their Images Idols, and are gross Idolaters.</p>
               <p>5. There is no Commandement, no Warrant, no Permission, no Toleration
from God; no example of any Saint, Patriarch Prophet, Apostle, of any kind of
<hi>Imag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>-Worship,</hi> in all the Book of God; but many Prohibitions of all kind of such
Worship.</p>
               <p>6. It's a great scandal both to the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> and so a great impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
to their Conversion.</p>
               <p>7. It was the <hi>invention</hi> of the Devil, and his <hi>wicked Agents,</hi> it never had any
better Author, if we enquire into the original of it.</p>
               <p>8. It's no way sutable to the pure and simple Worship of one God in <hi>Christ,</hi>
according to the Gospel. Yet notwithstanding all these things, it being confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by so many Laws, and long-continued Custome, will not, without great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
and resistence, be abolished. And so much the rather, becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Pompatical Worship, and avouched God to be their God, and Christ their
Saviour, must be pure and chaste; yea, free from the very appearance of this

evil, which tends to his dishonour and their ruine. This sin begins in Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ends in plain Idolatry, which is a corruption of his Worship, a derogation
from his honour, a stain of their integrity, a diminution of that true love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
they owe unto him, a breach of Covenant; and, in the end, a persidious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
and apostasie: Therefore he cannot endure this <hi>Image-Worship,</hi> but will
severely punish it. There be distinctions devised by men to maintain this
<hi>Image-Worship,</hi> that by them they may puzle and delude us. But dare they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon them, when they are convented before God's Tribunal? Will he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them? Can they justifie themselves by them? Can they assure us, that
there is no danger in <hi>Imagery,</hi> and this kind of Worship? Can they ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
in any People that used it, who in the end proved not Idolaters? What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
man can say in behalf of <hi>consecrated Images,</hi> it's certain, the effect of this
jealousie will be severe punishment: for it follows, that <hi>God will visit the sins of
the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth Generation of such as hate
him:</hi> And this may be a second Reason, or the same with the former, as being
an effect of that cause; a punishment issuing from that jealousie, which will
burn like fire, and not be quenched.</p>
               <p>In this Reason, we may observe,<label type="milestone">

violate his Laws in general: yet these are proper to this Commandement. The
cause that doth deserve the punishment is sin; this sin of <hi>Image-worship,</hi> here
called <hi>Hatred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Subject and Persons who shall suffer, are not onely <hi>Superstitious,</hi> and <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Parents,</hi> but their Children. The extent is, to the third and fourth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
               <p>This punishment threatned, is expressed in the word, <hi>Visit, I will visit.</hi> God
doth visit sometimes in mercy, sometimes in justice and displeasure: Here it's
<hi>Visitation in justice,</hi> rendred by the <hi>Septuagint;</hi> in this place, by a word signifying
to render; and in many other places, by a word signifying to <hi>Revenge:</hi> Both
these together, teach us, that here, to <hi>visit,</hi> is to render <hi>vengeance,</hi> and <hi>justly to
punish.</hi> And when God saith, He will do it, it informs us of His determination,
that it is such, that upon the Commission of the Sin, the Punishment shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be due, and the Delinquent liable unto it, and shall unavoidably suffer it,
if it be not prevented by timely repentance, and God's Pardon. This punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is either Temporal, or Eternal, private or publique, Sword, or Famine, or
Pestilence; and sometimes the Captivity; sometimes the ruine of Families, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
States, Nations; besides the Eternal Poenalty. This Commination was effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
and <hi>Israel</hi> found this Judgment certain, and felt it often lye heavy upon
them. This, as other sins against other Commandements, bring the like Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon Christians under the Gospel: Yet so, that as it was pardonable unto
them, upon repentance, by vertue of the Promise; So upon the like tearms, it
is to us, by vertue of Repentance, and Faith in Christ already come. The Sin
which makes liable to this Punishment, is hatred of God: <hi>Of those that hate me.</hi>
The Sin of such as hate Him, in this place, is the making and worshipping of

               <p>The subject of this Punishment and Visitation, is the Fathers; that is, the
Idolatrous Fathers. And these are principally in the sin, and so principal
in the punishment. These are the Authors and first beginners of this sin, and
by their example instruction, and direction, cause their Posterity to sin, and that
long after they are dead. So <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin; and his institution
and example began that sin I which once begun, continued till the time of that

onely the immediate Children, but Posterity, to the third and fourth Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This is not so to be understood, as though the period wherein the penalty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
were the fourth Generation: But, in Scripture, three and four Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
are many Generations, and God doth not precisely limit Himself to this
or that determinate number. It's true, that in the time of four Generations,
the Posterity of some Idolaters may be either cut off, or reformed. Yet it seems
unreasonable that Children should bear and suffer the Punishments of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sins: And therefore, some restrain the <hi>Visitation</hi> to Temporal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and determine the Children to be onely such as continue in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sins. And it's true, that the Children, by repentance, many times escape
the Punishments deserved both by their own, and their Fathers Crimes; and
no person truly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The last Reason is,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> from the Promise of mercy, to a thousand Generations of
them that love God, and keep His Commandements. By <hi>Mercy,</hi> understand
such Blessings, as God promised in the Law to <hi>Israel,</hi> which are often mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> especially <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. &amp; <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. The Subject of
these Mercies, are the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As loving God.</item>
                  <item>2. Keeping His Commandements.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. The love of God, in this place, is opposed to the former Hatred; and is
that pure and chaste affection of the Soul towards God, whereby it abhors all
<hi>Image-Worship,</hi> and even the appearance of it, in toying with Images, or the use
of any thing, in Religious Service, invented by Man. Therefore, as Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Idolatry, and all Worship of Images, is called Fornication and Adultery,
contrary to the Contract and Covenant made with God, as our God alone; so
the worshipping of one God in purity, according to our duty, and His <hi>Institution,</hi>
is called <hi>Chastity:</hi> And such as did not pollute themselves with the Worship of
Idols, are called Virgins, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4.</p>
               <p>2. Where there is this <hi>pure Virgin-love</hi> free from all Idolatry, there will be
an <hi>universal obedience,</hi> and keeping of God's Commandements, especially of the
two first, which virtually include the rest. By Commandements, therefore, in this
place, are strictly understood the first, and this second, with all the Branches
thereof: Yet because these, especially the first, are the Root of all the rest,
therefore the rest may, by consequence, be understood.</p>
               <p>The <hi>extent</hi> of this Mercy, is to a <hi>Thousand Generations,</hi> that is, for ever: For
if <hi>Israel</hi> had been faithful to their God, they might have continued an happy
People unto this day; and so God's Promise was. God never with-drew His
mercy from them, nor executed His Judgments upon them, but when they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
him, and violated these Commandements. It's true, that the last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which lyes upon them, at this day, had another cause than <hi>Image-Worship,</hi>
and it was the rejection of their Saviour and Messias, when God had sent Him
to save them, according to the Promise made unto their Fathers.</p>
               <p>For the more full understanding of this last part of the Commandement,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IX</label> in
the Commination and Promise, we must consider this with the former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As given to the Jews.</item>
                  <item>2. As by the Light of Nature continued to the Gentiles.</item>
                  <item>3. As most clearly manifested to Christians, by the Gospel.</item>
               </list>
               <p>These Promises and Threats are called by some the Sanction; that is, the
confirmation, ratification, and establishment of a Law: Yet they add no bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
force unto it; for that is wholly from the Will of the Law-giver once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
Onely this they may do, make the Law the more effectual. The
Threatning, is a great restraint from Violation, and the Promise of Reward, a
strong Motive to Obedience. These Threatnings, and Promises in this place,
had special reference to <hi>Israel,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and both the Punishments
threatned, and Mercies promised, were Temporal: for since the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi>
there is no Promise of Spiritual and Eternal Mercy, but in Jesus Christ promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
or exhibited. And it's observable,</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Isra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>2. That in the publique Judgments executed upon them, this is expressed
sometimes as the onely sin; sometimes the first sin; sometimes the chiefest, and
always implyed, as one cause thereof.</p>
               <p>3. That when they observed this Commandement, they enjoyed always this
mercy here promised, in their Successive Generations.</p>

continuance without repentance and faith. There was a special reason, why
these reasons were given in this Commandement, and it was because they were
so prone unto this sin; and he knew that in time to come, this would be the
great transgression.</p>
               <p>Thus far the explication of the words of this Commandement:<label type="milestone">

which is not such, nor can be proved such by reason, or divine revelation, and
also to invent religious rites and ceremonyes, or to use them, and this without

to prophaness. For nothing can be holy or unholy, but that which God hath
made such. For man to determin the object, the kind, the manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,

some other reason may add unto the rules of worship given by God, or they

But that which made up and brought unto perfection both Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Idolatry amongst Christians was, a Doctrine which did peremptorily
affirm (and many did, and do believe it) that a <hi>Wafer,</hi> or a piece of <hi>Bread,</hi> by a
few words of a <hi>Priest</hi> was changed into the <hi>Body of Christ,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> into his
blood contrary to Scripture, reason, sense. And it was, and is commanded,
that, upon this supposed imaginary change, this <hi>Wafer,</hi> and this <hi>Wine</hi> should be
worshipped as God, with divine and religious worship. And it's stupendious,
and a matter of amazement that Christians, who professe the Scriptures to be
the word of God, that the God, who made Heaven and Earth, is onely one, and
our Lord Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be a sign of Gods presence, but to be the onely true God, and so be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
with the highest degree of Worship. Yet the Eternal, Glorious, and
most Just God looks down from Heaven, sees all this, and in due time will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64164:93"/>
judge it. I need not here insist upon particulars, and enumerate the
superstitious rites, and ceremonyes invented, and used either by Heathens,
Jewes, Christians, or Mahumetans. Many of them are expresly named, and
particularly delivered, in Scripture; Many others, both in Christian and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Historyes.</p>
               <p>What is here commanded may be easily understood,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XII</label> not onely from the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,</hi>
but also from the end and scope of this commandement. For it was
added to be a Fense unto the former Commandement, and to prevent the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof. For how can we worship God as God, and the onely God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we know what manner, or kind of worship is most suitable to his Majesty,
acceptable to him, and conducing to his glory, and this in all times. Yet these
things he alone doth know, and hath power to institute; and his institutions
are the onely rule of Worship; and tend most effectually to preserve it pure
and <hi>undefiled.</hi> It's true, that many <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonyes</hi> invented by man, may
have a fair face of <hi>devotion,</hi> and <hi>Reverence,</hi> but they never proved to do any good
but much hurt. For they did beget false notions and apprehensions of the <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
who is to be conceived of by us, according as he is represented in the holy
Scriptures: For if our apprehensions be false, our affections and worship will
be base and adulterate. Therefore the general duty here presented is to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God with that Worship, which he hath instituted in his word, without
<hi>addition,</hi> or diminution. As for circumstances of time, place, and order to be
observed in the Worship of God, either publick, or private, they ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by the general rules of Scripture, particular examples of such, as are
related in the Scripture to have performed the service and worship of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to those general rules, and the prudential dictates of right reason, no
wayes different from, but agreeable to, the Word of God. For these are not
any parts of Worship, but accidentall to the Worship of God, yet not to it
precisely as worship, but as a serious act, which requires in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
thereof due circumstances, order and decency. As for significant
ceremonyes, annexed to the service of God, no wayes conducing to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
performance thereof, I think they are better spared, and omitted, then
used and observed. For though consi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ered in themselves without any reference
to Gods worship, they be indifferent, and so in generall may be lawfull; yet
if we examine their original, the first occasion of their use and institution,
the persons who use, or rather abuse them, and understand withall how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and unprofitable they be, and how offensive unto some weak B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ethren,
and also besides these, may be instituted many more of that kind, and may be
imposed upon the same ground; and that in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they have
been an occasion of superstition: it must needs be concluded by impartial, and
ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icious men, that they are not expedient. To say, and publickly declare that
they have no sanctifying power; that they are neither holy nor unholy, will not
serve the turn: For the same may be said of Images at first when they began to
be used; and do what we can, many of the people do account them to be holy,
make them parts of Gods worship, and are more carefull in the observation of
them, then they are of the more weighty dutyes of Religion.</p>
               <p>To understand the more particular dutyes here commanded,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIII</label> we must out
of the Scripture observe the particular institutions of God. Some of these were
required of God in all times; as Word and Prayer. For the Church did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
serve their God in these two: neither could it at any time continue a
Church without them. There be two acts of worship in respect of the word,
Teaching, and Learning it as the onely Doctrine revealed from Heaven, to direct
man unto eternall life.</p>

It might be taught by many kind of Persons, and many ways. The Persons were
extraordinary, as Prophets and Apostles, and such as were immediately inspired
from Heaven, or ordinary, private or publique. Every Person, and Servant of
God, endued with the knowledge thereof, might instruct one another, every
man his Brother. Parents were bound to instruct their Children, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
their Servants. But the Publique Teachers in Congregations and Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
were persons of more eminent knowledge designed for this purpose, as
ordinary Prophets, Levites, and Doctours, amongst the <hi>Israelites, Presbyters,</hi> and
<hi>Ministers,</hi> who are called <hi>Pastours</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> in the time of the Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

also <hi>Catechists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the <hi>Ordination,</hi> and <hi>Publick Approbation of Teachers,</hi> according to
the Rules of the Word of God, is hither to be reduced as a part of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine, for the manner, is taught by Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or by Writing: By word
of mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as by Preaching, Expounding, Catechizing. The learning of this
Word, is also a part of this Service: And to this belongs <hi>Hearing, Reading, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;</hi>
and asking and proposing Questions; to receive <hi>Answers,</hi> and <hi>Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Meditation, Repetition.</hi> For the means by which the knowledge of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
and Saving-Doctrine is either communicated, or received, are hither to
be referred. This Teaching, and Hearing, are Duties, as commanded by God,
and instituted by Him, as a part of His Worship: Yet such it is not, except the
Doctrine taught and heard be Divine, and from Heaven; and, as such, taught and
received by an undoubted assent and acknowledgment of it as infallible. In the
teaching of this Word, Precepts must be delivere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as Precepts, Prohibitions as
Prohibitions, Promises as Promises, Threatnings as Threatnings, Reproofs as
Reproofs, Exhortations as Exhortations; and so of the rest of the distinct parts
of this Word. To communicate and receive this Word, as a means to know
God His Works, and His Will, is a Duty of this Commandement; but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
and receive it, as the Word of the <hi>everlasting King,</hi> and onely Lord,
with the highest degree of honour and respect, is a Duty of the first Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And God in His <hi>Wisdom</hi> ordained this signification of His Mind, by
Word and Writing, as far more excellent and perfect than that by Images, and
the works of mens hands, as not only base and imper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

This of Word was more sutable unto the Nature and Constitution of Man,
as a <hi>Rational Creature,</hi> who had a Tongue given him to speak, and teach, and an

Works: but also of His Blessed Writings. And when He gave this Law, He
spake it, and did write it; but did not represent and signifie it by any Image,
much less by any work of mens hands. This Representation, by His Word,
was the purest and the best for man that this life is capable of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prayer</hi> is another <hi>principal part,</hi>

by God: And as it is to be made to God and God alone, so it's to be
referred to the first Commandement, as a means of our converse and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God, so it is required in this. And by this it's evident, that no man
can observe this Commandement, except he observe the former. And here we
must distinguish between the <hi>matter,</hi> the <hi>form,</hi> and the <hi>outward expression</hi> of
<hi>Prayer.</hi> All these must be such, as God hath instituted and prescribed to Man in
His Word, and agreeable to the same. There may some circumstances obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
in the performance of this Duty, be left unto the Reason and Prudence
of Man. For God hath not determined all the Particulars to be observed in
the Method, the outward expressions, the gestures. This Prayer may be, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and in secret, the work onely of the Soul: But with company, and in
publique, there must be outward expressions and gestures of the body. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64164:94"/>
expressions, without the inward acts, and affections of the Soul, are not
properly a <hi>Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but onely a <hi>carkass</hi> thereof. To draw near unto God with the

the act of a Man, as he is a <hi>Rational Creature;</hi> much less the Worship of God.
To this head of Prayer, may be reduced Praise, Thanksgiving, Confession of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

in them, then they belong to this of Prayer. Fasting also, and Humiliation, is
annexed to Petition, and especially Deprecation may come under this Head.
Publick Prayer, in an unknown Language, is both unprofitable, and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
For the People, ignorant of the Language wherein it is expressed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say, <hi>Amen.</hi> Yet Set-Forms and premeditated Prayers are not unlawful, if
they be offered to God with Understanding, Attention, and Affection: neither
do they, as some son<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

were some greater efficacy in thsoe words and expressions, then in others, as

many of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Rites</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> were never instituted by Christ and
the Apostles; are needless unprofitable, and at least an occasion of Idolatry; and
certainly Superstitious. And there can be no doubt, that Prayer directed to God
alone, by the mediation of Jesus Christ, without the Worship or Invocation of
Saints and Angels, are effectual, and commanded by God: and Worship, without
any Images, is safe and acceptable to our God. For that Worship onely is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to this Commandement, which is</p>
               <p>1. Instituted of God.</p>

               <p>3. Hath a <hi>Promise</hi> of a <hi>Blessing,</hi> upon the right performance of it. And that
which is not instituted by God, nor in force under the Gospel, and hath not a

                  </gap>e words, forbids <hi>false swearing:</hi> and because, in swearing, we use God's

               </p>
               <p>An <hi>Oath</hi> is a kind of <hi>Testimony,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> and of it self hath no sufficient power to prove
any thing infallibly: therefore, as the person swearing is, such is the <hi>Oath.</hi> If
God swear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have infallible truth, because His Word, much more His <hi>Oath</hi> is
infallible: Because He may both deceive, and be deceived. Yet the better
the man is, the more credible is his <hi>Oath.</hi> And in matters which cannot be
made evident by other proof, an Oath is the highest degree of confirmation:
and more we cannot expect, when more cannot be done. Therefore, upon an
Oath taken we rest. For an Oath, for confirmation, is unto men <hi>an end of all
strife, Heb.</hi> 6. 16. In the Oath of man we have a two-fold Testimony; one of
man, another of God: and the Testimony of God is used to confirm the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Man. In this respect, an Oath is said to be a producing of God, as
Witness of the thing sworn, and the word of Man. Divers <hi>Schoolmen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Casuists,</hi>
and <hi>Civilians,</hi> and <hi>Theological Writers,</hi> both <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> agree in the
<hi>Definition</hi> of an Oath, <hi>That it is a Calling of God to witness for the confirmation of
a matter that is doubtful.</hi> This Definition implyes, that the general nature of
an Oath is Divine Worship: For to call upon God, is a part of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
according to the first and second Commandement. The matter of it is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64164:95"/>
something doubtful, or which may be doubted of, a matter of Controversie, or
contradiction. For an Oath is needless in any thing, which may be evidently
proved any other ways. The Form of it is to produce God, as a Witness of that
which is, or may be doubted of: and He cannot be produced as a Witness, but
by Invocation. The end is, to confirm that which is doubtful, by the
infallible Testimony of God. Yet certainly, there is a more general nature of
an Oath: for it should be so defined, as to comprehend all Oaths; not onely the
Oaths of Men or Angels, as this definition onely doth, but the Oath of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so:
For the Scriptures expresly testifie, that God did swear; yet He cannot
worship Himself, nor call upon Himself, though He did swear by Himself. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an Oath in general, seems to be the confirmation of that, which may be
doubted of, by that which is most certainly and infallibly true and granted by
the Parties, to be assured for to be such.</p>
               <p>1. The matter of an Oath is that which may be doubted of, yet is certain in
it self, and ought to be certainly known to him that sweareth.</p>
               <p>2. Ordinarily it's such a Proposition, as cannot be cleared by demonstration,
or any other way.</p>
               <p>3. The end of it, is confirmation to him that knows it not certainly.</p>
               <p>4. This confirmation must be made by an higher, and an infallible truth: and
such is the <hi>Eternal Being</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> which yet can be no proof or confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but to him that grants that God is, as all should grant. Yet in this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I humbly submit to better judgments. Here it's to be noted, that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<hi>God is</hi> is higher and more certain to man then this, that God is so, or so
affected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o His <hi>Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ture;</hi> or this, That God will do so or so, as He promiseth or
threatneth. And as all Proofs are <hi>Per Notlus,</hi> so an Oath is.</p>
               <p>After this consideration of the nature of an Oath,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> follows the distinction of
Oaths. For there is an Oath of God, and an Oath by God. An Oath, by God,
is taken by Angels or Men. The Oaths intended in the Commandement, are
such as are taken by <hi>Men:</hi> For the Commandement was given to Man. Of these
are many Distinctions: For some are judici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, some extrajudicial; some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
some implicite; which, besides others, I pass by. The principal, and most usual,
is that of <hi>Assertory.</hi> and <hi>Promissory. Assertory</hi> is of that which is past or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
A <hi>Promissory,</hi> of something to come: and this latter is often used to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<hi>Leagues</hi> or <hi>Contracts,</hi> publique or private. And the thing doubted of and
confirmed is the sincere intention of the Party, promising for the present, and
the performance of the thing promised for the time to come. The confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in both these kind of Oaths, is the same, and that, is by calling God to
Witness. These, and all other Oaths, used by men, whether they be publique, or
private<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> presuppose the infallible clear O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>niscience of the Deity, and His most
perfect Justice: and the Party, swearing by that very act, pretends to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
both, And upon this, credit is given, because he can bring no higher
proof; and also it's supposed, that no man will forfeit his <hi>interest</hi> in God, as all
perjured persons do. By this Act of Swearing we submit, and put our selves
into the hands of the great Judge, to punish or reward, condemn or justifie us,
as we shall, in this particular, prove <hi>innocent</hi> or <hi>guilty.</hi> For there is no Oath,
but in some respect is execratory. Therefore it ought not to be taken, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
due deliberation, and with that <hi>Reverence,</hi> which shall be suitable unto the
Majesty of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>upream Lord, whom we call to Witness. And seeing no Oath,
but <hi>By God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> can be in many things a sufficient confirmation, therefore all Oaths
ought to be <hi>By God</hi> at least by consequence, and taken in such a manner, as is
agreeable to His Majesty.</p>
               <p>We are commanded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t unto any other, is Idolatry. This is a Reason why we may take an
Oath from Idolaters, swearing by their Idols, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:64164:96"/>
As for the <hi>Rites</hi> used in this <hi>Act;</hi> as, <hi>Putting the hand under the Thigh</hi> of him
to whom the Oath is taken, as <hi>Abraham's</hi> Servant did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 9. Or, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the hand towards <hi>Heaven,</hi> as the Angel did, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 7. Or, laying the hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Altar, according to the <hi>Custome</hi> of some places, or upon the Bible, as it is
with us; they are indifferent, and not of the <hi>essence</hi> of an Oath. They seem to
be added, to signifie what a serious, solemn, and weighty thing it is to <hi>swear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sin forbidden, is not, to swear, but to swear falsly: for we must not take
the Name of the Lord our God in vain; which, as you heard, is to swear falsly.
A man swears falsly in an <hi>Assertory Oath,</hi> when he either swears that which he
doth not certainly know to be true, or that which he knows to be false. For the
thing confirmed by such an Oath, ought to be certainly known unto the <hi>Person</hi>
swearing: In a <hi>Promissory Oath,</hi> he is guilty, who when he swears, either hath
no intention, or no sincere and constant resolution to perform the thing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
He also, who after he hath sworn, either forgets, or neglects the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
or upon indifferent and unjust grounds, altereth his mind, and seeks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
<hi>evasions,</hi> and takes advantage upon imperfect expressions, and so
doth manifest, that he doth not truly fear the Majesty of that great and glorious
Lord, whose Name he used, that by it he might make men believe, and depend
upon His <hi>Promise,</hi> confirmed by Oath.</p>
               <p>Thus far the Sin prohibited: The penalty threatned upon the sinne commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
follows in these words, <hi>The Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his
Name in vain:</hi> Where we have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Sin, the Punishment, the Judge. The sin
is, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our <hi>Yea</hi> should be <hi>Yea,</hi> and our <hi>Nay Nay;</hi> otherwise we shall be guilty. The
punishment is this, <hi>That we should not be held as guiltless and innocent.</hi> Where it's

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o we shall be judged: and, not to be
judged guiltless, is, to be judged, and also punished as guilty and that certainly,
and unavoidably. For the <hi>Septuagint</hi> u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unto us, the true <hi>Sense</hi> to be this; that the perjured Wretch shall in no
wise escape, but certainly shall be punished. The Judge is the Lord, who knows
the Hearts of men; and, as a Judge, takes special notice of all sins, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of such heynous Crimes as <hi>Perjury</hi> is: And though such guilty persons
should escape the hand of Man, yet they shall certainly feel the hand of God. The
punishment due unto this sin is not onely <hi>eternal;</hi> which certainly, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of, shall be suffered; but also some <hi>Temporal exemplary Penalty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that men

they shall be punished, God hath reserved to himself. He sometimes makes
use of the Magistrate: though with us, the Pillory is a punishment less by far
then ought to be inflicted. But many times the Magistrate is in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
too remiss, and many times is ignorant: yet God will in no wise suffer this
sin to escape unpunished.</p>

               <p>2. The end of an Oath is to glorifie God; to make that credible to others,
which cannot any other wayes be made sufficiently evident, and which is of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial

why these blessed ordinances make very light impressions, or none at all upon
our Souls; or if these impressions are lively, they be soone razed out again. We
should remember that in these acts of worship, we have to deal with God, and
converse with him, as he with us, and we approach his Eternal Throne. And
how much wil it dishonour him, and derogate from his glory, to be so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
irreverent, heedlesse in his very presence? And if we duly consider, we
shall easily perceive how heynous the offence will be, in these performances to
suffer our minds to rove, and wander, and to leave our hearts behind us; or
come before him, and approach his Throne onely with our lips, or worship
him with base prophane and indisposed Souls. There be some who by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

contrary to this Commandement. It's a matter of Lamentation to all Gods
Children that when they sincerely intend, and seriously endeavour to performe
their Religious service to their God in a due and holy manner, yet cannot so fix
their thoughts, continue their heavenly disposition, and raise and increase their
devotion, but find their minds ready to wander, and be distracted, and their
devotion to be interrupted, or abated: and in that respect acknowle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

state of glory, wherein they shall be free from all distractions, and worship their

aloud the inward, prophane, irreverent, and base disposition of their Souls. Yet
though hereby God is dishonour'd, and his worship polluted, they are senslesse
of any such sin even when the Judgments of God lye heavy upon them for this
sin. We have an evident example hereof in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
receiving of the Sacrament of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> were so severely punisht,

The dutyes commanded are easily understood by the law of contrariety. And
for the better knowledge of them, we must consider, that God doth require,
and command us not onely to worship him alone, and with that kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
he hath instituted, but to perform his instituted worship in an holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
manner. And this due manner of Worship is the thing here command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
So that as God is the object, so his Worship is the subject of this <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
devotion,</hi> holinesse, here required. And the first thing commanded is
<hi>swearing truly,</hi> and in such a manner as that God may be honoured, and that
the partyes swearing may be innocent. And God in these words doth not
command us to swear (for that belongs unto the first precept) but to swear

man would be such, as that many times an Oath would be not onely conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
but in some respect necessary, he thought it fit to regulate the same. And
therefore did command us.</p>

                  <item>1. To swear by his name, not by creatures or false Gods.</item>
                  <item>2. Because in judgments, leagues, and contracts, it was to be solemnly
used with some Rite and ceremony; he therefore appoints to be a
part of his Worship, and that not onely to men but Angels.</item>
                  <item>3. Because it would not prove to be of no force and effect if not taken in
due manner; in this Commandement he therefore prescribes the
manner and binds to observe it.</item>

                  </item>
                  <item>2. The matter must be of that weight and importance, as to be worthy

is no better way to do it than by <hi>an Oath.</hi> Otherwise, an Oath is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse;

                  </gap>ite
to premise some generals concerning the order, and relation of it to
the former; concerning the reason, and cause of a Sabbath; and concerning
the end.</p>
               <p>1. The order is clear enough. For after that God had required subjection
to himself, and secured his soveraign power in the First; instituted and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the services which man must perform unto him, prohibiting all superstitious
inventions of men in the Second; and prescribed the manner how his institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
must be performed in the Third; he determins a certaine time, wherein,
all other businesse set aside, religious dutyes ought to be performed unto him in
a more solemn manner, and that time consecrated in a special manner to his
<hi>Divine Majesty</hi> in this Fourth. This is the order and connexion of this part of
the Law with the rest, whereby we understand that this Commandeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth
the former necessarily, so that without them its nothing but a bare
duration, and part of time, no wayes different in it self from other times. And
for this reason must of necessity derive its morality, so far as it is moral, from
some thing antecedent.</p>
               <p>2. The reason,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> and cause why God did determin a certain portion of time,
for rest and sanctification, followes in the second place to be considered: and it's
the condition of man in this life, which is such, as that it did in some sort ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
require it. For man in innocency had his secular employment, if we
may so call it. For he was put in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and in that Garden God had plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Eastward in <hi>Eden,</hi> to dresse it and keep it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 15. And this work must
take up some time. But since his Fall, he must eat his bread in the sweat of his
face: and as his necessities, so his worldly employments are not few; but so
much of his time is taken up in these earthly works, that he cannot keep a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Sabbath to his God, as we hope to do in Heaven. For this cause God in
his Wisdome thought it fit to measure out of his time a determinate portion,
wherein man must sequester himself from the businesse of the World, and spend
the same in his better and diviner imployments. What portion was fittest, and
sufficient neither too much, nor too little, he onely knew, as He onely had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to limit it, and bind man to the <hi>Sanctification</hi> of it. The Jewes observed
one day in seaven, in a certain order, so likewise do Christians, though the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day of the Jewes was the last, as Christians is the first of the week, as our
weeks are now reckoned. And if any people in the world, then surely Jewes
and Christians had their warrant for the observation of holy times, from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
What the Patriarchs from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses</hi> did in this particular, we
cannot so clearly determin, because the Scripture in this point is silent. That
God set a special <hi>Character</hi> upon the seventh day of creation is evident, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64164:99"/>
2. 3. Because having finished his glorious works in six dayes, he rested the 7th.
and blessed and hallowed that day, and so he did none of the rest. Some take
it for certain, that God even then ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ituted the Sabbath: and others do think it
probable that God from the beginning required of man the 7th. part of his
time, and the 10th. part of his goods for his service; and reserved both as a
chief rent to be paid to him as chief Lord, in acknowledgment of his supreme
dominion. If reason were consulted, it could not deny, but that these are due
to God; especially if he require them by a command: If Scripture which is a
rule above humane reason; some think it might be demonstrated, that <hi>God
did command Man to gave both in all times.</hi> Yet to give both, is not moral
but positive. That is properly <hi>Moral</hi> which is intrinsecally good, just, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
and such as directly and immediately makes a man better; and that which
is good in this manner cannot any wayes be performed by a wicked man, or
an hypocrite. Yet the tenth of a mans goods, and the 7th. of his time, may be
given to God by a <hi>Cain,</hi> by an hypocritical <hi>Pharisee:</hi> tho with an heart rightly
qualified they cannot be offered to God by such kind of persons, whose very
hearts are corrupt and depraved. That which is just and holy in it self, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
a man acceptable to God is of universal, and perpetual obligation from
the beginning. If any particular duty afterwards become such by vertue of
Gods command, though the matter of the duty and the thing commanded in
it self be not intrinsecally just, then that duty is not moral but positive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
its morality, <hi>ab extrinseco</hi> from Gods Command, not from the nature of
the thing. In respect of this <hi>Morality</hi> not onely the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and the precept concerning the Tree of Knowledge, of good and evil,
may be said to be moral: and so moral and ceremoniall Lawes, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
dif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erent should be consounded. Yet if any will call such commands <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
moral,</hi> I will not wrangle about words: Yet I must say that term <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
moral</hi> is not proper nor <hi>accurate.</hi> As in Grammer there be words which
derive their signification, and in Logick arguments which receive the force of
arguing from <hi>Primitive;</hi> so even in this decalogue, which we call the moral law
there be Commandements which derive their morality from others, and all
from the first. Yet this is the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ference between such Commandements, and
others which are purely positive, or ceremonial, That these derivatives have a
nearer connexion with pure morals, and conduce more effectually to pure ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and holinesse, then these positives do, whose matter in it self is indifferent
and no better.</p>

God knew this better then we do, and therefore so strictly required the

               <p>The Explication is large.</p>

                     </gap>on</hi> of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi>
sometimes signifies, to have a special care to keep or observe a thing, and the
<hi>Arabick</hi> word<note n="b" place="margin">This word is used by the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator.</note> 
                  <hi>Natar,</hi> is of the same signification: And the meaning of
it is; <hi>Have a care, and take special heed to sanctifie the Sabbath:</hi> For when we
are forgetful of a thing, we neglect it. To remember a thing, is sometimes to
do it, if it be a thing to be done: as when God saith, <hi>He will remember His Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
it's meant, he will be careful to keep and perform it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 15. God had
a special reason to prefix this word, which signifies or imports special care and
heed.</p>
               <p>1. Because Religion did so much depend upon the Sanctification of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,

               <p>2. I believe the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> had much neglected the Sabbath and
Holy Times; neither if they had been careful, could they so well observe them,
because of their cruel Bondage.</p>
               <p>3. Some of these <hi>Israelites,</hi> contrary to God's Command, went out upon the

though a special <hi>Item;</hi> yet here it's specified by the Object, <hi>The Sabbath-Day;</hi>
and the end, the Sanctification of it. For the thing to be remembred,
and so carefully observed, was the Sanctification of that time. The word <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
taken from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, and used in many Languages of the
World, signifies</p>
               <p>1. By it self <hi>Rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Joyned with the word, <hi>Day,</hi> a time of <hi>Rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. A certain determinate time of <hi>Rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. An <hi>Holy Rest</hi> not a rest from all Works, but such as are secular.</p>
               <p>5. The word, <hi>Day,</hi> doth distinguish it from Years, and Moneths, and Weeks,
as greater and longer times; and from an hour, as a shorter measure of time:
And because it may signifie, either a natural day of 24 hours; or as it is an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
day, so far as it is a time of work, and is opposed to a Night, which is a time
appointed by God for man to rest in. For here it's differenced from those six
days wherein man may labour, and do his secular works, which also had their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
nights, and times of rest, from the Creation. And as our secular<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>work,
on other days, is not confined merely to the time of Light, natural from the
Sun approaching unto, or appearing in our <hi>Horizon;</hi> no more is this Sabbath-Day.
Yet God did not take from it, nor deny man, in it, a Night, as a time of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64164:100"/>
                  <hi>Rest.</hi> And men, in these things, should not be more precise than God would
have them to be.</p>
               <p>It's not material, whether we turn it, <hi>The Sabbath;</hi> or, <hi>A Sabbath,</hi> though
<hi>The Sabbath</hi> is more emphatical, and more agreeable to the <hi>Hebrew, Chaldee,
Septuagim;</hi> all which put a double Particle, One upon the <hi>day;</hi> another upon
<hi>Sabbath, Remember The Day of The Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This word, <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> doth not determine, whether it should be one day in
a Year, or in a Moneth, or in a Week; Whether it should be the first, or last of
a Week, or any of the intervenient Days: neither doth it inform us, when the
Week begins or ends. Yet that People of the Jews might easily understand,
that he meant that particular <hi>Sabbath-Day,</hi> wherein they were prohibited to
gather <hi>Manna,</hi> which God denyed to give them that time. And if they had been
ignorant of this, they might easily know, that it signified such a time, as God
should determine, and judge sufficient, for preservation of Religion and His
Worship, and yet leave a competent portion of time for man's necessities. This
appears by the Explication following.</p>
               <p>For all this, I do not think, that God did ever make such account of this or
that <hi>seventh day,</hi> as that one and the same should be of necessity, and of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
and perpetual Obligation to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> Neither is there any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
in the number of <hi>seven,</hi> or any necessary dependence of the continuance
of Religion upon this or that seventh day. The light of Natural Reason seems
unable of it self to know this time; yet if it be once revealed by God, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but acknowledge the Equity of it. It may dictate unto us, that if God once
determine the time, that time is the fittest. The <hi>Heathens</hi> might have some
<hi>Astronomical</hi> knowledge of the seventh day; but <hi>Theological</hi> they could have
none, except by Tradition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To sanctifie it]</hi> This is the principall part of this Commandement,<label type="milestone">

mans duty, <hi>To sanctifie this day.</hi> But its one thing for God, another thing
for man to <hi>sanctifie</hi> it. God may hallow it by his practise, as he did the first
7th. day of the World; or by his institution, and command: For his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
institution, designation of the day makes it relatively holy, distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it from, and advanceth it above other dayes, and binds man to honour it in
his practice. Man sactifies it, for that is the <hi>sanctification</hi> here intended, yet
presupposing the former.</p>
               <p>1. When he es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>2. When not onely he rests from secular works, but applyes that time to
the due performance of those heavenly services, which God requires of him
especially and principally on this day. It's a time wherein the soul must be
more imployed then the Body: it's a time wherein we must converse more
with God than men, with Heaven than with earth: it's a time ordained not
for the temporal so much, as the spiritual, and eternal good of man: it's a time
wherein we must not onely cease from our worldly labours, businesse, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Thus instituted of God, and thus hallowed of man, its the best, and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and noble part of our time, and resembles in some degree that eternal
Sabbath, which we hope to hallow more perfectly in heaven: When we shall
be free from all sin and sorrow, and <hi>Rest</hi> our selves with unspeakable content
and joy in our God! This will be that glorious Festival, and Holy-day, the
Sun whereof shall never set but ever shine! For it shall have no end! But this

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64164:100"/>
That whatsoever time God shall determine and design to man for a Sabbath,
man must remember it, and be very carefull not onely to rest in it, and forbear

               <p>The former words; <hi>Six dayes shalt thou labour and do all thy works,</hi> are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a <hi>Command,</hi> nor a <hi>Permission,</hi> nor a Toleration, nor indulgence in strict
sense, whatsoever they may imply. But the proper intention of them is to
single out six dayes, that God may let us know that none of them is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
but the 7th. following. They first presuppose that measure of time we
call a week, according to the number of the first seven dayes of the World which
God created in six dayes, and ceased from Creation the 7th.</p>
               <p>2. They imply that the Sabbath is weekly.</p>
               <p>3. That it's none of the Six dayes. In these six dayes man may labour
and do his Work, and all his Work. <hi>By Mans Work</hi> may be meant,</p>
               <p>1. The work of sin in opposition to the Works of God, and of the Spirit,
which are contrary: and as God never gave any liberty, so he never granted
any time for sin. From sin we must keep a <hi>Perpetual Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Mans work is his labour and imployment in the affaires of this world,
which are lawfull, and in themselves no way unlawfull. They are not onely
lawfull, but, in the time allotted by God, necessary; and he that neglects them
shall offend. And by this work is not meant onely the toyle of the body, but
the thoughts, cares, and consultations of the soul: which both are unlawfull on
the Sabbath, not onely because God hath exempted all that time from them,
but also because they will distract and hinder us in the work of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>As these words are no command; so they are no prohibition of serving God
and sequestring some part of the Six days for performance of heavenly dutyes.
For as man upon the Sabbath, may eat and drink, and do works of necessity,
mercy, and charity; so upon these Six dayes, he may and must serve and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
his God, and single out some parts of them for that purpose. Every day we
should present our selves before our God, and converse with him, and make
some part of it a Sabbath. And if by Gods gracious providence our condition
be such, as that we enjoy a larger measure of this secular time then ordinary, so
that we have leasure to sanctifie the same, our sin is great, if we neglect the
opportunity, and spend our precious time in idlenesse, vanity, and sin, or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
businesse of the world. We must not neglect the dutyes of our calling;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64164:101"/>
and our necessary imployments, or spend our spare time onely in contemptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and devotions, so as to omit the opportunityes that God hath given us to
do good to others. But we must take heed le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> we turn our Religion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas it's said;</hi> Thou shalt do (all) thy, Work.</p>
               <p>By the Particle, <hi>(all)</hi> may be signified all kinds of secular works, though they
be many, and various, according to the multitude and variety of employments,
which are honest and beneficial, or any wayes convenient for man. God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
not any; he gives full liberty and latitude as mans condition shall require.
Yet man should be so provident, and so diligent especially if he have multitude
of <hi>Businesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or distract or hinder himself in religious services, and the sanctification of
the 7th. day. Neither must he cast himself so into straits, as to impose upon
himself necessityes upon that day, wherein both body and mind should be free
and prepared to Worship his God. For though works of necessity may be done
that day, yet no man that shall create necessityes unto himself can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused.</p>

                  <hi>(But the</hi> 7th. <hi>day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God</hi>) inform
us of three things.</p>
               <p>1. That the Sabbath is one day in seven.</p>
               <p>2. The Seventh.</p>
               <p>3. That this Sabbath is the Lords; not onely because he rested in it, and did
blesse, and sanctifie it; but because though he be Lord of all time, yet he hath
separated it from other dayes, and challengeth a special propriety in it, so that
man must not have so much as the use of that time for his work, but must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
it to Gods work: And to engrosse this day to our selves for wordly
employments must needs be <hi>Sacriledge.</hi> That which is the Lords, must be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto to the Lord.</p>
               <p>Yet here it may be a question; When the Sabbath did commence, and which
was the first day from whence we must begin to number till we come unto the
7th, To say that this day which <hi>God</hi> Commanded <hi>Israel</hi> to observe was the
7th, day of Creation, wherein <hi>God</hi> rested, it's hard to prove. That it was the
7th. weekly from the first falling of <hi>Manna</hi> is certain; and so no doubt, they
understood it. But whether that fell out to be the 7th, of the Creation, who
can tell? It might be so, and it might be otherwise. Yet herein we have no
need to perplex our selves. As they knew their Sabbath, so we do ours. Time
in it self is neither holy, nor unholy. Its holy <hi>(ab extrinseco</hi>) from <hi>Gods</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and mans observation of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Let us be carefull to do our duty which is
sincerely <hi>to sanctifie our</hi> 7th. <hi>day,</hi> which is the next thing in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>In it thou shalt do no Manner of Work,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>IX</label> or, thou shalt not do any work.</p>
               <p>In the former Six dayes all work, any work except the work of sin might be
done; in this, not any work. And in these words, with those which immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
follow, we may observe and consider.</p>
               <p>1. What it is to sanctifie.</p>
               <p>2. Who the persons be that are commanded to sanctifie this day.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The sanctification</hi> is understood by the cessation and rest. The rest is, we
must not do any work; where by work is meant secular work, such as may be
done lawfully in the six dayes. These are not onely such works as toyle the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but also such as distract<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and take up the Soul. Therefore here is forbidden
Travayling, and passing from place to place, either on foot or horse-back, or any
other wayes; all labours of husbandry, of trades, and manufactures; all secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
studyes, and exercises in humane learning, all consultations debates and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64164:101"/>
about State-affaires; all judicial proceedings in secular Courts; all
playes, sports, recreations, which either toyl the body or distract the soul, and
take up so much of this holy time as secular businesses do; all thoughts and
cares about worldly things, all words, and conferences, so farr as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with the holy observation of the time. For mans works imply all
these.</p>
               <p>Yet this clause doth not prohibit such works, as are no wayes prophane, but
rather tend unto the sanctification of the day.</p>
               <p>The Jewes might circumcise upon that day;</p>
               <p>The Priests might kill their Sacrifices, and make their fires to burn
them.</p>
               <p>The Disciples must pluck ears of Corn, and eat them:</p>
               <p>Our Saviour might heal the sick.</p>
               <p>Any man might Water and fodder his Cattle, or lift up a beast fallen into a
ditch, or deliver man or beast out of danger. All which inform us,</p>
               <p>1. That necessary works, and such as tend to the preservation of man or
beast are lawfull to be done this day.</p>
               <p>2. That all such works as tend to the sanctification may be done likewise.
People may travail to the place of <hi>assembling,</hi> to hear the Word of God, to pray,
to perform holy dutyes. The Minister may study to prepare himself, may
preach, and teach, and do other ministerial works, even unto wearinesse. We
may eat, and drink, refresh our selves, visit the sick, heal them, administer Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
relieve the poor, and not prophane the time. This was the Rest: Yet
what was the end of this Rest? For this was but to prepare and make way to a
far more noble work, to which this rest was subordinate. For surely 'twas not
Gods intention to command man to cease from his secular works to do worse,
or to do nothing. For if the thing commanded had been onely rest, then a
Beast might keep the Sabbath as well as Man, and receive as much benefit from
it. Therefore this time was subordinate to an higher end then rest: and rest
was ordayned for a diviner imployment, as the service of our God, and the
sanctification of our souls. For we must Remember the Sabbath day to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
it: But it cannot be a Sabbath except we rest; it cannot be sanctified ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we apply, and consecrate that time of rest to God and the service of his
glorious Majesty. The Jewes were directed by the Prophet how to observe a
Sabbath in these words: If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from
doing thy pleasure on mine holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of
the Lord, honourable, and shalt honour him, not doing thine own wayes, nor
finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words; then thou
shalt delight thy self in the Lord, <hi>Esay.</hi> 58. 13. 14. In which words we

               <p>Magistrates and Governours: And these must</p>
               <p>1. In their own persons rest and sanctifie this day.</p>
               <p>2. They must cause others, subject to their power, so far as in them is, to do
the like: For as they are charged, so they must have care of the persons sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto them, and use all means to cause them to serve their God, and obey
Him, as well as themselves. In this respect it's true, that <hi>Magistratus est cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stos
utriusque tabulae,</hi> and so is every Superiour invested with power.</p>
               <p>The Inferiours, are either rational, or irrational. Rational, are either mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Family, or of the State, or Church, or Strangers.</p>
               <p>Members of the Family are either Children, as Sons and Daughters, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
as Man-servants, Maid-servants.</p>
               <p>Strangers, are either strangers in a Family, or in a City, and they may be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
or Aliens, and Aliens may be Proselytes, and incorporate, or not incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>Irrational, as Ox or Ass, or any Beast that is used for travel, or labour, in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or other Works of Husbandry. This last of Brutes is not so to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
as though the Law were given to Brutes, and irrational Creatures: For
they are not capable of Laws. The Law is not given to them, but of them. It's
given to Man, who is the Owner and Master of the Beast.</p>
               <p>1. That he might be merciful unto his Beast: For God will not have man
to be cruel unto his labouring and harmless Beast: For he that is cruel to these
will be cruel to his Servants, and such as are under his power.</p>
               <p>2. Because his Beast could not be used for Travail, Carriage, Draught, Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
treading out the corn, or other service, except some man, as the Master, or
his children, or his Servants direct them, and make that use of them.</p>
               <p>And from hence it's evident, That one end of this Commandement was the
refreshment of Man and Beast: and God, in this, had respect unto poor Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
who might by cruel and covetous Masters be abused and oppressed, and
also debarred from the service of their God, to the hazard of their poor souls.
Poor Servants had Souls, as well as the best, were bound to serve their God,
and had as much need of Spiritual comfort, as free men, or their Masters. And in
those days, if any Servants were under cruel and prophane Masters, their case
was lamentable: For being either taken in War, or sold, or born Servants,
their Masters might force them to labour that day, or to suffer cruelly, if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
did not relieve them.</p>
               <p>These words signifie, that no man in power should suffer any, Subject unto
them, to prophane the Sabbath, so far as they could hinder it.</p>
               <p>Neither did this charge unto Superiours excuse Inferiours, who had liberty
to sanctifie this day, if they did neglect, or prophane it. And such as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,
were bound to use all means to obtain this liberty to serve their God.
To say, that this Commandement was given of Servants, not unto Servants, is
not true: For then it would follow, that if they had good and Religious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
or such as would permit them to observe the day, yet they were not bound
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64164:102"/>
unto that duty, neither did they offend, if they did prophane it. So far, indeed, as
they were merely passive, and subject to the absolute power of their Superiours,
who would in no wise suffer them to rest, and sanctifie this day, when they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it, and they should every way endeavour to enjoy this liberty, and after all
this could not, then the sin must lye upon their Masters and Superiours, upon
whom God would charge it, and that heavily too. And let all Inferiours who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
this liberty, be thankful to their God, who hath shewed such great mercy to
them.</p>
               <p>The reason of the Institution of the Sabbath follows; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>IX</label> And it's from the end,
which, in general, is the remembrance of some great and glorious work of God,
for which he ought to be praised and glorified. One Reason why the <hi>Israelites</hi>
must rest, and also give liberty to their Servants to rest, is, because they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were Servants in the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and had little intermission granted
them either for to refresh their Bodies, or sanctifie Holy Times. And this very
rest and liberty might put them in mind of their great deliverance, and stir them
up to thankfulness upon their Sabbath-days, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 15. Another Reason, and
the same more general, was, from the great work of Creation, worthy of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
remembrance. And herein God is a Pattern, and proposeth his own exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
unto man for imitation; that as he in six days created Heaven and Earth,
and rested the seventh day, and so sanctified, and honoured it above other days;
so man might labour six days, and rest the seventh, and sanctifie it to the Lord.
This example doth more distinctly and clearly inform man, that the World was
not from everlasting, but had beginning, and that God did create it, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the universal and supream Lord of Heaven and Earth, by the Work of six
days.</p>
               <p>The seventh day, wherein he rested from his work, was a fit time for man's
rest, that on that day man might contemplate the glorious Works of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
God to be the Creatour, and every Sabbath say, <hi>Thou art worthy, Oh
Lord, to receive glory, honour, and power: for thou hast created all things, and for
thy pleasure they are, and were created,</hi> Rev. 4. 11. Besides the example of God's
labour, rest, and Sanctification, He knew that six days in the week was a fit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of time for man's secular works, and one in seven, for Diviner Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And this is given the reason, why God sanctified the seventh day, and
blessed it, because that after, in six days, He had created Heaven, and Earth, He
rested the 7th day. And howsoever this great Work of Creation is never to be
forgotten by Man, yet because to sinful man, the Work of Redemption is a
greater blessing; Therefore the first day of the Week, being the day of Christ's
Resurrection, and the Restauration of Mankind, is more to be observed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.
The Lord said unto <hi>Judah, Behold, the days come, when it shall be
no more said, The Lord liveth, which brought up the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>out of the
Land of Aegypt; But the Lord liveth, that brought the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>from the
Land of the North, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 16. 14, 15. So it may be said to us Christians, since
the time of Christ's glorification, That it shall be no more said, the Lord liveth,
that in six days made Heaven and Earth, and rested the 7th day: But the Lord
liveth, who after His Death and cruel Passion is risen again, and hath redeemed
sinful man from Hell, and Eternal Death. For if two great Blessings be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
one after the other, the latter, and the greater is more to be remembred,
and the time thereof rather to be observed. Therefore we do not observe the
7th day, wherein God rested from the Work of Creation, but the first day, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Christ rose again, and rested from His Work of Humiliation. And though
therein we do not forget the Work of Creation, yet we rather remember the
Work of Redemption, and glorifie our God for the same.</p>
               <p>

From this Explication of the Words of God we may understand,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XII</label> what is here
commanded, and what is here forbidden. The things commanded are
two:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Rest,</hi> For we must remember a Sabbath, and in the same we must do no
manner of work.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Sanctification,</hi> For we must remember the Sabbath-day to sanctifie it.
<hi>Rest,</hi> is two-fold.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of the Body.</item>
                  <item>2. Of the Mind; and in both these we must rest.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. The Body must rest from secular works, which hinder and disturb us in
the service of our God.</p>
               <p>2. The Soul must cease from such Thoughts, Cares, Meditations, and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which as much distract us in the Worship of our God, as labours of the
Body do. Again, bodily works of man, as man endued with understanding,
cannot be done without the Soul, attending, directing, and moving it, much less
can Heavenly Duties be performed without the Soul, which in the time of
these Services must be drawn off from the World, and sixed upon far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Objects. And because many Games and Sports, which are accounted
Recreations, do as much toyl the Body, and distract and take up the Soul, as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Works do, therefore we must needs judge them to be contrary to the Rest
here commanded. And our very words of Conference and Discourse, upon
this time, may be such, as are neither consistent with the Rest, nor the Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
required in this Precept. Yet this Rest is not to be so strictly taken, as
though all kind of Work, and Bodily Labour were unlawful on this day. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p>1. Works of Necessity may be done this day: and which those are, the

who were so precise in the observation of the outward Rest, could not deny
unto our Saviour, but that upon the Sabbath it was lawful to lift a Beast out of a
Pit or Ditch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into which it was then fallen. And upon the same ground, it
cannot be unlawful on that day to fight and defend our selves, against an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>2. Works which tend to the refreshment and ordinary preservation of Man
and Beast cannot be unlawful. Therefore, on this day we cloath our selves,
and take our ordinary food and repast; and a Beast may be watered, and fed this
day, as well as others.</p>
               <p>3. Works which tend unto the Sanctification of the Day are not prohibited:
For we may travail unto, and return from the places of publick Assemblies for
Prayer, Reading, Preaching, and other Divine Services. The Priests, under the
Law, did kill their Sacrifices, and so prophaned the Sabbath, and were blameless,
<hi>Math.</hi> 12. 5. And it was thought no prophanation, to circumcise an Infant
upon that day, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 23. Of this nature is the toyl and labour of the Ministers
in their several Congregations.</p>
               <p>4. Neither is any work of mercy, as visiting the Sick, administring Physick,
relieving the Poor, and such like, contrary to this Rest. And the reason of all
this is, because the Sabbath is for man, and not man for the Sabbath: and therein
God intended our good, not our hurt. The principal thing required, is the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Worship of God, from an heart seriously bent, and inclined thereunto: nor
the performance of some outward piece of service, in such a precise nick of time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Yet we must take care always to have a sanctified heart, and a desire to sanctifie
the same, and what we lose one time, we must endeavour to recompence at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>

The second Duty here commanded,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XIII</label> is Sanctification of the Day: and this is
the principal Duty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o which Rest is subordinate. For as there can be no San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
without Rest; so there can be no Rest acceptable to God, but that
which tends to Sanctification: An Holy Rest is the thing here commanded. It
must be the Rest of a Man, and not of a Beast, and the Rest of an Holy Man, as
Holy. Therefore, this Commandement presupposeth Man to be habitually
sanctified: For an unsanctified man cannot sanctifie a Sabbath, as God requires
it to be sanctified. This Sanctification consists in the performance of Holy
Duties in the Worship of God. The Object of this Worship, must be God
alone: The parts of the Worship must be such as He hath instituted: and the
acts of Worship must be performed by persons, who are sanctified, and in an
holy manner. And to consecrate this 7th Day to these Holy Services, is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing here prescribed. Therefore, to this Sanctification is required,</p>
               <p>1. A knowledge of the day, that it's determined by God.</p>
               <p>2. A preparation of the whole man, with a desire and resolution to observe
it.</p>
               <p>3. An actual application of that time, to a performance of Religious Duties:
and whatsoever Works tend most to the glory of God, those do most sanctifie
the Day.</p>
               <p>This is the reason why Christ's miraculous Cures did not prophane this day,
and that Works of Mercy are so suitable to this time. Though publick, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational
Duties are principally intended; yet Family, and Closet-Duties
are required: and though other days may be sanctified and observed, as times of
Humiliation or Thanksgiving, yet this is done upon a more, general ground, and
not by vertue of this Commandement, which is confined to the <hi>Seventh Day.</hi>
What the particular services of the Sabbath be, I need not mention: For they
are such as God hath instituted; and the principal are Word and Prayer, as you
heard in the Explication of the second Precept.</p>
               <p>The sins here forbidden, are,</p>
               <p>1. All prophane and sinful thoughts,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XIV</label> words, and deeds, which unhallow all
times, and especially this. These are sins in the six days, but more heynous sins
on the seventh.</p>
               <p>2. All secular thoughts, words, deeds, which are contrary unto, and non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with, the Rest and sanctification of this time, and with Diviner Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
These are lawful at other times, unlawful in this.</p>
               <p>3. The neglect of Holy Duties in this time of Rest. For though we should
rest this day, not onely from all secular labours and works, but also from worldly
thoughts, and motions of the mind (if it were possible) and not apply our selves
to Religious Worship; yet the Day remains to us unsanctified.</p>
               <p>4. All prophane Sports, yea, and all Recreations, which hinder and distract
us in the service of our God.</p>
               <p>5. All Hypocritical, all irreverent; yea, all imperfect performance of Holy
Duties. Men may be strict, zealous, devout in the outward parts of Religion,
and yet stand at a great distance from their God. For God requires not any
kind of Sanctification of this day, but that which is hearty and sincere. And
because our best service is imperfect, therefore we can keep no perfect Sabbath
on Earth: that is reserved for Heaven. Let us therefore endeavour the best,
aim at perfection, desire pardon of defects, and long after the estate of glory;
wherein we shall perfectly hallow an Eternal Sabbath before the Eternal
King.</p>

There he many causes of the prophanation,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XV</label> and impediments of the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of this holy time, and we should take notice of them.</p>
               <p>1. Some are Atheists, who are devoid of Faith, and the fear of God. These be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not, that there is a God who will judge the World, and render to every
one according to their Works: They fear not His Divine Power and Majesty.
They have no care to worship Him. They perswade themselves, that all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Service is vain, and that the Worship of a Deity hath no better reason and
ground, then the fancy and conceit of some precise superstitious Fools. They
think that the Rest, and Sanctification of every 7th day, is a needless expence, and
loss of time, to the hinderance and neglect of many considerable busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <p>2. Some, though not so prophane, do not consider how much the Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and continuance of Religion, depends upon the observation of Holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths.
Take these away, you shall by Experience find, that Religion will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,
and that in a short time. We, by the Light of Nature, may easily understand,
that there is a time necessarily required for the dispatch of all business: and if
so, then the Religious Service of our God, and the Salvation of our Souls, are the
greatest, and most weighty businesse we have to do in this World: and therefore
do of necessity require, and may justly challenge, not onely some time, but a
competent and due proportion of time. Yet we find, that men of great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and very prudent in these Earthly things, are very inconsiderate and
imprudent in this particular.</p>
               <p>3. Some take no notice of those Characters God hath imprinted upon some
days, and by some glorious work done on them, honoured them, and made
them more excellent then other days. They do not consider, that the Jews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the people of God (from whom Salvation was) observed, and that according
to God's Command and Example, one day in seven; and that Christians, from
the Apostles days, have consecrated the 7th part of their time unto God, and
that by sufficient Warrant from Heaven. And this forgetfulness, and want of
consideration, is one cause of their neglect, and dis-esteem of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>4. Some do know, believe, and profess these things; yet are Worldly-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
neg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>igent in matters of Religion, and at all times, and so on the Sabbath
are indisposed to Heavenly Duties: so that they hallow no time, and unhallow
this sacred time, which God doth arrogate to himself. And such as being Earthly
minded, are most active in secular business, are most careless and negligent in
the observation of God's Sabbath.</p>
               <p>5. The want of preparation before we enter upon the Sabbath, and Divine
Service, our careless carriage in the performance of Holy Duties, and our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing
of secular business, prophane though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and discourses must needs abate,
and that very much of the sanctification of the Day.</p>
               <p>6. Some are perswaded that all days, since the abolition of the <hi>Jewish Polity,</hi>
are alike: and therefore it is Jewish or Superstitious, to observe any determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
time, and to prefer one day above another.</p>
               <p>7. Some, out of a Spiritual Pride, and high conceit of themselves, as above
all Ordinances, neglect Sacraments and Sabbaths, as far below their high attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The Reasons to perswade us to sanctifie the Sabbath are many,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XVI</label> and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
the same with those which bound the Jews, and therefore must be sought in
the Old Testament, in <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets.</p>
               <p>1. God commands us to sanctifie His Sabbath, and repeats this Command
many times. And though their Weekly Sabbath was not the same with ours, for
the particular Day; yet the end, and many particular Duties of Sanctification
are the same.</p>
               <p>2. As the Jewish Religion, so the Christian, depends much upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64164:104"/>
and as theirs was necessary for the continuance of their Religion, so ours
is for the continuance of ours.</p>
               <p>3. God did severely, and many times, prohibit the Prophanation of this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
time.</p>
               <p>4. When, and where it's neglected, and prophaned wholly, or in part, there
Religion decays accordingly, and that in a short time.</p>
               <p>5. He hath promised to such as shall observe his Sabbath, many, and great
Blessings, both Temporal and Spiritual, publick and private, to particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Nations, and Common-wealths. And in these Promises, he did not so
much regard this or that 7th day, as the continuance of Religion, by the Sacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of such Times, as he himself should determine.</p>
               <p>6. He hath threatned most fearful Judgments to be inflicted upon them,
who shall, by neglect of Holy Duties, or by Worldly and Bodily Labours, and
Employments, or any other way, prophane the same.</p>
               <p>7. According to these Promises and Threats, he hath dealt not onely with
private Persons, but Kingdoms, and States. For he hath blessed such as did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Sabbath, and cursed such as did prophane it. This is evident, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the History of the Scriptures, but from his Judgments, in all Times. We
might easily, by observation, understand it in our Times: It's somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
and not altogether to be neglected, that even in this Nation, upon the
publike allowance of Sports and Recreations upon the Lords Day, which is our
<hi>Christian Sabbath,</hi> Civil and Bloody Wars, and ruine of the Royal Family,
should so shortly follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the hand of God should be most against those,
who by Writing, Words, or Practise, had maintained the lawfulness of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
I forbear to cite the particular places of Scripture, whence these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are taken and the Examples of God's Judgments; because this is done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
by many others, who have written of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude this Doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XVII</label> it will be expedient to say
something of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> which we Christians observe; and, as Christians, are
bound to sanctifie. These things, I suppose, will be granted by rational and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
men,</p>
               <p>1. That we under the Gospel, are as much bound to serve and worship God,
as the Jews were under the Law.</p>
               <p>2. That the <hi>Lords-Day</hi> is as necessary for the preservation and continuance
of Religion as the <hi>Jewish Sabbath</hi> was.</p>
               <p>3. It's as fit, and as due proportion of time, as theirs was: For our condition,
in respect of the business<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and necessities of this life, did not differ from theirs,
but is the same.</p>
               <p>4. It's as useful, and conducing to our Spiritual good, and the attaining of
our <hi>Eternal Sabbath</hi> as theirs.</p>
               <p>5. It's the 7th part of our time, and a 7th day in order, as theirs also was; and
so consecrates no less time to God, but so much as the Commandement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
               <p>6. The morality of the Commandement, and the principal thing therein
aimed at, is not this, or that 7th day; but this, or that 7th day, which God shall
determine for Sanctification.</p>
               <p>7. As God set a <hi>Character</hi> upon their Day, so He hath upon ours. Upon the
7th Day He rested from the great Work of Creation, and therefore sanctified
and blessed it, and honoured it above other days: and, in remembrance of the
great and glorious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Work of Creation, He commanded the Day to be observed:
So upon the first Day of the Week, when Christ had finished His great Work of
Redemption He began His <hi>Everlasting Sabbath.</hi> For upon this Day He rose
again; upon this Day He sent down the Holy Ghost; and by these two glorious
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64164:105"/>
Works He honoured this Day above all others, even above their <hi>Sabbath.</hi> The
Creation was a glorious Work; the Redemption is more glorious: The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a great benefit; the Redemption is greater. And if we must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the former, we must much more remember the latter. If the Day whereon
He rested from the former, be fit to be observed, much more is the Day wherein
He rested from the latter. The Resurrection of the Son of God made Man and
the sending down of the Holy Ghost are never to be forgotten, but eternally to
be remembred by Christians: For upon them depend our Eternal Salvation;
and without them we cannot attain unto, or enter into our Everlasting Rest.
And he is unworthy the Name, much more the Priviledges of a Christian, that
will not remember these things. And we can hardly find any to have dis-estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
or neglected this Day, but they were either prophane Wretches, or giddy
Sectaries, and Hereticks.</p>
               <p>For the alteration of the Day to be sanctified,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XVIII</label> there was great reason:
For</p>
               <p>1. Seeing Christ did not rise again, nor send down the Holy Ghost upon the
<hi>Iewish Sabbath,</hi> but upon the first day of the Week, there was more reason to
observe this our first, then that their last Day of the Week. And surely, seeing
Christ could have risen upon their <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and sent down the Holy Ghost up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Day, and yet did not either of them upon the same, nor any other Day
of the Week, there was some reason in it. And by singling out this time, for
those Blessed Works, He did intimate, that this should be His Day, wherein all
Christians should honour Him, to the end of the World; and that the former
<hi>Sabbath</hi> was to be laid aside.</p>
               <p>2. The former <hi>Sabbath</hi> did several ways respect the Jews in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As having the Ceremonial Law annexed unto it; the Services and
Rites whereof were to be observed in the Tabernacle and Temple
upon this Day.</item>
                  <item>2. It was a Sign between God, and them, that they might know, that it
was the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which did sanctifie them, <hi>Exod. 31. 13, 17. Ezek. 20.
12.</hi> So that it was part of that <hi>Partition-Wall,</hi> whereby they were
separated from the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Therefore, after that Christ was risen, the Holy Ghost given from Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Day, the Apostles received Commission to preach unto all Nations, and
God taking away the <hi>Partition-Wall,</hi> made of both, one Body-Politick in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
it was though altogether convenient, to <hi>surrogate</hi> the <hi>Lords-Day,</hi> in the
place of the former <hi>Sabbath:</hi> and, upon these grounds, the first day of the week
began to be observed in the days of the Apostles, and had the name of the
<hi>Lords-Day,</hi> and both the observation, and the name, have universally amongst
Christians, continued since that time. By laying aside the former Day, was
signified, that the Covenant with the Fathers, which had this <hi>Sabbath</hi> annexed,
was now with that Day expired, and abolished by a more excellent time, which
succeeded it; which being sanctified by us, doth distinguish us from the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Jew in all Nations. For, by it, we profess our Belief of Christ's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and our Sanctification by the Holy Ghost, sent down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Many remain to this day unsatisfied,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XIX</label> and doubt of the Morality of the fourth
Commandement; and, if it were Moral, by what Authority the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the
Jews, determined in that Commandement of the Moral-Law given unto them,
could be altered. For the Morality of it, we must observe, as before,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:64164:105"/>
1. That some Commandements were primitively, some derivatively moral;
so that there were degrees of morality in that Law, which is called Moral; and
in that respect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though they were all moral, yet there is a great inequality in
their morality.</p>
               <p>2. This Commandement, as some others, have something positive in it.</p>
               <p>3. This Commandement was positive, in respect of the time: For neither time
in general, nor this or that particular time, nor this or that portion of time, as a
day, one day in seven, this or that 7th day, are moral. They are not intrinsecally
good, nor have any connexion inseparable with the last end and felicity of man.</p>
               <p>4. This Commandement derives its morality, <hi>ab extrinseco,</hi> from the Divine
Determination of the time, and the Rest for Sanctification commanded in that
time. The Sanctification of one 7th determinate day every week, for the worship
of the true and living God, as it was a fit proportion of man's time, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
means for the preservation and continuance of Religion, had some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with the supream end, and did conduce to the attaining of it. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Determination of that time, for that end, signified by a Command added,
did plainly make it moral.</p>
               <p>For the alteration of the day it's certain,</p>
               <p>1. That if God had in the beginning determined one and the same 7th Day
to be of perpetual and universal obligation,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XX</label> then it could not be justly, and by
any sufficient Authority altered.</p>
               <p>2. It's certain, that the day prescribed to the Jew, in time of the servitude and
bondage of the Law, was altered, and another substituted, and observed in the
place thereof.</p>
               <p>3. This was altered after Christ's Incarnation and Glorification, sending
down of the Holy Ghost, the Revelation of the Gospel preached to Jew and
Gentile, and in the Apostles days, according to an Order given by them to the
Churches planted by them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2, 4. The day substituted was the first day
of the week, <hi>ibid.</hi> and the Lords Day, and was so called and observed universally
by Christians, from that time, to our days.</p>
               <p>4. In that, one day in 7, as also this or that 7th day, were positive, and not
moral; therefore the 7th formerly observed by the Jew, was alterable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> considered
in it self.</p>
               <p>5. The 4th Commandement given to the Jew, did not say, that, that 7th day,
determined then by Him, should never be altered, but be the Sabbath to Jew
and Gentile, to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>6. There were (as you heard before) great and weighty Reasons, why the
Apostles not onely might, but should a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter it: For if the Character set upon it
by the Work of Creation, and the deliverance of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of them from all Nations, till the exhibition of the <hi>Messias,</hi> was a reason
and ground to God for to institute, and for them to observe them, much more
was the Character set upon the first day of the week by Christ's Resurrection,
the general manifestations, and apparitions of him, rise uon that day, and the
coming of the Holy Ghost, as far greater blessings to sinful man, then Creation
and deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> was a sufficient ground and reason to lay aside
the former day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as joyned with the Ceremonial Law, the Covenant, with their
Fathers in the Wilderness, and the separation of the Jews from all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to institute and observe the first day unto <hi>God-Redeemer,</hi> by Christ exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
as the former was observed to <hi>God-Creatour,</hi> and Deliverer of one Nation
out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Neither was there any need of a new express Precept, seeing to
the Apostles the Reasons for the alteration were so weighty, clear, and evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.
For the former Sabbath, being joyned with the Ceremonial Law given
to the Jew, did presuppose the Church confined to a Nation, the Gentiles exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the people of God in minority and servitude under a Tutor, and Christ fo
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64164:106"/>
come; therefore, for the positive part, it was to cease with the legal dispensation.
And as there followed a new manner of Worship, and a new Administration
so there must be a new day. The Commandement it self requires one day in
seven; and if so, then no day could be so fit, as the day of Resurrection, and the
coming down of the Holy Ghost from Heaven. By the observation of this, we
acknowledge the <hi>Levitical Priesthood</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> to be abolished, Christ exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the Work of Redemption finished, and that Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who was
born at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> brought up at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> crucified at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> rose again the
third day, ascended into Heaven, hath sent down the Holy Ghost, is the Son of
God, and Saviour of the World.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>I</label> Something must
be said in general.</p>
               <p>1. Concerning the difference.</p>
               <p>2. The order of these two parts of the Law. For our Saviour reduceth the
whole Law to two heads.</p>
               <p>1. Of the Love of God.</p>
               <p>2. Of our Neighbour. And as God and our Neighbour differ, and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much; so the dutyes of this latter part differ, from those of the former: for as
the former have God for their object; so these have Man. The former respect
our communion with God, the latter our communion with our Neighbour.
The former presents the dutyes of men as subjects to be performed to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
the Great, and everlasting: the latter commands dutyes to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to man, who is the fellow-Subject. The former give morality to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
The latter receive morality from the former, and depend upon them,
and are so far good as they agree with the former. The former have more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with, as they conduced more immediately unto, the last end Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and Mans happinesse. So that the difference between them is very great.
According to this difference, there is an inequality. It's true that they are
equall, as they are commands, and also commands of God, and bind unto obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
unto God, and the matter of both is just; Yet their inequality is great,
because the dutyes of the former, according to the object are far more excellent
and if they come in competition with these of the second Table, they must be
preferred. Yet we must make a distinction. For in both parts of the Law
there be some dutyes morall, some positive; and one and the same duty is in
some respect moral, in another positive. This therefore is the certain rule that
moralls of the first part or Table, as some call it, are to be performed be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore the
morals of the second Table, and positives of the first before positives of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
Upon this account, if the love of Father, and Mother, a moral duty of
the latter part, come in competition with the love of God required in the first
part, then its true our Saviour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith, He that loveth Father or Mother more
then God, or hateth not Father and Mother for Christs sake, is not worthy of
Christ. In this respect, obedience to our lawfull superiours inconsistent with
our obedience to God is unlawfull; for we must obey God rather then man,
the supreme Lord before the subordinate. But if we compare positives of the
first Table, with morals of the second, the morals of the second must be prefer'd
before the positives of the first. Therefore we may intermit the outward so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
worship of God upon the Sabbath day to save the life of a Beast, or much
more of a man, though the work should take up the whole time of one Sabbath
or more. This lesson our Saviour taught us, when he proved that it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64164:106"/>
to heale on the Sabbath. This inequality is implyed in the words of our
Saviour to the Scribes, and Pharisees, when he not onely reproves them, but
denounceth a judgement against them, in that they pay'd tith of Mint and
Annise, and Cummin, and omitted the weightyer matters of the Law, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
mercy, and Faith, <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 23. Where he intimates,</p>
               <p>1. That there be lesse and greater dutyes.</p>
               <p>2. That to pay Tyth of our goods and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fruites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a duty of the first Table; and
judgement, mercy, and Faith of the second.</p>
               <p>3. That payment of Tythes, though a duty of the first Table is inferiour to
Judgement, Mercy, and Faith, duties of the second Table. In the time of the
Law, Sacrifice, New-Moones, Sabbath, Solemn-Feasts, and prayers were du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the first rank, and form, to be performed to God; yet then God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
justice, and mercy to Man before them, as appeares, <hi>Esay.</hi> 1. from <hi>verse
11.</hi> to the 18. And he desires Mercy more then Sacrifice, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 6. And if
any except, and say; that Sacrifices and Sabbaths were part of the Ceremonial,
not the moral Law; I answer, that the <hi>Weekly Sabbath,</hi> and so prayer were
dutyes required in the moral Law, and all the Ceremonies of worship were
branches thereof in those times.</p>
               <p>After the difference,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> and inequality, the order is to be considered; and that
is either general of the whole in respect of the former part of the Law, or of the
parts amongst themselves. The order of the whole, is either of dignity, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The former precepts and dutyes considered, comparatively with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
are more excellent, and terminated upon a more noble object, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of them conduced more immediately to the supreme end, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with our God, and so deserve the first place, which God hath given
them. As for the order of nature its evident, that we have relation first to
God, our Creatour, Redeemer, Lord and King, before we have relation unto
man our fellow-subject; and the love of our God is before the love of our
Neighbour: because we cannot love our Neighbour aright, except we first love
our God. The latter depends upon, and issues from the former which
doth regulate, and rightly qualifie the later; and besides, the morality of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is derived from the morality of the former, as you heard before.</p>
               <p>As the object of the dutyes required in the former precept was God, so the
object of these latter are Men, with whom we do converse. We must love, and
honour Saints departed, and the blessed Angels; yet the Persons here princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
understood are men living upon earth, with whom we have ordinary
Communion. For these Commandements do refer unto this life, and respect
men living in this vale of teares, and therefore much of this Law shall cease to
bind in Heaven. To do as we would be done unto, and to love our Neighbours,
as our selves do virtually containe all the particulars of this part, and are the
brief abridgement of the whole. To leave every man unto his liberty in the
distribution, and digesting of these later Commandements unto a method, and
to unfold the excellency of that order which God hath observed, I will at this
time deliver mine own apprehensions of the same. Upon consideration, I find
that these six last precepts may be distinguished into two sorts.</p>
               <p>1. Such as receive, or</p>
               <p>2. Such as give morality.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> Such as receive their morality are the V. VI. VII.
VIII. IX. the five first of the second Table. That which gives morality is the
Last, which is the measure, and foundation of the five former. For you must
note that in the former Table God did begin with the greatest, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall,
and so proceeded to the lesse, and inferiour, but in this part he proceeds
in another order, and reserves the greatest to the last. Of the five which derive
their morality from the last, some prescribe the rule of justice to be observed;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64164:107"/>
Some, a rule o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> judgement. Those which prescribe a rule of justice do deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<hi>Jus Personarum, aut Rerum,</hi> the right of persons, or things belonging to
per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons. The fifth determins the right of persons, the rest the right of things,
which are life, wise, goods, or estate. The 6th. is concerning life; The 7th.
concerning our Neighbours Wife: The 8th, concerning mens goods. In the
9th, we have the rule of judgement. Gods order and method (if we can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it) is most accurate and excellent. The last (which gives morality to the
former five) commands the love of our Neighbours as of our selves, as you
shall heare hereafter. And this is the root, and rule of all the rest. For as
our Saviour comprized all the foure first Commandements in the love of God;
so he collected, and included all the latter precepts, in the love of our
Neighbour.</p>
               <p>These things first observed,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IIII</label> let us enter upon the explication of the 5th, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
which as <hi>Philo</hi> saith had <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and was placed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of both the two Tables, and joynes them together. Whether it was the last
in the first Table, as some conceive, or the first in the second, or part of it in the
former, and part in the latter, I will not dispute. This is certain, they were all
written in two Tables, &amp; this of necessity is next to those which concern our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to God. Parents and superiours represent God, and yet are men, and so that
Commandement hath some affinity with the former, though more agreement
with the latter. This Commandement determins the right of persons, who
are superiours, inferiours, equals. To Equals the offices of love, and humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are due, but no honour: for its the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight which inferiours must give to supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
as superiours, and of them it is principally intended. For God did
so order it, that though all men, as men, are subjects, fellow-subjects amongst
themselves, and under the power of God, as their Lord and Soveraign, yet
there should be an imparity, not onely of excellency and dignity, but of power
amongst them: for without imparity there can be no order. The first impari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is naturall, wherein Parents are superiour to their Children, and that in po-w<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er.
And I will consider and understand the Commandement, first of natural
Parents and their Children, and afterwards proceed to the imparity which is
by institution, and which may be reduced <hi>Analogically</hi> to this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Wherein we have,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The duty Commanded.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The reward promised.</hi> In the duty we may observe,

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The persons bound to perform it, are not expressed, but easily understood.</p>
               <p>1. To be inferiours.</p>
               <p>2. To be Children, who onely have relation to Father and Mother, as such:
for Children are such as have Father and Mother, and Father and Mother are
such as have Children, who receive their life and being from God by them:
For they are both begotten and preserved by them. Parents are in Gods place,
and his deputies, and instruments: and the benefit which we receive by them,
except they be unnaturall, is such as cannot be requited. It was Gods will to
bring us into the world in this manner, and to make us so much depend upon
our Parents, that we might see what great reason we have to honour them.
And whosoever will not perform this duty, must needs transgresse against the
very light of nature, and those principles which God hath imprinted in their
Soules. So that (as <hi>Philo</hi> saith) The offenders are guilty of impiety against
God, and inhumanity against man, and stand liable before the Tribunal, both of
God and man: and those that are undutifull to their Parents, are usually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
and irreligious towards God. This duty in respect of Children is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64164:107"/>
and binds them all and every one; none can be exempted: All and every
one have Father and Mother too, since <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were created by God, and
not procreated by man. Therefore <hi>Adam</hi> is called the Son of God, <hi>Luke 3.
38.</hi> The conception of Jesus Christ and his birth were extraordinary; for he
had a Mother but no immediate Father, therefore he may be excepted: Yet it
was said that he was subject unto them: that is, not onely to his Mother <hi>Mary,</hi>
but his Father by law <hi>Joseph,</hi> to give example to all Children, seeing he the
Son of God subjected himself unto them. This duty ariseth from the relation
as the foundation thereof. For by the manner of the receiving, and continuing
of their being, they are inferiours, depending upon Parents, and under their
power.</p>
               <p>The partyes to whom the duty is to be performed are Father and Mother: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who begets them; and Mother who conceives, beares, bring forth, nurseth
and taketh care of them in their helplesse age. In this respect they have proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
superiority of power above them. And lest Children should think it sufficient
to be subject to their Father he adds, <hi>(and thy Mother.)</hi> For though the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be subject as a Wife to her Husband, yet she is superiour to her Child, as
she is a Mother, and may command, and must in no wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e be neglected or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed.</p>
               <p>The duty it self is expressed in the word <hi>(Honour)</hi> which is but single,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> yet
comprehends severall dutyes, as Reverence to their persons, in respect of their
dignity, subjection to their power, obedience to their commands, maintenance
if they be in want, and they able to relieve them, and covering their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes:
for maintenance is sometimes called honour; and <hi>Shem,</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
their Father, when in a modest manner they covered his nakednesse.
Reverence must be in the heart, and expressed in their words, their gestures,
and outward carriage towards them. Subjection is a resigning of their own
Wills, and acknowledgement of their power and superiority, and that they
themselves are not, <hi>(Sui juris)</hi> their own Masters; but their duty till the time
of emancipation is, to serve. Obedience is to do their just commands, and
must be regulated by their directions: for they must hearken unto their instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
both for the matter to be done, and the manner how it ought to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and they must execute it freely, and with diligence: for if it be not free,
and willing, its no obedience. If Parents fall into want, grow decrepit,
and faile not onely in strength, but understanding, and so cannot help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
Reason it self, much more the Word of God, will dictate unto us, that
Children should not onely cover their infirmities, and bear with their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
but also help, succour, relieve them, and endeavour to recompence that
tender love, and kindnesse which their Parents shewed unto them, when they
were Children. And this is to be done unto them, with all due respects, as
unto Parents: for in their lowest condition, such they are, and such they must
be accounted. And if all these dutyes be not performed, how can Children
be said to honour Father and Mother, as here they are commanded to do? And
if Heathen Children be bound thus to honour their Parents, and some of them
by the light of nature have done it; how much more are Christian Children
of Christian Parents obliged to this duty? which should be performed out
of knowledge, the love of God, and Faith in Jesus Christ, as a part of Christian
obedience, and thankfulnesse.</p>
               <p>This is the duty commanded:<label type="milestone">

all the Law which prescribes the duty of man to man. It hath severall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandemnents,

                  </gap>bundant mercy to add the promise: and the
Apostle makes the use of it to move Children, to obedience. The land which
the Lord their God should give them was the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and therefore it
had special reference to the <hi>Isralites;</hi> yet so that all other dutifull Children of
all nations have a right in it, and especially Christians. Why else should the
Apostle take it up to move Christian Children, to obedience, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3.
The enjoyment of our own native Country is opposed to captivity, banishment,
dispossession, disinheritance, and a Vagabond life: Long life to an unnatural,
or a violent death which takes away life, even then when natural vigour conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
and there be no internal causes of immediate dissolution. A prosperous
life is opposed to the cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ses, and miseryes which others suffer. Yea all these
mercyes are opposed to all those judgements, as inflicted by God, and suffered
by wicked, and undutifull Children for their neglect, disobedience, contempt,
and rebellion against their Parents. These blessings promised are but tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
not spirituall and Eternal. For those are acquired by Faith, and derived
from Christ, and the promises in Christ, in whom Christian Children receive
not onely this temporal, but a spiritual reward upon this obedience perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Faith. Neither doth this promise take effect in all dutifull Children, so
as that alwayes they enjoy this reward, and be free from the like jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> contrary to this reward: For even dutifull Children many
times suffer Captivity, banishment, untimely death, and other miseryes; but
not for this sin of obedience, whereof they are not guilty, but for tryall, and
some other cause best known unto God, who will recompence the want or
losse of this reward, with some far greater mercy. There be extraordinary and
reserved cases wherein good Children may suffer, and have a share in publick,
and general calamityes, and ruins, and sometimes may bear the sins of their
Parents. The performance of the promise doth most appear, either in the
times of peace, and prosperity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or in deliverances, and comforts, in the time of
misery; or in those fearfull curses, which fall upon such, as have been disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
stubborn, and undutifull Children; who are punished sometimes with
pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sometimes with losse of their estates, and banishment from their native
soyl, and place of inheritance; sometimes with a violent, and shamefull death
or an ignominious life: and all this for the violation of this precept, besides
other temporall, and eternall punishments for their other sins. Examples of
those rewards, and punishments we may read in Scripture, and in other
Historyes.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I have explained the expresse words of the Commandement.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> There
is something further implyed, and that's the duty of parents in respect of their
Children. For if they be in Gods place, and must be honoured, then they
must be like unto God, do good, be beneficial to inferiours, so as to deserve
honour, which unnatuall, and carelesse parents cannot so much expect. As
God by the Apostle exhorts Children to obey their Parents; so he forbids Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64164:108"/>
to provoke their Children, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 4. Where we may observe, that in
duties the inferiour must be first: The Wife must be subject to the Husband
first: The Children must be obedient to their Parents first: Servants to their
M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sters, first. Subjects to the higher Powers, first. Yet so that superiours have
their dutyes, which they are bound to perform. The dutyes of Parents are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
negative, or affirmative. Negative are many, as opposed to the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
The Apostle in the former place expresseth onely one; They must not
provoke them. This is done when they deny that which is necessary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for them in respect of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ability, and estate; when they command
them unjust, or unreasonable things; when in their rash passion they revile
them and give them ignominious terms though they deserve them not: When
they use too much severity, and sometimes plain cruelty, not so much out of a
desire to amend them, as for to satisfie their own humours, and fury, as though
they would revenge themselves upon them as enemyes. To this purpose the

Countrey. For the life to come: so they must bring them up in the nurture
and admonition of the Lord, and learn them betimes, even in their tender
yeares, so far as they shall be capable, to serve their God, know their Saviour,
and seek Eternall Life, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 4. Children have Souls, as well as Bodyes,
and are capable not onely of a temporal, but an eternal estate. And Parents
should endeavour to provide for both, especially for the better, that their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
might be the Sons, and Daughters of the Living God, and Heires of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
glory. What comfort can it be to have Children miserable in this life, or if
in this life happy, eternally miserable in the life to come; as it often falls out,
through want of education? To this education belong instruction, exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
correction. Familyes should be nurseryes, and Seminaryes of Religion.
And if Parents for want of knowledge, or leasure cannot thus educate them, let
them commit them to School-Masters, Trades-men, Ministers, and others, who
are fit for that purpose. What Parents in this Particular should do, Tutours
Guardians and such as are trusted with <hi>Orphans,</hi> are bound to perform.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> what the sins both of Children,
and Parents against this Commandement, be: For they are contrary to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
here commanded. The sins of Children are disobedience to their Parents
commands, irreverence to their persons, rebellion against their power, ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and neglect of them in their weaknesse, want, and misery; when they shall
take bad courses, so as to be a shame, grief, and discomfort to their Parents, who
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64164:109"/>
did carefully endeavour, and seek their good. God will surely punish them:
For the promise of life, peace, and prosperity to good Children implyes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of a curse against wicked, and grace-lesse wretches, who cannot be
obedient to God, when they are disobedient to Parents. God high displeasure
against incorrigible Children is signified by that law he gave to <hi>Israel.</hi> If a
man have a stubborn, and rebellious Son, which will not obey the voyce of his
Father, or the voyce of his Mother, and that when they have chastned him,
will not hearken unto them; Then shall his Father and Mother lay hold on
him, and bring him out to the Elders of his City, &amp; unto the gates of his place:
and they shall say unto the Elders of his City, this our son is stubborn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious;
he will not obey our voyce: He is a glutton, and a Drunkard. And
all the men of his City shall stone him with stones that he dye: So shalt thou
put evil away from amongst you: And all <hi>Israel</hi> shall hear, and fear, <hi>Deut. 21.
18,</hi> 19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p>These are the sins of Parents,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IX</label> as Parents.</p>
               <p>1. To be unnatural: Of this sin many Fornicatours, and Adulterers are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For fearing shame, or some other punishment from men more then
from God, they murder their Children, either before or after their birth, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
them being born, and leave them to perish.</p>
               <p>2. To take no care to maintayn them, and provide for them; or prodigally
to wast that which should relieve them.</p>
               <p>3. To discourage them, dul their Spirits, provoke them, use them as slaves,
or beasts, or enemyes.</p>
               <p>4. To be ignorant, or negligent, so that they either cannot, or will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
them, or cause them to be instructed.</p>
               <p>5. To be prophane, ungodly, wicked, and to give them bad example, and be
patterns of impiety, and iniquity unto them.</p>
               <p>6. To be found indulgent, remisse in Discipline, and correction, and to bring
them up idlely, or delicately.</p>
               <p>7. To neglect their education in Religion, and take no care of their poor
Souls. The sins of Tutours, Guardians, and such as are trusted with Orphans,
are carelessenesse, or unfaithfulnesse. And these must know, that though these
desolate, and poor Creatures cannot or may not question them; yet God will
right them, and will certainly call these unjust Stewards to account, and severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
punish them for their negligence, and injustice. And as he will blesse godly
faithfull, carefull parents, and such as supply their place, and comfort them in
their Children, or some other way: So he will punish the negligent, ungodly,
unfaithfull in their own Children, and many other wayes, and will require the
blood of their Souls at their hands, and their last reckoning will be sad and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.
Few Fathers endeavour the Regeneration of their Children; Few Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
travayl again of them, that Christ may be formed and born in their hearts.
And one great cause of the corruption, not onely of familyes, but Church and
state, is the neglect of education. When Parents do not use the power God
hath put into their hands, nor take the opportunity he hath given them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stil
the principles of religion, and piety into them in their tender yeares, when
they are so ready to receive the first impressions. It's a matter of sorrow, and
lamentation to consider how much Parents do neglect their duty, and to see the
sad events thereof. For many of them transmit their sin and guilt, and derive
it to posterity, who inherit their iniquity, and misery.</p>

Father, and Mother, are tearms of relation, expresly named in the Text; and
these imply another Relation, Husband and Wife, who are the Foundation of
a Family, and were the beginning and first root of Mankind. And after that
Woman was once created, and man had a fellow, the relation of Husband, and
Wife followed, and was the first relation, according to God's Institution, which
requires that man and woman should be Husband and Wife, before there be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother. They are</p>

                  <item>3. Father and Mother, by God's Blessing.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Yet there be many, who violate this Institution, and propagate the World
with an illegitimate, and spurious, or incestuous Brood; though by Repentance,
and Faith in Christ, this sin may be pardoned, and God's Judgment averted,
both from Parents and Children. In this first Society, there is an imparity,
though not so great as that of Parents, and Children: and the Duties thereof
are two; Subjection, and Love: For the Wife must be subject to her Husband;
and the Husband must love his Wife. This is the Command of God, by the
Apostle, <hi>Wives submit your selves unto your Husbands, as unto the Lord: For the
Husband is the Head of the Wife,</hi> &amp;c. This is the imparity of Superiour, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour.
And <hi>Husbands love your Wives, as Christ loved the Church, and gave Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Ephes. 5. 22, 25. This subjection was due from the first Wife, to the
first Husband, even in the estate of Innocency. For even then Marriage was
instituted, and by it was constituted one of the nearest Societies in the World,
and the same indissoluble, except by Death, or Adultery; and that not onely by
Covenant, but especially by God's Institution, whose Will it was, that they
should be one flesh, and that man should forsake Father and Mother, that dear
relation, and cleave to his Wife. This Subjection before the Fall, was so a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as that it was not a punishment. For then Man was the Head, a Superiour,
because made first; and Woman was made after Man, of Man, for Man, and man
was of the more noble Sex: and it was God's Will he should be Superiour, in
the first Contract, according to his Institution. But after the Fall, it was not
onely a Duty to be performed willingly, but a Penalty to be suffered patiently.
And a grievous Penalty it is, when a Woman is married to a proud, insolent,
imperious Fool; and to such Women who are of the like temper, and violently
bent to have their own Will, though never so unreasonable. As the imparity
between Man and Wife, is less then that between Parents and Children; so the
subjection of the Wife to the husband is not so great, as that which is due from
Children to Parents, much less then of Servants to their Masters. The place of
the Wife, though inferiour to the Husband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is honourable: She is Partner with
him, and shares in the government of the Family, and may command both
Children and Servants. He is the Master, she is the Mistress, though subordinate
to him, as her Head, as the Body is to the Head. The duty of the Husband, is
to love his Wife, and that not with any kind, or degree of love, but with a dear,
tender special love. He must love her as his Wife, as one flesh with him, his own
body, part of himself, nearer to him, then Father or Mother. Yet, as obedience
of Children, so both love of Husband, and subjection of Wife, is limited, and must
be in the Lord, that is, subordinate unto that love and subjection, which is due
to Christ, and agreeable to the Will of His Command, and not contrary unto
it. And both the Duties, presuppose other Vert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, in both Parties, or else they
will be not onely imperfect, and deficient, but unlawful, and not in the Lord, but
against the Will of the Lord. And this subjection of the one, and love of the
other, Evangelically understood, are more perfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and noble Vertues, in true
Christians, then in others: as the Bond of Marriage doth represent the Union
of Christ and His Church, who are contracted on Earth, and the Marriage it self
shall be solemnized in Heaven with great glory, and full joy that shall never
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64164:110"/>
end. The want of this subjection in the one, and love in the other (much more
the contrary sins) are forbidden in this Commandement, and are the causes of
many other sins, confusions, discomforts, miseries, ruines of Families. And by
these two, and the contrary, may be understood all other Duties here comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and sins forbidden, and all such as depend upon them, or are necessarily joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with them.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XI</label> Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
follows that of Masters and Servants. For, after that Mankind was multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in a Family, and their Estates and Goods increased, their work was the
greater, and required more hands: and the first that did the Work of Servants,
though they were not Servants, were Children; and after that, besides irrational
Servants, as the Ox and the Ass, there were many rational Servants properly so
called. Of these be many kinds.</p>
               <p>1. Such as have little use of Reason, and are onely fit to be governed, and not
to govern; yet having health and strength, are able to do good service by the
direction of others.</p>
               <p>2. Some, through want and penury, or a competent Estate or Family of their
own, became mercenary hired servants, who otherwise were free: Such are
most of our Servants.</p>
               <p>3, Some, for Debt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell their Children, and sometimes themselves, for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and Bond-slaves: These might be called <hi>Vendititii,</hi> who sold their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and themselves.</p>
               <p>4. After that, a greater multiplication of Mankind into greater Societies;
as Cities, and Civil States. They waged War one against another, and by the Law
and general consent of Nations, the goods of the Conquered became a lawful
spoyl, and the persons captives and slaves to the Conquerours; and so Servants
were increased: These were <hi>Servi Capti,</hi> Servants taken in War, who had their
life for a prey, and their maintainance, for their service.</p>
               <p>5. And if these, or any others, were detained as servants in a Family, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to marry; and had children, these children were servants, called in Latine,

became Servants to those who bought them.</p>
               <p>7. Many were brought into Servitude most unjustly by Men-stealers, who
are called <hi>Plagiarii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Amongst these, may be reckoned Apprentices, who in some Trade or

               </p>
               <p>The Duty of all Servants,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XII</label> as such, is to do service to their Masters willingly,
faithfully, diligently, as in the presence of God, the great Master of Heaven. Their
aym must be, to preserve and improve their Masters Estate, whose work they
do: and they must know, that they are not <hi>Sui juris,</hi> either free, or their own
Masters; and that their Masters Will must be their Will, because they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Power and Command: These two Duties of Faithfulness and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
are proper: and though they be bound to Reverence, Subjection, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
yet these are common Duties, which all Inferiours, under the power of
another, are bound to perform. Let all Servants hearken to the Doctrine of
the Apostles, and practise it.</p>
               <p>They must be obedient to their own Masters in the flesh, with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
in singlenesse of heart as unto Christ; not with Eye-service, as men
pleasers, but as the Servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, with
good will doing service to the Lord, and not to men: Knowing that what good
thing any man doth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64164:110"/>
or free, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7, 8. Knowing that of the Lord yee shall receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance:

They must not purloin, but shew all fidelity, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10. And they must ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
not onely their Christian, but their unbelieving Masters, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1. and
not onely the gentle and good, but the froward, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. In all which
places, we may observe the Dutyes, the Sins, the Rewards, the Punishments of
servants. Their Dutyes, are fidelity and diligence in their Service: Their
Sins, murmuring, purloining, unfaithfulnesse, negligence: The Reward of good
servants is, not onely maintenance, and wages, on earth, but God's blessing
and a reward in heaven: The Punishment of bad servants is, not onely such
as the severity of their Masters shall inflict; but the curse of God here, and
hereafter. Amongst servants may be reckoned Factours, and such as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the businesse of others for wages; and thereupon, because they are trusted,
are bound to account. Under this head may be reduced, all such as are hired
to do work for others. Besides all these, there are in a family such as neither
be children nor servants, but such as sojourn, and dwell with the Master of the
family, and are in some sort under his power, as strangers, and sojourners in a
forreign State may be said to be unperfectly subjects, to the power of the State
where they live for a time. The Duty of Masters is to give unto their servants
that which is just and equal, <hi>knowing that they also have a Master in Heaven,
Col.</hi> 4. 1. They must not oppress them, abuse them, or deny unto them any thing,
which the Lawes of God, the just Lawes of men, and their own contract doth
allow them. If it be a sin to be unmercifull to a Beast, much more is it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull
to a man. And though servants cannot right themselves; yet God will
hear their cry, and judge their cause. Before I conclude this point of the Duty
of Servants, and Masters, one thing is to be observed, That christian Masters
should be, of all others, most just unto their meanest servants; because they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
their belief of that Master in heaven; and as he is mercifull and just to
them, so they should be unto their servants. Christian servants also should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that they do service, not onely unto man but God, and to God not
onely as Creator, but to him as Redeemer, and to Jesus Christ, who is exalted
at the right hand of God: and though they be Servants to men, yet if they tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe, they are Sons of God, and may expect an inheritance in heaven.
And besides their other sins, this is grievous, if they run from their Masters as
<hi>Onesimus</hi> did from <hi>Philemon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A family is the seminary both of the Church,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIII</label> and civil State: And, as a State,
or Church, may be said to be a great family; so a family well ordered may be
called a little common-wealth, civill or ecclesiastical. Therefore I proceed,
from oeconomical to politick dutyes, which by analogy are reducible to this
5th commandement. A family, which seems to be onely a private society, may
multiply into severall familyes, and they into Vicinityes, and greater multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.
And though every family hath an order of superiority, and subjection;
yet the severall families, and Vicinityes, being distinct, have no power one over
another, but in that respect are equall. Yet these may associate, and unite
themselves into a community, and become one body, not onely by confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for friendship, and mutuall help, commerce, and defence, but may enter
into a stricter bond of Union, and become politick, and establish an order of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
and subjection, either for matters of this life, or for Religion, or for
both: as <hi>Israel,</hi> set at liberty by God, and brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into one common-wealth, civil, and ecclesiastical. For in the constitution
of a common-wealth, the community is the subject, and matter; the order of
superiority and subjection is the form.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:64164:111"/>
There must be a supreme power, one universall Will and Power, and the
subject wherein it must originally reside, and also by which it must be exercised,
must be determined: this once done, it presently appears, who are subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this power, and in what degree. The partyes who are trusted with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of this supreme, and publick power, make Lawes, constitute Officers for
peace and warr, and execute the Lawes, manage publique businesse, and affairs,
and use all meanes to promote the publique good, procure the peace and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Whole, and defend the Body from violence without, and protect the
just from injuries within. The Subjects severally and jointly submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and promise fealty and obedience. There be many common-wealths,
and they differ one from another in the manner of their constitution, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration.
If the power be disposed in one it is called a Monarchy, which
may be Despotical, when it's absolute, and unlimited in one person; or Regal,
when that one is trusted with the administration, and the executive power.
If the power be absolute in some few, it's called an Aristocrasy; and so it is, if
they be onely trusted. If it abide in the whole body, yet wisely disposed, it
may be called a free State: if so that the basest, as well as the best, have power
of administration, especially in highest businesse, it's a Democrasy. Tyranny,
Oligarchy. Ochlocrasy, are corruptions of these constitutions.</p>
               <p>In a common-wealth thus constituted we have higher powers:<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIV</label> and the duty
of Subjects is to be subject, loyall, faithfull, and acknowledg them as their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
under God for the matters of this life: For every soul must be subject
or submit unto the higher powers, which are ordained of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1.
And they must submit themselves to every ordinance of man, that is to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of man over man, and the higher powers, for the Lords sake: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be to the King, that is, for those times the <hi>Emperour,</hi> as supreme; Or
unto Governours, that is, Officers, as unto them that are sent, that is, commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
by him, for the punishment of evill doers, and for the praise of them
that do well: For this is the end of all civill government as ordained of God,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. 14. This subjection differs from that of Wives to Husbands, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to Parents, Servants to Masters: for it's an higher, and publick power of
the supreme Governours of a State, as such. And they must <hi>be subject not onely
for fear, but for conscience sake, Rom.</hi> 13. 5. This fear is not only that of Reverence,
which is the unto them in respect of their honour and dignity; but it's a featr
of violating the Lawes, or rebelling against the power, because the higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
do not bear the sword in vain. They must obey their just Lawes: For <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
must put in mind the Christians of Creet to be subject to principallityes and
Powers, to obey Magistrates, and to be ready to do every good work, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1.
Yet this obedience unto man is limited, and is so farr due as it is agreeable to
the Lawes of God. They must also pay Tribute, Custome, and whatsoever
Charge shall be justly imposed. For seeing they watch over us, and take care
of the Whole, and we enjoy the benefit of their care, prudence, and pains, it's
fit we should maintaine them, and be willing to erogate so much as shall be
needfull for the preservation of the State. For the publick good and safety is
the good and safety of every private person. They must also be willing and
ready to assist their Governours with their persons, states, and lives, for the
safety of their Country: And this, many Princes included and required,
in their forms of fealty and allegiance. And this Fealty, if regular, and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
is due, first, unto the State, and then unto the Governours: To the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
first, and then to the King.</p>
               <p>Out of the words of the Apostle,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XV</label> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14. we may observe, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verours
are supreme, or subordinate; and amongst the subordinate there be
many degrees, according to the severall degrees of power derived unto them,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64164:111"/>
for their severall imployments, in the distinct and different acts of administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And subjection, honour, obedience, are due unto these, according to
their measure of power and Authority. This subjection and obedience unto
the higher powers, and Magistrates, is limitted, not onely by the Lawes of God,
but the constitution of every severall State. These Officers are for peace of
Warr, by Sea, or Land, and may command those under them, and they must be
faithfull, and obedient. I will not in this place enlarge, and declare the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of souldiers; nor debate the Question, Whether a souldier in pay, and yet
in Quarters in his own country, when there is no visible Enemy, be exempt
from the power of the civill Magistrate, or no? It's certain that the power of
Admirals, and Captaines by Sea, and Generals, and Commanders by Land;
respect souldiers properly as souldiers, and is regulated by Martiall Lawes,
which are different from the civill Lawes, for the administration of Justice in a
time, or place, of peace. The duties of souldiers as such, are to be faithfull and
obedient to their Commanders, vigilant in their places, resolute in service, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
and quiet in their Quarters, contented with their pay. The Sins of
military men, except they be kept in order by severe discipline, are, to be cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
mutinous, treacherous, Revolters; and likewise to plunder, murther,
commit Rapes, and many other kind of Villanies. Commanders should be
faithfull, valiant, prudent, skilfull in Martiall affaires, carefull of their Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>The Dutyes of higher powers are,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XVI</label> to protect their Subjects, make good and
wholesome Lawes, constitute able and just Officers, administer Justice, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Laws, to have a care of, &amp; provide for, the good education of the people
in trade, learning husbandry, to regulate trade, and commerce, to found Schools,
Colledges, Universityes, Corporations, and, by all lawfull meanes, procure
and promote the peace, safety, welfare, and prosperity, of the People. They
should be Fathers, and such as tender the good of their Subjects, as of their
Children. As they are called gods, and are in God's place, so in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
and ordering of their severall Dominions, they should be like God in
Counsell, Wisdome, and Integrity. And happy are the people to whom God
shall vouchsafe such Governours: For it is a great mercy. Which if any people
shall enjoy, their duty is to blesse God for them, pray for their happinesse, and
honour them according to their deserts. And so much the rather should we do
this; because it's so heavy a Judgment, and cruell curse, to be subjected, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
to the pride, folly, oppression, Tyranny, of wicked Rulers. It's a sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
when those who hate us, rule over us.</p>
               <p>The Sins of Subjects are,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XVII</label> secret Treason, and Conspiracy, open Rebellion,
Sedition, disobedience to the Lawes, contempt of the Power, and Persons, of
their Princes, murmuring, and complaining of Oppression when there is no
cause, falsely traducing and accusing the Government of Injustice, and Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
denying Tribute, Custome, and other dues, and rights, which the just
Constitution, and Lawes, require. The Sins of the higher powers are many;
Some of the chief are these, to neglect the publick good, commit the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
to unjust and unworthy men, make unjust Lawes, pervert Judgment,
ordain insufficient and unjust Officers, usurp too much power, oppresse the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to enrich and advance unworthy Favourites, and Flatterers, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the State, Pomp, and Pride of a vicious Court, to displace just and prudent
Officers, and to debarr men of parts, and worth, from the administration; to
wage unnecessary Warrs, and so vainly to exhaust the publick Treasures, and
expend the Subjects blood, to refuse good counsell, and to follow bad. And
the highest Crime of all, and which includes the rest, is, Tyranny, and that is,
to govern contrary to good Lawes, and exercise arbitrary power, to the ruine of
the publick: Under this head may be reduced, Persecution of the Godly, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64164:112"/>
loyall Subjects, for the profession, and practise of the true Religion instituted
from Heaven. Besides these, there be many Sins of inferiour Officers, and
Magistrates, in their severall places. And here I might take occasion to
enquire what power the civill Governours have <hi>(circa Sacra)</hi> in matters of
Religion:</p>
               <p>1. They cannot justly establish any false Religion contrary to the Word of
God conteined in the Scriptures: neither can they, or ought they, to tolerate
any Errours, Heresies, Blasphemies, Idolatries, or Corruptions in Religion.</p>
               <p>2. They may make civill Lawes concerning Religion, and execute the same
by their coactive power, and by these Lawes they may and ought to bind and
command their Subjects to worship the true God in Christ, and protect them
in the same. This is that which they call <hi>Jus Religionis ordinanda:</hi> an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
right of all higher powers. Yet they must be sure they establish nothing in
Religion which is not clearly agreeable to the Gospell. For, as it is unlawfull
for any civill powers to establish by Law, any thing in Religion contrary to the
Gospell; so it's no wayes tolerable to bind the Subjects, upon civill penalties,
to professe things doubtfull, and needlesse. If all the Subjects in a State pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
themselves Christians, they cannot have any just cause to complain of their
Rulers, if by a Law they be commanded to make that Christian faith, which is
truly and plainly Christian. They are bound unto it by the Lawes of Christ, by
their own profession, by the Lawes of their Country. Yet Christian Religion
is not to be propagated by the sword, but by the Word clearly taught, so that
their Consciences may be convinced: But this presupposeth the Subjects no
Christians. Yet if they be such, the higher powers, Christians, are bound to use
all lawfull means, appointed by Christ, to make them Christians. The first care
of King <hi>David</hi> was to settle the true worship of God: The first care of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
to build a Temple unto God; and the first care of the good Princes of <hi>Judah,</hi> to
reform Religion, and to destroy the Monuments of Idolatry; and all this by
their civill power: And there is great reason, why all Princes and Governours
should do thus; Because the establishment of their power, and the welfare of
their Subjects depends principally upon Religion. Yet this power of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
is clearly distinct, and different, from the power of the Church, as a
Church, which can have no sword, nor exercise any civil coactive power. This
spirituall and ecclesiastical power looks upon every one within their precincts,
as Subjects of Christ, and Members of their spirituall Society (and such Princes
and Governours should be); and they proceed against them in the name of
Christ, if they do offend, and if they continue obstinate, they cast them not out
of the State but the Church. As for liberty of Conscience, it's limited to
things indifferent: For Christ did never purchase, never grant to any liberty
to believe Errours, false Doctrine, or their own Fancyes, no wayes grounded
on the Word of God, much lesse to professe them, and least of all upon this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
and profession, to associate, and continue, themselves in severall Societyes,
seperate from Orthodox Christians, raise Schisms in the Church, and Factions
in the State, to the disturbance of both. If we look upon the persons, who in
reformed Churches, cry so much for liberty of Conscience; upon due examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we shall find the most of them to be factious; to have little of the power,
though they may have much of the form, of godlinesse; and that which they call
liberty of Conscience, to be a liberty to professe their Errours: and if they had
power in their own hands, they would give liberty onely to their own Sect,
and would prove the most bloody persecutors of all others. What tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Princes may grant, of different proffessions, when they cannot reduce their
Subjects to the Unity of profession of the same saving Truth, is another case,
and cloathed with other Circumstances, and must be judged of accordingly.
The truth is, when a State is once corrupted, and that deeply in Religion, it's
an hard thing to reform. Publick Confessions are too large, and few of them
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64164:112"/>
without the mixture of something, either superstitious, or erroneous, or
doubtfull, and such as weak Christians of tender Consciences cannot well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XVIII</label> which requires a larger debate then here I intend, and
the consideration of civill Societies, and common-weales, order requires that
I add something of the Church as reducible to this Commandement. The
Church is a spirituall Society, and a multitude professing Christ, associated in
matters of Religion. And though the same persons, which are Members of a
civill State, may be Members of a Church, yet they are to be considered under a
different notion. The Author of this Society is God, &amp; that in a more special
manner: who first by extraordinary, then by ordinary men, especially since the
Exhibition of Christ, makes them Subjects of this Kingdome, which is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this whole Treatise, and admits them into this Society. When they are
once reduced, and made Subjects unto God Redeemer, they constitute that
Common-wealth whereof he is Head, and Monarch. And this Society, since
the Revelation of the Gospel, may be considered as universall, consisting of the
Christians of all Nations: and in this respect they are all subject unto Christ as
their Lord and King. Yet this universall Church, and these persons, scattered
and divided in many Nations, may be united and associated in severall Vicini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes,
according to their cohabitations, into greater or lesser Bodyes, for Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
and Worship, or for Discipline. As associated for Worship, and Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
they have their Pastours, to whose charge they are committed by the holy
Ghost. And these Pastours may be many, and have their severall assignations,
and their particular flocks; or a number of them may take the charge of a
greater number in common; or every one my have their severall congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in particular. From hence ariseth a relation of Pastour and People. The
Duty of the people is, to esteem their Pastours and Teachers highly, in love for
their works sake, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 13. To obey them, and submit unto them: <hi>Obey
them</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>who have rule over you, and submit unto them: for they
watch over your Souls, Heb.</hi> 13. 17. They must atttend unto their Doctrine, and
follow their good example, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. They must maintain them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for them: For Christ hath ordained that they who preach the Gospell
should live of the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 14. And let him that is taught in the Word
communicate to him that teacheth in all his goods, Gal.</hi> 6. 6. The Duty of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
and Pastours, amongst others, are these: To be rightly qualified, and
also called to their places, binding themselves to do Christ service in that Office.
They must plant, and water, preach, catechize, and edifie the people wholly
in the saving Doctrine of the Gospel: and though they cannot confirm their
Doctrine by Miracles; yet let them do it by good example. They must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
the Sacraments according to Christ's institution, pray for the People,
perform all publick services of Religion, and do all things that tend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
confirmation, and Salvation of the People.</p>

admonitions, good example. They deny them maintainance, have itching ears,
affect novel opinions, are carried away with strange Doctrine. They prove schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall,
desert their faithfull Pastours, vex them, persecute them. Ministers
offend, when not rightly qualified, enter upon the place without a due call, and
in an undue manner; when their end is gain, not the good of the peoples souls;
when they neglect their calling, or are carelesse, or remisse, in the discharge
of the Ministery, preach false or unprofitable Doctrine, give bad example, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt

Courts of Jurisdiction, Spiritual. In these Ecclesiastical States, the Supream
Power of the Keys, or Church-Government, is in the whole Combination:
the delegated Power is in their Officers, and in their Representatives. This
Constitution finished, the Superiours and Governours, are the Officers, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives,
whereby the whole Church doth exercise her Power: and every
particular member, whether Officer, or any other, is subject: This Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should be agreeable to Christ's Institution: and it's no ways safe, that the
<hi>Association</hi> should be of too little, or too great extent: And most certain it is,
that Christ did never ordain, that there should be one Universal Supream Court
in any part of the World, to which all Christian, of all Nations, should submit,
or make Appeals. The Duty of the People, and Members of this Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and every particular Person, Officer, or any other, is to submit to
this Order, once established, according to the Laws and Rules of Christ, obey
the <hi>Canons,</hi> acknowledge the Officers, receive their Jurisdiction. The Duty of the
Governours, is, to consider, whether the Constitution be according to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
to have a special care to make good <hi>Canons,</hi> and to constitute able, prudent,
pious, and sit Officers; to inform the Ignorant, reform the Scandalous, reprove,
admonish, suspend, or excommunicate absolve; and in such a manner, that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Discipline may be preserved pure, the People reformed, the Church
edifyed, and Christ glorified. And the Civil Magistrate should countenance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,
assist them so far, as his Civil Power, in this particular, may be useful. The
Discipline is easily corrupted, hardly reformed, the Primitive and Apostolical
Order little known. And, in this point, many are our Divisions. Men have their
several conceits of it: Every Party fancy their own way to be the Pattern in the
Mount, and few are impartial, and unprejudiced; and though a good Discipline
may be proposed, yet the greatest part cannot endure it.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>I</label> by the former Commandement, determined the right of <hi>Persons,</hi>
and in this He begins to define man's right in things, which He commands
to be observed. The first and principal thing, which a man hath right unto, is
his life; and therefore, after the duty to be performed to our Parents by whom
we receive life from Him, he takes care, and provides for the safety of man's
person, and the preservation of his life, by prohibiting Murder. This Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
presupposeth, that God alone, according to his absolute propriety, hath
the absolute power to dispose of man's life, and can take it away, and that justly
at will and pleasure: and that no man can do without Warrant extraordinary,
or ordinary, from him. Man hath no absolute right to dispose of his own
life, whereof he hath onely the possession and use, but not the propriety: and
therefore he must not so much as hazard it, without Divine Warrant.</p>
               <p>The subject therefore of this Commandement,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> is this mortal and bodily life
of man, which we receive by Conception and Birth, and part with by Death. It
consists in the union of Soul and Body, which is not so firm, since that sin entred
into the World, but that it easily may be dissolved. For man consists of two
parts, Soul and Body: The Soul, in it self, is incorruptible, and immortal, and
no man can kill it; though man, and many things else may separate it from the
Body, and the Body from it. Therefore, in the profession of the Gospel, we need
not fear men, who kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul, <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 28.
The malice and violence of man may make the Body an unfit Habitation for
the Soul to dwell in, and no fit Instrument for the Soul to act by; and then the
Soul no ways able to animate the same, is gone, and stays no longer. As this life
is the subject of this Commandement, so the end of it is to preserve the same,
and not to break the Bands of Union, till it be God's time, Soul and Body must
part.</p>

kill</p>
               <p>1. In general, is to take away the life of any living Creature, and this is not
the sin.</p>
               <p>2. It's to take away the life of man; neither is this absolutely and simply
the Crime: For the life of man may be taken away, and yet justly. Now God
doth never forbid any thing that is just: yet this may be so just, that it would be
injustice not to do it.</p>
               <p>3. Murther, here forbidden, is to take away the life of man unjustly, and
without Warrant from God. To understand this sin of Murther, we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
certain distinctions: For,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It's Negative, or Positive.</item>
                  <item>2. It's total, or partial.</item>
                  <item>3. It's inchoat, or consummate.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Negative Murther, is when we deny to give, or do something, when it's our
Duty, without which life cannot subsist, or continue, as shall appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Positive, when we by some violence, or some other way, do that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive,
or tends to the destruction of life: So the life of many a man is taken
away by Poyson, and other secret Plots, devised by cursed Wretches, and put in
execution by bloody Villains.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:64164:114"/>
It's totall, when life is wholly taken away immediately, or the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
some mortall harm, so that life is irrecoverable.</p>
               <p>Partiall Murther, is committed by wounds, blows, stripes, or other violence
which destroyes a limb, or limbs; for all these hazard life, and take away the
perfection of it, and tend to destruction.</p>
               <p>It's inchoate in the mind, and heart first, and then in words. In the mind, as
by violent passions of anger, wrath, fury, and rage, or by malice and hatred. For
all murther is begun in the heart, and, the more of Will, consent, and resolution
there is, is the more heynous. Therefore Wilfull Murther is accounted most
heynous; and Man-slaughter is a grievous sin, though not so grievous as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
Both issue out of the heart: for out of the heart proceed evill thoughts,
Murthers, <hi>&amp;c: Luke</hi> 15. 19. Chance-medly (as we call it in our law) indeed
takes away life; but the party thus killing his Neighbour, whom he formerly
loved, or did not hate, is rather unhappy, then wicked; because there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Will in it. God therefore assigned Cityes of Refuge, for the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of such. Yet these, if when they did this, they were either vainly, or ill imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
have much cause to be deeply humbled: For no such unhappy event can
fall out without the Will of our <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> who could easily have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
that sad accident. The most bloody disposition of the mind, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is most
directly contrary to this Commandement, is that of hatred, and deliberate
malice. Therfore it is said, that he that hateth his <hi>Brother</hi> is a <hi>Murtherer, 1 Joh. 3.
15.</hi> Yet Anger, and Wrath, if rash, and unjust are transgressions of this Law in
the judgement of our Blessed Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 20. If anger be continued, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
malice: and that malice is most accursed, which deliberates, and resolves
of Murder, and proves implacable, though it commit not the fact, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of want of pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r, and opportunity, or for feare of some mischief, which
may befall the party himself, if he put the bloody design in execution. Yet to
hate, and actually Murder is more; then to hate, and not to Murther, absolutely
considered. There is another degree of this sin, in bitter, spitefull, reviling, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious
words. For whosoever shall say unto his Brother <hi>(Racha)</hi> shall be
in danger of the Councell: But whosoever shall say <hi>(Thou Fool)</hi> shall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Hell fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 21. The former word seemes to be a terme, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of passion; the other of contempt. There be also treacherous words,
which tend to the taking away of life, and there be whisperings, backbiting,
standering, and tales, all tending to shed blood, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 9. There be words,
which are softer then oyle, and yet are drawn Swords, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 21. There are

bloody sin is begun in the heart, and tongue of man. Yet it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate
without the Hand, which is the instrument to execute and accomplish
what Thoughts, and Words have begun.</p>
               <p>Again in this sin,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> as in others, some may be principall, some accessory, and so
guilty, by consent, counsell, assistance, connivence in concealing, or not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
or some other way: And whosoever shall not use all meanes to prevent,
and save the innocent, or not endeavour to see the Murder, once committed,
punished, are guilty of blood. In this respect the Priest, and Levite passing by
a man wounded, and half dead; yet neither pitying him, nor endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
him, were guilty, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 30. For if we should do our diligence to save
the life of a beast, much more the precious life of man. Let's heare what God
saith in this particular. If thou forbear to deliver them, who are drawn to
death, and those that are ready to be slain. If thou sayest, Behold we know
it not: Doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it, and he that keepeth
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64164:114"/>
the Soul, doth not He know it? and shall he not render to every man according
to his Works? <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 11. 12. We read that a <hi>Galatian</hi> Shepherd refusing
when it was in his power, to save a man torn with dogs, was three yeares after
slain by Wild Beasts himself. This was a just judgement from God. The Rich
man refusing to relieve Poor, miserable, and hungry <hi>Lazarus,</hi> lying at his gates
could not be innocent: neither can any such unmercifull, and inhumane
wretches. For not onely such, as cruelly oppresse, afflict, and grind the faces
of poor people, but such as are devoyd of mercy, and the bowels of compassion
are guilty. <hi>Si non pavisti, occidisti: Ambros.</hi> In this kind, unskilfull or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Physitians cannot be excused. Some of these do not valew the life of
man, and are easily perswaded for favour or gain, to murther such, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to cure.</p>
               <p>As there are private; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> so there be publick Murders, and these are also nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
or positive: Negative, when they neglect to enquire after the authours of
Murder, or acquit them being known, or grant them Pardons. By this meanes
sometimes a whole Land is polluted with blood and suffereth Gods vengeance.
For a Murderer should be taken from the Altar and put to death, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 14.
No satisfaction must be taken for his life, but he must surely be put to death,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 31. And a man that doth violence to the blood of any person, must
fly to the pit; Let no man stay him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 17. He that endeavours to save
a bloody person, must needs be guilty of blood himself. Some make bloody
lawes to take away most unjustly the lives of their innocent Subjects: Some
wrest the lawes just in themselves, and by unjust Judgement condemn the guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
to death: and this is done in time of peace. All such as wage unjust wars,
or manage just wars cruelly, and unjustly, are great transgressours. Such also
are all seditious, and tumultuous persons, and also the <hi>Authours of civil Wars,</hi>
and enemies to the administration of justice. Some are too remisse in just
wars to revenge that blood, which was cruelly and causelesly shed by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
This was the sin of King <hi>Saul,</hi> in that he destroyed not the <hi>Amalekites</hi>
from under Heaven.</p>
               <p>Besides the former differences,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> and degrees of this sin, there be others:
For even of <hi>Wilfull</hi> Murders, those are most heynous,</p>
               <p>1. Which are committed out of pure malice, or a contempt of the precious
life of man: Some are so bloody, as they make no more account of the life of
man then of a beast, nor so much: Others are so cruel, as that they delight in
the torment which others suffer, and therefore take away the lives of others so,
as to put them to lingring and extreame paine.</p>
               <p>2. To Murder Father, Mother, Children: as the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> and, after, some
cursed <hi>Israelites</hi> did sacrifice their Children to the Devil, is most unnaturall,
grievous, and abominable.</p>
               <p>3. To Murder Magistrates, Judges, publick Officers, and especially
<hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> upon whom the publick peace and safety doth much
depend, is a far more heynous transgression then to slay a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>4. To Murder innocent persons, and such as have done no wrong, nor giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
any cause, is far more then to Murder injurious and abusive provoking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>5. The blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> and the Saints, and faithfull Servants of God do cry
most loud, because the cursed <hi>Caines,</hi> and Perfecutours slay them, because their
works were good, and their own evill: and out of an hatred of the power of
Godlinesse in them: For the more of God is in them, the more they hate them.
The most heynous Murther in respect of the person, the injustice, the malice,
the reproach, was the crucifying of <hi>Christ</hi> the Son of God.</p>
               <p>

'Tis difficult,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> if not impossible to reckon up all kinds, and different ways of
murther: For the life of man is exposed to a thousand dangers, and is easily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away: and the malice of the Devil that old murtherer, and of bloudy men,
is very great. So that it's the great mercy of God, that man lives half his days, or
that any dyeth a natural death. And therefore our duty is, to be thankful to our
God, as for other mercies, so for the continuance and preservation of our life.
And every day should we commit our selves into his hands, prepare for death,
set our soules in order, desire his protection, and the guardance of his Blessed
Angels. And, in this place, we might take occasion to speak of self-murther,
which is certainly unlawful: For we have not the absolute propriety, but the
use of our lives given us of God to use, and to make an account to him of the
same. A man may be unmerciful, and unjust unto himself, both in respect of life,
and other things. Unto all the former sorts of murther, may be added all unjust
Punishments, and especially such as grant life, yet upon such tearms, that it is
worse then Death: as when innocent persons are condemned to cruel Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
or to the Gallies, or to Banishment, or the Mines. By what hath been
said, we may, in some measure, understand what God hath forbidden.</p>
               <p>The Preceptive,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> and Affirmative part is implied, and may be easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the former, which is Negative. For, as the Duty is, so our care must
be to preserve the life of our Neighbour, as our own; which is dear, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
to us. To this end,</p>
               <p>1. We must be humble, meek, patient, peaceable, placable, and ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,
and be reconciled, upon reasonable tearms, unto our Enemies.</p>
               <p>2. We must be pittiful kind, liberal, and ready to give, or do what shall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the preservation of the lives of others, and not suffer them, through
out own default, to perish.</p>
               <p>3. We must be bold, resolute, couragious, and ready to hazard our goods, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
liberty, and sometimes our own lives, to save innocent persons, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the servants of God, and rescue them out of the hands and jaws of wicked
and cruel men. <hi>Open thy mouth</hi> (saith God, by the <hi>Wise-woman) for the Dumb, in
the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction,</hi> Prov. 31. 8.</p>
               <p>4. We must, in a just War, be willing to lay down our lives for our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
that by the Death of few, many may be preserved.</p>
               <p>5. As our hearts must be well affected, so our words must be words of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
patience, love, humility, peace, kindness, comfort. And as we must avoid the
causes and occasions of doing hurt; so all our inward affections, outward car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
words, deeds, must be so ordered, as shall most tend to the safety of the life
of others. Neither must our Prayers and Endeavours be wanting, to prevent
the death of innocent persons. Thus <hi>Reuben</hi> sought to save the life of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Joseph. Esther</hi> adventured her life to prevent the ruine of her people,
<hi>Esth.</hi> 4. 11, 12, &amp;c. Thus <hi>Ebedmeleck</hi> delivered the Prophet out of the Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 38. 7. 8. And God remembred the Work of Mercy to reward it, <hi>Jerem.
39.</hi> 15, 16. Besides all this we must not conceal, but discover, and that betimes,
all Plots, Designs, Intentions of Murther, known unto us; do what we can to
prevent the effusion of innocent bloud; severely, and carefully prosecute all
Bloudy Murtherers. And herein all Judges, Magistrates, Higher-Powers, who
are trusted with the Sword, must, by the Sword, cut off bloudy men, and not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to live.</p>
               <p>The Reasons why we should abhor,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IX</label> and take heed of this sinne, are many:
For,</p>
               <p>1. The life of man is precious, and the greatest and chiefest Earthly Treasure
man can have: it's the best thing under Heaven, and in it self the greatest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of God in this World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:64164:115"/>
2. It was given of God to serve him, and seek a better, and more glorious
life in the World to come. To take it away before the great work be done, and
Man hath made his peace with God, and secured his Title to Heavens Kingdom,
is a most horrid crime, and tends to the destruction of Soul and Body at once,
and may be a privation, and prevention of Eternal Life, to be enjoyed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Therefore, it's no wonder, God doth so much detest it. And many are so
malicious and revengeful, as that, if it were in their power, they would destroy
and punish both Body and Soul in Hell fire. 'Tis reported of a bloudy man of
<hi>Millain</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> that when he had suddainly surprized one whom he hated,
overthrowing him, set his Dagger to his Breast, and told him, that he would kill
him, unless he would renounce, and forswear God: which when this surprized,
fearful man had done, that bloody man presently killed him, saying, This is a
noble Revenge, which doth not onely deprive the Body of Temporal Life, but
brings also the Immortal Soul to endless flames: <hi>Bodin. de Rep. Lib. 5.
Cap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>3. The Body of Man, as well as his Soul, was redeemed, and bought by the
blood of Christ, is, or should be the Temple of the Holy Ghost, is capable of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
glory; and man was made in the Image of God: So that to destroy
the body of Man, and take away this life unjustly, and without Warrant from
God, must needs be an offence against God the Father, in whose Image Man
was made; against the Son, who redeemed him; against the Holy Ghost, whose
Temple he is, and against man himself, his Neighbour, his Brother, his Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
in Christ. And for Christians, to murder Christians, must needs be
heynous, seeing we profess our selves Christians, and Fellow-members in Christ;
and thereby we engage our selves to the highest degree of love of all other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the World. To murder a Christian, is not onely a sinne against God-Greatour;
but also, and that directly, against God-Redeemer, which is an high
aggravation.</p>
               <p>4. The life of man once destroyed, cannot be restored: neither can any sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
sufficient be made either to God, or Man, for the same: for life is
inestimable, and cannot be ransomed by all the Gold and Silver in the
World.</p>
               <p>5. This sin is the most destructive of Humane Society: so that if God should
not forbid it, restrain it, or punish it, no man could live in safety, and the Earth,
in a short time, would be unpeopled, and wholly desolate.</p>
               <p>6. God hath given a strict charge, that no murtherer should live; and woe
unto them that shal protect, or abber, or endeavour to save any man whose hand
is embrued in innocent bloud.</p>
               <p>7. Murderers are the children of the Devil in a special manner: for he was
a murtherer from the beginning.</p>
               <p>8. The Judgments of God, upon this sin, are severe, many, signal, and his
detestation there of very great. This appears by the many strange and superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Discoveries of secret murthers, by the strange and extraordinary Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon bloudy persons. For sometimes He punisheth them by Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the same kind, and sometimes by the same persons, that employed them
in the murther of others; sometimes, by some fearful Vengeance executed in
the same place, where they had shed the bloud of others; sometimes, in the
same time, as the same Day, and Moneth, wherein they had murthered others,
that man might take notice, hear, and fear. For this Sin God sometimes puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
not onely the Persons guilty, but Families, whole Nations, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
               <p>God's own people in Covenant with him, must suffer for the innocent blood
shed by <hi>Manasses:</hi> and neither his Repentance, nor good <hi>Josiah's</hi> serious and
zealous Reformation could avert the judgment. Blood is a crying Sin, and calls
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64164:116"/>
aloud for Vengeance; and God, the Judge of all the World, must needs hear, and
will make Inquisition, and manifest his indignation. If <hi>David,</hi> a man after
God's own heart, will slay innocent <hi>Uriah,</hi> with the Sword of the children of
<hi>Ammon,</hi> the Sword shall not depart from his own house. One Son shall mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
another, and his own child that came out of his own bowels, shall not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seek his Crown, but thirst after his Bloud. The innocent bloud of Christ lies
heavy upon the Jews for these 1600 years. <hi>Cain</hi>'s horrour of Conscience was
dreadful, and <hi>Judas</hi> his torment intollerable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: and why? Both had shed inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
bloud. Therefore we must not murder.</p>
               <p>Yet all this must be understood of the effusion of innocent bloud,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>X</label> without
warrant from God. Otherwise, <hi>Abraham</hi> could not have been guiltless, in
that he purposed to sacrifice his innocent Son <hi>Isaack. David's</hi> just wars had been
unjust. <hi>Joshua's</hi> severity against the <hi>Canaanite,</hi> to whom he gave no quarter, had
been cruelty. <hi>Saul's</hi> destruction of <hi>Amaleck,</hi> in not sparing man, woman, nor
child, could not have been warrantable. <hi>Moses,</hi> by the <hi>Levites,</hi> slays 3000 of his
Brethr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n in one day; and <hi>Phinehas</hi> takes away the life of two guilty Persons,
without Formality of Law, and judicial process: and yet both were innocent,
neither chargeable with bloud, because they did it justly. In this respect, the
punishment of Blasphemers, Idolaters, and capital Offenders, is lawful, and
warrantable, no ways contrary to this Law. Some explain and enlarge this
Commandement, so as to include the murder of Souls, as here prohibited. But
the Commandement doth not extend so far. It's true, that we may conclude
from hence, that if murther of the Body, much more the murder of the Soul,
must needs be an heynous sin.</p>
               <p>The Devil is the murderer of Souls, by tempting men to sin; and so are all
his Agents, who by false Doctrine, evil Example, Perswasions, Commands, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
incline men to believe Lyes, and disobey their God. And such as
shall not endeavour the Conversion and Salvation of others, cannot be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
               <p>But these things are not proper to this Commandement, which was given for
the preservation of man's bodily life: Yet we may argue, that if it be so hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
a crime to kill the Body, it's farre more heynous to murder the
Soul.</p>

affirmative, and a Precept. The Sin expresly forbidden is <hi>Adultery.</hi>
And this presupposeth Marriage, which was instituted by God, and to be
observed by man in the state of Innocency before any sin entred into the World
by man, For God having first created man the Male, after that, create's the
Woman of a Rib of Man, Female. The man was so made, that he was fit to
beget; the Woman was so made as that she was fit to conceive, bear, bring
forth, nurse children. For this was the reason why God made them Male and
Female, because by them thus different in Sex, he intended to propagate all
Mankind of one bloud. The Woman being created, was brought to Man, and
given unto him by God, and he took her, with her consent, as flesh of his
flesh, and bone of his bone; and they twain became one flesh. And God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
this order to be observed unto the end of the World. This was the
first institution of this sacred society: So that the first and principal efficient of
Marriage, was God instituting it; the Subordinate, is the mutual consent of the
parties. For Marriage is a contract, or covenant: This is the general nature
of it; and as the matter is one man, and one Woman, free from all former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
that may hinder it, so the form, and chief essence is in the special nature
of the contract, whereby they mutually bind themselves one unto another so
as to become one flesh for term of life of both the parties. The end is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
mutual help, and comfort; and upon the Fall, <hi>Per accidens,</hi> the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Fornication. One effect, and that a principal one is, That the Wife
hath not power of her own body, but the Husband: and likewise also the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
hath not power of his own body, but the Wife: and this is the reason
why Adultery is so grievous a sin, and a just cause of dissolution; because the
party committing it, doth give that body which is anothers, and not their own,
unto a third party, contrary to Gods institution, the Covenant, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
end of marriage. Amongst Christians this Marriage doth resemble that
spiritual and blessed union of Christ and the Church, begun on Earth to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mate
in Heaven, and should be entred upon and continued so, and also
observed in that holy manner, as that it may be a furtherance, not an hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to that more Heavenly bond, and society. We should first give our
selves to be married to Christ, before we give our selves to be married one unto
another. For Redemption did not abolish, but perfect Marriage. It's not
made necessary to eternal life; for as we may be married and not saved, so we
may be unmarried, and yet Married to Christ and Saved. Yet all Christians
should marry in the Lord: Though the Marriage of Heathens, as Marriage,
is lawfull, and their children born in Marriage are legitimate.</p>
               <p>By these things premised concerning Marriage,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> we may easily understand
what Adultery is. It is the defiling of the Marriage-bed. The Apostle saith,
<hi>Let Marriage be honourable in all, and let the bed be undefiled,</hi> Heb. 13. 4. That
the words are a dehortation appeareth from the context. The sin dehorted
from, is Adultery, which is a dishonouring of Marriage, and a defiling of the
Marriage bed. This Adultery is opposed to chastity, and fidelity in married
persons: The sense is; Let all that are married preserve the honour of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and preserve the Marriage-bed pure. This Adultery is committed three
wayes,</p>
               <p>1. When the Adulterer is single, and the Adulteresse Married.</p>
               <p>2. When the Woman is single, and the Man, or Adulterer, Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ried.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:64164:117"/>
3. When both the parties are Married. When one party onely is Married,
and the other single, one bed onely is defiled; but when both the parties are
Married, two Marriage-beds are defiled by one act. This Commandment
followeth the former in order: For the best, and nearest thing is Mans life; the
next is his Wife; who by Gods institution, and solemn contract, is one Person,
and one flesh with him. And for an Husband, or Wife to commit this sin, is
a wrong unto their bodies, which is of more account then their goods can be.
And Adultery is a wrong more heynous than Theft, and next to that of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Some have observed that the sixth and seventh Commandement are
fitly joyned together, because Adultery and Murther often go together. And
we must avoid Adultery the cause, that we may avoid Murther, which is often
committed to conceal Adultery; as in the example of <hi>David,</hi> who having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Adultery with <hi>Vriah's</hi> Wife, caused him to be slain, lest his Adultery
should be discovered. Others consent to murder, that they may enjoy one
another more freely. Thus Adulterous Wives conspire with their <hi>Paramours,</hi>
to poyson, or secretly murder their Husbands. Adultery in either Party is a
grievous sin, but especially in the Wife, because it may bring in a Bastard, and a
spurious brood to inherit her Husbands estate.</p>
               <p>This sin appears to be heinous many wayes,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> and therefore ought with the
greater care to be avoided, and abhorred. It's contrary to Gods institution,
to the sacred and solemn contract of the Married parties; it's a dishonour of
the body. <hi>For every one should know how to possesse his Vessell in Sanctification, and
honour,</hi> 1. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ss. 4. 4. This Vessel is the body: the Sanctification and honour
is chastity: Which implies that Adultery, as also fornication is the dishonour,
and slain of the body. In this respect it may be said, that he that committeth
Fornication, sinneth against his own body. It's a disgrace to the Children,
a blot upon the Family, the cause of wofull discord, the dissolution of the sacred
bond, the ruine of Families, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ource of many miseries. This is farther
evident from the Penalty determined by God against this sin, which was death.
<hi>The Man that committeth Adultery with another Mans wife, even he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth

Again, this society of Marriage being ordained for propagation, is the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

And to multiply a Bastard brood for the beginning of a <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasticall

Persons. It's a curse, and dishonour to any people to be derived from any such

Marriages; and most civilized Nations have their Rites, and Customs
for the more solemn Celebration of the same. Christians appointed the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of the <hi>Banns;</hi> and the solemnization of the Marriage it self, was to be
performed in the open Congregation, with holy instructions, exhortations, and

Marriages. Again, this Crime amongst Christians is more hainous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

expresly; yet implicitly many other sins come under this Prohibition. And
for the better understanding of this commandement, as of some others, we must
take notice of some Rules given by <hi>Catechists, Casuists,</hi> and <hi>Expositors: viz.</hi>
That where one sin is forbidden, all of that kind, and such as bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Analogie,</hi>
or have Agreement with it, are there, by a Synechdoche, forbidden. Where the
effect and the end, there the causes and meanes, are Prohibited. And where the
Principall there the <hi>Accessory</hi> are condemned. Where the act, or outward
fact, there the thoughts affections, inclinations, desires, purposes, gestures,
Words, are determined to be unlawfull; According to these rules; besides Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
many other sins which have some affinity and agreement therewith are
here forbidden: as fornication, incest, whoredome, rapes, deflowring of
Virgins, <hi>Sodomy,</hi> and <hi>Bestiality,</hi> which two lusts are not to be named but with
detestation: And all lasciviousnesse, uncleannesse, and abuse of the body in
this kind. The reason hereof is, because God never gave any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iberty to use
their bodies in this kind out of Marriage. For so soon as he had created man,
and given him a power, and blessing of propagation, and multiplication, He
brings the <hi>Woman</hi> to the <hi>Man,</hi> gives her in marriage unto him; before they
had any warrant to have carnall knowledge one of another. In this respect
simple fornication (as they term it) between single Persons, and the keeping of
<hi>Concubins,</hi> are unlawfull.</p>
               <p>According to the second Rule (of cause and effect) because intemperance, and
excesse in eating,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> drinking, and pampering of the body, and idlenesse are
causes as of other sins, so of these of uncleannesse; therefore in that respect but
no otherwise they are prohibited. Fulnesse of bread, and abundance of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
were two of the great iniquities of <hi>Sodom,</hi> one of the filthiest and leud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
places in the World, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 49. Yet intemperance, luxury, and excess
in bodily pleasures, may be reduced to this Commandement, understood in a
latitude as prohibiting all excessive, and inordinate enjoyment of worldly and
bodily pleasures. And the <hi>Jews</hi> being as sed horses in the morning, neighed
after their neighbours wives, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 8. Lewd company is also another cause.
<hi>Dinah Jacob's</hi> Daughter wanders, and gads abroad to see the Daughters of the
Land, falls into lewd company, and is deflowred. For which sin the City of
<hi>Shechem</hi> is destroyed. To gaze unadvisedly upon beauties may kindle the
flames of lust. Immodest, and wanton Apparrell, Carriage, Gestures,
Words filthy Communication, Lewd Pictures, filthy books, too much familiarity
of Men with Women, or Women with Men, who have not the gift of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
and converse with them without any calling, especially, with the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the Devil, who will take all advantages, are dangerous. Not to
reckon up particulars, which are many; this we must know for certain, that
whatsoever is a cause, or occasion of this sin of uncleannesse; and gives advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
or opportunity to Sathan, is forbidden, as such, in this place. Yet the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this sin, as of all other, is in the heart: for, as, <hi>out of it evil thoughts,
and murders;</hi> so <hi>adultery and fornication issue,</hi> Mat. 15. 19. <hi>For whosoever looketh
on a Woman to lust after her, hath committed Adultery with her already in his
heart,</hi> Mat. 5. 28. Till temptations come into the heart, we are safe. But
when the heart begins to entertain unclean suggestions, conceive and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
unclean thoughts, desire unclean pleasures; the devil hath insinuated
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64164:118"/>
himself, and is entered already. But if we yeild consent, resolve to fulfill
our lusts, and deliberate how to accomplish our filthy design, then he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
and will hardly be forced out; we become his captives and slaves, the
sin is conceived and formed in us: And this deliberate consent, and resolution
is the principal part of this sin; and most properly contracts the guilt. For
where there is Reluctancy within, and strong temptation without, or a suddain
surprizall, the sin is not so heynous. The inward disposition, and willing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of the heart doth most offend God: the outward act, and the use of
meanes to accomplish our desires, do the greatest hurt to man. Yet as there
are degrees of these sins within, so there be also without, and that not onely
in respect of the severall kinds of filthinesse; for some are more abominable
then other in their own nature; some by complication, because in one act
Adultery and Incest may concurre; but also in respect of the act, and habit.
For the sins of adultery and murder were not habituall in <hi>David:</hi> his constant
temper was far different, though some make a Constant practise of this sin.
Besides all these wayes of contracting guilt in this particular, some are guilty,
though not as Principalls, yet as Accessory. For many are no better then
<hi>Bawdes,</hi> and <hi>Panders,</hi> by being subservient, and officious unto other in this sin:
<hi>Thus</hi> Jonadab <hi>contrives a meanes, and gives advice to</hi> Amon, <hi>how be might fulfill
his lust upon his Sister</hi> Tamar, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 5. Thus far the negative part, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we understand what sins are here forbidden, and also how hard a thing it
is, to be pure and innocent from all uncleannesse: for few are found, who are
not in some measure polluted. For the causes, and occasions are many, and
the temptations great, and our frailty much: and we have continuall need
of Gods gracious assistance, which without our own constant Vigilancy we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect. As for Polygamy, and the severall cases of conscience, and the
distance of degrees in consanguinity, and affinity to be observed, to avoid incest;
I leave them to Casuists.</p>
               <p>The affirmative part here implied,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> and often expressed in other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the Precept of Chastity: for he that forbids impurity, commands Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
which is not a vertue as it ariseth from the constitution of the body, or
from some naturall, or artificiall causes, but as its rooted in the heart, and is
Regulated by the Word of God. For as the sin of uncleannesse is not in the
outward Act of carnal knowledge, which ordered according to Gods institution
and Law, is not only lawfull, but a meanes ordained by God to propagate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and to continue a Church unto the end of the World: So likewise Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
is not the forbearance of the outward act, but a right, and constant tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the heart, hating the sin of uncleanness, and preserving both Body and
Mind pure, in free obedience unto God. And as the proper, and principal
subject both of all other, &amp; also of this ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ue, is the will: So all this will avoids
all causes and occasions of the sin here forbidden. The inward thoughts, desires,
resolutions, deliberations are pure; the words, gestures, apparrell, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
acts are modest, and sober; so that by a chast soul the Vessel, and body is
kept in Sanctification and honour. And this is the duty here commanded:
But because there are many meanes to preserve Chastity; these therefore
ought to be used. The fear of God, which is the beginning of Wisdome, and
a Principle-generall of all vertues, doth first dispose the soul to this particular
duty; and reigning in the soul commands all temptations to be resisted, evil
company, and filthy persons to be avoided; good and chast Society to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
prayer, frequent prayer against this sin, to be made; some honest imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be used; the Scripture, and pious books to be read; the reasons against
this sin in Scripture to be remembered; the motives unto chastity to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
good examples of Chastity, as that most excellent one of <hi>Joseph</hi> to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
Yet we must know that in respect of persons its twofold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:64164:118"/>
1. Of single persons.</p>
               <p>2. Of married persons. Single persons are such as were never married, or
widows: both these must be chast, so as not onely to have pure, and sanctified
minds, but also to forbear all kind of Carnall copulation. Married persons
may have the use of one anothers bodies without any sin, but then they must
be faithfull one unto another: for onely they that have right unto their bodies
must have the use of them. And if they transgresse, their sin is adultery, and
greater then that of simple fornication; not only because it is an abuse of the
body, as simple fornication is: but because it is against the marriage-contract,
and they have a remedy, which single persons have not; and many more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
follow upon it. In this condition of marriage, many may think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
safe: yet no persons though married must neglect their watch, presume
upon their own strength, contemne temptations: for they may fail as well as
others, as wofull experience hath taught many. Their secret carriage must be
chast before God; their outward behaviour must be modest before men: the
one that they may have a good conscience; the other that they may give good
example. And single persons that have not the gift of continency, must mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
yet wisely, and in the Lord; lest that estate which was ordained for a
comfort, and help, prove a discomfort, and a snare. They are happy in this
respect (and a great mercy of God it is) who have their education in chast, and
modest families and fall not into familiarity with lewd persons: For many who
in chast Company would have been chast, and would have abhorred this sin,
have bin defiled by lewd, and ungodly persons. Yet if we fear our God, and
trust in him, he can preserve us pure in the most filthy societies, as he did <hi>Lot</hi>
in <hi>Sodom;</hi> and deliver them in the strongest temptations, as he did <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Commandement certainly requires temperance,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> as an excellent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Chastity. And divers of the School-men, and Casuists oppose it
to Luxury; which they make a generall; under which they reduce, and rank, in
a certain order,</p>
               <p>1. Simple fornication, to which they referr whoredome, and the use of
Concubi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>3. Adultery.</p>
               <p>4. Deflowring of Virgins in their parents power.</p>
               <p>5. Rapes.</p>
               <p>6. Uncleannesse against nature, as <hi>Sodomy,</hi> and <hi>Bestiality:</hi> all which were
mentioned formerly. Yet this temperance, more properly taken, is opposed
to luxury, taken more strictly for excesse in diet and apparrel, and such things
as tend to the preservation of the body. It's contrary to drunkennesse, and
gluttony, and all excesse in that kind, and may include abstinence, and fasting:
for we must keep the body under, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill
the lusts thereof. The body must not be armed against the soul, lest the flesh rebel
against the spirit. The pampering of it, is like the warming a frozen Serpent
in our bosome to sting us unto death: We are commanded <hi>to abstain from flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lusts, which fight against the Soul,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 11. Yet temperance is properly,
and strictly, here commanded as tending unto Chastity; yet it may come under
another notion, as it doth dispose us to Heavenly duties, and prepare us for
our last account. There are intemperate persons, who are lovers of pleasures,
more then lovers of God; and surfetting and drunkennesse indispose us to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
performances, and unprepare us for our latter end. And in this respect
intemperance is a sin against the first table. Drunkennesse absolutely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
is not a sin against this commandement, but as inclining and disposing to
uncleannesse; and in other severall respects against many other. For there be
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64164:119"/>
divers sins, and divers duties, reducible to severall parts of this morall
Law.</p>
               <p>As there be many disswasives from the sins here forbidden,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> so there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Swasives, and motives to the duties here Commanded: Some are generall
motives to Chastity in generall; some to Chasity in single life; some to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
in marriage in particular. And every Disswasive in generall, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,

               <p>3. We are bought with a price, and cannot dispose of our selves as we please;
but must so use them as our Saviour hath Commanded, and we must honour
and glorifie him, who hath bought them: for his they are.</p>
               <p>4. We have consecrated both soul, and body to his service.</p>
               <p>5. We are Regenerate, and sanctified; and as in soul, so in body, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a power to perform this duty of Chastity, as well as other duties.</p>
               <p>6. We hope, and expect, that these bodies shall rise again unto eternall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and how can we pollute them?</p>
               <p>7. One Reason in generall to all men Jews, Christians, Gentiles, is,
that Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ity is the honour of these bodies of ours, as uncleannesse is their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.
For the bodies of all men being tabernacles of the immortall soul,
and created, and redeemed to immortality; are far more excellent then the
bodies of beasts; and therefore must not be abused, and made like, nay worse,
and more base, then the bodies of brutes. There are besides these common
reasons, others proper to incline married-parties to Conjugall Chastity,
and fidelity: as the honour and Legitimation of our Children, the mutuall
content and comfort of man and wife, the peace and welfare of our Families
for the present, and of posterity for time to come; Gods institution, the
matrimoniall contract, the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

just suspicion of jealously, or be jealous when there is no sufficient cause. We
should know these things, and learn out of Gods word, how excellent a virtue
Chastity is, how pleasing to God, how disposing to heavenly duties. Out of
this knowledge and love to God, we should love this duty, desire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to performe it; and labour to be chast in our hearts, not onely before
men but God. We must resist temptations, and suppresse the first motions
unto uncleannesse; and with <hi>Job</hi> make a covenant with our eyes, and not
think upon a maid, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 1, 2, 3. unto the 13th. In this case, if our right

Psal. 24. 1, 2. <hi>The Earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof;</hi> This is God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.
<hi>He hath founded, and prepared it;</hi> This is the reason and ground of
this absolute Propriety. Yet He was willing, that seeing He made these things
for Man, he should have some right unto them, and an inferiour kind of Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in them. Therefore it is written, <hi>The Heaven, even the Heavens are the
Lords; but the Earth hath He given to the Children of Men,</hi> Psal. 115. 16. So
that Man derives his Right unto them from God, by way of Donation, and that
from the Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28, 29. This Donation is from God, not as Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
but Creatour and Preserver. Therefore it's true, that <hi>Dominium non fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur
in Gratia;</hi> That Man, by Sin, might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orfeit, there can be no doubt, yet if
God took not the Forfeit, so as to re-enter, the Right remains unto men, as men,
not as sanctified. The sanctified onely have a sanctified use of them, and will
be able to make a good account. God renewed his Charter and Donation, <hi>Gen. 9,
3.</hi> and this after the Flood. Yet this is but a common and general Right gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto man in general, and might stand good, though all things continued as
common. This gave neither publike Right to many, nor private to any, yet
was a just Foundation of the Division and Appropriation of things, which was
once introduced by the Law of Nations, and of several States, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of private persons: and though this Division and Appropriation le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t some
things common, and did onely constitute a publike or private Title, yet to make
that publike, which God and Nature have made common, as to drink water out
of the River, &amp;c. or that private, which is publike, is a breach of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.
Besides the Laws and consent of men, there is a special Providence of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64164:120"/>
God, both in disposing the several parts of the Earth to several Nations; as the
Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Israel,</hi> of <hi>Mount-Seir</hi> to <hi>Esau,</hi> &amp;c. and also making private
men, rich or poor, and giving to one more, to another less. This Donation of
God is not absolute and unlimited: for He gives with a <hi>Proviso,</hi> to dispossess,
and take away at will and pleasure; especially when whole Nations, States, or
private men, by their heynous crimes, do forfeit. These goods which God gave
licence to be divided, are either in no man's possession or propriety, or in some
man's possession or propriety. For such as no man claims any right unto, nor
can justly do it, they fall to the first Inventour and Possessour: and this is a good
Title, as also Presciption. For such goods, as others have a Right unto, whilest
that Right continues, we cannot, in Justice, challenge as ours, except they be
given us by the Owners, or sold, or exchanged or left by Inheritance, or deserved
by some Service, or be made Lords thereof, upon Conquest, in a just War. There
be other just ways of acquiring, but I remember them not. These goods are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal,
or incorporeal: corporeal, are immoveable as Lands, or moveable as
other goods: incorporeal, as usages to pass, to drive, to carry through another
mans ground, and other such like. There be degrees of this propriety: Some
have onely the use of another mans goods, but not the profit; some, the use and
profit, but no right of alienation; some, have right of alienation; some, have
onely <hi>Dominium Eminens,</hi> as chief Lords, and can onely demand a chief Rent,
which the Vassal in alienation must always except. A man may be wronged
in all, or any of these; and to deprive a man of the least right, he hath in these
things, by the Laws of God, and just Laws of men, is Theft.</p>
               <p>So that the Form is in the injustice of the <hi>Possession</hi> of these goods; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> and to
know when this <hi>Possession</hi> is unjust, we must</p>
               <p>1. Distinguish betwixt things common things publike, things private, that
we may understand, and that distinctly, the common, the publike, the private
Propriety and Right,</p>
               <p>2. We must consider that some Propriety and Right is grounded upon the
Laws of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some upon the Laws of Men; whether the Law of Nations, or
Laws of particular States; some upon both.</p>
               <p>3. We must observe, that some things may be proper and due, by the Laws of
men, which are not due by the Laws of God, and on the contrary; and some
things are due, both by the Laws of God and Men, agreeing with the Laws of
God: and so far as the Laws of Men are contrary, and, in this particular, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
man's right, they are of no force, neither can they bind any
man.</p>
               <p>4. Seeing Justice commutative, as some call it, doth give, <hi>Suum Cui<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan>
                  </hi> to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one his due; Theft must needs be a not giving of every one that which is his
own, and due unto him by the Laws of God, and the just Laws of men. Not to
give, must be understood in a Latitude, as to include unjust acquiring, unjust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
and keeping, unjust disposing and wasting, &amp;c. of that which is not our
own. And here the Question may be put, Whether the Laws of that God,
who gave the Earth, and the fulness thereof unto the Sons of Men, hath made
any goods so proper, as that the use of them should not be common in cases of
Necessity. The Resolve seemeth to be made by our Saviour's words, justifying
the Disciples plucking the Ears of other men's corn; and, by the Example of
<hi>David,</hi> eating the <hi>Shew-bread,</hi> sacred and proper to the Priests. Whereas some
put, in the definition of Theft, <hi>Invito Proprio Domino,</hi> a taking away goods, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the consent of the Owner, this is not accurate. For though, <hi>Volenti non fit
injuria,</hi> and if the Owner be willing, it's no Injustice, therefore no Theft; yet
goods may be justly taken away in divers cases, without the Owners consent.
This word, <hi>Stealing,</hi> or <hi>Theft,</hi> must be extended so far, as to signifie not onely
<hi>Furtum,</hi> which is a secret and fraudulent Usurpation; but also <hi>Rapinam,</hi> which is
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64164:120"/>
a manifest and violent taking away another man's right. And this Injustice is
opposed not onely to Justice, determined by the Laws of men; but unto Mercy
and Liberality, required by the Laws of God. For men cannot detain, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of their goods, but according to the Laws of the chief Lord, and Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
who is God. And we are here forbidden to wrong men, not onely in
their Propriety, but their Possession, Profit, Use, and Servitude.</p>
               <p>Distinctions of <hi>Theft,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> and so of <hi>Thieves,</hi> are many, both in regard of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the manner:</p>
               <p>1. The matter may be sacred, and given to God, and for pious uses; and to
usurp these, is called Sacriledge. It may be common; and so to usurp it, is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossing:
It may be publike, and so the sin is <hi>Peculiatus,</hi> a robbing or defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Common-wealth: If the thing be of the Herd, or Flock, it's <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geatus,</hi>
driving away of Cattle. If it be any person of man, woman, or child,
it's <hi>Plagium,</hi> Man-stealing. If it be Use or Servitude, it may be called Trespass.
If it be in time of War by Land, and the War unjust, or the Goods taken away,
or consumed, without Commission, or if they belong to such as are no Enemies,
it's <hi>Plundring.</hi> If it be in the time of War, or Peace, by Sea, it's Pyracie. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to these several distinctions of the matter, there be several kinds of <hi>Thieves,</hi>
and <hi>Persons</hi> guilty of <hi>Theft.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Again, they are distinguished for the manner; As,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Causes conjoyned, when several persons concur in the same
<hi>Theft,</hi> whereof some are principal; others, accessary: and that by
receiving, concealing, counsailing helping, sharing, or any other way
consenting in this sin. For as we are forbidden by God, to concur
actively with others, to other sins, so here to this. We must do
what we can to hinder and prevent this sin, detect and use all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means to have the Offenders punished; and so do our best, not
onely to maintain our own, but preserve our Neighbours goods.</item>
                  <item>2. They are such as are gross and palpable <hi>Thieves,</hi> and condemned ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally:
as those who are guilty of <hi>Burglary, robbing by the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
cutting Purses,</hi> and of any kind of filching and stealing, and
of cogging and cheating. Under this head, come such as use <hi>Vivere
ex Rapto,</hi> as <hi>Borderers,</hi> and <hi>Moss-Troopers.</hi> To these, we may add
such as refuse to deliver goods found, unto the right Owners, when
they are certainly known.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thieves,</hi>

are,</p>
               <p>1. Such as make unjust Laws, concerning new Estates to enrich themselves
and oppress, impoverish, and undo their Subjects.</p>
               <p>2. Such as (without Law) by an Ariytrary Power, lay heavy Taxes upon their
Subjects, sequest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r, confiscate, or charge their Estates without just cause.</p>
               <p>3. All covetous Judges, who judge for Rewards, and do wrong to such, as
being wronged by others, seek to them for remedy. And many times we find
it true, that Princes are Revolters, and Judges are companions of Thieves, love
Gifts, and follow after Rewards.</p>
               <p>4. All publike Auditors, Treasurers, Commissaries, Collectors, Publicans,
and other Officers, trusted in the gathering, keeping, dispensing the Publike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
and yet give in false Accounts, divert the Publike Treasure, enhaunce Fees,
extort more then their due, and oppress the People, and rob the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
either in Peace or War, by Sea or Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Private Thieves,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> are either such as are false and unjust in their Trust, or in
their Contracts. False in their trust; as unjust Stewards, Factors, Sharers in a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64164:121"/>
Common stock, Tutors, and Guardians trusted with the estate of Orphans,
and whosoever are any ways trusted with other mens goods, and yet prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful.
Unjust, and unfaithful in their Contracts are many, according to the
several kinds of Contracts; whereof some are made without writing, some are
written. Some of these Contracts I will mention, to discover the several sorts
of Thefts, whereof men are guilty; and give some Directions to reduce many
places of Scripture to this Commandement.</p>
               <p>1. In lending and borrowing, there is Injustice,</p>
               <p>1. In Lending; some lend when they should give, and to those who are in
need, and should be freely relieved. Some will not lend at all, when they might
do it without any prejudice, and are bound to it by the Laws of God. Some will
lend, but not freely, or upon reasonable, but unreasonable hard tearms; as upon
more than ordinary Security by Pledges, Morgages, and such like, to the great
dammage or danger of the Borrowers. These are contrary to that of our Saviour,
who best understood this Commandement, <hi>Give to him that asketh thee, and from
him that would borrow of thee, turn thou not away,</hi> Math. 5. 42. Amongst other
kinds of Lending that of <hi>Vsury</hi> is most to be considered, as admitting of much
debate, and a subject of many Cases. It's lending of Money upon condition, to
receive the Principal with Interest, for the use of it. In respect of the Interest
to be received over and above the Principal, for the mere use, it's called <hi>Vsury.</hi>
Yet, it's to be observed, that it's not always a lending of money actually, but
sometimes virtually, or, as some <hi>Casuists</hi> use to speak, <hi>Interpretativè,</hi> Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
all this in these few words, <hi>Pactum ex mutuo Lucrum.</hi> This <hi>Vsury</hi> thus defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
is not absolutely unlawful. For, in divers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ases, a man may receive from
some men gain for money, or other things lent: in which respect, as <hi>Lucrum ex
mutuo,</hi> is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> unjust: neither is <hi>Lucrum pactum ex mutuo.</hi> For the Covenant, or
Contract added, cannot make it unlawful: Because there are divers Contracts
for Gain of the same nature, which are generally allowed as lawful. But to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and bind the Borrower to Interest for the Use, when he is poor, and such
as by the Laws of God we are bound to help freely; or when we shall bind any
to unreasonable or excessive Interest. For this doth argue the Lender to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
covetous, or unmerciful, or both. And indeed common U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urers, and such
as make a constant trade of it are covetous, cruel, unjust, unmerciful, unchristian,
and cannot be excu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed. For their end is gain, and they will stand upon hard
and strict tearms, even with those whom they should relieve. Many of them are
very cursed Wretches, and not to be suffered in a well-ordered State, much less
in a Christian Church: As for Justice, Equity, Mercy, Charity, they know them
not. The <hi>Israelites</hi> were forbidden to lend upon Usury to their poor Brother,
or to keep his pledge <hi>Exod. 22. 25—6. 7. Levit.</hi> 25. 36, 37. When a Brother
is poor, not by his own default, but the hand of God upon him, and he willing
to labour, and some thing freely lent would help him, he is an object of mercy.
As there is Injustice, and The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t in lending; so there is in borrowing,</p>
               <p>1. When we borrow a thing onely to use, and are bound to return the
same again, as good as we received; or if we cannot, yet give satisfaction. For to
delay too long, or neglect, or refuse altogether to restore it, or deny it; or if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
be made worse, not to make satisfaction, is Injustice.</p>
               <p>2. So it's a Degree of Theft, when we borrow, to restore in the same kind so
much, and so good; and yet either deny to return any thing at all, or return less
in quantity, or worse in quality, or both.</p>
               <p>There is another kind of Contract in Selling and Buying,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> wherein we deal
with others by way of exchange either of one kind of Commodity for another,
or of Money, for all kind of Commodities. And in this, many and great sinnes
are committed, and no man can number the Deceits and Cheats used in this
kind. Many things are sold by Weight and Measure: and not to give just and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64164:121"/>
full Measure, or to sell by unjust Weights, is Theft, and much spoken against, and
condemned in many places of the Word of God. <hi>Monopolies,</hi> engrossing of
<hi>Commodities,</hi> corrupting of vendible <hi>Wares,</hi> and all other means used to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunse
the price of things, are here forbidden. To sell, and give no good Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
to conceal Forfeitures, former Sales, Statutes, Mortgages, and to defraud the
Buyers; or to deny, or delay to give possession, can in no wise be just. To set
too high Rates upon Commodities, and by Lying, and sometimes Swearing, and
Equivocations, to extort from the Buyer a greater price; or cheat and defraud
the simple and ignorant Chapman; to sell that which is not our own, without
warrant from the true Owners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can in no wise be just. To buy under the value,
and so defraud the simple and plain man; to oppress such, as sell for need; to
buy by greater, and sell by lesse Measures or Weights; to buy things plundered,
stoln, and known to be other mens, all co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e in to the <hi>Catalogue of Theft.</hi> So it
is, to buy when we have no need; to raise the Market, and enrich our selves.
There is Theft also in the Contract of setting and taking Houses or Lands,
when Landlords oppress their Tenants, make not good their Bargain, raise the
Rents without cause: In taking, when the Taker observes not his Covenants,
delays payment, or pays not at all, but runs in arrear, making no conscience of
his dealing, useth not the Lands and Houses as his own, so that the Owners suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
dammage. There is also a Theft in the hiring of Servants and Work-men,
when they pay them not their Wages at all, or not their full Wages, or not in
due time. The hired are guilty, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n they are lazie, false, unfaithful. To these
may be added, as Thieves, all such as remove Land-marks, encroach upon others
Right, acquire Possession upon an unjust Title; all such as deny just Usages, and
Services, upon their Lands or Houses; all Litigious Persons, and so all Officers
of State, especially such as have to do with the Publique Revenue, as you
heard before; all such as are employed in Judgment, and deal not fairly, and
justly, as negligent, covetous, or perfidious Lawyers, Attorneys, Sollicitors, &amp;c.
All Officers for Execution; as Sheriffs, Bayliffs, &amp;c. whose Design is to enrich
themselves; all such as trespass upon their Neighbours, and are unwilling to
make satisfaction; all such as refuse to restore Pledges, or things deposited, or
deny to make restitution, when they are bound thereunto. If we should put
in this <hi>Black Bill, all Alienation of Tythes, Impropriations, Prescriptions Customs,
Compositions,</hi> whereby they are impaired; all <hi>Defraudations of Ministers,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
them their <hi>Due,</hi> few would believe us. Yet the sad Effects of these, is,
the starving of the Ministers Bodies, and the Peoples Souls, and the taking away
the Churches Right, contrary to the pious intentions of the <hi>Donours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the several Distinctions of Theft,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> whereby the Parties guilty of this
sin are distinguished and known. The degrees and causes of this sin here prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>2. The <hi>Tongue</hi> is abused to lye, flatter, swear, equivocate, accuse falsly, partly

others of their goods.</p>
               <p>3. In Writing; Evidences, Deeds, Obligations, Covenants, are antedated, or

                  </gap>tiness; especially when we spend that we have in
proud and sumptuous Apparel, Building, Furniture, vain Arts, Recreations,
Sports, Gaming. For if any man take such a course of life, as that his Expences
shall exceed his Estate, he must either reform his ways, or if he continue his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive
course, he must be a Beggar in time, or fall upon some inordinate way, or
unjust means of acquiring that which is not his own. Pride and Ambition are
costly, and will not be maintained with a little: and most men spend their
Estates, either in Vanity, or Iniquity. Both these are grievous sins, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the rearer.</p>
               <p>4. Covetousness is a great cause of Theft, and Injustice, and it's very unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
will pitty no man, do right to none, wrong to any, use the basest and most
sordid, yea, the most horrid means, to gain. It will not onely oppress, but mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Fatherless and Widow or any other, to gain their Estates.</p>
               <p>5. Fear of want, weakness of Faith, whereby we should trust in God, and cast
our care upon him, is a temptation to this sin; as also discontentedness, with
that Estate God hath given us, and too much love of our selves.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if we do not seriously consider, and certainly believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we are but
Stewards of our goods, and must dispose of them, according to God's Will, so as
not onely to be just, but also merciful, and both just and merciful in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

according to our ability. The particular Branches of this Justice, may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by the several kinds of Injustice formerly mentioned; and therefore I
need not proceed to particulars. The degrees also answer to the degrees of
Theft. For this Duty, as all the rest begins in the Heart, which must be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
out of love to Justice, to do no man wrong, to do every one right, not onely
in paying Debts, making Satisfaction and Restitution, where Wrong hath been
done, to which he may be forced by the Laws of men; but also he must be
merciful, and relieve the Poor, and give to pious Uses; and, always, rather ready
to want and suffer wrong, then to do wrong. It goes on in Words and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;
in all which he must be plain, honest, faithful, constant, true, and no
ways chargeable with Deceit, or Dishonesty, and Double-dealing. In our
Deeds we must acquire justly, use honestly, give freely, detain nothing that is
due, when it's due, nor take any advantage to the injury, and dammage of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though it be in our own power: and though we swear to our own hurt, yet
we must not change, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 4.</p>

The means to the Observation of Justice,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>X</label> are many: For,</p>
               <p>1. We must consider, that these Earthly Goods are given us to preserve our
lives in this time of our Pilgrimage, and a little will do it: and when we come
unto our abiding City, which God hath prepared, we shall not have any need of
these things.</p>
               <p>2. We are but Stewards of our goods, and are bound to give an account both
how we get them, and how we spend them, to our God.</p>
               <p>3. They are given us to be used so, as to seek God's Kingdom, and lay up
Treasure in Heaven, where we must expect a glorious Inheritance, and an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Estate: in comparison of which, all the Treasurers of the World are but
trash.</p>
               <p>4. We were not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver and
Gold, which cannot deliver us from Death, much less from sin, and the Eternal
Punishments of Hell.</p>
               <p>5. Seeing we were redeemed by the precious bloud of Christ, we must give
our selves, and goods, wholly to him, to be disposed of, according to his Will.
Without the consideration of these things, we cannot Evangelically, as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
obey this Commandement. These are general means. The particulars
are,</p>
               <p>1. Contentedness with our estate which God hath given us, be it more or
less. The Apostle tells us (and we may believe him) <hi>That godliness, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
is great gain;</hi> and he gives a reason to perswade us: for we brought
nothing into this World, and it's certain, we can carry nothing out. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Food and Rayment, let us therewith be content, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8. And Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
will tell us, that all the rest, though never so much, besides these, are
needless.</p>
               <p>2. We must not be idle, but painful and laborious, and use some honest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
to maintain our selves, and relieve others.</p>
               <p>3. We must be provident and wise, in using and ordering that which we
have.</p>
               <p>4. We must be frugal, and sparing in an honest way, not sordid; and we
must take heed of all expensive courses, in things that are vain and sinful, and
keep within our compass.</p>
               <p>5. We must know, that the way to thrive, is to be honest, and merciful; and
if we first of all seek God's Kingdom, and His Righteousness, trusting in our
God, we may be sure we shall be provided for.</p>
               <p>To perswade us to the observation of this Law,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XI</label> besides the general Reason,
from the Command of God, not onely <hi>Creatour,</hi> but <hi>Redeemer;</hi> the Eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
threatned, and Rewards promised, our own Vows and Promises to
our God, and the power of Grace given us for obedience; There are many
particular Disswasives from Theft and Injustice, and Swasives to just Dealing,
Equity, and Mercy.</p>
               <p>1. This is directly contrary to the peace and welfare of Humane Society,
which cannot be continued, if Theft, Rapine, Injustice, unmercifulness, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
be suffered. For, how many Dissentions, Quarrels, Miseries, arise from this
Sin?</p>
               <p>2. The folly of Injustice, Oppression, and Covetousness, appears to be great,
if we consult the Scriptures: For they inform us, that whilest men seek to
gain, they lose; whilest they enrich themselves unjustly, they become poor. For
Goods and Estates acquired unjustly, waste away, the Curse of God consumes
them; their Lands, Houses, Treasures, fall into the hands of others.</p>

                  </gap>ave them in the midst of their days, and find little or no comfort in
them. And the more uncertain they are in themselves, and corruptible, the
more uncertain the Possession and Enjoyment: the more frail and mortal the
Owners be, the greater the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olly is. They do but load themselves with thick
Clay, and lay snares for their own lives, and bring upon themselves Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>3. The Punishments threatned, and executed by God, and recorded in the
Scripture, are very fearful: For not onely private Persons, but great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Families, and whole Nations have suffered for this sin. And God hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ways signified his detestation of Covetousness, and indignation against Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
hath promised to hear the Cries of the Oppressed, and to revenge
their cause and wrongs.</p>
               <p>4. It's contrary, and that directly, unto Christianity, insomuch, as that Christ
will punish with Eternal Fire, not onely such as have been <hi>Thieves,</hi> covetous
Oppressours; but even such as refused to relieve His poor Saints and Members,
in their wants and distresses.</p>
               <p>5. Justice and Mercy, in this kind, are great Preservatives of Peace and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
in Humane Societies; and therefore God so often calls for the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them.</p>
               <p>6. A little Estate, justly gotten, wisely used, is always accompanied with
God's Blessing, and transmitted to Posterity, without any curse or guilt. In this
respect, a little which the Righteous hath, is better then the Riches of many
Wicked, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 16.</p>
               <p>7. Works of Mercy, and Benevolence to them who are in want and misery,
are highly commended, and to them a rich Reward is promised. For what is
given to the Poor, God takes as lent unto himself, and He engageth to re-pay
with Interest. And if these be shewed to the Saints, in the Name of Christ,
the least of them, to a cup of cold Water, shall not lose the Reward, or be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
either in this life, or in the life to come, when Christ shall give posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of an Everlasting Kingdom to merciful men.</p>
               <p>8. Justice and Mercy, render men like unto God, and are Duties most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Christians, who have believed in Christ, and must love their Brethren,
with a dying-giving love, seeing Christ dyed, and gave Himself for them, and they
have so deeply tasted of God's love in Him.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Ninth Commandement.</head>
               <p>AFter that God had determined the right of persons,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>I</label> and things, by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
laws, he here prescribes a rule of judgement. For as in the civil law
some observe</p>
               <p>1. Jus.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Judicium,</hi> as the parts, and members of the same, and meanes to observe
justice: So it's here. That which they call <hi>(Jus Civile)</hi> is nothing else but the law,
determining the right of persons, things, actions both publick, and private. And
that which they call <hi>Judicium</hi> is nothing else but certain rules regulating judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which determines whether the law hath been obeyed, or disobeyed, and
the right determined by law observed, or violated, and proceeds accordingly.
So that as the former four Commandements determine the right of persons,
and things to be observed by man, so this prescribes a rule for the better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of Judgment. The end therefore of this law is to regulate Judgement,
and to prevent unjust, and stablish just Judgment amongst men. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the originall of all humane jurisdiction, and civil Courts. For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
understanding thereof you must observe, that all civill power is threefold <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative,
judicial, executive:</hi> and all governments once constituted begin to act,
in making laws; goes on in judgment, according to these laws; and end in
execution, according to this judgment. For execution is the last act, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation
of civil power. The former Commandements give certain rules for
the enacting of humane laws; this, of ordering humane judgment. That some
understand this Commandement so, as though all sins of the tongue were here
forbidden, is not true: Because Perjury, and Blasphemy are forbidden in the
first Table, reviling words against our betters in the 5th; <hi>Racha,</hi> and thou Fool,
in the 6th; Bawdry in the 7th; lying for gaine in the 8th, Commandement,
Others think that the end of this is to provide for our Neighbours fame, and
good name: Yet this doth not reach the true scope of this law, which is, as you
heard before, to establish just judgment.</p>
               <p>These things observed,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> for to cleare the order, manifest the scope, and give
some generall light, I proceed to the explication of the words of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is negative; and therein we may observe.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A party litigant, whose cause is brought before a judge.</item>
                  <item>2. Witnesse to give-in evidence in the cause.</item>
                  <item>3. The testimony,</item>
                  <item>4. The quality of it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. The party litigant is our Neighbour, whether friend, Kinsman, stranger,
enemy, considered as litigant: and in this place it may signifie either the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
or Defendant. For all causes are brought into Courts of judgment by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and complaint. And here I need not distinguish of causes which
are according to some, civil, criminall, capitall; nor of Courts whereof some
are supreme receiving last appeals, and are not bound to formalities; or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
and inferiour Courts which have a limited jurisdiction, and are bound
to a certain form of proceeding.</p>
               <p>2. The witnesse is one that is or should be indifferent to the cause, and in
no wise inclined to the partyes; and hath, or is supposed to have some certaine
knowledge in the matter complained of, and controverted, and so is able to
give some evidence to the judge, who is bound not onely to know the law, but
the thing controverted before he give judgment. For no man can justly judge
of that which he knows not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:64164:124"/>
3. The testimony is an act of a Witnesse, as a Witnesse, whereby he declares,
or pretends to declare, especially to the Judge, his knowledge in the cause con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted:
The end of it is, to give evidence, that so the merit, or demerit of
the cause may be known. And because this testimony is given upon <hi>examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and interrogation, therefore in the originall, <hi>Not to beare false Witnesse,</hi> is,
<hi>Not to answer false Witnesse.</hi> The Testimony in this respect puts on the nature
of an Answer, which is given especially in doubtfull causes upon Oath: and the
Oath is taken to make the testimony credible, because it's supposed no
man will hazzard his soul and interest in God. And because it's the highest
degree of confirmation, in such causes; it's therefore said to be an end of all
strife, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
               <p>4. The quality of the Testimony is the last thing in the Commandement,
and it may be either true or false, and so either promote or hinder justice, do
right or wrong unto our Neighbour litigant. Truth and Falshood are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
essentiall, but accidentall qualityes to a testimony: and because men are
not infallible, therefore their testimony may be false, as well as true.
And the quality forbidden is falshood, the quality commended is truth: for
God saith, <hi>Thou shalt not beare false Witnesse.</hi> In this Commandement, as
in severall others, there is a <hi>Synechdoche.</hi> For hereby witnesse giving evidence,
we must understand all partyes that any wayes actively concurr to judgement;
Whether they be the partyes litigant, Plaintiff or Defendant, as the Judge, or
the partyes assistant, as Sollicitours, Atturnyes, Advocates, Notaries, and Clarks,
or such as are trusted with the execution, either of Writs or Judgment. The
reason why <hi>Witnesse</hi> is onely named, is because judgement doth so much,
yea necessarily depend upon Evidence; and one kind, and the same most usuall,
is by Witnesses: Yet by testimony must be meant all other kind of evidence,
and in this Word is also a Synechdoche; for by it we must understand all judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
acts, as Complaints, Apologies, convention, plea, sentence, execution.
The meaning therefore of the Commandement must be this; Thou shalt not
any wayes concur to unjust judgement, neither shalt thou hinder, but thou must
do thy best to promote justice in all causes, and tryalls. So that injustice, in
judiciall proceedings, whether from Law-givers, or Judges, or Witnesses, or
Advocate, or any person acting in judgment is prohibited, and justice Distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
is commanded. For the Judges of the Earth should be like unto God,
whose Deputyes they are, and render to every one according to their Works.
This justice is necessary to the preservation of humane society, &amp; all civil states:
which may subsist without this or that form of government, so that they have a
government; but cannot continue long without the administration of justice,
which is in all <hi>Polities</hi> like the Sun in Heaven, and the World cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it.
And as Laws are in vain without judgement and execution; so judgement
is not onely vain, but a mischief, if it be not just. Though the Commandement
hath speciall reference to civil judgment in a Common-wealth constituted; yet
it may extend to all private families, and societies, Schooles, and Colledges of
Discipline, and Corporations, yea and to all Ecclesiasticall Courts. And by
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alse Witnesse <hi>analogically</hi> may be understood all private, rash, and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
censures, whisperings, false reports, and too much <hi>Readinesse</hi> to <hi>Believe</hi>
them.</p>
               <p>This sin of false Witnesse,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> as also unjust Judgment, hath its root and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the heart; for out of the heart proceed not onely Murders, Adulteries.
Theft, but false Witnesse: for the heart must needs be corrupt before the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
can be false, or the judgment unjust. For out of the abundance of the
heart the mouth speaketh. Therefore all such as have any desire, resolution or
intention to pervert, and corrupt judgment must needs transgresse this law. It
goes on in words, and writings, and ends in actions, all which, as they tend to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64164:124"/>
hinder just proceedings, and promote injustice must needs be unlawfull. And
in this sin we must neither be principall, nor accessary. If in this particular our
Neighbour suffer, either by our silence, or neglect, or imprudency, we cannot be
excused. By all which we learn that here we are commanded to desire and love
justice in our hearts, and endeavour by words writings and actions to promote
the same. And herein we must not be cold, and carelesse spectators with <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi>
not caring for such things, when we see injustice done; but we must be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and diligent to prevent it, if we have power.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> and the dutyes commanded are many; and may be
reduced unto a certain order, either according to the acts of judgement, from
the first information, unto the last execution; or according to the severall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,

               </list>
               <p> But before this Commandement can be obeyed, the
foundation must be well laid in the enacting of just laws. Therefore the Law-givers,
and Supreme governours have two things to do;</p>
               <p>1. To enact good, wise, just laws, and such as tend to the publick weale,
peace, and prosperity of the subjects.</p>
               <p>2. To appoint good Judges, and Officers: and if this be not done, and so sin
prevented, no justice can be expected. And it's a sad thing when these fail,
and neglect their duty, rebel against God, neglect the publick good; and they
which should reform others, have need to be reformed themselves, and there is
none can reform them. This foundation of just Laws, and good Officers, and
Judges being laid, and a right course taken for a true and faithfull information
of publick crimes, and private offences, just Judgement will very much depend
upon the Judges, whose duty is after they are commission'd as inferiour, or as
supreme, to be well skill'd in the laws, make diligent search into the cause, passe
sentence impartially, according to the merit or demerit thereof, and see the
same faithfully, and fully executed. But if they be insufficient, negligent in the
discussion of the cause, corrupt, covetous, partial, devoyd of the fear of God, love
gifts, favour friends, hate enemyes, fear great ones, or despise the poor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse
and Widdows, their sin against this Commandement will be very
great.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed to other particulars,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> I desire every subject to observe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
laws, and love his Neighbour as himself, live peaceably in the State where
God hath cast him. Love will do no evill: and if we would thus do, we need
not feare the sword, we should prevent Suites, and many ungodly intentions;
and this should be the design of every good Christian. But seeing this will not
be done: and we can neither find any State free from evill doers, nor Church
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:64164:125"/>
without scandalous persons; the duty of Informers, &amp; Plaintiffs comes in first to
be observed. And as publick informers should accuse no man falsly, either for
gaines, or out of spite, and for revenge; so their duty is to give-in true infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and be able to make it good: and they ought to spare no offendours,
whom they certainly know to be such. What is to be done in the Church in
this particular, our Saviour hath informed us fully, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. As for Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs,
and Prosecutors in Criminal causes against the publick, we should ayme
principally, at reformation; and in capitall at the publick good, that others may
heare and feare. But in private wrongs whether they concern our credit, or
persons, or goods, it's our duty first to seek satisfaction in private, between our
selves, or upon a reference to others. But if in this way we cannot prevayl,
and there is a necessity (for in that case suits in law are lawfull, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it will be better to sit down and suffer wrong, pray, and refer our cause to
God) then we must not be so unconscionable as to charge our adversary with any
thing, whereof he is not guilty, nor so imprudent as to undertake the charge
against him, and not be able to make it good. If after the suit is commenced,
and before it receive a finall determination, the adversary be willing of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
and there be any hope of good, and it be not likely to prove prejudiciall,
the Plaintiff ought to accept it, and all the time of the controversie, and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the tryall, he ought to be in Charity. As for the Defendant, if he be
wrongfully charged, he may justly defend himself, so that he do it not unjustly,
nor use any unlawfull meanes to free himself. In this particular we find many
guilty, litigious, delighting in suits, &amp; loving to <hi>vex</hi> their Neighbours; and many
Defendants, who have done wrong, and are questioned, yet will deny it, and
that upon Oath, and will use the most cursed meanes to put the Plaintiff to the
greater charge, to suborne or corrupt Witnesses, and delay the finall decision:
which also is the sin of both partyes sometimes. And few men continue cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
whilst they contend in law. The many sins of the parties litigant
are so well known, that I need not give any further account of them.</p>

faithfull, perswading to peace; and if that cannot be, to be as carefull of their
Clients cause, as of their own. Yet so as to do nothing against a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the rules of Christianity. Their profession is lawfull and good, but
the design of many of them is to gaine, and out of covetousnesse to enrich
themselves. Their end is not peace, and justice. They encourage men in
their litigious suits, perswade them of the justice, and good issue of their cause,
and will undertake it though never so unjust: They disswade men from agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
comply one with another, to bring <hi>grift unto the Lawyers mill,</hi> delay
Judgement, protract Suits, give advantage to their Client's adversary, either ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly,
or negligently, or perfidiously: They make large accounts, exact im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
fees, and pick poor mens purses, and so prove not onely <hi>Theeves</hi>
against the former Commandement, but enemyes to just Judgement, against
this.</p>
               <p>The duty of Witnesses is to remember,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> and seriously consider their Oath,
and accordingly, clearly, and fully, to declare the truth, and all the truth, they
certainly know in that cause wherein they are produced. And this must be
done without any partiality, or respect to any person, with a desire to make
way for, and promote righteous Judgement. Such as are willing to be suborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or corrupted, and are ready contrary to their Oath, and the true end of all
judiciall testimonyes, to testifie that which they know not, or know not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or that which they know to be false, or conceal any of their knowledge, or

or favour, or hatred, or any other inordinate passion and affection; these direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
transgresse against the expresse Words of the Commandement. And further
let every one know that as he is forbidden here to be a false Witnesse, so he is
commanded to testifie the truth certainly known unto him in any cause, when
he is called thereunto, and the case of his Neighbour shall require it. Nay in
some cases we must willingly offer our selves, when we understand that by our
true and faithfull testimony we may prevent in justice, either in clearing and
righting the innocent, or punishing the guilty.</p>

the Law, so far as their place requires, or else, not to undertake the profession)
is to perswade men to peace; if that cannot be done, or be not expedient, to
take full, and perfect information before either they give Counsail, or undertake
the cause. If they find it to be unjust, they must refuse to meddle in it or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it. They must give good, and faithfull Counsail, plead wisely, justly,
effectually in a good cause, be content with moderate fees, remember the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of poor Clients, be faithfull, do what they can to bring the matter to a
due tryall, and with as much expedition as conveniently may be. The sins of
these are many, if they be corrupt, or covetous. Some take upon them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and practise in it, though they have no sufficient skil. They will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
any cause though never so unjust; their end is gaine, not justice; their
God is their gold. They give bad Counsell, encourage the Clients to go on in
an unjust cause, or in such a matter as it's more then probable they shall be cast,
if justice take effect. They will plead against justice, obscure a plaine truth,
puzzle and daunt a timerous witnesse, are senslesse of their Clients condition,
perfidious, will plead vehemently against justice, and do what they can to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
judgement, will not use all diligence to promote justice.</p>
               <p>In our judicial proceedings,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IX</label> according to the constitution of our government
we have Juries, or Jurors; so called because they are sworn before they can
act, and in that respect also they are called <hi>Sacramentales.</hi> These are either
<hi>Delatory,</hi> or <hi>Judiciall.</hi> Delatory are for information, and their businesse is to
enquire after Delinquents, and to certifie their names, and their offences. And
they are either superiour or inferiour. Superiours for a whole County, at
Assises, or Sessions of the peace: and this Jury is called the <hi>Grand-Inquest.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
are such as present, and indite in inferiour Courts. Judiciall are such as
for the substance of the cause determine it for matter of fact, before the Judges
give the sentence for Law. Their judgment is called a <hi>Veredict.</hi> And these,
according to the causes, are such as give their <hi>Veredict</hi> in civil, or Criminal, and
capitall causes. In civil causes belonging to the Common pleas, the Judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

these, are called the Jury for life and death. All this makes it evident, that
amongst us judgement depends much upon these Jurours. Their duty in this
respect is, that according to law they be <hi>Boni et legales homines,</hi> and no wayes
chargeable with such crimes, as they accuse or judge: which words according to
the first institution did reach further then we ordinarily conceive. It was the
wisdome of our Ancestours to appoint these Juryes, that every one might be
judged, <hi>per Pares,</hi> by his <hi>Peers,</hi> and such as were likely to know men best, and
their quality, causes, and offences. The intention was the preservation ofli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,

must be men of understanding, and integrity, and must endeavour to be fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
make just, and impartiall presentments, and give just, and impartiall
Verdicts. Yet many of these are either unskilfull, or unconscionable, pact up
of such persons, as are for the person not the cause, wranglers, rash, carelesse, or

this Commandement: and as they ought to be just, and understanding men,
fitly qualified for their places; so they should faithfully, and truly record, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
from first to last, and carefully, and safely keep the records: They must
not be carelesse, and negligent, much lesse false in altering, omitting, or falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

by Law, and execute the Commands of superiour Magistrates, and the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Judges, and honestly and conscionably do all things the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of them in their places. But great is the iniquity of many of this kind of
Officers. To conclude, all persons that have any thing to do in judgment, should
do their best endeavour to advance justice, otherwise where innocent &amp; just per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
should expect right, and protection, they will find iniquity, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

in <hi>Prohibitions, Reproofs, Threatnings</hi> against this kind of <hi>injustice.</hi> And we
have many examples of Gods judgements, severely executed upon Delinquents
in this kind. <hi>Paul</hi> condemns it as a sin in Christians to go to Law one with
another, especially before Heathen Judges, and signifies that they should rather
suffer themselves to be defrauded, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 7. By which words he implyes
that Christians should give no cause, and that if cause be given, we should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suffer them sin, and contend in Law; because it gives offence, and opens
the mouths of prophane persons against our profession of piety, and purity in
practise. And because a false Witnesse perverts judgment, leads the Judge
aside, and wrongs our Neighbour, and disappoints him of that right he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
God commanded that a false witnesse should be punished with that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the party litigant if condemned should have suffered. The Judges must
make diligent inquisition, and behold if the Witnesse be a false witnesse, and
hath testified falsly against his Brother, then they must do unto him, as he had
thought to have done unto his Brother, so they should put evill from amongst
them. And those which remaine should hear, and feare, and from henceforth
commit no more any such evill amongst them. And their eye shall not pitty,

against such persons, as shall either out of covetousnesse, or fear, or
favour, or hatred, judge unjustly. If either false witnesse, or perverting of law,
or unjust judgement, may be suffered, no man can be safe or secure of his credit;
his life, his Wife, or estate. When the administration of justice is neglected,
much more, when Tribunals, and Courts of judgement which should be sacred,
are corrupted with partiality, bribery, or any other way, there must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a liberty to sin, impunity in wickednesse, the ruine or oppression of the
weak, the poore, the just, and innocent; and a great confusion thereupon: This
kind of injustice is contrary to Gods institution of all government, and the
commission whereby he hath derived jurisdiction unto men, and trusted the
sword of justice in their hand: For it was given unto man to protect the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and take vengance on evill doers. The effects of it are sad, and the event,
through Gods just judgment, is the ruine of many, and great familyes, the alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and consumption of many goodly estates, the desolation of whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Kingdomes. By receiving false accusations, and passing unjust sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
Jesus Christ the Son of God was put to death, <hi>Steven</hi> stoned, <hi>James</hi> slain
with the sword, and many thousand Saints cut off, and others of Gods just ones
cruelly persecuted. This is reckoned amongst others, as a crying sin, which
brought famin, pestilence, sword, Captivity upon the Jews, and the desolation
of their goodly City, Temple, and Kingdome. How heavy was the hand of
God upon the Jews, who so earnestly pressed <hi>Pilate</hi> to condemn Christ unjustly?
Neither did <hi>Pilate</hi> who hearkened unto them, escape the hand of God, for he
murdered himself. Rash, and unjust censures, and judgment extrajudiciall,
shall not go unpunished. All these things briefly mentioned may be sufficient
to cause any man to hate this sin, and detest to be a false witnesse, or an unjust
Judge, or any wayes concur to pervert judgment.</p>

judgment, cannot disswade us from this, and restrain us; yet let the commands
of God, his commendation, and approbation of this justice, the promises of
rewards, and the blessed consequents of this virtue, move all men to have a
speciall care of keeping the affirmative part of this precept. As God hath
commanded, and commended it, so hath he promised many mercyes to such as
do their duty in this particular, desiring, endeavouring, thirsting after distributive
and judiciall righteousnesse. Hearken what he saith to the Jews: Learn to
dowell; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed; Judge the Fatherlesse; plead
for the Widdow. Come now and let us reason together, saith the Lord;
Though your sins be as Scarlet, they shall be white as <hi>Snow;</hi> though they be
red as <hi>Crimson,</hi> they shall be as Wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye
shall eat the good of the land: But if ye refuse and rebell, the sword shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

Where we may observe that this justice in judgment, prevents or averts judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and renders men capable of mercy, peace, and plenty. It's a protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  </gap> of the Second Table, as the first is the greatest of the First
Table. So our Blessed Saviour informed us: For when He was asked,
Which is the greatest Commandement? He answered, <hi>Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thine heart with all thy soul, and with all thy mind:</hi> This is
the first and great Commandement: And the Second is like to this, <hi>Thou shalt
love thy Neighbour as thy self.</hi> To love our Neighbour, as our selves is the last
Commandement, as shall appear anon. These two are the <hi>Epitome</hi> of the whole
Law, and virtually contain all the Precepts of it: The first, All of the first Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
the last, All of the Second Table. Therefore, they are general Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements:
the one, of the first part of the Law: this other, of the Second. For
after that God had in the four first Precepts of the Second Table determined,
the right of persons, and things out of judgment; and, in the Ninth, given a
Rule of judgment: In this last, He prescribes a general Duty, which is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Rule of the rest; both out of Judgment, and also in Judgment.</p>
               <p>This Commandement is Negative; wherein we must consider,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Act,</item>
                  <item>2. The Object,</item>
               </list>
               <p>That so we may understand what the Sin prohibited is. The Act is, to covet;
the Object, something that is our Neighbours. To covet, is to desire. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth
some knowledge, at least of apprehension of the thing desired as good,
and, in some respect, good to us. It's an Act of the Will, and presupposeth the
good desired, as absent, and not possessed or enjoyed: and there are degrees of
this Act, according as we conceive the good desired, less or greater. That which
is best (if we be rightly informed) is to be desired most, and other things in a
certain order and measure, as they are nearer unto, or further distant from the
greatest good. We may mistake, and conceive many things to be better then
they are, and so deceive our selves, and desire that which is not good at all, or
that which is least good, as though it were the greatest. So most men are delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
when they covet Earthly Things, more then Heavenly; and imagine, that
in them there is a vertue and power to make them happy: and so we prefer the
World and love it more then God. This is a sin against the first Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and it's Idolatry. Thus ambitious, covetous, voluptuous men do. We
covet things, as good to us, that we may have them, and enjoy them: and this
coveting, may be upon a simple apprehension, and before a deliberate consent,
or it may follow it, and then the Soul begins to move, and use means to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
it.</p>
               <p>Yet Coveting in it self,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> is indifferent, neither good, nor bad. Some things
may; some things must be coveted; some things must not. Therefore, we must
know, in what respect, <hi>Coveting</hi> is here forbidden, when it's said, <hi>Thou shalt not
covet;</hi> and what the things are, which we cannot lawfully desire to be our
own: and that is easily understood by the Object, the second thing here determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by God.</p>
               <p>The things not to be coveted, are here expressed.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By a particular Enumeration.</item>
                  <item>2. By a general and comprehensive Term.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:64164:127"/>
In this particular Enumeration, we have, <hi>House, Wife, Man-servant, Maid-servant,
Ox, Ass, Field,</hi> Deut. 5. 21. Some reduce this to <hi>Utile,</hi> and <hi>Jucundum,</hi>
things pleasant, or unprofitable.</p>
               <p>The general and comprehensive Word is, <hi>ANY THING, Thou shalt
not covet any thing.</hi> This was added, to include all things, and to leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
excluded. Yet these things may be considered materially, and so <hi>Wife,
House, Field, Cattle,</hi> may be desired; or formally, as our Neighbours: and so we
must not covet them. We must not covet <hi>his House his Wife, his Field,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nor
any thing that is his;</hi> that is, our Neighbours. That which is not ours, but his,
both by the Laws of God, and Men, must not be the Object of our Desires. We
may like them, but not covet them, as his: For, if we do, it's an evident sign,
that we love our Selves too much, our Neighbour too little: Nay, we love his,
and not him, or his, more than him. And this is a want of that love God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth:
He requires a love of his Person, as of our Selves, it forbids a love of
his. So this Commandement was given to regulate the very motions of the
Heart, with the Affections and Inclinations of it, in respect of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>This is the plain and genuine sense of the words,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> which inform us of many
things:</p>
               <p>1. That the Law of God, prescribing the Duty of Man to Man, doth reach the
Heart, binds the Conscience, and requires a conformity and obedience in the
Inner-man.</p>
               <p>2. That God, in Judgment, will take Cognizance, not onely of men's words
and actions, but of the motions, inclinations, and dispositions of the Soul:</p>
               <p>3. That both God's Laws, and also his Judgments, are far above the Laws
and Judgments of men.</p>
               <p>4. That this Commandement is the Rule and Measure; of the five former
Commandements, according to which, we must understand them.</p>
               <p>5. It reacheth them all, and is the principal, and they the conclusions, which
derive their Morality from it; so that in obeying it, or disobeying it, we obey,
or disobey the rest. Therefore, sayes the Apostle, <hi>It's the fulfilling of the Law,</hi>
Rom. 13. 10. And all the Law (that is, which requires the Duty of Man unto
Man) is fulfilled in one word, <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> Gal.
5. 14.</p>
               <p>6. That whatsoever Duty we perform to Man, is not agreeable to the Will
of God, if it be not done out of love to our Neighbour; as our love to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is not regular, if it issue not from, and be subordinate to, the love of
God.</p>
               <p>7. That this, with the first, of the First Table, do more clearly discover Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Corruption, and the Root of all Sin in us, than any of the rest.</p>
               <p>8. That if we could perfectly obey these two (as we never shall in this life)
we might perfectly obey all the other, and might pluck up by the very Roots all
other sins.</p>
               <p>9. That by this, we easily understand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what necessity we have of Christ, and
his sanctifying Spirit; without both which, we can neither hope for remission of
sin past, or power to avoid sin and transgressions of this Law for time to come.
For if our hearts be not renewed, they will be ever coveting; and coveting will
be a continual Spring of dishonour of Superiours, Murder, Adultery, Theft, False-Witness,
as our Saviour teacheth us. For out of the Heart proceed evil Thoughts,
Murthers, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, False-Witness, Blasphemies, <hi>Math.

                  </gap>o as to be any cause, or occasion, of coveting that which is our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
All Envy likewise must be a sin against this Law: but Hatred and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
in general, and Contempt, are directly contrary to it. In a word, the want
of Love unto our Neighbours, as our selves, or any degree thereof, is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited:
From all this it's evident, that the principal thing commanded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in this <hi>Commandement,</hi> is, the love of our Neighbours, as our selves; So to
do, as we would be done unto. For the more full understanding of this, we must
observe and consider some things concerning</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Love in general.</item>
                  <item>2. Our Neighbour, as the Object of this Love here required.</item>
                  <item>3. The measure and quality of it.</item>
                  <item>4. The end whereat it aims.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. Love, is of persons, or of things: This is a love of persons. And it presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
a Knowledge antecedent, to direct it. The act of it is, to wish well, desire,
intend the good of the person beloved; and therefore is called, <hi>Amor Benevolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi>
the love of good-will. There is, indeed, a love of others, for our own ends,
advantage, interest; but this is either Lust, and not Love; or love of our selves, not
of our Neighbours. As this Love wisheth, and desireth the good of another, so
the good is either Temporal, or Spiritual, and Eternal. For the good desired by
this Love here commanded, is any kind of good, whereof he is capable, which
may conduce unto his happiness. Therefore, the principal thing desired, is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life, as it is an Estate of perfect Holiness and Happiness. And it's such a love,
and so vigorous, as it will stir us up effectually, to use all means to procure this
good.</p>
               <p>2. As the Object of the highest degree of our love is God,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> so the Object of
this love, required in this last <hi>Commandement,</hi> is our Neighbour. This our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
is,</p>
               <p>1. All Mankind, so far as capable of our love.</p>
               <p>2. Some part of Mankind: and so our Neighbour is either publike, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.
Publike, is either Civil, or Ecclesiastical: the State, or Church, whereof we
are members; and, in both, first the Superiours, and publike, and most eminent
persons. Our private Neighbours, are not onely Father, and Mother, Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Friends, Servants, Benefactors, but also strangers; yea, and Enemies, as
God in his Divine Providence shall make them immediate Subjects, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
of our love.</p>
               <p>3. The quality and measure of our love,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> is implyed in these words <hi>[As thy
self]</hi> It's not said, <hi>as God;</hi> for that's too high: Nor before, or more than, our
selves; for that's too much. So that in these words we have both the quality, and
the quantity, or measure of this love determined. For the quality, it must be real,
hearty, and sincere: for so we love our selves. It must be real; for in some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
we must hazard, yea, lay down our lives, and give our goods, for to save, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and help our Brethren, in their miseries, wants, extremities. We must lay
down the lives of our Bodies, for the Salvation of their Souls; and, with the
Widow, cast in all that we have into the Treasury. This love must be without
dissimulation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9. And we must not love in word, neither in tongue,
but in deed, and in truth, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18. Yet this love of our selves, cannot be a
Rule of the love of our Neighbours, except it be regular. For it may be fond,
foolish, vain, irregular, and inordinate. Therefore, it must be regulated by the
Word of God, issue from Faith in Christ, and our love of God in Christ, and
we must love in obedience to his Commandement, and aym at His Glory, and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64164:128"/>
seek the true, especially the spirituall, and eternall good of our brethren. And
if we thus love our selves, then we may make this love of our selves the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of our love to others. The measure and quantity of this love is also here
implied in the foresaid words. For we must love God more then any thing,
more then any person, more then our selves: and the more wee love God, the
more we love our selves in God. Therefore, because we must love our selves
lesse then God, we must love our Neighbours lesse then him: otherwise our
love will prove inordinate. In loving others we may love our selves first,
and in that respect more then our neighbours. And in this love of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
there be degrees to be observed: For we must love our Country, under
what form of Government so ever it be, before any particular person; the
Whole more then the Part; the publick more then the private: and because
we our selves are but private Persons, and a part, therefore we must love the
whole State in some cases more then our selves. And in the State, we must
love and seek the good of such persons, upon whom the safety, and peace pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
much depends more then others. We must also love the Church more
then the State, and our brethren in Christ more then any particular persons in
the world.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> the End of this love is, that we may do as we would be
done unto. For as we love or hate others, so we do unto them, so we deal with
them, well or ill. If we love our selves aright, and love others as our selves,
we will neither think, nor devise, nor intend, nor endeavou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to do him any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
but we will desire, devise, intend, endeavour his reall good. And as we
would have others to do all things, so as that they may tend unto our Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
peace and spirituall Welfare, so we must do all things so, as to design their
perfect happinesse so well as our own. And as we desire that others may do
nothing prejudiciall to our joy, comfort, happinesse; so we must do nothing
that may tend unto, or end, in our neighbours hurt, so as to make them either
sinfull or miserable. All obedience without this love is but a carkeise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Therefore though the heathens did the things conteined in this Law, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were devoid of the Love of God, and this love of our Neighbours, is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
from the love of God and faith in Christ, their obedience was not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
and such as this Law required. To give all our goods unto the poor and
our bodies to be burned, and not out of love, is nothing. This love will think
well, wish well, do well, speak well. It will be patient, and long-suffering; yea it
will be kind unto enemies, and such as hate us, and if they thirst, will give them
drink, if they hunger, feed them, and in their miseries relieve them. It will
blesse them that curse us, and pray for them that hate us, and despightfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
us. It will return blessing for cursing; do good for evill, and seek to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
evill with good. It's an evidence of a sincere faith, a confirmation
of our union with, and interest in, Christ: it's the character of a reall Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and a proof that we are passed from death to life. By it we resemble God
who is love; by it we imitate Christ, by it we are cemented together amongst
our selves, by it we rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and mourn with them
that mourn; it makes all men one, and every man part of ourselves; it's the
union of Souls, the mother of concord, the harmony of the world. Therefore
let us love our neighbour, him more then his, and endeavour by all means to
observe this Commandement.</p>
               <p>Though I have delivered many things concerning this Law,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IX</label> before I entred
upon the Exposition of the several Commandements, and therefore might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
proceed to the Ceremonials, and Positives; yet it will not be amiss to
add some Observations unto the former. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:64164:129"/>
1. Obedience to this Law, pre-requires the knowledge of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and power of the Law-giver, the matter of the Law it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elf, the binding force
of it, and the measure of this Obligation.</p>
               <p>2. These things, first known, we must consider the Wisdom of the Law-giver,
who, knowing the Nature of Man, and his very inward frame, and so
much the more perfectly, because He made us, He chiefly, in this, looked at
the Immortal Soul; and, in the Soul, at the Heart and Will, which is the
Queen, and hath an Imperial Power over the whole Man, and is resident in
the Throne of the Soul, and in the Heart, at Love, which is the principal Act of
the Heart, and is called <hi>Pondus Animae,</hi> the Poise of the Soul, inclining and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
it whither it pleaseth.</p>
               <p>3. This love He directs by this Law upon the right Objects, and gives it a
right measure, in respect of every Object, whether God, or our selves, or our
Neighbour.</p>
               <p>4. When we consider the right Objects, and the right measure of love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in this Law, and how far we observe both, we shall find our obedience,
either to be disobedience, or to be far short of what is required.</p>
               <p>5. By this we easily understand, that by the obedience to this Law, no man
living can be justifyed, and that after the Fall of Man, it was never given, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
for that end: for if it had, it must needs have proved ineffectual, and
such as could never reach that end.</p>
               <p>6. Yet it was an excellent means to discover unto man his sin, let him see
his misery, and the necessity of a Saviour. And when we make use of it to that
end, we must not onely examine whether we be Worshippers of Images, perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
persons, Prophaners of the Sabbath, disobedient to Superiours, Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
Adulterers, Fornicators, Thieves, False-Witnesses, but how our very Hearts
stand affected, and in what measure we love God, and our Neighbours: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our love be rightly qualifyed, fully extended, and intended. And by this,
we shall easily find the best imperfect; the most, abominably corrupted, and
few sincere, and all of us, by Nature, before we be in Christ, to be base and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Caitiffs. And till by the first and last Commandements, we see the inward
depravation, and the deep stain of our Souls, we cannot throughly be humbled,
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> sincerely penitent, nor truly reformed, nor vehemently, and effectually desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of Christ for pardon of sin past, and grace of Sanctification for time to
come.</p>
               <p>7. It's an excellent Rule of Obedience; yet except we have a special care in
the first place, to observe the first and last Commandements, all our performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are greatly defective, and no ways acceptable.</p>
               <p>8. Though Faith, as fixed in Christ, dying for our sins, and rising again for our
Justification, and Repentance, as a return to <hi>God Redeemer,</hi> be not commanded
in this Law, as given to <hi>Adam</hi> innocent; yet, both Faith, and Repentance, in
their general Nature, abstracted from their proper and formal notions in the
Gospel are required in this Law. For Faith as an assent to God's infallible
truth revealed, or, as a reliance on God for his Blessings and Happiness, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the first Precept.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:64164:129"/>
Repentance, as it's an hatred of sin and an obedience to God in general, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in all the Commandements. But Faith, as presupposing the Party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
a sinner and guilty; and as fixed upon Christ saving from sinne;
and Repentance, as a return to obedience, after disobedience, and an hatred of
that sin which is in us; they cannot any ways belong to this Law, as given at
first, or so understood.</p>
               <p>8. When we fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> we lost our power to believe, and return to God
again: otherwise, what need is there to be born again of the Spirit? And
why are Faith, Hope, and Charity, Gifts of the Spirit, merited by Christ, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
freely of God. Actual Faith in God-Redeemer, by the Word, made Flesh,
they never had, and therefore could never lose it.</p>
               <p>9. This Faith considered in general, is a Moral Duty, required in the Moral
Law; otherwise it could have no aptitude to be a condition of Justifycation,
and Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>10. Yet we by this Faith could not obtain either Justifycation, or Eternal
Life, except Christ had merited, and God had promised, and ordained, and
that freely, that upon Faith both should follow; and Faith, as a Moral Duty, or
a part of inherent Righteousness is not that whereby we are justifyed, but as
fixed on Christ, and uniting us unto him.</p>
               <p>11. This Faith, as a practical assent to the Truths of the Gospel, which reveal
the love of God in Christ, suffering for our sins, is a most excellent principle of
obedience, and love in the highest degree: as it's a confidence in God, saving
us onely for Christ's sake, it tends most effectually to God's Glory, and empties
man wholly of all power and merit in himself, as a base and miserable
Wretch.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>I</label> as a rule of obedience: The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials
and Positives come next to be considered. And I will first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the nature of a Ceremoniall Law in generall, and so proceed to the
more particular handling them, according to their severall differences and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions.</p>
               <p>The generall nature of these, is</p>
               <p>1. That they are Laws of God, have a binding force, and that upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
The speciall nature, and difference of them, whereby they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from morall Laws, is,</p>
               <p>1. In the matter, which in it self is neither good nor evil, morally.</p>
               <p>2. They differ in this also, that they are religions rites, which are compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of outward and inward, visible and invisible, corporeall or sensible, and
spirituall, sacred, hidden parts. In respect of the invisible, and spirituall part,
and as instituted by God; They are called Sacred, and Religious Rites: and
if <hi>Ceremonia</hi> come of the <hi>Hetruscan</hi> word, <hi>Cerus, Sanctus,</hi> then in the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
they are called <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> too. They are called Positive, that is, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary,
because they principally depend upon the arbitrary institution, and
position of the Law-giver. The outward part may be performed without any
respect to the inward, and so ignorant and wicked men may observe them. Yet
the performance of them is never acceptable without the moral qualification,
of the party performing them in obedience to the institution, and also joyning
the practise of Morall duties with them. This is evident out of many places
of Scripture, where men are reproved,</p>
               <p>1. For performing them with impure hearts, and polluted hands.</p>
               <p>2. For neglecting the weighty and substantiall, that is, the morall duties of the
Law. And to be zealous in Ceremonials, and careless in moralls, was alwayes
either hypocrisy, or impiety, or both. These positive Laws, which alwayes
received their binding force from the institution commanding, not from the
excellency or goodnesse of the thing commanded, are a rule of obedience, as
well as the morall: and the neglect of them is a contempt of the Lawgiver.
There is an Analogy, and proportion between the outward, sensible, and
the sacred part; and in that respect they might by the outward senses help the
memory, informe the understanding, stir up devotion, and affection, set
forth Gods worship with greater Solemnity, and are an outward testification
of inward submission, saith, obedience unto God, and the approbation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which was professed. And for these ends, and such like they seem to
be added to Morals: and so much the rather because man hath a body, as well
as a Soul, and is not all Spirit but in part flesh, and must serve God in
both.</p>
               <p>These kind of Laws are either such as were enacted before the Fall of man,<label type="milestone">

Christ, were either such as God instituted before, or which he instituted after
that Christ was exhibited. Those before the Incarnation were either extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
or ordinary; and the principall were either Sacrifices or Sacraments so
called, as now we understand them. Again, those which constantly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64164:130"/>
from the times of <hi>Adam,</hi> till the glorification of Christ, were sacrifices,
and offerings. For <hi>Adam</hi> taught his Children <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> to offer gifts, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
and no doubt by Warrant, &amp; Commission from God: otherwise the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of <hi>Abel</hi> had not bin accepted of God, nor offered in faith. Yet afterwards
to these were added the Circumcision; the Passover, and many other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
mention'd in the books of <hi>Moses.</hi> The waters of the flood bearing up the
Ark, and saving <hi>Noah,</hi> and his family is made a kind of Baptism, or baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
Rite. Whether the Rain-bow signifying a temporall blessing, could be
a Religious Rite may be doubted, and so much the rather because the benefit
promised was generall to all men, and living Creatures. Yet, if the not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
by the flood, did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ignifie a spiritual blessing, then it had the full nature
and essence of a Religious Rite. The passing through the Red Sea, and under
the Cloud, the Manna, the water out of the Rock, all these were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and rather Sacraments then any otherwise. That they were Sacraments
both <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3. and <hi>Peter, 1 Pet.</hi> 3, 20. 21. do teach us. The
ordinary Sacraments before the times of the Gospel, were Circumcision and
the Passover. The rest of the Mosaicall Ceremonies, except some few were Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and Mysticall; whether things, persons, actions, times. The Priests
did serve unto the example, and shadow of heavenly things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 4. The
Tabernacle was a figure for the time then present, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 9. The services and
purification, shadows of things in Heaven, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 1. The person, and especially
the high Priests were types of Christ: Their great sacrifice of expiation, and
other sin-offerings, of the Sacrifice of Christ. The tabernacle typified either
heaven, or the humanity of Christ, wherein the Godhead dwelt bodily. So
that persons, things, and actions, signified better persons, things, and actions.
All their Consecrations, Expiations, Dedications, Purifications, and Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
had some reference to spirituall duties, or promises, or judgments;
And this was the sin, the usual sin of that people, that they neglected moral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
were zealous in <hi>Ceremonials,</hi> expected justification, and salvation by them,
made the redemption of Christ vain, and needlesse? forgate the promise made
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and so looked not after the better Covenant established upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
promises. Yet all these Ceremonies were Laws binding to obedience: and
it was their misery to want either tabernacle, temple, solemne services, or
holy times; and their sin, if, when they enjoyed these, they did not observe
them. They were laws of God Redeemer, had speciall reference to Christ
to come, and the times of the Gospel, and were enacted for severall ends, as
hath bin shewed in the Chapter of the administration of the Kingdom of God
Redeemer, and the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound by the Mosaicall Ceremonials in a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
manner. But when Christ had finished the great work of Redemption,
and the more glorious light of the Gospel did begin to shine, these shadows
must vanish and fly away. The standing Sacraments of former times must
be changed, not only because they did signifie some temporall mercy past, and
had some temporall promise annexed, but also chiefly because they were Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
of Christ to come; or did imply o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Gospel, which do, and shall continue in force till the end of the
World. But first, before I can give any clear account of the Sacraments
of the Gospel in particular, I must say something of a Sacrament in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
               <p>1. Sacraments, are Ceremonies, and holy Rites to be used in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and are parts of that worship: and thus they differ from Ceremonialls
in generall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:64164:131"/>
2. These Sacraments presuppose the Redeemer, the work of Redemption,
the Laws of God Redeemer; as they require obedience, and duty, and as they
promise mercies, and benefits merited by the Redemption. Others do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
it thus, That Sacraments presuppose the Redemption, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>3. The Spirituall and heavenly part of the Sacraments of the old, and new
testament were always for substance, and the principall thing in them, the
same.</p>
               <p>4. That the Sacraments of former and these latter times agree in many things,
and differ, and that much, in some things.</p>
               <p>5. That Christ contracted all the principall Ceremonials of the old into a few,
these few are Sacraments; for number two; for signification clear; for obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
easie: and for man, if observed aright, very beneficiall.</p>
               <p>These things understood,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> the nature of a Sacrament may be the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
It's a Ceremony confirming the Covenant of grace in Christ. The
Sacraments of former times required faith, as well as these of the Gospel, but
with this difference, that the former required faith in Christ to come, the
latter required faith in Christ already come. To understand the definition, we
must observe the generall nature, and specificall difference. The generall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is, that they are Ceremonies and sacred Rites, and so they agree with all
the other Sacrifices, offerings, and other mysticall parts of Gods worship.
They are Laws, and binding in respect of the divine institution, and command,
and mans obligation to observe them. In this word Ceremony is included
also the outward, and sensible part, and the inward and spirituall, as likewise
the Analogie and proportion between them; and according to that Analogie,
and Gods determination, the signification or representation of the Spirituall
part by the outward, and bodily. The specificall difference is the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Covenant of grace in Christ, Where we have</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Christ.</item>
                  <item>2. The Covenant of grace in Christ.</item>
                  <item>3. The confirmation of it by a Sacrament, or sacred Rite.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. Christ is the foundation of all Sacraments, in that he finished the
work of Redemption, and thereby established the promises of the Covenant
for ever. For if he had not suffered, all promises in him had not bin Yea, and
Amen, but had bin all voyd. By his Sacrifice he satisfied Gods justice, and
merited both the promises, and all the mercies promised, upon condition
of faith, and power to performe the conditions as you heard before; when I
spake of the immediate effects of his death.</p>
               <p>2. Yet these benefits, and mercies are not conveyed without a Covenant,
which promiseth them unto sinfull man; yet so, as the promises require some
conditions and duties to be performed by man; yet by the power of the spirit
enabling us. And because the Laws of God are so made, as that they contain
not onely promises, whereby God binds himself voluntarily to man, but
also duties to be performed freely by man, they are called a Covenant: Yet
because there was a Covenant of works requiring perfect, and perpetuall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as the condition and duty upon which alone performed, life would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
and a Covenant made with <hi>Israel,</hi> when they came out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and
this Covenant requires neither that perfect obedience, as a condition of life,
nor the Ceremonies of the Law; but faith in Christ: and promiseth not onely
life, but power to believe in Christ meriting remission, and life, therefore it's
called the Covenant of grace, and free mercy in Christ; for whose sake he is
willing to save man, whom he might have condemned.</p>
               <p>3. This Covenant is confirmed by a Sacrament; This confirmation of this
Covenant is the specificall difference. For in this very act of confirmation, a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64164:131"/>
Sacrament differs from all other Ceremonies; which might signifie Christ, or
his work of Redemption, or the Sanctification of the spirit, or some duties of
man; yet not confirme the Covenant either in respect of Gods promises, or
mans duty.</p>
               <p>This Covenant may be said to be confirmed three ways; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label>
               </p>

                  <item>1. By the death, and blood of Christ.</item>
                  <item>2. By the Spirit.</item>
                  <item>3. By a Sacrament.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. It was confirmed as a Covenant by the death of Christ, so as a Will is
confirmed by the death of a Testatour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17. The issue of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
is, that upon the death of Christ, both the promises, and duties,
and the whole Substance of the Covenant were made unalterable; so that now
we can expect no other promises, nor any other conditions, though the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Covenant of works, both with the promises and conditions, was altered.</p>
               <p>2. It's confirmed by the Holy Ghost, being given unto true believers; to
assure them, that as they have received the title to glory, and the first fruits
thereof: so they shall receive the principal reward promised; and fully enjoy
it. In this respect the Spirit is called an earnest, and a Seal: yet it's rather a
Seal in respect of glory promised, then of the promise it self. The</p>
               <p>3d. Confirmation is by a Sacrament; and this is a confirmation rather of the
Covenant in respect of man, then in respect of it self as a Covenant. This
confirmation is expressed by the Metaphoricall word <hi>SEAL:</hi> as when Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
is said to be not onely a Sign, (as all Ceremonies are) but a Seal,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. There be many kinds of Seales, and many uses, and ends of them;
but one usuall Seal is a confirming Seal, and the end and use of it is to confirme
Covenants, Deeds, Grants. For whether the Deed be Indenture, or Will,
or a Patent, and free-grant, whether absolute or conditionall, we first express,
and signifie our minds consent, and approbation by Words and Writings,
and then we add our Hands and Seal: which sealing is the highest, and most
Solemn testification of our consent, and the greatest confirmation that we can
give; and being produced is the most perfect evidence, and proof of our title,
being as an Authenticall record. And in this respect a Sacrament is a Seal
for confirmation. And it's a Seal in respect of God and man.</p>
               <p>1. In respect of God, who by his very institution of it intended to confirme
his consent unto, and approbation of the promises upon the conditions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
and acknowledgeth his engagement to performance of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
               <p>2. In respect of man, who by Receiving, and Celebrating the Sacrament
Solemnly testifies his approbation of the conditions, and doth further engage
himself unto the performance of them. The thing confirmed by a Sacrament,
is</p>
               <p>1. The Covenant it self, both in respect of God and Man: for it confirmes
Gods promise of mercy, and Mans engagement to duty.</p>
               <p>2. If the mutuall promises and engagements be confirmed, a conditionall
right to the mercies promised is made sure to man, and the conditionall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of duty in man is confirmed to God.</p>
               <p>3. When man performes his duty, he receives an actuall right; and in due
time possession: but this cannot be immediately made sure, as may appear
hereafter. Whereas some say that Sacraments exhibite, and confer grace, and
the School-men say, that a Sacrament is <hi>SIGNUM EFFICAX GRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIAE;</hi>
yet, if we speak properly, a Sacrament as a Sacrament, doth no such
thing; except we understand it thus, that as an Instrument sealed conveyes and
gives a right upon a consideration; so this upon a condition may conferr a
right: and so all other Laws of God Redeemer, do by vertue of the promises
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64164:132"/>
annexed to them, without which men cannot have so much as a conditionall,
and remote right. Reformed Divines do generally deny that Sacraments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
grace <hi>(ex opere operato)</hi> as the School-men speak; and require a due qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
in the party to whom they are administred, according to divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
As for the actuall exhibition of saving grace, it depends upon this
divine ordination, that when man doth his duty, and performs the condition,
saving grace shall follow; according to His promise. And this is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
most properly of such as are at age: The principall condition is faith,
without which no Sacrament <hi>(in adultis)</hi> can be effectuall, so as that upon
the receiving thereof, grace should actually follow: And no man ever received
benefit by Celebration of Sacraments, without a morall qualification in the
very receiving of them. By all this we may understand, how Sacraments are
said to signify, seal, and exhibit grace: They signify as Ceremonies and Rites,
seal as Sacraments, exhibit and convey as other Laws and instruments which
have a promise annexed, and that by vertue of the promise, and Gods ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I will not here assert that either the word <hi>SACRAMENTUM</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Greek, doth properly signifie any such thing, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that
the word is so used in Scripture: Let it suffice that in this sense the words have
bin used, both by Latine and Greek writers, and if any can find a better word,
I shall willingly accept it, when I know it. If any make question whether
this definition doth agree to the Sacraments of the old testament as well as of
the new, as we use to speak, it's plain it doth. For Circumcision was a sign,
and Seal of the righteousnesse of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. where we have Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
promised by God; faith required from man, which is the substance of the
Covenant; and Circumcision as a Ceremony was a sign to signify, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the righteousnesse by faith, and a Seal to confirme it. Yet this faith then
required was in Christ to come: And <hi>Abraham</hi> had this faith before he was
Circumcised, which made the confirmation stronger; yet it confirmed no
righteousness but by faith.</p>
               <p>The Celebration of the Sacraments is a profession of our Religion,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of our union amongst our selves, badges of our profession to distinguish us
from others, and a Solemn engagement to obedience: yet these are generall
accidents, and are neither of the essence of them, nor proper adjuncts to any
one of them. As the observation of them is a service to be performed unto God,
they are parts of his Worship: As they are commanded by God, they bind us,
as all other Laws do: and the observation of them by that command becomes
necessary, so far as he intended them: In this respect they agree with other
Laws; They are meanes of obtaining the benefits merited by Christ, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
by God, as all other Laws obeyed are: For God hath promised that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
obedience, the benefit shall follow. The observation of them is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
joyntly, with the observation of morall, and other more excellent duties,
which more immediately, and effectually conduce unto the main end, as with
repentance, and faith, without which they cannot be effectuall. For the
promise is not added to the Sacrament alone. <hi>For he that believeth, and is
baptised shall be saved,</hi> Mark 16. 16. It's not said, <hi>He that is baptized, but he
that believeth, and is baptized shall be saved.</hi> A man by faith without Baptism,
not by Baptism without faith may be saved. Yet the contempt of these Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
may damn a man, and deprive him of salvation, because that contempt
is inconsistent with faith. For true faith, and salvation have a necessary, and
inseperable connexion by the Divine ordination: in so much, as that <hi>He who
believeth not shall be damned.</hi> The efficacy of these Sacraments for the actuall
enjoyment of grace, requireth a right qualification in the party, and depends
upon the power of the holy Spirit: For Baptism is the <hi>Laver of Regeneration,</hi>
by the renewing of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. As all other Laws have their
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64164:132"/>
promises, and threats, so these sacramentall ceremonialls likewise have. From
hence it followes, that not onely they who neglect, and omit, the celebration
of them; but also the unworthy receivers are guilty, and make themselves lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to punishment: And they who observe them, and observe them aright; in
God's good time, though not alwayes at, or in, the time of the observation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the benefit promised. For though the benefit, and the actuall enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be from Christ, and the Spirit, yet it's sometimes attributed to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Sacraments, because they in some sort concurr in an inferiour
manner to the collation of the same. Therefore we are said to be ingraffed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ, and saved by Baptism; yet not by Baptism alone.</p>
               <p>After these generals,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> concerning all the ceremonials and special Sacraments, I
proceed to speak of Sacraments in particular: and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cause we are freed from the
Sacraments of former times by the death of Christ, I will passe by <hi>Circumcision</hi>
and the <hi>Passeover,</hi> and come to the Sacraments of the Gospel, which continue in
full force and power unto this day, and shall so continue unto the end of the
World. The Sacraments of the Gospell are two:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Baptism.</item>
                  <item>2. The Lord's Supper.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The first is the Sacrament of Regeneration, and Admission into Christ's
Kingdome, and our ingrafting into Christ: The second is the Sacrament of
our continuance in this Kingdome, and growing up in Christ. Baptism may
be briefly therefore defined to be a Sacrament of our Regeneration: But more
particularly, It is a Sacrament of the Gospel, wherein, by washing with Water
in the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, Regeneration is confirmed to
the party baptized. As it is a Ceremony, so it agrees with all the ceremonies
of God Redeemer; as a Sacrament, with all other Sacraments thereof: as a
Sacrament of the Gospel it differs from all Sacraments annexed to the Promise.
For though they were instituted by God; yet this with the Eucharist was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by God Redeemer exhibited: The former presupposed Christ to come,
these, Christ already come. And also though it agree with Circumcision, as
being a Sacrament of initiation; yet it differs both in the sign, and in the thing
signified in some respects. The name of it is <hi>Baptism,</hi> which comes of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which, though it signifies to dip or dive, yet, often signifies to wash. In the
Gospel, we read of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism which was from Heaven; and Christ's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
as instituted by Christ after his Resurrection, in a certain form different
from that of <hi>John</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>In the speciall Nature,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> we must consider</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Rite.</item>
                  <item>2. The Effect. In the Rite, we have
<list>
                        <item>1. The Element, or the thing.</item>
                        <item>2. The Action.</item>
                        <item>3. The Words.</item>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The Element, or outward thing considered in it self, is Water, which hath
many vertues, or power to produce many Effects; as to quench Thirst, to
cool, to moisten, to mollifie, to heal, to fructifie, and also to cleanse. In res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of this cleansing power, which is most ordinary, God singled it as common
to be had, and commonly used for that end in all Nations to whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
were sent, to preach and baptize. And in respect of this cleansing, it
was fit to signifie the cleansing and regenerating vertue of the Spirit. This
signification was not naturall, but it was determined to it by divine instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For it was made a sign of this supernatural Grace, by a supernatural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Christ, not onely exhibited, but raised again, and ready to ascend into
Heaven. For this was one difference between the Sacraments of the Law and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64164:133"/>
the Gospel, that these latter were instituted immediately by the Son of God
in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arnate: Besides, there was another; that the former were alterable; these
never shall be altered.</p>
               <p>The Action is Washing,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IX</label> and this was part of the Rite. This did imply, that
man by nature is unclean and polluted with sin, and must be cleansed and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
before he could enter, and be admitted into God's Kingdome. Yet all
the Water in the World had no power, nor all the washing with Water could
have any such effect, as to cleanse from the guilt or stain of sin. This power
was merited by the Blood of Christ, to be exercised by the Spirit: Regeneration
therefore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> signified by washing. One end of washing is cleansing, and wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may be by dipping, diving, powring on water. The principall thing is
washing, whatsoever way it be done. Therefore Baptism is said to be a wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of water, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5. 26. The putting away of the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th of the flesh, 1 <hi>Pet. 3.
21.</hi> The washing of Regeneration, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. The washing of our bodyes
with pure water, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. It cannot be denyed, but that the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
descending into the water, and plunged wholly, and after that ascending out
of the water again, might resemble Christs Death, and Resurrection more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly;
Yet neither was this the principal signification, nor the immediate end
of Baptism. But how will it be proved, that in Baptism, the whole body,
with the head, and all parts were plunged under the waters? And suppose
some were Baptized so, it doth not follow, that all ought to be so by vertue of
any command. All the washings, lustrations, purifications mysticall, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
in the Law, were contracted in this washing of Baptism.</p>
               <p>The words added to washing with water do complete the Rite,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>X</label> and make it
very solemn: The words are these, <hi>I Baptize thee in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy-Ghost.</hi> In which words we have,</p>
               <p>1. The name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy-Ghost.</p>
               <p>2. The Baptizing into this name.</p>
               <p>These words containe the Doctrin of One most Glorious God, the Father, the
Son, and Holy-Ghost, with the great, and stupendious works of creation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
sanctification. For that Great, Almighty, and ever Blessed God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
the world; by the Word, made flesh dying and rising again, redeemed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
and by the Holy-Ghost sanctifies his people: And by the Redemption of
Christ, and sanctification of the Spirit, he is the Fountaine, and cause of mans
eternall happinesse, and glorification. This Doctrin must be preached, heard,
received, believed, professed by the party to be baptized (if at age) by himself;
if not at age, by some other representing him. And he must further promise to
renounce the Devill, and all other Lords, to subject himself unto this God, the
Father, Son, and Holy-Ghost, to obey his Commandements. By virtue of this
profession and promise, when nothing to the contrary is manifest, the party is
baptizable according to Christs commission. But besides these words,
there must be baptizing in this Name, which is understood severall
wayes.</p>
               <p>1. With some <hi>in the Name</hi> is in, and by the authority, and power of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son, and Holy-Ghost. With other, its in this name invocated, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon: And the truth is, that Baptism ought to be administred by commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and command from God, and with solemn invocation of, and prayer unto,
God. With others, it is to be by baptizing devoted, &amp; subjected to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son, and Holy-Ghost, as their onely Lord and King, in whom the party
baptized must believe, whom he must worship, and obey, as his onely supreme
Lord, and Saviour, expecting eternall life from him, and him alone. With this
sense agrees that of such as understand it of baptizing in, or unto, the Faith
which was professed; and unto the worship, and service of the true God which
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64164:133"/>
was promised. These words do contain both the duty of man, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of God. The duty of man is to believe, and obey God the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost; and the promise of God is to accept him as such, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him as a subject of his Kingdome, to receive the benefits of protection, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
and eternall life.</p>
               <p>After the Rite consummate,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XI</label> follows the effect, and the end, or, according to

               <p>3. This regeneration is, by the renewing of the Holy-Ghost.</p>
               <p>4. We have justification by grace.</p>
               <p>5. Adoption, whereby we are made heires of Glory. It's our first ingrafting
into Christ, for mortification of sin and newnesse of life, <hi>Rom. 6. 4, 5, 6. Col. 2.
12.</hi> You must take notice that Regeneration, Adoption, and the state of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
are onely begun upon our first faith, and admission, and not finished till
the Resurrection. And <hi>Johns Baptism</hi> was for remission upon Repentance, and
confession of sin, <hi>Marke</hi> 1. 4. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 6. The manner how this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
is this:</p>
               <p>1. The party to be baptized by receiving Baptism doth solemnly testifie, and
as it were Seal, and confirme that Faith which he had professed, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of submission, and obedience he made.</p>
               <p>2. God, by the party baptizing him, doth solemnly testifie his admission of
the party Baptized into his Kingdome as a Subject thereof, to enjoy the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
thereof. So that the administring on the one side, and receiving of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
on the other, is a deep, and mutual engagement, and makes the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
strong on mans side, to do his duty; on Gods side, to perform his promise.
This is an immediate confirmation of the covenant and promises, as a covenant
and promises, and doth engage to mutual performance for time to come. For
if there be a performance on both sides, there must needs be an actual possession,
which needs no confirmation. If it be said, that the performance on mans side
is onely begun, and so is the performance on Gods side but in part: for it is
onely full when we fully enjoy eternal glory. It's true, that it is so: and
therefore it's a confirmation of mans promise, of faith and obedience to the
end, and of Gods promise, that when mans performance is perfect, His perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
shall follow, and, in due time, be full and perfect. For the more full and
clear understanding of the point, we must observe.</p>
               <p>1. That the Covenant between God and man differs from other ordinary
covenants. In other covenants, the partyes covenanting are equally free from
any antecedent obligation in respect of the thing covenanted; and the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of both partyes ariseth from their voluntary consent expressed, and no
wayes else, so that they may be properly called <hi>(Cor-rei).</hi> In this there is a great
inequality between the partyes covenanting: For the one is the Lord, and
King, and the other Subjects: and they as Subjects are not onely under his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64164:134"/>
but bound by his laws before they voluntarily oblige themselves, and if
they never promised obedience, yet they are bound to do it, and must be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Laws given them.</p>
               <p>2. That Gods word, and promise is firm, and inviolable for ever, without
any solemn rite added to confirm it: yet because mans weaknesse is great, God
was willing, not onely by promise to oblige himself to man, but also by so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
rites, yea, and an Oath, wherein he pledged his eternall Diety, to confirm
his promise; and all this to strengthen his weak saith, and give him full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
For God being willing more abundantly to shew unto the heires
of promise, the immutability of his Counsel confirm'd it by an Oath, <hi>Heb. 6.
27.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That the thing that is confirmed, both by solemn rites, and his Oath, is
his promise.</p>
               <p>4. That because; as mans infirmity, and inconstancy was great, therefore God
thought it good to require of him a voluntary engagement, and a solemn confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
to subject himself to his power, and to obey his Laws; that the more
freely, and deeply he had engaged himself, the more carefull he might be to be
faithfull, and obedient to his everlasting good: and the thing confirmed by
man is his voluntary engagement of subjection, and obedience.</p>
               <p>5. That the thing whereunto man engageth himself in Baptism, is, that he
will be a Loyal, and obedient subject, unto God his redeemer in Christ; The
thing whereunto God obligeth himself is to be his God, and admit him a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his blessed Kingdom.</p>
               <p>6. That though the engagement be distinct from the performance, yet if it
be sincere there is a beginning of performance, though that performance
is not the thing confirmed, but the thing for which the confirmation is
made.</p>
               <p>7. There is a great difference, as between the making and confirming of a
covenant, and the keeping of it; so likewise between the solemn admission into
the visible Church, and the mysticall, which consists of real Saints, and loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
What kind of profession, and promise is required in the party to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
may be considered afterwards. By all this we may easily understand,
that it we will expect any benefit by our Baptism, we must have a speciall care
to perform our promise confirmed by this solemn rite: For these Sacraments
are special, and distinct laws added to all the rest, for this end to engage man
more strongly to observe them; And Baptism is a kind of naturalizing of such
as are baptized.</p>
               <p>The Second Sacrament,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XII</label> is the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> or that which we call the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
or Supper of the Lord. It's called the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> because a Sacrament of
thanksgiving, for the great benefit of Redemption by Christ; The Communion,
because in it we being many partake of one sacred bread, and the same cup: It's
called the Lords Supper, because it was instituted at the last Supper, that Christ
as morall did eat with his Disciples. Yet there may be other reasons of these
names given, and are given by others. This Sacrament hath many other names,

exercitation,</hi> 16. of his <hi>Apparatus.</hi> This <hi>Eucharist</hi> is a Sacrament of the
Gospel, wherein, by the use of Bread and Wine, according to our Saviours insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
in remembrance of his death and passion, the continuance, in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is confirmed. This Sacrament was instituted immediately by Christ in
the night, wherein he was betrayed; and succeeded the Passeover which was to
cease. For then Christ the true Paschal Lamb was exhibited, and ready to be
slaine. The <hi>Passeover</hi> did signifie Christ to come; and after Christs resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Sacrament did signifie him not onely come, but slain already, and it is
to continue to the end of the World for the perpetual memory of his sacrifice.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64164:134"/>
For as often as we eat this bread, and drink this cup, we shew forth Christs
death untill his comming again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. This death of Christ repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in this Sacrament, was the accomplishment of the Passeover, and of all
propitiatory Sacrifices, and sin-offerings. And this Sacrament is the abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all Sacrificial feasts, and especially such as were used for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of leagues, and covenants. It was resembled in a more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manner by that Sacrifice mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
Where,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Moses</hi> informs the people of all the words of the Lord, and all his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>2. The people promise obedience. This was the league, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Moses</hi> builds an Altar, and 12. Pillars according to the 12. Tribes, to
signifie that they were all engaged in it.</p>
               <p>4. There were offered by 12, young men, representing the 12 Tribes, burnt
offerings, and peace offerings of Oxen to the Lord.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Moses</hi> took half the blood, and put it in basons and half the blood he
sprinkled upon the Altar, which signified God one, and the principall party co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting.</p>
               <p>6. He takes the book of the Covenant, and reads the precepts, and promises
of God in the audience of the people, and they again engage to observe the
Law.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Moses</hi> took the blood of the Covenant, and sprinkled it on
the people, saying, Behold the blood of the Covenant, which the Lord hath
made with you concerning these Words. In all this, somethings are remarkable,</p>
               <p>1. That the thing that was confirmed was the covenant it self.</p>
               <p>2. That this Covenant was not onely made, but solemnly confirmed on
Gods side by half the blood sprinkled upon the Altar; by the other half of the
blood sprinkled upon the people, it was established on their part.</p>
               <p>3. That to the Rite were added words, and the words are taken up by our
blessed Saviour in this Sacrament.</p>
               <p>4. That though a Sanction of a law be taken for the confirmation of it by
promises of reward, and threatnings of punishments which are indeed essentiall
parts of Gods laws; yet this was a true, and proper sanction, not onely of the
precepts, but the promises, and the threats of God, and the promises of
the partyes covenanting with God, and it was by blood, and a solemn rite with
words.</p>
               <p>In the definition we may observe.<label type="milestone">

               <p>For I take rite in a large sense to include the words. The Elements (as they
use to call them) are Bread and Wine, which were then ready on the Passeover
Table. These were very fit both to signifie the body and blood of Christ; and
the eating and drinking of them, a spirituall Sacrificiall feast. Yet this they did
not by nature, but by the divine institution, though by nature they were apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
such things. These as consecrated unto God, were apt to represent Christ
sanctified, and set apart to be our Saviour, and deliverer: The bread was fit to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
his body, and the Wine his blood; the bread broken, his body crucified; &amp;
the Wine powred, out his blood shed; and both separated and given a part,
did resemble his death: the virtue of both to preserve life, the vertue and
power of Christ dying to give us eternal life.</p>

                     <item>1. The great Work of Redemption.</item>
                     <item>2. The Covenant; both which, are represented by the <hi>Elements,</hi>
and the use of them.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Redemption</hi> is signifyed by the words, <hi>My Body broken,</hi> and, <hi>My Blood
shed.</hi> For these inform us, that Christ dyed, and offered Himself a Sacrifice unto
God, offended by the sin of Man, to propitiate Him, by satisfying His Justice, and
meriting His Favour. This was the Foundation of the Covenant, and Man's
Salvation: For it made Sin Pardonable, and Man Save-able. That His
Body was broken; and being broken, was given; it informs us, that He suffered
Death, and offered Himself dying. That this Offering was propitiatory, it's
implyed, in that Bloud was shed for Remission. In the words of the <hi>Covenant</hi>
we have,
<list>
                     <item>1. The <hi>Promise,</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The <hi>Precept.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Promise</hi> in the words; <hi>This is my Body, broken, and given for you;</hi> and,
<hi>This is the New Covenant in my Blood, which was shed for the Remission of Sin.</hi> For,
though remission of sins, and Salvation, were merited, and purchased by Christ's
Death, and Sacrifice, and so trusted in his hands; yet they are conveyed in the
Covenant by a Promise, or Grant. Yet the Word is turned, <hi>A Testament;</hi>
and if we follow that metaphor, that which is called a Promise, is a Bequest. Yet
though the Expressions may be different, yet the thing is the same; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, That it is the Purpose, and Will of God, for, and in consideration of
the Death of Christ, suffered for our sins, to give man remission, and eternal life.
And this His Will He hath signified in His Promise, whereby He hath bound
Himself, upon certain tearms, unto sinful Man: Upon which tearms, Man may
challenge them, as due unto him. And whereas we read in <hi>Luke,</hi> and <hi>Paul;
This is the New Testament, or Covenant, in my Blood;</hi> and in <hi>Matthew,</hi> and <hi>Mark,
This is my Blood of the New Testament.</hi> You must understand,</p>
               <p>1. That the words are taken out of <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 8.</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>Matthew,</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> follow the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Septuagint,</hi> more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
then <hi>Luke,</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That the Sense of both is the same: For to be a Covenant in the Blood of
Christ, is, to be a Covenant confirmed by the Bloud of Christ; and to be the
Bloud of the Covenant, is to be the Bloud, whereby the Covenant is made
firm; and so both teach us, that by the Death of Christ, the Covenant of Grace
was made for ever unalterable; as you heard before, out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17.
And the Covenant was sounded upon Christ's Death.</p>
               <p>4. That this Covenant is called the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> to distinguish it from the
<hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and that Covenant that was made, and confirmed with <hi>Israel,</hi>
Exod. 24. 8.</p>
               <p>5. That as Christ's Bloud did merit, so the New Covenant did convey the
Benefits merited by the Death of Christ. This is the Promise. The <hi>Precept
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64164:136"/>
is in these words,</hi> Do this in remembrance of me. <hi>That is,</hi> As I dyed for thee,
gave my Body for thee shed my Blood for thee; So eat thou this Bread, drink thou this
Cup in remembrance of my Death suffered willingly out of the greatest love for thee.
<hi>This Remembrance must be practical; And as the thing remembred is Christ's
Death for our Sins, it requires</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. A Confession of our sins, a Sense of them, an Hatred, a Desire to be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and Purpose to forsake them.</p>
               <p>2. A Belief that Christ dyed for the expiation of those sins, and that His Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
was accepted of God, as a sufficient Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>3. An acknowledgment of God's wonderful Love, and the great benefit of
Redemption; and desire to be for ever Thankful.</p>
               <p>Thus far the Rites:<label type="milestone">

Redemption, the Blessed Covenant of Grace, wherein we have the Laws and
Constitutions of this Glorious Kingdom, whereof we discourse.</p>
               <p>The second thing that follows, is, the confirmation of the continuance of
this Covenant; and that is in these words: <hi>This is my Body,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is the
New Covenant, or Testament, in my Blood</hi> &amp;c. The thing confirmed is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the Covenant of Grace, in the Bloud of Christ. The Confirmation,

firm in the Covenant, and is ready to give a further increase of Graces, and a
greater measure of Mercy, for the merit of Christ dying; and, upon the same
tearms, the Covenant was made, and confirmed at first. For the Condition then
was, not onely to begin but continue Faith and Obedience; and God, by this
Sacrament, doth renew His Promise, that man may renew his Faith. Man, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed
to continue in this Covenant, doth solemnly, by receiving and eating
this Bread, in remembrance of the Body of Christ, broken and offered; and, by
receiving, and drinking the Cup, in remembrance of the bloud of Christ, testifie
and engage himself, to continue in thta Covenant, expecting Remission, and
Eternal Life, upon no other tearms, but Faith in Christ dying for him. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

               <p>But How, is this Bread Christ's Body? It's not the Body of Christ by Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>antiation,
nor Consubstantiation. For both these are contrary to Reason,
to Sense, to the Nature of all Religious Rites, and Sacraments, to all Miracles:
For there never was Miracle, that did delude the Senses: For the Water, turned
miraculously into Wine, appeared to be Wine, and tasted as Wine, and was
Wine indeed, as it appeared. That many of the Fathers seem to affirm it to be
the Body of Christ, is nothing; for, as many call it Bread, and a Sign and Figure
of Christ's Body. To this purpose, you may read the Learned Dr. <hi>Crakenthorpe,</hi>
against <hi>Spalatensis,</hi> in the Controversie of Transubstantiation, where ye shall find
a multitude of Councels and Fathers, exactly quoted to this purpose. The word,
<hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> was not known till latter times: The thing signified by it,
cannot be certainly defined: For the greatest School-men, and subtilest Wits,
differ amongst themselves, both in the Definitions, and the Explication of their
Definitions. Besides, there is some reason to think many of them do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it: For some of them, amongst us, have refused to take it upon their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that, after a due Consecration, according to their Rules, any such change
of the <hi>Elements</hi> is made. But suppose the change, and that it's certain; to what
end doth it serve? For it's confessed, that wicked men may receive the Body of
Christ in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and yet be damned: neither doth it profit any man,
who receives it without Faith. THIS, therefore, that is said to be Christ's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
is Bread; and, at the first Institution, it must needs be so: for then Christ's
Body was not broken, neither did Christ then give it.</p>
               <p>The second Question, therefore, is, How Bread may be said to be Christ's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
if not really, and by Transubstantiation, or Consubstantiation, or some such
way.</p>
               <p>The Answer is, That it's His Body,</p>
               <p>1. By Representation, because it's a Sign and Figure of his Body, as many of
the Ancients expresly affirm: and if any of these say, it's Christ's Body in proper
sense, as they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would make us believe they do, then they
must needs contradict themselves. And this is proper to all Religious Rites, to
signifie something invisible: and many times the name of the thing signifyed, is
given to the Sign it self. As <hi>Circumcision</hi> is said to be a token of the Covenant,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 2. and afterwards, it is called the Covenant: <hi>My Covenant shall be in
your flesh,</hi> ver. 13. whereas it was the token of the Covenant, that was in their
flesh.</p>
               <p>The reason of this expression, is the similitude and agreement between the
sign and the thing signifyed. In this respect, Christ calleth His Flesh, Bread;
not that it was Bread, but because it was like to Bread. And that place of
<hi>John</hi> the 6th, where He calls Himself, and His Flesh, Bread, is alleadged, to
prove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t is change: yet, if the Expression, and Predication were proper, that
place might prove, that Christ's Body was changed into Bread, and not Bread
into His Body, as will easily appear to any Intelligent, and impartial Reader.
Yet to be a bare Sign is not all; but to be a Sign so by Divine Institution, as to
confirm the Promise of the Covenant, and assure the worthy Receiver, that as
certainly, as He gives him that Bread; so certainly will God give him the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
merited by the Death of Christ. By this time, we may understand, what is
signifyed by these words, <hi>This is my Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is meant by the latter words; <hi>This is the Covenant in my Blood;</hi> and,
<hi>This is my Blood of the Covenant?</hi> For the sense of these, there can be no doubt,
but by <hi>THIS,</hi> is meant,</p>

               </list>
               <p>This Cup is said to be the new testament; that is, the sign, whereby it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in this Sacrament, and as it were a pledge given by God, and received by
man, of remission of sin, merited by the blood of Christ, and for his sake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to us. Whereas <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> relate that Christ said; This is
my blood, it's meant that the Wine in the Cup was a token and sign of his blood,
given and received to confirm the new Testament or Covenant. Thus Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
was a Sign, and Seal of the Righteousnesse of faith to <hi>Abraham:</hi> as
this Cup is a sign to signify; and a Seal to confirm the righteousnesse of faith,
and remission of sins in the blood of Christ. As for the real presence of Christ
in this Sacrament, it's certain that his glorifyed body is in Heaven; Yet he is
here Virtually, and Really present by his Spirit in this Sacrament, as in all
other his Ordinances, and in a speciall manner, and the same powerfull and
comfortable to the worthy receiver.</p>
               <p>The Papists have put a difference between the Sacrifice of the Masse,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XVII</label> and
the Sacrament of the Eucharist: and for the former Service they have their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from the Missal, for the Later from the Rituall. Yet Christ did but
institute a Sacrament, and not a Sacrifice; and in the same, the bread and
wine is commanded to be used in blessing, the giving and receiving of
both, and not the offering of the body, and blood of Christ; for that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
was once made, never to be made again. And whereas they do affirm,
that the Sacrifice of the Masse is properly a Sacrifice Propitiatory for the Sins of
the living and the dead, and the same with that Sacrifice, which Christ offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon the Crosse; it cannot be true, neither can it be credible to any rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
unprejudiced person. For a Sacrifice properly so taken, especially <hi>ilasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi>
or propitiatory is essentially bloody: as wherein the thing Sacrificed is
first slain, then offered. But the Sacrifice of the Crosse as they themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
is <hi>(INCRUENTUM)</hi> unbloody, and therein is no death of the
thing Sacrificed. Neither can it be the same with that which Christ offered
upon the Crosse: For to that it was essential, that Christ's body should be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and the blood shed, and offered unto God, without spot by the eternall
Spirit; and without this Death, and offering, it could not have bin this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
at all: and this Sacrifice was but offered once, and once offered was never to
be offered again. For once in the end of the World hath he appeared to put
away sin by the Sacrifice of himself, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. So that we have here but one
Sacrifice, and the same once offered; yet of eternall vertue. If this Sacrifice
of the Masse were the same (which they affirm) with the Sacrifice upon the
Crosse, it must needs be granted that it is propitiatory: But they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That it is, <hi>incruentum.</hi>

                  <item>3. That it's only, <hi>Commemoratorium, &amp; Applicatorium.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>By the First they grant, that it's not essentially the same.</p>
               <p>By the Second, that it's not effectively the same.</p>
               <p>By the Third that it's only a Commemoration, and a meanes of the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the same.</p>
               <p>And if they would lay aside the Sacrifice of the Masse, and acknowledge the
Sacrifice of the Crosse, and celebrate the Sacrament as it was instituted by
Christ; We should easily grant, that therein there is a Commemoration of
Christ's death, and Sacrifice once offered; and that this Sacrament is a meanes.

Before I conclude this Doctrine of the Sacraments,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XVIII</label> I will examine,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Who have power and right to administer them?</item>
                  <item>2. To whom they may lawfully be administred?</item>
                  <item>3. Whether they are to be administred according to humane judgment,
which is fallible, or divine judgment which is infallible?</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the first of these; Who have power to administer? That's easily and briefly
determined: For they who are trusted with the word, and have Commmissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to preach the Gospel, they have power to administer these Sacraments.
This, in respect of Baptism, appears in the mission of the Apostles into all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For, by that Commission, they who must teach must baptize: And
we never read of any Commission given to any others either to baptize, or
administer the Lords supper. And the constant practice of the universall
Church, so far as known to us, hath bin conformable to this Commission. What
may be done in case of necessity, which God, not man, hath brought us unto, is
another thing: For in such cases God dispenseth with many things, required
in his own Institution.</p>
               <p>As for the second question,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIX</label> To whom may they be administred? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
in generall, is,</p>
               <p>1. They may be administred to such as have a right unto them, who are
Christ's disciples, and may be judged fit to be members of the Church visible,
and in the number of Christians.</p>
               <p>2. We must distinguish between the subjects, who have a right to the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
participation of Baptism, and such as have aright to the actual participation
of the Lords supper.</p>
               <p>3. Of such as may be subjects capable of Baptism, some are <hi>Adulti;</hi> and
these, if they be disciples, and manifest themselves to be such, they no doubt
may be baptized. But all the controversy in our unhappy dayes, is; Whether
Infants of Christians, and believing Parents may be baptized, or no? In this
controversy, I shall deliver my knowledge and judgment, as briefly as may
be.</p>
               <p>1. Infants, as Infants and Children of <hi>Turks, Pagans,</hi> unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi>
are not capable of Baptism; neither as Infants, nor Infants of such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p>2. Infants as Infants, and considered Physically as distinct persons from
their Parents, are not capable of, or have any right to Baptism.</p>
               <p>3. The Infants of Christian Parents, so considered as distinct persons, from
their Christian Parents, as Christians, have no right unto it.</p>
               <p>4. The Infants of Christian, and believ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng Parents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> considered as one person
with them as Christians and believers, have right to Baptism. For if they be
one person with them as Christians, they must needs have some kind of right to
Baptism, as their Parents have.</p>
               <p>5. They have not this right from them by Nature, nor humane Laws: for
so they only receive their humane nature from them, as their Parents have
humane nature, and this naturally: and if their Parents be free, or noble by
humane Laws, they derive freedom, or nobility.</p>
               <p>6. That they derive this right from their Parents, as Christians, it's from
Gods free mercy, and gracious ordination, which includes the Children in
Covenant with the Parents.</p>
               <p>7. Children are one person with their parents, both by the Law of God, and
the Laws of Men: and that in many things, and especially in Obligations in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
in rewards, and punishments. By the Laws of men, in civill matters, we
know that, <hi>SUI HEREDES,</hi> as the <hi>Civilians</hi> call them derive a right
unto their Parents estate, though there be no Testament; or, if a Testament,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64164:138"/>
and the same they be excluded; because the Law grounded upon nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
them as one person with their Parents or next kindred deceased. If the
Father be a subject of a free State, and so bound to subjection, unto the Laws,
the Son born of him, as a subject of that State is bound to the Lawes,
and derives that obligation from his Father, as one person with him; nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her
is it materiall, whether the Father was a subject naturall, or naturaliz'd. If
the Father dye indebted, and the Heir enter upon the estate by vertue of that
Will: He by the civill Law falls under the same obligation, as one with the
Father, and is bound to discharge the debts. <hi>Paul</hi> was born a <hi>Roman, Act.
22.</hi> 28. and all the Priviledges of a <hi>Roman</hi> he had by birth from his Father,
because his Father was a <hi>Roman.</hi> If a man for his merits be invested with a
Fee, or estate of honour and juridiction adherent, and the same investiture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him, and his Heires; then his Heir after his decease from that first investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his Father, or his father first invested, the estate with the honour, and
jurisdiction is one person with him. If a Peer be convicted, and condemned
for high treason, his estate is confiscate, and the blood tainted, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and Family suffer as one with the person guilty. These instances, though
others more clear, and fit may be given, may suffice to manifest in things civil,
and by humane Laws, the Father, or the Parents, and Children to be one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
I might further shew that in many cases Prince, and People, and also
the whole State may be considered as one person, and are so taken both by
God, and Men. Let's inquire whether it be so in matters of Religion, and by
the Laws of Gods Kingdome. That it is so, I have made it evident out of the
second Commandement of the Law morall, both in punishments and blessings:
For not onely temporall but spirituall judgments, lye upon the Children for
their Fathers sins, which could not be just, except they be some ways one person
with their Parents. And all true believers derive their right unto spirituall,
and eternall rewards as one person with Christ, and in some sort from <hi>Abraham,</hi>
since his time, as the Father of Believers. But the principal thing to be cleared,
is, that Parents and Children are one person in religious obligations &amp; spiritual
priviledges, &amp; favours. For obligation unto obedience to Gods Laws, all Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
and understanding Christians will grant that <hi>Adam</hi> and all mankind were
one person as Father and Children; insomuch, that in <hi>Adam</hi> sinning we all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and in him dying we all dye. This could never have bin so, if God both in his
Laws, and Judgments had not considered, and accounted, that in <hi>Adam</hi> bound,
all his were bound: But this was under the government of God Creator, not
Redeemer. Yet <hi>Abraham</hi> was under the government of Redemption, and
the Kingdom of grace. And in him God binds his seed, and Posterity, yea
his bought, and born-servants male. For thus it is written; <hi>And God said
unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>Thou shalt keep my Covenant; Thou, and thy seed after thee in
their generations,</hi> Gen. 17. 9. Where we must note,</p>
               <p>1. That this was the first institution of Circumcision.</p>
               <p>2. That this was immediately, and personally given as a Law, at this time
only to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That it did not onely bind <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, but his posterity to many
generations.</p>
               <p>4. That the obligation in respect of the Children was so strict, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised
man-child, whose flesh of his fore-kin was not Circumcised, that
soul should be cut off from his people: He had broken the Covenant, <hi>ibid.
vers.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>5. That this Sacrament was a Sign, and Seal of the righteousnesse by faith,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2. And was to continue till the time of the Gospel, when the Sign of
the Covenant was to be changed into that of washing with water: and the
faith confirmed, then, was in Christ to come, and by that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified;
but after that time, the Gospel-justification was by faith in Christ already
come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:64164:138"/>
From all this it's evident, that the obligation of the Father, was the obligation
of the Child. And it's further remarkable, that</p>
               <p>1. That Covenant did expresly include the Children with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p>2. That it was the Covenant of Righteousnesse by faith in Christ.</p>
               <p>3. That there is no exception, or exclusion, nor clause to that purpose in all
the Gospel, as that God should contract his mercy, and not extend it so far
even to Christian Children, in the times of the Gospel, as he did in the times
of the Old Testament. No man that shall seriously consider this matter, but
will confesse that Parents are bound not onely for themselves, but also for their
Children too. And therefore they are so oft, not onely under the Law, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel, to teach their Children so soon as they are capable, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are bound to receive their instruction, and to observe the condition of the
Covenant, into which their Parents entred for them and theirs. Therefore
God saith that <hi>Abraham</hi> would command his Children, and houshold after
him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. Which command of <hi>Abraham</hi> had been of little force, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
his Children, and houshold had been bound by that command, which
was given to him, and in him to them. God considering both as one person.
God hath so far subjected Children to their Parents, Servants to their Masters,
and the houshold or family to the Master or Mistris of a family, that neither
Servants nor Children are <hi>(Sui juris)</hi> or in their own power, but in the power
of Parents, and Masters so, that they may command them, and not onely in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of this life, but especially in religion. And if they were not so much in
their power, and bound in them, it was strange that when the Centution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
his whole houshold became believers, <hi>John</hi> 4. 53. and that <hi>Lydia,</hi> and
her houshold, the Jaylour, and all his, or all his house should be baptized at
one time, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 15. 33, 34. And surely the Child of Christian Parents is
bound in his Christian Parents, unto the conditions of the Covenant; so as no
Child of any <hi>Mahumetan, Pagan,</hi> or unbelieving Jew, is.</p>
               <p>But the principal point to be cleared in this particular is,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XX</label> How Parents, and
Children are one person by the Laws of God in spiritual favours and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
so that what the right of the Parents is, the same may be the right of the
Children: And what these rites, and priviledges are which are communicable
from the Parents to the Children. And here this is a certain rule, that so far
as God binds Children in their parents to duty, so far he binds himself to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in their Parents by his promise. The Apostle saith, That if the root be
holy, so are the branches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. Where we may observe.</p>
               <p>1. That the root are the Parents, and the branches are the Children.</p>
               <p>2. That the root, and branches make but one tree; So parents, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
make but one body one person Politick.</p>
               <p>3. That if the root be holy, the branches are holy, and to be holy is a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
priviledge.</p>
               <p>4. That as the branches derive their naturall <hi>Being</hi> from the root, so the
Children derive their spiritual priviledges to be holy, from their holy Parents.
Yet this holinesse is not either justification, or inherent, righteousnesse, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
sanctification of the Spirit. For when the unbelieving Husband is san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by the believing Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is sanctified by the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
it cannot be meant of any such sanctification, neither is the holinesse of
the Children of such sanctified parents, any such thing. It's something whereby
they are nearer the Kingdome of God, then the Children of Apostate heathens,
Mahumetans, or unbelieving Jewes are. The distance from God, and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the one is not such, or so great as the distance of the other. The Apostle
puts the <hi>Ephesians</hi> in mind, That before their conversion, they were Gentiles in
the slesh, who were called uncircumcision by that which was called circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:64164:139"/>
in the slesh, made by hands; That at that time they were without Christ,
being aliens from the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> and strangers from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of promise, having no hope, without God in the world, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 11, 12.
It's not to be understood that they were without God as Creatour or Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
but without God promising to save them. For God did not promise to
save them, or their Children upon any terms. They were excommunicate,
and banished out of his Kingdome, and were denyed the very meanes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version:
Therefore they must needs be without Christ, and without hope:
For where there is no Christ, nor promise in Christ, there could be no hope.
But after their conversion they were Subjects of Gods Kingdome, fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
with the Saints, and of the houshold of God: and if the Parents being the
root were holy, then their Children, the branches were holy, and within the
Verges of Gods spiritual Kingdom. And as the promise in Christ to come, was
to the Jews, and their Children; so the promise in Christ already come, is to
Christians, and their Children. For the Covenant made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his
seed is essentially (though not accidentally) the same with the promise of the
Gospel, and must necessarily include the Children with the Parents, as that did,
except any man can produce a clause of exclusion, which no man to this day
ever could. When <hi>Peter</hi> said, The promise is to you, and to your Children,
and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God should call, <hi>Acts
2.</hi> 3. He spake not to the Jews merely as Jews, but as Christians believing in
Christ already come, and the promise was not personal to them alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
their Children, but to them as such, and their Children. For their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
did no wayes limit, or straiten the promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
it in the same extent it was before. And the words imply that if he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Gentiles, who were afar off, both they, and their Children, as he did call
them afterward, even they should enjoy the promise in the same extent, so as to
include the Children with the Parents. To understand it otherwise, is to offer
violence to the Text. For the Gentiles once called must enjoy the priviledges
for them, and theirs, in as large, and ample manner as the Jew did: this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was the proper, and special priviledge of the Jew, he must first be called. Yet
this we must know, that Children are in the lowest form of Christs Kingdom,
whilst they are Children, and after they are at age by their actual disobedience,
may loose the benefit, and by Apostacy, they may forfeit all their priviledges and
their hope. These priviledges which these Children enjoy, are not, ordinarily,
immediate conversion, or justification, and the Spirit of Adoption, and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and the actuall enjoyment of those blessings; but that which they have
immediate right unto, is the meanes of conversion, which he denyes to such as
are not of the Church. For this was the priviledge which the Jew enjoyed,
though he did not believe, he was trusted with the Oracles of God, wherein
were precepts of duty, promises for mercy, and also of power to keep the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and the outward confirmation, both of precepts and promises. This
was the Childrens bread, which was not given to doggs of the Gentiles, and
such as were strangers to the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel.</hi> These Children born
in the Church, and of believing Parents, who are Christians, are members of
the Church, subjects of Christs Kingdome, and have a special relation to God,
to Christ, to the Church; and the same, such as no Infants in the world born of
Parents out of the Church have, or as such can have. The summe of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is, That as all Children are part of their parents, make but one person by
the Laws of God and men, so Christian Infants are one person with their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
parents, and make but one body with them, as the root, and branches are
but one Tree, and this by divine ordination, and especially in obligations to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes,
and right unto favours and priviledges spiritual so far, as they are capable.
So that the question so much vexed in our dayes rightly stated is this: Whether
Christian infants, as part of their parents, and one person with them have right
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:64164:139"/>
to Baptism, or are subjects immediately capable of baptism, according to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
ordination? To this thus stated, the Antipaedo-baptists have said nothing
to this hour. And whereas they alleage that there is no example or precept
in the Gospel for Infant-baptism; it hath been answered; that there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
precept, or example for women to receive the Lords Supper, and yet they
themselves administer it to women: But this is but very little, if not the least,
that may be said for infant-baptism. For so many precepts, and examples, as
they can find in the New-Testament; for the Baptism of such as are at age, so
many precepts, and examples they give us for Baptizing Infants. For if the
parents, or one of the parents may be baptized, then the Infant may be baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
For they are one person in respect of Baptism, and therefore what right the
one hath, the other must have. Neither can it be upon any sufficient ground
alledged that Children are uncapable of Baptism, either as it is a Sacrament, or as
a Sacrament of initiation, or as a seale of the righteousnesse by faith: For cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
was</p>
               <p>1. A Sacrament.</p>
               <p>2. A Sacrament of initiation,</p>
               <p>3. A Seal of the righteousnesse by faith. Yet this was administred to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
and that by Gods Institution, which never would have been done by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Warrant, if they had been uncapable. The difference between Baptism,
and Circumcision was,</p>
               <p>1. That the signes are different.</p>
               <p>2. That there was a different modification in the object of faith required in
both. The signe of the former was the cutting off the foreskin of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lesh; in
the second washing with water, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghost.
The different modification of the object of faith, was Christ to come, and
Christ already come.</p>
               <p>The spirituall thing sealed and signified in both, was the same, that is, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
by faith in Christ. And as there is no place of Scripture alleaged, so I think
there can be no reason sufficient given, why the covenant being essentially the
same, the Children included then, should be excluded now. If the faith, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and promise of the Parents then was sufficient to obtain the sealing of
the covenant by the initiating Sacrament, why should they not be now? For
Children are as much one person now with their parents, as they were then.
Neither should any wonder that the Faith of one may benefit another, if the
Faith of a Father could obtain the deliverance of the Child, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 23.
And the Faith of a Mother, the freedome of the Daughter from the power of the
Devil, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 29, 30. and the faith of those that carryed the sick, and
Paralytical wretch, obtained the remission of his sins, and recovery, <hi>Mark.

               </p>
               <p>1. What it is morally or politically to be one person with another, or <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na

               <p>2. How many wayes severall persons, physically distinct, may be one.</p>
               <p>3. For how many ends or causes it may be so.</p>
               <p>4. To reduce the places of Scripture, which teach us how God doth take not
onely parents, and Children, but many others as one, into order, would take
up a large discourse, and it might be very usefull, and profitable, and give great
light to many places. But for the present I intend it not; it would be too
great a digression. Onely in matters of religion, Parents and Children,
Prince and People, Husband and Wife, Master and Servants, and such relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in severall societies, are onely so far one, as God would have them to be;
and Children are so far one with their Parents, as to derive by divine ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
something from them, whereof they are capable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:64164:140"/>
Otherwise we might argue, that, because their Parents have actual faith, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
right to the actual participation of the Eucharist, are justified, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
<hi>&amp;c:</hi> therefore the Children are so, have faith, and a right unto the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
participation of the Lords Supper. And this is the next thing to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who they are, who may be admitted to the <hi>actual participation</hi> of the Lords
Supper.</p>
               <p>Infants baptized have a remote right unto that Sacrament; and so also have
Christians of age, formerly baptized, a nearer right. But the question is not of a
remote right, but of an immediate right according to divine institution, to the
actual participation of this Sacrament! <hi>Justine Martyr</hi> informs us of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of the Church, and the rules observed in those times. The summe, and
substance of his words, is this: That they baptized persons at age, who profess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Christian faith, and promised to live accordingly. And the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Communicants at the Lords Table, was this,</p>
               <p>1. They must be baptized persons.</p>
               <p>2. Continue in the profession of the Christian faith; for so he must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
               <p>3. Live according to the Commandements of Christ. Those that desire to
know his mind in this particular may read his words in his second Apology.
And here it's to be noted,</p>
               <p>1. That this very qualification is required in the words of the Institution of
this Sacrament, and the Apostles doctrin thereupon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24, 25.
unto the 33. <hi>verse.</hi> For in that place the Apostle doth imply,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the communicant should have the use of reason, which infants
have not.</item>
                  <item>2. That he must be a Disciple, or Christian Baptized.</item>
                  <item>3. That he have the knowledge of the mystery of Redemption, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the same.</item>
                  <item>4. That this knowledge must be and ought to be practicall: How else
can he celebrate, and receive the Sacrament in remembrance of his
Saviours death, passion, sacrifice, so as not to be guilty of the body, and
blood of Christ? And hence it follows,</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. That an ignorant person, who hath no competent knowledge of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Redemption, and that Sacrament or professeth not the Christian saith,
or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> guilty of scandal certainly known can have no right unto the immediate
receiving of the Eucharist: if known to be such.</p>
               <p>2. That there is required more in a communicant at this blessed Table, then in
a person at age to be baptized: For unto the one is required onely a profession
of his faith, and a promise of a new life, but in the other not onely profession,
and a promise, but baptism antecedent, and a performance of the promise in
living according to Christs Commandements. And whereas some tell us, that
this Sacrament is a converting ordinance; I must tell such, that as it presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
Baptism, which is the laver of regeneration, so it presupposeth conversion if
we will speak in the Dialect of the Spirit which is safest, and not according to
our own fancies, which is no wayes tolerable.</p>
               <p>The third,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XXII</label> and last question is, whether this Sacrament is to be administred,
according to mens knowledge and judgment which is fallible, or according to
Gods knowledge, which is infallible? For satisfaction herein,</p>
               <p>1. It's certain, that both the Sacraments are to be administred, and that by
Gods command by man, as by the Minister who is trusted with the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the word, and Sacraments.</p>
               <p>2. That mans knowledge is but fallible, and he cannot search the heart and
reines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:64164:140"/>
3. That though the Minister as in Baptism, so in the administration of the
Lords Supper, must keep close to his commission, yet by reason of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of his knowledge, he may administer unto persons unworthy, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
cases is bound so to do.</p>
               <p>4. That though man may administer to the unworthy, yet God doth alwayes
either suspend, or excommunicate them, and denyes the spiritual benefit unto
them: and this perfect judgment he hath reserved to himself. Yet this doth
no wayes warrant man to give the Eucharist to any man, whom he certainly
knows to be unworthy. And in denying it to such, he need not plead juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<hi>(in Foro exteriori)</hi> or power of suspension, and excommunication in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as a Minister of the Gospel; but onely alledg that by his commission from
Christ, he hath no power to give it to such a person, and he must not do that,
which he hath no power to do. Neither doth he in refusing to admit such a
person, whom he certainly knows unfit, either for ignorance or scandall signify,
that the party hath no right at all any wayes unto the Sacrament; but onely sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies,
that according to the rules of Christ, for that time, and whilst he is such,
he cannot have any actual possession, or enjoyment of that right: As the Leper
had right unto his rent, or house, but could not possesse, and enjoy it, till he was
clean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed. Yet one thing seems strange, that such as grant unto the Minister, or
Presbyter the power of absolution <hi>(in Foro interiori)</hi> as they call it, yet should
deny him the power of suspension, of that party whom he certainly knows to
be scandalous. Why may he not positively declare him to be unworthy and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his certain knowledge, so judge him according to the laws of Christ?
Yet if he do thus, this act is far different, from the acts of judgment exercised
<hi>(in Foro exteriori)</hi> where a Discipline is established. We need not here debate
what kind or degree of Faith in such as are at age do give them right to Baptism.
For its not the Faith, but the profession of the Faith, and promise of New life,
we must look at in this particular. For if they professe the true faith, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
a new life, and that seriously, and we know nothing to the contrary, we
must judge them to have a right, and we must give it them. If a <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
who is still in the gall of bitternesse, do thus, we must baptize him, we have
warrant for it; and if we refuse, then we offend. Though all those things be
true, yet it's certain, God requires of such parties sincere faith, sincere professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and sincere promise, and such as shall afterwards be followed with sincere
practise: and if they be not such, he will not Baptize them with the Holy-Ghost;
and though he allow them to be members of the visible Church, till they shew
themselves worthy to be cast out, yet he doth not ingraft them into Christ, and
give them an immediate title to the heavenly inheritance. But man having
not the knowledge of God, cannot passe the judgment of God: neither must
we presume to do so. Yet if the Church, or any that hath commission, shall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
certain evidence bind, or loose, either in <hi>foro interiori,</hi> or <hi>exteriori,</hi> their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall be made good, and ratified in Heaven, so far as it shall agree with the
infallible judgment of God.</p>
               <p>It's doubted by many, Whether the Children of ignorant, or scandalous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
or such as are both ignorant, and scandalous may be Baptized. What to
determine in this point is difficult, because it may admit many different cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
and cases. If we consider these Children as born in a visible Church,
where there is a faithfull ministery, and a good discipline setled, there is hope of
good education, and the Children may be considered as members of that
Church as a body Politick, and so admitted to Baptism: For the greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is, when there is little or no hope of Christian education. The defects, or
crimes of the immediate parents in the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> did not deprive their
Children of the right and priviledge of circumcision. But except we know the
particular case, and the circumstances thereof with such parents of such Children
in particular, we cannot exactly define what is to be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:64164:141"/>
They who affirm, that onely the Children of Parents, really regenerate, have
right to Baptism, presuppose,</p>
               <p>1. That these Children derive their right to that Sacrament, from their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Parents onely.</p>
               <p>2. That they derive it from them, as they are regenerate, and neither from
any other, nor from them any other ways considered. But when they can prove
clearly these things out of Scripture, I may believe them. For outward Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
(such Circumcision, and Baptism, be) they may be granted to the Seed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the flesh, if the Parents be not justly cast out of the Church; and so of
Christians, if they be made no Christians before the Children be born. Upon this
account, both <hi>Ismael,</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> were circumcised. And if they be cast out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it's a Question, whether upon Adoption, or some other Grant, they may
not be baptized. But I leave this Controversie to be debated, and determined
by such as are so busie about it, as though they had nothing else to do.</p>

and ascribeth all mercies to His Free-Will, and abundant Grace in Christ;
I, therefore, thought good, though I mention'd it in the Exposition of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law (for it belongs, and is reducible to the first four Commandements, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally,
in several respects) yet to speak something of it more at large, and more
distinctly: and so take occasion to speak of that excellent Pattern of Prayer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by our Saviour Chirst unto his Disciples, and left upon Record unto us, and
all Generations unto the Worlds end. Of the necessity, efficacy, and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Prayer, many have excellently discoursed, to whom I refer the Reader. As
for the order, which it challengeth in the Body of Divinity, we must find it in
those 4 first Commandements, which speak of the Worship of God; for it's a
part of God's Worship, required and prescribed more especially in the first and
second Commandement of the Moral Law. It's sometimes used to signifie the
whole Worship of God, as a principal part, virtually containing many of the
rest. It's sometimes taken more strictly for Praise, Thanksgiving, Petition; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all those are sometimes contained in one speech directed unto God.
Sometimes and that most usually, it signifies Petition. And, as Thanksgiving
is an acknowledgment of God's mercies we have received, and praise of his
perfections, manifested in His glorious Works; so Prayer is a presenting our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
for mercies promised, unto God, as All-mighty, and All-merciful, in the
Name of Christ. And it's then effectual, when by Faith, in Christ, it's persumed
with his Merits. There is this more general Definition: <hi>Prayer</hi> is a Presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of our Petitions unto God: And this is either directed to the true God,
or to a false suppose God: Such the Prayers of Heathens and Idolaters be.
There is Prayer to the true God.</p>

                  <item>1. According to the Light of Nature.</item>

               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:64164:141"/>
And such is the first, and more particular Definition formerly given. And we
must distinguish between a Prayer, and an effectual Prayer. To an effectual
Prayer is required, not onely the right qualification of the person praying, but of
the Prayer it self. And the efficacy depends upon neither, but upon Christ's
Merit, and God's Promise. It's an excellent part of God's Worship: and
therefore some make it to be the <hi>Genus.</hi> For it's the general nature of it. It's
the good pleasure of this Eternal King, that all his Subjects should have access
unto his Throne; with all Humility and Reverence bow before him; adore
his glorious Majesty, seek all mercies by way of Petition. And in the Gospel
we must approach in the Name of Christ: For He is our High-Priest, who in
his Golden Censer, must offer all our Prayers, sweetned with his Merits; who,
by his blood, hath made the Throne of God, the Throne of Grace, and accessible
by sinful man. And for his merits fore-seen, and fore-accepted, the Prayers of
the Saints, from the times of <hi>Adam,</hi> till his Incarnation and Ascension into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
were accepted. This Worship of Prayer, doth acknowledge his Supream
Majesty, his Almighty Power, and his endless and infinite Mercy, his Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and Omnipresence, and gives the glory of all Deliverances and Blessings
unto him. By it, we confess our selves needy Suppliants, and wholly depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
upon him, who is the ever-living Fountain of all Mercies. He is of that
gracious disposition, that he admits all his Subjects at any time, even the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
to come before him, pour out their Supplications, and reveal their Hearts
unto him: and, as He is able, so He is willing to accept their persons, and their
prayers, take special notice of their desires, yea, of their cryes, sighs, groans; and
writes them in the Book of His Eternal Memory, that, in due time, He may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their Desires. Things desired, are the matter of our Desires, and our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of our Prayers. Yet Desires are not Prayers, but when they are by us presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto Him. The first definition of <hi>Prayer,</hi> is easie to be understood in all
parts thereof, excepting that of Praying, <hi>In the Name of Christ.</hi> For the better
understanding whereof, we must have recourse unto our Saviour's words unto

not pray, and offer in His Name, in the foresaid manner, before their Lord was
glorifyed. In this Form, which is not a Prayer, as taught His Disciples, nor as
related in the Scriptures, nor as learned by us; but as made, and tendred unto
God, in the behalf of our selves and others; we may, with others, observe</p>

               </list>
               <p>1. <hi>Who must pray?</hi> The parties bound unto this Duty are all men living:
The Command of the Moral Law requiring, it obligeth universally. All men
have need to pray, because all men, always, in all things, even for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of <hi>Being,</hi> do wholly depend upon the Supream Soveraign. The very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
though they worshipped false Gods, did acknowledge some Superiour
Power, did account Prayer one part of Worship, and a means to propitiate their
<hi>supposed Deities,</hi> &amp; to obtain their favour, protection, and all their good success in
their great Enterprises. And, if we may believe <hi>Tertullian,</hi> these, in their Souls,
in Extremities, would invocate one Supream God. He's a cursed Atheist, that
will not pray; a prophane Wretch, who neglects to pray; an Idolater, that
prays not to the true God; no Christian, that will not pray in the Name of
Christ; an Hypocrite, who prays not sincerely with his heart; a cold Christian,
that prays not fervently; a miserable man that knows not how to pray, and pray
effectually.</p>
               <p>The Partyes for whom we must pray,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> 
                  <hi>are</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Our selves: for besides our own necessityes, wants, and miseries, our to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and perpetual dependence on God requires it. And this will be our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
till the time of Glory: Our whole life in the flesh is a time of Praying.</p>
               <p>2. We must pray for others so farr as they are capable of our prayers: For
we are taught to say not onely, <hi>My Father</hi> but <hi>Our Father.</hi> And because all
men are our Neighbours, and we must love our Neighbours as our selves, we
must pray for them whom we most love, as we pray for our selves. Our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
must enlarge according to our charity, and must take in all, not onely
Friends and Acquaintance, but Strangers and Enemies: So our Saviour taught
us to pray for them who despightfully use us. And because all Mankind are
but one Body, and we Members of the same; so we can exclude no man, as
man, and flesh and blood, as we be. This Neighbour is publick, private; ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall,
civill. In the first place we must pray for publick Neighbours,
whole Nations, and States; and especially for our own dear Country, and the
People subject to the same supreme power that we are. Amongst these we
must remember our Governours supreme, and subordinate, upon whom our
safety and peace under God do much depend. The spirituall publick Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64164:142"/>
to be commended to God chiefly, is the universall Church militant; and
more particularly that particular Church whereof we are a part, and, in the
same, above others, the Ministers of the Gospel. Our private Neighbours are
not onely strangers and Enemies, as before, but such as are joyned unto us by
Vicinity of place, Family, Kinred, Alliance, near Acquaintance, Friends by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
love. These must be thought upon in our prayers. But most of all
must we put God in mind of his dearest Saints, and especially such as are in
greatest miseries, persecutions, trials, for the Gospel's sake. We must not
forget to supplicate and petition for the Conversion of <hi>Pagans, Mahumetans,</hi>
unbelieving <hi>Jewes.</hi> Yet, in all this, we must observe that some are in that
happy condition, that they need not out prayers; some in that desperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of sin and misery, that our prayers can do them no good. Neither are
they capable of any benefit to be received by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The party to whom our Prayers must be presented,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> 
                  <hi>is to God:</hi> And in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
we consider how we ought to conceive of God, and what Titles we
should give him in our addresses to him. And they all are either implied, or
expressed in these words, <hi>Our Father in Heaven. Father</hi> signifies his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
<hi>in Heaven,</hi> his greatnesse. These two include all his perfections mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
in his word and works. For he that will pray to God must conceive
of him as mighty, and merciful, willing and able to hear, and help. <hi>Vasquez,</hi>
and other Schoolemen said well, that God, as <hi>Potens, et Liberalis,</hi> was the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Prayer. His Might can do any thing; his Mercy will do what he can.
And if we conceive any, either unable, or, if able, unwilling to help us, we
judge it in vain to sollicit them, or tender our Petitions to them. We must
not onely conceive of God as mighty, and mercifull, but as infinite, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
in both; and also the supreme Lord, present in all places, at all times,
and knowing all things, even the most secret, and, in particular, with what
hearts we pray. A Father in Heaven is all this. And we may observe in the
Scripture-Prayers that God's servants give him in their particular prayers, such
Titles as are suitable to the matter prayed for. As when they desire God to
take vengeance of cruel Oppressours, and bloody Murderers, they give him the
Title of <hi>God to whom vengeance belongeth: Psal. 94. 1, 2, 3. &amp;c.</hi> Many such
instances may be given. From these words also, we may observe the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
required to an effectuall Prayer; especially if we joyn with the Preface
the Body of the Prayer, wherein we have the things prayed for. And because
we can have little heart to pray, when we have no hope to speed, we must
look at our heavenly Father as promising these mercies. And because we
have need of all kind of Mercies, especially spiritual, and eternal, we must look
at him both as an universal cause of all Mercies, especially of the greatest. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we have made our selves unworthy to be heard, unworthy to receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good thing from him, we must look at him as propitiated by the blood of
Christ, and as moved, and made willing by his merits to give those things, and
by his intercession ready, not onely to hear us, but plenteously to powre down
from Heaven his blessings, and Graces, upon us, and to give us all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to our happinesse. So that though he many times prevent us with his
blessings, and gives us more then we ask or can think upon, yet we must pray:
and our prayer must be qualified with knowledge, faith, humility, reverence,
hope, charity, a resolution to do his heavenly will, hearing him that he may
hear us, and we must have the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry <hi>Abba</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and may come with boldnesse, and confidence, before his throne of grace,
and be instant, constant, importunate.</p>
               <p>To passe by the distinctions of Prayers; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> ejaculatory, solemn; particular,

                  </gap>, or in company; which I mentioned in the exposition of the second
Commandement. I proceed unto the body of the Prayer, wherein we have
the matter of our prayers, and the things to be petitioned for. And, by the
way, let us take notice that there was no need to give a rule, for thanksgiving,
distinct from that of petition. For that which is matter of petition before,
and when we pray; is the matter of thanksgiving, when God hath heard our
our prayers, and granted our desires. All things which man can desire of
God may be reduced unto one, and that is, Happinesse; which consists in full
communion with our God, and blessed Saviour Jesus Christ. This happiness
may be said to have two parts.</p>
               <p>1. Enjoyment of all good we are, or shall be, capable of.</p>
               <p>2. Freedom from all evill we either suffer or are liable to.</p>
               <p>The good we are capable of, is either spirituall or temporall: The evill
which we suffer, or are liable unto, is either of Sin or Affliction. The evill of
Sin is either of sin past, whereof we are guilty already: or of sin, whereof we are
in danger for time to come. And according to these heads, our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in this pattern reduceth in an excellent order all things to be prayed for.
So that whosoever understands it, may see</p>
               <p>1. That in a few words a world of matter is conteined. There is nothing
in all the Prayers recorded in Scripture; nothing in all the Prayers of Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Liturgies or Directories; nothing needfull to man's full, and eternall
blisse, but here he may find it.</p>
               <p>2. That all these are reduced into a most excellent, and accurate Method.
This Pattern therefore must needs be from Heaven, and it's above the power
of men, and Angels, to compose the like. In it we have</p>
               <p>1, Supplication for Blessings.</p>
               <p>2. Deprecation of evils.</p>
               <p>The Supplication is either for Blessings spirituall, in the three first Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for temporall, in the fourth. Deprecation of the evill of Sin past, we
have in the fifth; of Sin to come in the sixth; where is added a Deprecation
of the evill of Affliction, which some make a seventh Petition.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed to the particular explication of these heads, I desire the
Reader to take notice</p>
               <p>1. That a Prayer may be, either simple; as when one of these onely is the
Matter of our Petition; or compound, when more, or all these, are the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our prayer. To this purpose, in Books for private devotion, and in
publick Liturgies, as also in the Scripture, we have many examples.</p>
               <p>2. That the whole Pattern is delivered by the Evangelist St. <hi>Luke</hi> as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
given to Christ's Disciples, to regulate their Prayers: In <hi>Matthew</hi>
it's expressed as a formall Prayer; so that if we take up the very words, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
our selves to God, they are properly a Prayer.</p>
               <p>3. That some, upon vain and weak grounds, think it unlawfull in these
words to pray to God. But certainly they are an excellent Prayer, if offered
with Understanding and Devotion unto God, in the Name of Christ glorified,
and made our Intercessour in Heaven.</p>
               <p>4. Yet many do idolize this Prayer, as though there should be some strange
force, and power in the very words: and it's a sad thing to think how it's abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
both in publick, and private, and that by very many, who take upon them
to use it without Understanding, Affection, right disposition of heart, and the
Name of Jesus Christ, in which it should be offered.</p>
               <p>Our Blessed Saviour taught us first to supplicate,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> then to deprecate; and to
supplicate first for spirituall, then for temporall blessings. The spirituall are
three:</p>

                  <item>1. The Hallowing of his Name.</item>
                  <item>

                  <item>3. The Doing of His Will.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And though these seem to tend onely unto Gods glory, yet they end in mans
benefit, and good.</p>
               <p>The first is, <hi>Hallowed Be Thy Name;</hi> which may be understood so as to be a
<hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>xologie,</hi> or a Petition. In the former sense, they ascribe unto God, all glory
honour, power, and Blisse for evermore. In the latter sense as they are a
Petition, and so usually taken, we must first consider the meaning of the words;
Wherein we have,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Name of our heavenly Father.</item>
                  <item>2. The Hallowing of it.</item>
                  <item>3. Our Petition that it may be Hallowed.</item>
               </list>
               <p>By Name is meant, the Majesty, and the supreame, and universall, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
power of God, whereby he is King of Kings, Lord of Lords, and the
onely God; to whom alone all Glory, Honour, Praise, and Worship are for
ever due from all both Men and Angels, and that in the highest degree. For
his Name is above all Names: and there is an infinit distance between him so
far above, and all other things even the most excellent so far below. This
Name, and this Power, this Excellent Majesty, and Supreme Dominion doth
presuppose his glorious perfections, and his eminent acts. The Hallowing of
this Name is not to make it more Holy, or excellent then in it self it is; For
that cannot be done: There is no degree above the highest, no addition to
that which is infinite. To Hallow it therefore must be something else: And
it is to know, and acknowledge it to be such as it is. This cannot be done ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be manifested: and it's manifested in his glorious works, and especially
in his blessed word. To know it thus manifested, and to acknowledge him
the onely supreme Lord with all humility and reverence, and to subject our
selves as nothing in our selves, wholly unto him is to hallow, glorify, and
magnify the same: For all these words signify the same thing. For to sanctify
is to acknowledge Him to be excellent; to glorify, is, to acknowledge him as
glorious; to magnify, is, to acknowledge him as great. Yet, it's not sufficient to
acknowledge him as excellent, glorious, great, but he must be acknowledged as
most excellent, most glorious, and the greatest, and we must wholly submit our
selves to him as such, not onely as Creatour, and Preserver, but Redeemer. To
petition for this Hallowing of his Name, is to request</p>
               <p>1. That as he hath already, so he would continue to manifest his name more
and more, not onely unto us, but unto all others; not onely by his word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
from Heaven, and by his former works, but by new, and glorious
works, so that his very enemies may acknowledge that he alone is God, and
that his name is most excellent, and that he rules in Heaven, and earth. His
name hath bin manifested to others; it hath bin manifested to us; and may be
manifested to them that are unborn. It hath bin manifested much, it may be
manifested more. It hath bin Hallowed by others, and much too; We pray
it may be Hallowed by us, and by us more, and more. It's manifest to all by
the works of Creation, and preservation, and generall government of the
World, but not by his Gospell, and the Work of Redemption, as it is to us.
Yet many do not know his name, though manifested; many know it but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly,
and not as they should; and might do; Many know it more then
others, yet do not acknowledge it, as they should do, and submit unto it. And
they who in this life know it most, do not acknowledge it, and submit unto it
perfectly: Therefore there is great need to pray continually that this Name
may be Hallowed by us, by all, and that perfectly; which duty will not fully
be performed by us, till we see him face to face in glory. Yet in this vale of
teares we may cry <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is,
and is to come;</hi> and cast our selves, and lye at his Throne, giving all Glory,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64164:144"/>
Honour, and Power, to <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> for evermore. In this
we pray for the confusion of <hi>Atheists,</hi> Idolaters, which either do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him at all, or not alone; and of all Men and Devils, which shall usurp this
power and, glory and arrogate it to themselves.</p>
               <p>The second petition is,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> 
                  <hi>Thy Kingdome Come:</hi> wherein, that Gods Name
might be the more Hallowed and Glorified, we pray that he would exercise
his supreme and universall power, especially in the Spiritual government of
mankind, that all his enemies may be subdued, and his Loyall, and obedient
subjects may obtain full, and everlasting peace, and safety. For this is the
principall end of the comming of his Kingdome, and his Kingdome comes
when he Reigns. This Kingdome is not that generall providence of God
whereby he orders all things to their ends; nor the civil government of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in their severall Common-weales, though both be subordinate unto this;
but the speciall government of God-Redeemer in Christ, by which man is orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to his finall and eternall estate. This Kingdom and Reign of God began
betimes, even presently upon the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and was still coming unto that
very day, when our Saviour did teach his disciples to pray, <hi>Thy Kingdome Come.</hi>
It was come before, and a great part of this Reign was past, but for the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
and most excellent manner it was then to come. <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, Christ
himself, his Apostles, and Disciples by his direction did preach, that the
Kingdome of God was at hand: which did imply that the more eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and glorious manner was not yet come, though not far off. And when
he had finished his work of humiliation, was risen again, ascended into Heaven,
and set at the right hand of God, invested with an Universall Regall power,
and confirmed in his everlasting Priesthood, then this Kingdome was come:
and he began to Reign gloriously, and God in and by him began to order, and
administer his spirituall, and eternall kingdome, so as he never did before.
Then the rod of his Scepter went out of <hi>Sion,</hi> and he Reigned in the midst of
his enemies; he enlarged the borders of his Dominion, and he made all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
his territory. This is the Kingdom of the <hi>Messias,</hi> so much spoken of, by all
the Prophets; so much desired, so much longed for, so long expected by
Kings, and Prophets, who lived not to see it. This is the Kingdome in a
Speciall, and strict manner, which they were then taught to pray for, and in
such a manner, as that neither we now, not they, after Christ began to rule at
his Father's right hand, could pray for. Yet because Christ did onely then begin
to Reign, and He must Reign till his enemies be made his foot-stool, and all
his adversaries, even death the last be subdued, and destroyed, and this is not
yet done, therefore they might then after Christ's exaltation, and we must now,
pray that he would continue to Rule by his word, his spirit, his speciall power
till that which was promised be accomplished; that so that great design of God,
which was, the totall, and perpetuall ruine of Sathans Kingdom, and the full,
and finall deliverance of his Saints might take effect. There be three degrees,
and Periods of this Reign. The</p>
               <p>Frist, Commenced upon the Fall of man: The</p>
               <p>2d. Upon the exaltation of Christ. And the</p>
               <p>3d. Shall follow upon the Resurrection, and last Judgment, when God
shall be all in all, and Reign perfectly without any enemy, without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
This we pray for here, as that special and spiritual Kingdom, which
is distinguished from the civil government of temporall States, opposed to the
Kingdom of darknesse, of Sin, Sathan, Death. It's called in Scriptures the
Kingdome of God, the Kingdome of Heaven, the Kingdom of Light, the
Kingdom of Christ, the Kingdom of Grace, the <hi>Vniversal,</hi> and <hi>Eternall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:64164:144"/>
The King is God,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> not merely as Creatour, and Preserver of the World: but
as Redeemer who since Christs Exaltation Reigns by him in Heaven, and Earth,
as by his Administratour-generall. Heaven is the place of his speciall residence,
his glorious pallace, and his Royal throne. His Territory is the World; His
speciall subjects, men Redeemed by the blood of Christ; His Lawes, the Rules
of the Gospel, to direct mans obedience; with promises, and threats, which are
the standard of his judgments. The eternall holy Spirit is his power. His
Judgments are spirituall, and eternall rewards, and punishments: with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
and bodily thereunto subordinate. And because men are found in the
Kingdom of darknesse, and under the power of Sathan; they are reduced by
the word and spirit unto subjection: Which is a work of great, and most free
mercy. The word and Laws must be made known outwardly by man, and then
written in the heart by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>In this government, he doth exercise his severe justice, his greatest power, his
choisest wisdome, and his sweetest mercy in the highest degree. This Kingdom
comes unto a people, when God graciously vouchsafeth to give them the word;
Sacraments, Ministers, and all the meanes of conversion, with a promise in the
word, of his Spirit, to make this (used) effectual. He continues it with them,
whilst he continues these meanes, and doth not take away his spirit; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them up to a reprobate mind, so that the things that concern their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
peace are not eternally hid from their eyes. It comes close, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
when God by these meanes, made efficacious by his spirit, destroyes the
dominion of sin, and dispossesseth Sathan. It's then consummate, when sin is
wholly destroyed, and the person made fully subject, and perfectly obedient to
his eternall Sovereign. It's consummate to the Universall Church, upon the
execution of the final judgment; It's principally with in us, and established in
our hearts by God, when he there to Reigns, as first to take away the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then, in the end, the very existence (as I may so call it) of sin. For it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
by degrees; and sin doth first cease to Reign then to Be in us. This
government therefore is an act of God Redeemer in Christ, giving all things,
doing all things necessary, sufficient, effectuall, for our Conversion, confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
perseverance, and consummation, as he hath promised; and, by promise
bound himself to us. So that in this Petition we pray for, and humbly seek
of God his Word, his Sacraments the Ministery of the Gospel, Christian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
Discipline, pious Magistrates, the gifts and graces of the spirit, the
continuance, and good successe of these; the ordering of all things for the
good of the Church; the conversion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the reducement of all Nations
to subjection unto Christ, justification the continuance, and perfection of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
the first fruits of the spirit of joy, and comfort, the destruction of the
Kingdom of Sathan and Antichrist, and all enemies of his truth, and our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for the comming of Christ, the Resurrection of the last judgment, the
execution of it in the eternall glorification of his Saints, and perdition of their
enemies. That God by Christ hath thus far reigned in the World, in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in our hearts, is a matter of thanksgiving, and a benefit never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>

               </list>
               <p>By Will is not meant the essence of God, nor his Decrees, but the Lawes of
his spirituall kingdom, wherein he requires Subjection, and Obedience, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:64164:145"/>
Faith, good works, and these to be performed to him as Lord Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
by Christ Jesus. To do this will, is to be really, and sincerely subject
and obedient, in avoyding all sins prohibited; and doing all good Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Laws of his Kingdome, having a speciall eye to the rewards promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and the punishments threatned. The manner how this duty is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
is set down by prescribing a <hi>Pattern in Heaven.</hi> It's true that the Starrs
of Heaven do continually, and constantly in their motion observe their order
fixed unto them in Creation. Yet this is far short, though something it be, and
they continually accuse us of disobedience, and exorbitancy, seeing they have
followed strictly, and precisely, the rule of Creation from the first time of their
Being, but we are exorbitant, and continually wander: The will of God is
done in an higher degree, and more excellently by the Angels, those blessed
and immortall spirits, who never sinned, and are so confirmed that they shall
never sin: For they do his commandements, <hi>Hearkening to the voyce of his
Word, Psal.</hi> 103. 20. They subject themselves wholly unto him, <hi>Whose throne is
in Heaven, and his Kingdome ruleth over all, vers.</hi> 19. They acknowledge Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

               <p>It must be our design, desire, endeavour to follow their example, till we reach,
and attain their perfection. And because we have no power to do this will in
this manner, we therefore in these words pray for Gods sanctifying, assisting and
confirming power accompanying his Word, and that we may wholly subject
our selves unto his power, and be effectually and continaully inclined and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to do his Will in all things, at all times, with all our hearts. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why this petition followes the former, and is immediately subjoyned, is
manifest: For except we subject our selves unto the power of this King, and
thus observe the Lawes of this Heavenly Kingdome: we cannot be capable of,
have any right unto, or enjoy the honour joy, peace, and happinesse of the same.
It hath very near connexion with the former petition, and therefore we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of God some mercies, which in both are the same but in different respects.
In the former we desire them so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they are such, as, without which, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Reign, and give us everlasting peace: We desire here the same things as
necessary, and without which we cannot performe our duty in observing his
Laws, which is the condition of the rewards promised: By them we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our fall, depravation, inability, the want of Gods divine Spirit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instamp
his Image upon us, and we earnestly desire his sanctifying grace to be
given and continued unto us, as without which we can do nothing. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

us this Day our Daily Bread;</hi> The order is clear: For we must first seek spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
then, temporall blessings; the one as more excellent, and necessary to
eternal life; the other is not necessary, nor so excellent. The prayer is agreeable
to our Saviours doctrine: For He that taught us to pray first for spiritualls,
then for temporalls, taught us first to seek the Kingdome of God, and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse;
and then Food and Rayment should be added. These Earthly
things were given to preserve this bodily life, that enjoying health, Peace,
Food, Rayment, we might not be distracted in the service of our God, but
chearfully seek eternall life in Heaven? Earthly things are given to seek Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly;
and the seeking of Heavenly blessings, first, is the right and ready way
to obtain Earthly. Therefore to seek temporalls fust, and more, is preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:64164:145"/>
and a perverting of the order prescribed by our Saviour, both for our

peace, good government Civil, and all things necessary for a comfortable life,
that we may seek a better. It's opposed to famine, nakednesse, sicknesse poverty,
war, captivity, unreasonable times, and all such things as make our life uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,
and miserable. And we are taught by this word, not to desire, or seek
riches, daintyes, or superfluities. This bread is called <hi>(Our daily Bread)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we need it every day; it's suitable to, and agreeable to our bodily nature,

By <hi>(This Day)</hi> we may understand the present time: For we must not distract
our minds by seeking these earthly things, immoderately, or inordinately. We
seek them immoderately, when we seek abundance, or seek them too eagerly,
or take into our thoughts too much of future times, which are uncertain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

it cannot seed us. And these words imply further, that we have a Father in

The matter of it is some evil, which either lyes upon us, or we are subject unto:
For since the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> this kind of petition is needfull. The evils which we
deprecate arise from many causes, and are all reduced to the evils of sin, or
affliction. The evil of sin is either of guilt, or of temptation: for it's either past,
and so the guilt lyes upon us; or to come, and so we are in danger of it, may
be tempted to it, and so overcome. And first we are taught to deprecate the
guilt of sin past in these words.</p>
               <p>Forgive us our Trespasses, as we forgive them that Trespasse against us.
In <hi>Mathew,</hi> Forgive us our Debts. In <hi>Luke,</hi> Forgive us our
Sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:64164:146"/>
That we may understand what we in these words are taught to ask of God,
we must know.</p>

               </list>
               <p>The evil is sin, which makes us guilty, in making us such. Sin (as you heard
before) is a disobedience to Gods law; it displeaseth God, who hates it, and
makes the party sinning, both liable to temporall, spiritual, and eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For he that shall offend God as a Law-giver, may justly be punisht by
him as a Judge. Sins are called Trespasses, because God by them may be said to
suffer dammage, and his glory due to him from his subject is impaired; though
not in it self, yet in respect of us, and if satisfaction be not made we must suffer.
The expression is from the <hi>Chaldy</hi> and <hi>Syriack</hi> languages, in which the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Chôb</hi> signifies to sin, to offend God, to do wickedly, and sometimes to
contract a debt. And whosoever sins, instantly and immediately he becomes
a debter, and owes a punishment unto God, which he is bound to suffer, and
must suffer when it pleaseth the supreme Judge to inflict it, if it be not some
wayes prevented. The substantive of this verb doth sometimes signifie debt,
but often sin, and guilt. One Evangelist (as you heard) calls it debt, another
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, yet by sin is meant guilt, whereby a man is a debter, and bound to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     </gap>an,</hi> not digesting and approving Christ's satisfaction takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
from the word (debts) used in <hi>Mathew</hi> to assert that sins are debts, and
the obligation contracted by them is <hi>(obligatio credita):</hi> whereas 'tis <hi>(obligatio
criminis)</hi> as may easily appear from the whole tenure of the Scripture, and even
from this place. Whether they do this ignorantly or wilfully, I know not, but
if ignorantly, they are grossely ignorant: For though sins are called debts, and
such debts as arise from contracts, and may be remitted by a free acquittance,
yet they are but so called Metaphorically. Yet no man can prove out of this
place that they are so called in that sense, but rather the contrary, if we through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examin the words. To forgive or remit sin is to take away the guilt, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to punishment: and this it is properly, and in strict sense: and the
word remit doth inform us, and teach us that it is so: and so far as the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is remitted, so far sin is pardoned, and no further. If it be wholly remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the party guilty is wholly freed; but if the remission of the obligation be
but in part, as it may be, the pardon is not full, and consummate. And it's not
to be doubted, but if the obligation may be remitted in part, and by degrees, and
is so many times, and not wholly at an instant <hi>(Simul &amp; Semel).</hi> And so far
as a guilty person is freed by the supreme Judge from the guilt, so far he is freed
from the punishment, either present, and lying upon him, by removall; or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by prevention. And a judge, or a party offended may pardon either,
<hi>(ex nuda voluntate)</hi> without requiring any satisfaction, or upon satisfaction
given, and accepted: And the satisfaction may be made, either by the party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending,
or some other substituted, and accepted. The forgivenesse or pardon,
we here pray for is granted upon satisfaction made unto divine justice, not by
the sinner, but by Jesus Christ, substituted, and accepted by God. Yet this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
must be acknowledged, and pleaded in the Court of Heaven, by the
sinner confessing, repenting believing in Christ, not onely making satisfaction
on earth by his blood, but pleading his blood as a Propi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iation in Heaven. And
here forgivenesse, Pardon, Remission, sparing, not imputing, justifying are all
one. By this discourse we understand what Forgivenesse is. The Party that
forgives sin is our Heavenly Father. And it is an act of God, not as Law-giver
but as Judge, yet not of him as Judge according to the law of works given to
man at his Creation, but according to the law of Redemption. Whereas some
think, that pardon is not the act of a Judge, as a Judge, they surely meane it of
an inferiour Judge bound to passe judgment according to the Law in force.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:64164:146"/>
Otherwise, a Judge Supream, and above Law, may pardon, and as a Judge: for
Pardon, actively considered, is a Sentence. The reason why a subordinate Judge,
by Commission, cannot pardon, is not because he is a Judge; but because he is a
Judge limited by his Commission, which is not essential, but accidental to a
Judge. Yet Absolution, which declares a man to be innocent upon Proof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may
be an Act of an inferiour Jurisdiction. But howsoever it be in <hi>Humane Courts,</hi>
yet it's certain that Justification by Faith in Christ, opposed in the Scripture to
Condemnation, is a Sentence, according to the Law of Redemption in force:
Yet in many things, it differs from all <hi>Humane Judgments,</hi> and is called <hi>Pardon,</hi>
because the party pardoned is guilty, and unjust in himself; and it's called <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,</hi>
because the party pardoned, is just in Christ. God onely being the
Supream Law-giver, and Judge, can forgive sin, in proper sense; yet He may use
the Ministery of others, in doing this, according to that measure of Jurisdiction,
He shall derive unto them: Yet as He never gave either Men or Angels infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Knowledge, to know the secrets of men's hearts, not power to inflict, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
Spiritual Judgments; so He never gave them Authority, ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>olutely, to
forgive sin, or pronounce Sentence in their own name: For it's onely valid and
irrevocable, so far as He shall by His own Name make it such. Yet this Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is an Act of God, as merciful, yet just, and as sitting in the Throne of Grace,

               <p>6. Ready to forgive others, who have offended and wronged him. This forgiving
others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is an act of private Jurisdiction; for so the power of a private man, to
pass by offences done unto himself may be truly called. Yet this Pardon cannot
free him from the punishment due unto him, either by the Law of God, or Men,
if God or Man proceed to Judgment against him. By this Petition, when we
say, <hi>Forgive us our sins,</hi> we acknowledge our selves, and others, for whom we
pray, to be guilty: and, by this Confession, we accuse our selves as guilty;
justifie God, if He should condemn us; magnifie His Mercy, if He pardon
us. It must be made with a bleeding heart, and godly sorrow, that we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
so just, so holy, so good and merciful a Father; with great humility, and
importunity, not onely for our selves, but others: and because we daily sin, we
must daily pray, <hi>Lord forgive us our trespasses.</hi> We must not mention our own
merits, righteousness, good works: for all righteousness and merit in our
selves must be renounced, otherwise we lose the cause. And if we from our hearts
do not forgive others, we plead against our selves, and cannot obtain pardon.
This is the reason why our Saviour so much mentioneth and urgeth the Duty of
forgiving others, though 77 times a day. And if we pray in this due manner,
Christ will plead, and God will pardon, and we shall depart justified. For the
most merciful God propitiated, and pressed by Christ's Intercession, cannot hide
his face long from penitent and believing sinners. His Promises, to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The second Deprecation,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIII</label> is of sin not yet committed; yet so possible, that
it may be easily committed, and there is great danger of it. The words are</p>
               <q>Lead us not into Temptation;</q>
               <p>For because it's to little purpose to be pardoned, and freed from the guilt of
sin past, if we continually return to sin again and so contract a new guilt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Saviour taught us daily to tender this Petition to our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For if we were in Heaven, all former sins pardoned; yet if we were not
fully freed from the danger of sinning again, we could not be fully happy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we could not be fully secur'd in that estate of holiness and bliss. God, in
his abundant mercy in Christ, doth not pardon sin-past, with any intention to
give us liberty to sin again, that Grace may abound, and that we may make new
Work for Mercy. When He hath once healed and restored us, He saith unto us,
as Christ did to the impotent man, whom He had healed at the Pool of <hi>Bethes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,
Behold thou art made whole; Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee,</hi>
Joh. 5. 14. <hi>For we are delivered out of the hands of all our Enemies, to serve him

For as we have engaged our selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so it must be our special care to observe, and
not transgress the just and holy Laws of this Spiritual Kingdom. That we may

               <p>Temptation, morally and strictly taken, may be said to be any thing which
unduceth and moveth us to sin, as of it's own Nature tending thereunto. For
we must conceive Temptations, as in themselves, tending directly to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oduce, or
cause actual sins. Yet because many times they are not onely resist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
they are like Attempts Assaults Endeavours, which aim at sin, yet do not
always take effect. They may be actual causes of sin, yet sometimes are not,
sometimes are essicients thereof. A Temptation may be called not merely a
thing but an act. <hi>Binsfield</hi> the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ffragan of <hi>Triers,</hi> defines it to be, <hi>Assimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
Boni ad fallendum.</hi> His meaning is, that it is a Representation of a thing, as
good, though it be evil, to incline us to it; or of something that is good, as evil,
to restrain us from it. And the end of it is to deceive the party tempted. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Will of Man is so created of God, that it neither can be forced, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to sin, not approve, like, chuse, desire, love, consent unto anything re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
and apprehended as e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>il; therefore every Tempter goes about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
the apprehension, pervert the Judgment, corrupt the Will, and so entice,
incline, and incite it freely unto evil.</p>
               <p>The great Tempter is the Devil,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIV</label> an implacable and eternal Enemy to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of God's Kingdom. And if he can perswade them to sin, and to transgress
the Laws of their Soveraign he knows he doth them a mischief: Because upon
their obedience, depends their Eternal Peace and Welfare. He knows our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
Inclinations, Frailties, and Imperfections. He observes our security
and negligence, and takes all advantages against us, as being active, restless, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
strong, vigilant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> raging, and malicious; ever seeking, not onely our Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
but Eternal Ruine. The danger from him is the greater, because of his
boldness, in that he durst attempt our Saviour the Son of God; and of his success,
in that he prevailed not onely against <hi>Sampson, David, Solomon, Peter,</hi> and other
great Worthies, but also against <hi>Adam</hi> Innocent. He tempts man sometimes
immediately, and that either invisibly, or visibly by some Form or Bodily
Shape assumed; wherein he appears to Man, as once he abused the <hi>Serpent,</hi> to
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64164:147"/>
deceive <hi>Eve.</hi> Yet often he doth his cursed Works by others mediately; and his
most effectual Instruments are the wicked of the <hi>world,</hi> who, by their evil example
bad Custom, false Doctrine, pernicious Counsels, impious and unjust Laws, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Judgments, Perswasions, Menaces, Promises, Persecutions, Gifts, Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and other ways, restraining thousands from doing good, stirring them up,
and inclining them to evil. He also takes advantage from the Sensitive Part,
from the Ignorance of the Understanding the Depravation of the Will, the Flesh
lusting against the Spirit, and rebelling not onely against the Dictates of right
Reason, but the Illuminations and Motions of the Spirit; and from the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of our Passions, and Vehemency of our inordinate Affection. The more
of Flesh and Lust is in us, the stronger he is against us; because we carry in our
Bosome, nay, in our Bowels, a treacherous Enemy, ready to confederate with
him, and betray us unto him, and so makes our selves to tempt our selves. <hi>For
Man is tempted of himself, when he is drawn away of his own Lust and enticed,</hi> Jam.
1. 14. Thus you understand, in some measure, what Temptation is; and that
the parties tempting us without, are the Devil and the World; and within us,
the Flesh, and Corruption. But what is it, <hi>To be led into Temptation?</hi> It's not
merely to be tempted: for so have many been, and have not onely resisted, but
overcome the Tempter, and that sometimes with ease. And no Temptation,
except entertained, and, in some measure, consented unto, can do us any hurt.
And whatsoever God, by His Almighty Power, may do; yet neither Man, or
Devil, can necessitate us to sin. To be led, or brought into temptation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
is so to be tempted, as that there is great danger we shall be overcome. For
if we be surprized, found neither watching, nor armed, nor any way prepared
for Defence; or if we be weak, and the Temptation violent, and above our
strength; or if we be deserted, and left destitute of help, and sufficient assistance;
or if Divine Providence leave us circumvented, so that there is no ways to
escape, then are we led into Temptation, and shall hardly escape.</p>
               <p>The thing,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XV</label> therefore, prayed for, is, <hi>Not to be led into Temptation.</hi> It's not, that
God would not suffer us to be tempted at all at any time; but that He would be
pleased, when He sees us weak, and not able to stand, either to divert it, or delay
it, and so, for the time, to prevent it: Or, if that it be His Will, that we must be
tempted, that He would not desert us, and deny His assistance: or not suffer us
to presume, or despair: or that He restrain the violence of the Tempter, and
abate the strength of the Temptation, or proportion it to our strength, and our
strength to it, lest it prove Superiour; so that though the Temptation be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinued
long, be violent and extraordinary, we may have great, and extraordinary
power and assistance, not onely to resist, but conquer: or that He would make
a way to escape; and that He would never suffer us to be secure, but stir us up,
that we may be ever watchful. In a word, we pray for clearness of Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
soundness of Judgment, integrity of Heart, a great measure of Confidence
and Prudence in Heavenly Things, and all the Graces of the Spirit; strong Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
against Sin, constancy in the profession and practice of His Truth, power
over Passions and Affections, Noble and Divine Affections; so that we may be
above the fears and desires of the World, whereby men are intangled in the
snares of Sathan, his continual care and assistance, until the very hour of Death,
and that in our hardest and extream Conflicts, He would stand at our right
hand, perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle us, and shortly tread Sathan under our
feet, that so we may obtain a final Victory, and the state of safety and security,
wherein we shall never be in danger of sin, and temptation any more. We
ought to be the more earnest and fervent in this Petition, because we know our
own weakness, the strength and violence of temptation, the sad condition of
such as are foyled the glory, joy, and comfort of the Victory: And this is our
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:64164:148"/>
great advantage, that Christ hath overcome the World, cast out the Prince of
Darkness; and being tempted, and that violently, himself, He pities us the more,
and hath the greater care of us. Yet <hi>Importunity</hi> will little avail us, except we
stand continually upon our Watch, strongly armed with the compleat Armour
of God, use the strength God hath given us, take all opportunity to do good,
avoid the causes and occasions of sin; not presume upon our own power, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
rely upon God, be patient, and continue fighting, defend our selves, and resist
the Enemy unto Death: and if we be sometimes worsted, and wounded; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
renew our Repentance and Faith, return unto the Fight again, with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Care, and stronger Resolutions, make no Truce with the Enemy, give him
no respight, never faint, nor intermit the War, till Sin be fully and finally sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
in us.</p>
               <p>The words of this Petition do seem to imply, that God doth lead us some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
into temptation; and the expression seems strange: <hi>For God cannot be
tempted with evil, neither tempteth He any man,</hi> Jam. 1. 13. Therefore we must
understand the words so, As</p>
               <p>1. In no wise to think, that God doth, or can move, or induce any man to sin:
for this cannot any ways stand with His purest Holiness, nor with His most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Law.</p>
               <p>2. Yet because nothing can be done, or come to pass, without His Divine
Providence, either effecting, or permitting, or ordering, therefore, God may be
said to lead into temptation, because He either permits us to be tempted, and
neither restrains the Tempter, nor prevents the Temptation: For if a Sparrow
fall not to the ground, much less is Man tempted without His Will and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>3. God doth put a Man in such a condition, as wherein He shall be tempted,
and the condition it self is such, as no ways in it self tends unto sin; yet through
Man's Negligence, or Corruption, may be a great occasion of Temptation: And
so He may be said to tempt, <hi>per accidens.</hi> An estate of Peace and Wealth is
good; yet such is the subtilty of Sathan, and the corruption of Man, that few in
that condition, but are tempted and overcome.</p>
               <p>4. God may be said to lead us into temptation, when He, for some just can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
denies us deliverance from, and out of the same: For desertions, denial of
assistance strength, and a competent Superiour Degree of both, are many times
just Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gments of God.</p>
               <p>5. God many times brings his own Children into an estate of Temptation
on purpose to try their Faith, and excellent Vertues, and so gives them a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Victory. Yet we must know, that God necessitates no Man to sin; and, if in
temptation we be overcome, it's not His, but our own fault.</p>
               <p>The last Petition is,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XVI</label> 
                  <hi>Deliver us from evil:</hi> Some understand this as a branch
of the former Petition, as indeed it may be in some sense: For suppose it to be
meant of the evil of afflictions; yet even these are called Trials and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 2. and Satan, from these, takes occasion, and sometimes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
from them to tempt us. <hi>Job</hi>'s afflictions, as from Sathan, were temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Some understand by that word, <hi>Evil,</hi> Sathan, that great Enemy, and terrible
Adversary. Some say that, that <hi>Evil is the evil of Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as though we should
say unto our Heavenly Father, <hi>Though thou suffer us to be tempted, yet deliver us
from the evil of temptation, which is Sin.</hi> Yet the evil of Affliction, Tribulation,
Persecution, and the Misery of this life is not in it self sin: though Satan, and
wicked men, may seek by these to draw us to sin. And whether they be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(according to the fifth Petition) for former sins; or chastisements, and
corrections for future Reformation, or Trials of our Faith and Patience; yet we
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64164:148"/>
must pray, that God would sanctifie us in them, sanctifie them unto us, and
wholly, and for ever, deliver us from them, seeing God hath promised to wipe
away all tears, and make all things new. For they are not good in themselves,
though He, by His Wisdom, turn them to our good. But we cannot be fully
happy, till wholly freed from them.</p>
               <p>After the Preface, and the Body of the Prayer, wherein our Saviour teacheth
us by whom, for whom, to whom, in what manner, for what things we must
pray and give thanks, follows the Conclusion in these words;</p>
               <q>For thine is the Kingdom, Power, and Glory.</q>
               <p>Concerning these words,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XVII</label> divers things are to be noted:</p>
               <p>1. That as <hi>Grotius,</hi> and divers others have observed, they are not found in the
most ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Copies in <hi>Matthew,</hi> as they are not mentioned in
<hi>Luke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Yet they are found in the <hi>Arabick, Syriack,</hi> and <hi>Vulgar Latine</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations:
whereupon He conceives those Translations to be made after the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies
of the Churches were brought unto a certain Form.</p>
               <p>3. Some understand these words, so as to contain certain Reasons whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we ought to press our Petitions before the Throne of Grace, and so move
Him to give them. For His is the Kingdom, which they desire to come; His
Power alone, which can effect these things; and the granting of them tends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and will end in His Glory. We may observe in the Prayers of the Scripture,
that God's Saints did urge and press their Petitions upon God'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Mercy, His Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
His Power and Glory, His place of Universal Judge, His Promise and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
the Justice of their Cause, the Iniquity and Cruelty of their Enemies,
their misery and sad condition, their joy and comfort, which would follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Deliverance, their Relation to Him, His former Favours, and such
like. And with these they added Solemn Vows of Reformation, Praise and
Thanksgiving.</p>
               <p>4. They may be understood as a <hi>Doxologie,</hi> with which the Apostles, and the
Church did use to conclude their Prayers. And hereof we have many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
especially in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and in ancient <hi>Liturgies,</hi> following the
Scriptures. And as the <hi>Preface,</hi> and the words thereof spoken unto God, with
humble A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>ence, by it, to make way for our Prayers; so a <hi>Doxologie</hi> is a very fit
<hi>Valediction,</hi> when we have ended our Prayers, and depart (as it were) from His
Presence.</p>
               <p>5. This <hi>Doxologie</hi> doth agree, in general, with others in the Scripture; but
it's not to distinct and particular, as many of them be, which offer and ascribe
prai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or unto Christ, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16. or to God, and the Lamb Christ Jesus, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. 13.
That <hi>Doxologie, Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost</hi> &amp;c.
was very agreeable to the Scriptures, very ancient, the Epitome of all other
<hi>Doxologies;</hi> and so a <hi>Doxologie,</hi> that it was a Confession of our Faith, in God the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. This seems to be essential to Prayer, and to be
either implyed, or expressed in every Prayer.</p>
               <p>The word, <hi>Amen,</hi> is the Epitome of the Prayer, summing up the whole, and

                  <label type="milestone">

of Obedience in Precepts and Prohibitions: It remains, that we speak of
it, and consider it, as a Rule of God's Judgment, in Promises and Threatnings.
By Precepts, God binds Man; by Promises, He binds Himself. Before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
one thing formerly omitted, is to be added: That some Precepts of this
Law are mixt, and are partly Moral, partly positive: as Faith, and Repentance,
considered in their general Nature, as Duties, to be performed to God, are Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
For Faith, whether it be assent unto the Truth of God's Word, or a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
upon Him, promising any Reward or Benefit: Repentance, as it includes
materially in it subjection to God, as Supream Lord; and Obedience unto His
Commands, are Duties of the Moral Law, as Moral. But as Faith assents unto
the Truths of the Word concerning Jesus Christ, and relies upon God's Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in Christ, and Repentance, as it's a Return unto <hi>God-Redeemer</hi> in Christ, as
atoned by his Bloud, and so made propitious, may be said to be positive, as the
Objects of both are positive, and above the Law of Nature, as those positives,
which are Ceremonial, are below it. But to return to the Law, as a Rule of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we must enquire into</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Nature of Promises, and Threats in general.</item>
                  <item>2. The Order of this part of Divine Laws.</item>
                  <item>3. The particular Nature of these Promises and Threats in the Laws
<hi>God-Redeemer.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1. For the Nature of Promises, and then of Threats. The Object of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
is, <hi>Bonum suturum,</hi> For we cannot promise evil, but good; at least, that
which is conceived to be good: neither can we properly be said, to promise
good past, or present. The act of a promise, is a voluntary Obligation, whereby
the party promising, doth bind himself unto another, for to do, or give some
good unto the foresaid party. All promises are voluntary, otherwise they are
not promises. The effect of them, in respect of the party promising, is Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
in respect of the party to whom the promise is made, some kind of right
unto the thing promised. To threaten, is to signifie to another, that we intend
to do him some hurt, or evil. The Object is</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Evil:</hi> For we cannot properly threaten good.</item>
                  <item>2. It's evil to come; otherwise, it's <hi>actual hurt,</hi> or punishment.</item>
                  <item>3. It presupposeth some intention, or resolution, to do hurt, or inflict
evil.</item>
                  <item>4. It signifies by words, or other signs, this intention; as Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<list>
                        <item>1. Presuppose some intention to do good.</item>

               </list>
               <p>I will not here spend time, in the enumeration of the Accidents, or Adjuncts
of these Promises, to shew how they are private, or publike, annexed to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of the Law, or not; absolute, or conditional; made by Superiours, Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
Equals; feigned, or unfeigned; the Promises of such as have power to
make them, and also strength to perform them, or of such as have nor. I also pass
by the accidental distinctions of Threats; which word, some think, comes of
<hi>Terreo,</hi> to terrifie. There are Promises, and Threats of Man, and of God. These
are of God, annexed to His Precepts, and Prohibitions, as a Rule of Man's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:64164:149"/>
And, in this respect, they differ from other Promises, and
Threats.</p>
               <p>The Order of these,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> in this Government of God-Redeemer, is very evident:
For,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. They are referred to that part of Government, which is concerning
Laws.</item>
                  <item>2. In Laws they follow that part, which in Precepts, and Prohibitions,
is a Rule of Obedience.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For, as the Law considered, as a Rule of Judgment, presupposeth something
before in it, as a Rule of Obedience: So these Promises relate unto the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
observed; as the Threats consider them as violated, This is the Order
determined by God, to manifest His Justice, in His Retribution of Rewards, and
punishments: and hereby He signifies, that though He be much inclined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and do good; yet He will judge onely the Obedient, a fit Subject of His
Bounty and Rewards. They that are just, and obey His Laws, and they onely
shall live, and enjoy His Mercies. And he never threatens, as He never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
punishments, but upon demerit of the Disobedient. For He never puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
any, but such as violated just Laws; neither did ever intend it, or signifie His
intention otherwise.</p>
               <p>The particular and distinct Nature of these Promises,<label type="milestone">

thing to be considered. They agree with the Promises, and Comminations of
the Law of Works in Creation, with the Law also given to <hi>Israel</hi> from God, by
<hi>Moses,</hi> both in that they are Promises, and Threats of God; and also because
they are annexed to the Precepts, as a Rule of Obedience. These likewise, as
well as those, may be called <hi>Sanctions,</hi> as added to the Precepts, for to enforce
the Obedience. For the Promises are mighty Motives, and powerfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade,
to the Observation, as Threatnings restrain from the violation of the
Precepts. And both these were so much the more effectual, because there is

               <p>1. Unjust and unworthy.</p>
               <p>2. Derive their power to perform the Conditions and Precepts of the Law
from the Redeemer, upon the merit of Christ, having satisfied God's Justice;
whereas the Promises of the Law of Works, presupposed man to have power to
keep it given in Creation, and required perfect and perpetual obedience by
that power. And if man once lost that power, there was no promise in that
Law of restoring it again, or giving new power. It's said, <hi>Do this and live:</hi> Sin
in the least, and die. And so it bound to perfect and perpetual performance, or
unto death, as unavoidable by that Law: for there was no promi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Law of <hi>Moses</hi> did strictly command universal and constant obedience: for
<hi>Cursed is he that continueth not,</hi> saith the Law, <hi>in all things written in that Book:</hi> it
promised no Spiritual Blessing, no Spiritual power, nor Spiritual pardon.</p>
               <p>As for the Threats of this Law, they make Offenders liable punishment;
yet they determine Eternal Death, as unavoidable to none offending, but to final

onely do, yet He was willing, by Promises, to bind Himself, to reward him
gloriously, and after he had lost his power, to send Christ to redeem him, and
give him a new power and first to promise to give him excellent Rewards, and,
in the end, actually to reward him for Christs sake, with full, and everlasting
glory, and that upon easie, and fairest terms. For this cause is his Mercy so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
magnified in the Scriptures, and especially in the Gospel. Therefore is it
said, That God who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith He loved us,
even then when we were dead in sins, He quickned us (by Grace we are saved)
and raised us up together, and made us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that in the Ages to come, He might shew the exceeding Riches of His Grace,
in His kindness towards us, through Christ Jesus, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6 7. And it was
His great mercy, that He doth threaten no sinners and offenders with punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
unavoidable, or unremoveable, but final Impenitents, and Unbelievers
as such. From all this His Promises may be described to be, A part of the Laws
of <hi>God-Redeemer,</hi> whereby He freely bound Himself, and did signifie, that for
Christ's sake, He would give all Mercies to Man believing, that may make him
for ever fully blessed. And his Threats are, A signification of His Will, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

upon certain conditions; and onely unremoveable, or unavoidable

the Fall, to give Christ. And this was fully performed in the fulness of time,
and so to us it's no Promise: and this was not made in consideration of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and satisfaction of Christ, and did at first include a Promise to call and afford
the means of Conversion. The rest of the Promises were grounded upon the
Satisfaction and Merit of Christ, and were better Promises then those of the
Law of Works. And they are better, not onely in respect of the things p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some tell us,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> that the Gospel threatens not any sin with Death, but final Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief:
And hereupon ariseth a Question, about the Threats of the Gospel;
Whether there be any such Threats of the Gospel, which make the Offender
liable to Death, but onely the final Unbeliever. For Solution whereof, we must
consider,</p>
               <p>1. That if the Gospel were so strictly taken, as it is by many, as to contain
and consist onely in Promises, then it would follow, that no sin, no not final un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
could be threatned with Death by the Laws of <hi>God-Redeemer,</hi> as <hi>Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. We must know, that in Scripture, by Death, is meant punishment in
general, Whether it be Temporal, or Eternal; Bodily, or Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
               <p>3. That every sin deserves Death; that is, Punishment; whether they be sins
against the Law of Works, or of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:64164:150"/>
4. That the same sins against the morall Law, which were threatned with
Death by the Law of Works, are threatned with Death by the Law of Grace.
For as that Law bound to obedience, or, upon Disobedience, unto Death; so
doth this. Yet observe,</p>
               <p>1. That the sins against the Law of grace, are sins formally against God-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
as such, and giving Laws unto sinful man.</p>
               <p>2. That these sins have not only the nature of sins, as transgressions of a Law
of God, but also the nature of impenitency, and unbelief. For whosoever
continues in sin, or delays (if but an hour) his return to God Redeemer is
not only a sinner against God, but an impenitent Sinner against God-Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in Christ, requiring repentance and faith instantly, and not granting the
liberty to continue in sin, and to delay repentance for a moment.</p>
               <p>3. Though the Law threatned every sin against it with punishment, and
death unremoveable, or unavoydable, yet the Gospel, though it threaten eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sin against it with punishment, yet it threatens none with punishment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>removeable,
or unavoyable, but finall unbelief, or such sins, as upon which,
by his ordination, finall unbelief is necessarily consequent.</p>
               <p>4. This Law of grace threatens not only sins against the morall Law, but
against the very Ceremonialls of the Gospel. How else could the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
have bin guilty of the body and blood of Christ, and have suffered so grievous
a punishment, as many of them did, for the unworthy receiving the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
The rule of this judgment was neither the Law of works as given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
nor as given to <hi>Israel</hi> either in the moralls, or positives. If any say that
Christ died not to satisfie for such sins as finall unbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ief, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ins, unto Death,
as Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, or some kind of Apostacy; it may be
said that one immediate effect of Christs death, was to satisfie Gods justice,
and make sin remissible in generall: not that it was God's intention, that all
sins or any sin should be remitted absolutely, but upon certain termes defined
by his wisdome, and justice. In this regard these sins, as sins in generall, were
made remissible by Christs Sacrifice. Yet in respect of Divine ordination, and
the termes defined for remission, they are irremissible. So that as sins, by
Christs death they are remissible; yet made irremissible, <hi>Per accidens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respect. Yet here we must observe, that not only finall unbeliefe, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency,
are sins against the Laws of Redemption, and the precepts of the
Gospel; but every degree of them from the first to the last, from the least to
the greatest, are so too. Neither is finall unbelief, merely as finall, unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but, <hi>per accidens:</hi> Because, after a certain time granted by God, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
is expired, he will never vouchsafe time, nor meanes, or power for it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
and belief he hath made a necessary condition of pardon; and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree'd
never to pardon, but upon this condition.</p>
               <p>These promises,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> or threats, may be considered either formally, or materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and in respect of their matter; and accordingly may be discovered, and
summed up in Scripture. All such places of Scripture as command, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
Repentance, and Faith, have some promise annexed; and the same either
expressed, or implyed. And to such places, these promises of God do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong. For Promises and Duties go together; and therefore in most
of the promises the duty is expressed: And they are made to persons, so, and so
qualified. Insomuch that till the person be rightly qualified, he hath no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
right unto the thing promised, nor can have any hope of performance.
For God is only bound to performe his promise; when man hath performed
his duty: This was the Wisdome of God so to make his promises, that man
might have no cause to presume, or deceive himself. The generall qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to which all these promises are annexed, is, faith and repentance. All
those places both of the Old, and new Testament which prohibit, reprove,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:64164:151"/>
dehort from impenitency, unbelief, blindnesse, and hardnesse of heart; have
some threatnings, or commination annexed, either implicitly or
expresly. And as Duty and Promise, so Impenitency, and Threatning
go together: and as the promises many times expresse the duty; so these
the sin, and the same not repented of. And as the sins not repented of are
many, so the punishments threatned are too. I might give examples, as, <hi>If ye
be willing, and obey, ye shall eat the good of the Land; but if you refuse, and rebel, ye
shall be devoured with the Sword,</hi> E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <item>2. To be willing and obdient, is, the duty, and qualification: and that's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
(as doth easily appear from the context).</item>
                  <item>3. To be devoured with the Sword, is, the punishment threatned.</item>
                  <item>4. To Refuse, and Rebel, is the sin threatned, and that's Impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>More expresly,</hi> He that believeth on him is not condemned; He that believeth
not is condemned already, <hi>&amp;c. Joh. 3. 18, &amp; 36. Yet we must</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Distinguish betwixt threatning, and peremptory denunciations upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency
continued foreseen. For those Denunciations are rather Sentences
of the Supreme judge, or predictions, then comminations of the Supreme
Lawgiver. Thus God did denounce the universall deluge; the ruine of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem;</hi>
the rejection of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. We must seperate from these promises, and threats, those which God
signified to <hi>Adam</hi> innocent: and to <hi>Israel,</hi> as a body politick in the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> till Christ was exhibited. For though these and those might gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
and materially be the same, yet specifically, and formally they were not.</p>
               <p>3. There is a difference between promises, and threatnings; in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
bind God to reward the obedient, yet threatnings do not bind him to
punish the disobedient: For by promises God doth bind himself to reward;
by threatnings he only binds man to suffer. His promise he cannot deny,
because he is faithfull and just: His threatnings signifie what man deserves, and
how he may justly punish him, and the effect thereof is this; that the party
offending is instantly liable to punishment, and bound to suffer it, though
God be not bound to inflict it. If he were bound by it in the same manner as
he is by promise, he could have no power to pardon sin; and if he must make
the Law the Rule of his judgment, and were bound so to do in the threatning,
as he is in the promise, he must needs punish every sin, and pardon no sin. But
He being slow to wrath and ready to forgive, and much inclined to mercy, He
in his wisdome thought good in his Law, so to threaten sin, as to reserve a
transcendent power above his threatnings, to shew mercy. Some threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
may be peremptory, but all are not such. He also so threatens sin, that
if man commit it, he is not bound absolutely to punish it; nor obliged to
punish it wholly or in part, instantly, upon the commission of the sin; but
hath power to deser his judgment: And hence his patience, and long-suffering,
wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by according to the Law of Redemption, he gives man time, and means
of returning, and seeks to draw him to Repentance. Yet lest any should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
and despise his threatings, he lets man know, that if he delay his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
too long, he shall in no wise escape the punishment, and there will be
a day of the Revelation of his just judgment: wherein he will powre out the
treasures of his Wrath in full measure upon impenitent Wretches; and the
more they contemned his patience, the more they shall suffer. Though God
hath power to dispence with his Law in respect of judgment threatned; yet
he hath bound himself by an eternall decree, not to spare or pardon, but upon
condition of Christs expiation, and mans repentance; for which there is a
limited time granted, wherein if we repent not, pardon will become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>

These promises in respect of the matter promised,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> may be again distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</p>
               <p>1. Into promises of blessings, or deliverances: and as both are bodily, or
spirituall, temporall or eternall, so the promises be. The Apostle assures us,
that godlinesse hath the promises of this life, and that which is to come, 1 <hi>Tim.
4.</hi> 8. And our Saviour informs us, <hi>That if we first seek the Kingdome of God,
and his Righteousnesse, then these temporall necessaries shall be added unto us,</hi> Mat.
6. 33. This is evident from Christs pattern of Prayer, wherein, as you heard
before, he taught us Supplications for good, and the same not onely Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
but temporall; and deprecations of evill, and that also both spirituall and
temporall. He promiseth the Kingdome, that's a promise of a spirituall and
eternall reward, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32. And Food and Rayment, and that's a promise
of bodily and temporall blessings, <hi>verse 31. ibid.</hi> So he hath promised to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us from temporall evils, and also from condemnation, and eternall
death. Yet</p>
               <p>1. He binds himself in these promises only to godly men, (as you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
and in them unto godly men for temporall mercies, in subordination to
spiritualls, and so far as his Divine wisdome, shall see them tending to their
eternall good. The spirituall promises are such, as whereby he bindes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to give blessings, to be received in this life, or in the life to come: in this
life, either blessings antecedent to conversion, or consequent to it: consequent
are either the state of justification upon our union with Christ, or our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of it, according to our continuance in Christ. Mercies promised for
the life to come, are either such as are <hi>Sutable</hi> to the State of Separation, or
the State of Resurrection. And there may be a distinction in respect of the
subject to whom they are made: For some are made to single persons; some
to familyes; some to whole Nations; some to mankind in generall: And some
of these are ordinary; some extraordinary. According to these heads all the
promises in Scripture might be reduced to a certain method, if some would
take paines; and it would be a profitable work.</p>

to the matter threatned, which is punishment. And seeing the punishments
are contrary to the rewards, and so the threatnings to the promises, therefore
they may receive the same distinctions, which the promises do; as to be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
or bodily, temporall or eternall: And so of the rest. For as the whole
man, body and soul, sins, and all his parts, faculties, and members participate

                  </gap>gression, severall wayes, and in severall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
so the punishments both threatned, and executed, are distinguished,
and proportioned. They may be differenced from those of the Law of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For those ranne thus; Sin, and Dye: <hi>And in the day that thou eatest
thereof, thou shalt surely dye,</hi> Gen. 2. 17. And this without any <hi>Salvô,</hi> or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
But the Law of Redemption saith, <hi>Except ye Repent, ye shall all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
perish,</hi> Luke 13. 3. They give hope of Pardon, upon condition of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and do not look at sin, merely as sin, but as sin unrepented of. The one
faith, the sinner shall dye; the other, the sinner not repenting, not believing,
shall dye. They may be distinguished in respect of the end: For some are
for destruction; some for correction and amendment: and the lesser are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and inflicted to prevent the greater, and the temporall, to turn away the
eternall. Some are exemplary to warn others; some are not. So likewise
in respect of the sins committed, they may be distinguished: for some are for
one sin; some for many sins jointly together. Some are for personall sins,
personall; others for the sins of others, as when Children become liable to
punishment for the sins of the Parents, Subjects for the sins of the Soveraign,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:64164:152"/>
and such like. They may be differenced according to the measure, which is
alwayes proportionable to the sin. Some are threatned to be inflicted in the
same kind by way of re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aliation, as when a man suffers, in that wherein he sins.
They may be distinguished according to the severall distinctions of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
For some are directed against single Persons, some against Families;
Some against whole Nations; Some against the whole World: Yet this is a
good and true observation made by many, that neither the promises, nor mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
promised are merited or deserved by sinfull man, though he repent and
believe; yet the punishments threatned, are fully deserved by man: and God
in punishing never did exceed, but rather abate: and when he afflicts most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely,
yet he doth it rather, <hi>

deserve the highest degree of punishments threatned, but not the lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of mercies promised. We must all say with good <hi>Jacob I am not worthy of
the least of all the mercies, and the truth which thou hast shewed thy servant,</hi> Gen. 32.
10. I forbear for the present, further to inlarge in the doctrine of promises
and threats, and to descend to particulars: because I shall have occasion in
my discourse of Gods judgment, to speak more particularly of rewards and
punishments, which are the matter of promises and threats, which fully inform
man of his destiny and doom, and what in judgment he must look for to his

                     <item>1. That it is not an attribute, but an Act of God.</item>
                     <item>2. An act of God Redeemer.</item>

               <p>Its not an act of acquiring Power, nor of the constitution of his kingdome,
but of the administration; and its not an act of Legislation but of jurisdiction.
The power of jurisdiction God acquired as you heard by the humiliation of
the word made flesh. It was exercised, first, before the word incarnate, by God
without any Administratour-generall: But after that our blessed Saviour was
exalted to the right hand of Majesty, He committed all judgment to the Son,
<hi>John 5. 22. To whom he had given all power both in Heaven and Earth,</hi> Mat. 27.
18. Yet in the excercise and execution of this jurisdiction, both before, and
since the exaltation of Christ, there is use made of Angels, Men, and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
This jurisdiction is supreme, Universal, Spirituall, Independent, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
according to Law. The subject upon which this jurisdiction is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
is, man, even all men, and every person from the first <hi>Adam,</hi> unto the
last Child that shall be born. The act of it is retribution of something,
for nothing; of good for good, of evil for evil. The Object of this act is the
doings or Works of man, as man, endued with understanding and <hi>Free Will:</hi>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:64164:152"/>
For it considers not the acts of man naturall as he is <hi>Vegetative,</hi> or <hi>Sensitive,</hi>
which are meerely naturall, and agreeable to the acts of Beasts, and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
These works are not meerely deeds of the executive power, but words
of the mouth, and the inward acts of the Soul: and not onely the acts, but the
moral habits, and dispositions, whether naturall or acquired; but especially ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
and dependent upon free acts. These works are an object of this act of
jurisdiction, as they are agreeable or disagreeable to some Law, and especially to
the Laws of God Redeemer: and according to these works Man is the formall
object of this retribution, and so of this judgment. The Retribution is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
               <p>1. Of punishments.</p>
               <p>2. Of rewards: For as mens works are, so their retribution shall be. If
their works be good, and they found obedient, God will render a most glorious
and excellent reward in the end, and many other inferiour besides. If their
works be evil, and they prove disobedient, their Retribution shall be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
according to their disobedience, both in quantity and quality: It shall
be, <hi>Malum triste, propter Malum turpe,</hi> or <hi>Malum incommodi, propter malum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justitiae.</hi>
Yet we must know that no reward spiritual, or eternal, is rendered
but as merited by Christ, for such as shall be rightly qualified, and capable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And because supreme Judges were never bound to formalities, and this
Judge is present in all places, at all times, knows all things, even the most hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
both fully a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d clearly, we need not here in this discourse, bind our selves
particularly, and severally, to declare the acts of convention, examination, testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes,
conviction, sentence and execution, as though these were alwayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
distinctly, and severally, and that actually. Hence we may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand the perfection of this judgment from the perfection of the
Judge: For.</p>
               <p>1. There can be no question of the jurisdiction, because the Judg
is Creatour, Preserver, and Redeemer: and his title is most clear.</p>
               <p>2. His power is universal, and none can be exempted from his jurisdiction:
all are his subjects, and his Vassals.</p>
               <p>3. It's supreme, and there can be no appeale lye from his Tribunall to a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour.</p>
               <p>4. As he is <hi>Omnipresent,</hi> so he is <hi>Omniscient,</hi> and knows all mens works, and
hearts, even the hidden things of Darknesse, and every ones Conscience shall
acknowledge every charge to be absolutely true.</p>
               <p>5. He is most just, and essentiall justice, and cannot possibly judge unjustly.
Shall not the Judge of all the World do right? saith <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. 25.
Where he acknowledgeth,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. His Universall jurisdiction: He is Judge of all the World.</item>
                  <item>2. His absolute justice; Shall He not do right? That is, certainly he
Shall.</item>
               </list>
               <p>6. His power is <hi>Almighty,</hi> and as he can easily summon all before his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Seat, even the greatest; so he can execute his judgments to the full, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in punishments or rewards. So that this Judgment is free from all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
of humane Courts, whether civil or Ecclesiasticall. This judgment
differs from that which he pass'd upon Men, and Angels at the first: For it
hath another rule, and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

another notion, and the Judge also is God as Redeemer. The obedience or
disobedience, which are the proper formall object of this judgment, are to be
measured by the Laws of Redemption: The one is faith, the other unbelief.
And these things must seriously be considered, lest we confound the several juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l; and that is, to reduce the severall judgments to their proper
places, in the Laws of God Redeemer. For as some sins are generall against all
the Laws of God: Some against the <hi>Morals;</hi> Some against the <hi>Positives;</hi>
Some against some of the <hi>Moral</hi> precepts: joyntly considered; Some against the
severall, and particular precepts accordingly the punishments might be
ranked; and the same order might be observed in the rewards. But lest we
should confound the judgments of the two severall Governments; amongst
others, two rules may be observed, whereby we may difference them: and this
difference once known, I may go on without interruption. The</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Rule is from the judgments themselves. The</item>
                  <item>2. From the Laws, and works disagreeable to these Laws.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. The judgments which fall and lye upon all mankind, indefinitely, as
<hi>Mortality the curse of the earth, ejection out of Paradise, the perill and paine of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in bearing, and bringing forth Children, and the paenal subjection of them unto
their Husbands:</hi> For these are common to all, both believers, and unbelievers,
and are inflicted upon all mankind, without exception, for the first sin. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some of these, or some part of them may be in some measure removeable,
or abateable, and yet continue, they may become penaltyes inflicted by God
Redeemer.</p>
               <p>2. The Lawes of God Creatour, require perfect obedience, not onely in all
things, and degrees, but in all times, and say thus: <hi>Do this and live; and if thou
do not this, thus, thou must dye:</hi> and there is no remedy but this Law, if it be

                  </gap>udgment, as God might have made it. The Law of God Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeer,
saith, <hi>Though thou hast sinned, and dost sin, yet if thou return by the power
of my grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and believe, thou shalt live, and not dye. Though thou art guilty, and
liable to punishment, and the same lye upon thee in part, yet upon these conditions, the
penalty may be removed or prevented.</hi> Some of the sins forbidden in the Law of
work are the same materially with those forbidden in the Gospel, and so are
some of the dutyes: yet they differ formally (if we speak after the manner of
the Schools.) This you have heard before. For any s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n after it once put on
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:64164:153"/>
the notion of impenitency, by delay and neglect to return, it presently begins
to be a sin against the Gospel. And such are all sins committed, after the first
promise of Christ. Such was the Murder of <hi>Cain,</hi> the corruption of the old
world, the filthinesse of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and all the rest mentioned in the book of God,
from <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. to the end. So that all the penaltyes, as that of <hi>Cain, the old
World, the Builders of Babel,</hi> and the rest were penaltyes as threatned by, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
for the sins against, God Redeemer. All this is evident from the books
of <hi>Moses,</hi> and all the Prophets, which speak to men as sinfull, promise Christ,
forbid impenitency, Preach, and urge repentance, and make all penaltyes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
upon that condition, which could not have been done, if sin and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltyes
had been looked upon according to the Law of works. Therefore it's
in vain to argue that, because, as the Law of Works commanded love to God,
love to Neighbour, did forbid Idolatry, Perjury, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rder, Theft, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> did threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
death, and punishment for these sins, so the Gospel commands the same du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes,
forbids the very same things, threatneth the same penaltyes, and promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
life, that therefore the Law of works continueth, especially the <hi>Morall Law.</hi>
For the precepts, prohibitions, promises, threats of the Law of works, and the
Law of grace, come under different notions. For an instance we may amongst
many places single out this one: <hi>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy
upon him, and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Esa. 55. 7. The Law of
works saith, Be not Wicked; Sin not at all: The Law of Grace saith, Though
thou hast sinned, and art wicked, yet forsake thy wicked way, and return unto
the Lord, against whom thou hast sinned. The Law of Works saith, Thou hast
sinned, and must dye: I have no promise of life or Pardon for thee. The Law
of Grace saith, though thou by thy sin hast deserved to dye, yet upon condition
of repentance, and return, thou shalt be Pardoned and live. I touch more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
upon this point, and here stand more largely upon it, because some will take
no notice of it; others, who are sufficiently informed, are hardly perswaded of
this difference, and the abrogation of the Law of Works, which to a guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
denyes all possibility of salvation.</p>
               <p>To come nearer to the intended <hi>Scope,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> These punishments may be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</p>
               <p>1. In to those of losse and paine: Because some deprive us of that good we
have, or may have: Some vex us with some evil, which either lyes upon us, or
threatens us; Some do both; But this is a generall distinction, and agrees to
punishments in generall.</p>
               <p>2. They may be distinguished in respect of the principall cause, or instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall:
For some are from God immediately: Some are inflicted from him by
some of his <hi>Creatures,</hi> as by fire destroying <hi>Sodome,</hi> by the water drowning <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah,</hi>
by the earth swallowing up <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> by the Pestilentiall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
of the aire infecting many thousands, by Wild Beasts, Locusts, Cater-pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
Frogs, and other animate, or inanimate Creatures, by Angels good or
bad; and God punisheth man by man, and that many wayes. For all the just
judgments, and penaltyes inflicted by humane jurisdiction, are punishments of
God, who judgeth amongst the Gods, and rulers of the earth. Many times the
unjust judgments of man are the just judgments of God. For man may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
unjustly to death in a cause wherein he is innocent, and yet justly
suffer that death from God for some other <hi>Crime,</hi> whereof he is
guilty.</p>
               <p>3. They may be distinguished in respect of the subject, whether single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or societyes; lesse or greater. A single person may be the subject of these
punishments, in respect of his goods, his body, his person, his Soul. A society
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:64164:154"/>
may be considered as one body in respect of it self, for the present, or joyntly
with posterity for time to come. There are penaltyes proper to Familyes, to
Cityes, to Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inityes, to States, and whole nations, wherein they are involved
at one time: There may be penaltyes transmitted, from Parents to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milyes,
as from <hi>Gehezi</hi> to his posterity; and so likewise from <hi>Joab,</hi> and from
<hi>Judas;</hi> and so from States, and other Societyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I spake before parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
though briefly, of the punishments, both of Civil and Ecclesiasticall
<hi>Polityes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The punishments may be distinguished into ordinary and usual, incident
to the generality of <hi>Mankind,</hi> or extraordinary. For the punishment of <hi>Cain,
the old World, Babel's</hi> builders, <hi>Sodome, Lots</hi> Wife, and such like were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
and rare; and so will be the burning of the World in the end.
But</p>
               <p>5. The principall distinction of punishments is that of Temporal and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall:
and by temporall, I mean all such as are different from spirituall: The
one deprives men of the comfort and happinesse, which we may enjoy in this
life, and the other touch a man more nearly, and tend more directly to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
misery hereafter. The temporall punishments of single persons are easily
known by the History of the Scriptures, and others Writers, and especially by
Gods threatnings against the Jews for their disobedience, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. and
<hi>Deut.</hi> 28. which, though they had some speciall reference to the Law, and the
Jewes; yet are incident to all, even those that live under the Gospel.</p>
               <p>The greatest punishments,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> and most to be feared, which men do suffer in
this life, are spirituall. When it's said, The Wages of sin is Death, <hi>Rom. 6. 23;</hi>
By death, is meant not onely that death which is seperation of Soul and body
for the time, and all the fore-running miseryes of this life, but all kind of
punishments, and especially spirituall: because death in that place is opposed to
eternall life, which is an <hi>aggregation</hi> of all spirituall mercyes. If we should
follow the order of time, then all the spirituall penaltyes inflicted by God, and
suffered by man since the first promise of Christ for the sins following, are reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to this head; as the rejection of <hi>Cains</hi> offering, his <hi>excommunication,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the greatest part of the World, before the flood, as being the Sons of
men, and seperated from the Sons of God. After the flood, seeing all first in
<hi>Noah's</hi> person, then in his family had the Word, and other means of conversion,
yet the greatest part of them for Apostasie were punished with the losse of these
meanes, and were left without the <hi>Oracles</hi> of God, the promise of Christ, and
the power of the restoring Spirit, and this punishment lay many yeares upon
their posterity, continuing Apostates. After God had singled out the Posterity
of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Jacob,</hi> and renewed the promise unto them, and continued the
meanes of conversion in that nation, the rest of mankind being rejected, were
called Heathens. Yet to these he left the light of nature, and some remnants
of the truth continued from their first Apostate-Parents and Ancestours, by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
and some, if not very many, had not onely a possibility, but opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
to be Proselytes, and so incorporated into the Church of the Jews. Yet
these did generally, not onely neglect these opportunities, but held the truth in
unrighteousnesse, lived contrary to the light of nature left unto them, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
the creature above the Creatour, God blessed for ever. And for this
sin God gave them up to vile affections, delivered them up unto a reprobate
mind, whereby they became full of all unrighteousnesse: and this was that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
judgment, and penalty whereby all hope of Salvation was taken from them.
Their sad condition is described unto us, not onely at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. from
<hi>verse</hi> 18. to the end: but briefly, yet fully, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. 11, 12. The taking
away the Word, and the Spirit of grace, and sending upon them the spirit of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:64164:154"/>
slamber, was also the punishment of the Jew, after they refused their Saviour,
and rejected the Gospel.</p>
               <p>But to proceed to the particular degrees of these punishments,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> according to
the different nature and degrees of sin, against the Law of grace, and the Lord
Redeemer, we must distinguish, of persons never sincerely converted, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate;
and of such as have been truly regenerate, and are entred the state of
justification. Amongst those who were never truly regenerate, some reject,
some receive the meanes of conversion; and their punishments are inflicted in
this life, or after death. For here I speak not of Heathens, which never enjoyed
the meanes, neither can say that they were tendred unto them. For such as to
whom God sends his Messengers, and by them offers the meanes, their sin if
they reject them is <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and they refuse to submit themselves to their Lord
and Saviour: These say, <hi>We will not have this man reign over us,</hi> Luk. 19. 14. Their
punishment is this for the present, that they shall be accounted enemyes, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and they must certainly know this, that the Kingdome of God came nigh unto
them; and their Condition shall be very sad, and wofull. For Christ himself
saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it shall be more tolerable in the last day for <hi>Sodom</hi> then for them,
<hi>Luke</hi> 10, 11, 12. Others receive these meanes, and proceed to profession, and
severall degrees thereof, but do not proceed to perfection and sincerity. Some
will hear the word, but not receive it into their minds, to understand the very
principles, and fundamental Laws of this <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Their punishment is; that
as they will go no further with God, so God will go no further with them, but
denyes unto them the Spirit of illumination, leaves them blind as he found
them, and suffers Satan to take the Word from them, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 12. Some receive
it so far, as to understand it, but are not willing to do it: Their punishment is
this: that God will not make it further effectuall to promote their spirituall
happinesse, and they are left (as the former) to Satan, to take it out of their
hearts, lest they should be ieve, and be saved. And though these may receive
the Spirit of <hi>illumination,</hi> yet they receive not the Spirit of <hi>Conversion.</hi> Some
receive if onely into their understandings, but not into their hearts, so as to
delight in it; and to do something commanded, and obey it in some degree:
but either, for fear of <hi>adversity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or love of the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Cares</hi> of this life,
they bring no fruit unto perfection, but either deny the truth, or receive it not
into <hi>an honest heart.</hi> Their punishment, is this: That the Spirit of conversion,
sanctification, and Adoption is denyed unto them, whilst they are such; but
they remaine under the <hi>Power</hi> of Satan, the dominion of sin, and in the state of
<hi>Damnation.</hi> Some continue for a longer, or a shorter time in this imperfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and in the confines of these Kingdomes of life and death: and though
God be patient, and calls for an honest and good heart, yet they deny it, and at
length the time of grace allotted by their Saviour is expired, and then the things
which belonged to their peace, are hid for ever from them, and the gates of
mercy and eternall life are shut against them, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 42. The last sin is
<hi>Apostacy</hi> of such as have received the knowledge of the truth, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the same, escaped the corruption that is in the <hi>World</hi> through lust,
have tasted some joy and comfort in their Saviour, yet turn back to their <hi>Vomit,</hi>
and <hi>Wallowing in their</hi> former sins; or deny the Lord who bought them, or do
not only deny him, but blaspheme him, and persecute him in his <hi>Members.</hi> The
punishment of these, is; that God suffers the unclean Spirit with seven other
spirits worse then <hi>himself,</hi> to enter and keep <hi>possession;</hi> and so the end of that
man is <hi>Worse</hi> then the first <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 45.</p>

And it had been better for them never to have known the way of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
then after they have known it to turn from the holy Commandement
delivered to them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. There remains no more sacrifice for sin, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which shall devour
the Adversaries, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27. They cannot be renewed to Repentance, <hi>Heb.

Such is the Punishment of them who blaspheme the Holy Ghost.
Though many of these may live a while in worldly Peace, yet their case is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
and so miserable as no Tongue of man can expresse, and God delivers
them up unto security, till they suddainly sink into Hell; or, before their end,
awakes them, and they become desperate, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Vnbelief.</hi> Impenitency is a continuance in Ignorance, or Errour, or
other sins against the meanes and motives of Conversion: and it's the same
with Blindnesse and Hardnesse of Heart which admit of many degrees, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

or according to the Malignancy of the Heart, which may be more or lesse.
Unbelief is a re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Unbelief, which before were Sins, may become Punishments. The
Punishment of these Sins is deniall of the Spirit, either sufficiently to prepare
them, or convert them, and so justifie them. From some of these he takes
the Word: To some of these he continues the Word, and denies the Spirit:
To some he grants the Spirit for some degrees of Preparation, but not of full
Conversion. From some he takes away the Spirit wholly, and delivers them
up to Satan. And this deniall of the Spirit is the heaviest Judgement that
God inflicts, or man can suffer, in this life; when men shall hear, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand;
see, and not perceive; to have their Hearts made fat, their Eares
heavy, their Eyes shut, lest they see with their Eyes, and hear with their Eares,

and <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 26, 27.</p>
               <p>As the State of impenitent Sinners,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> upon their death, doth alter; so their
Punishments, different from the former, do begin: and they suffer in another
kind, and their condition, being miserable, becomes unalterable. The day
of Grace with them (if not before, as it is with many, yet surely then) is past:
No place for Repentance will be found: No Prayers, Tears, Intercession of
Saints, and Angels, or any other meanes, can do them any good: Their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
and Salvation become irrecoverable and impossible. Death, which in
it self is a Curse (yet by the Wisdom and Mercy of God in Christ, to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
is a door to Eternity of Blisse, and an end of all their Misery) is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of their greater Woe; and though it doth not wholly take away their
<hi>Being,</hi> yet it deprives them of all hope of a better <hi>Being.</hi> Their Bodies are
laid in the Grave, or left upon the Surface of the Earth, for a prey to Fowles,
Dogs, wild Beasts, or hurled into the Deep, or howsoever, dissolved and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into dust, are reserved for greater Torment. Their Souls, departed from
their Bodies, are forsaken of God, not received by Christ, not guarded by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
nor carried into <hi>Abraham's</hi> bosome, and are left as a prey unto the Devils:
and into whatsoever dismal Lodging they are brought, or in whatsoever woeful
Region they wander, as, in this life, they had no faith in God, no Union with
Christ, no heavenly Consolation of the Spirit; so now they are destitute of all
peace, and joy. And it's not the least Torment to remember that once there
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:64164:155"/>
was a day of Mercy, and Grace, an Opportunity of obtaining pardon, or at least
a power to have lessened Sin, to lessen the Punishment; yet now that day is
past, and that Opportunity neglected, is for ever lost. They are in the same
condition with the Devils, and reserved, (as it were) in chains, unto the
Judgment of the great Day. This certainly known, and continually remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
continually torments. In consideration of which wofull estate, it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerns all, and every one of us, whilst it is said <hi>to day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

to his voice, not to harden our hearts, lest God swear in his wrath that we
shall never enter into his Rest. We that live in the last dayes, and enjoy the
Ministery of the Gospell, have not onely many a fair Warning, but many a
fearfull Example represented before our very eyes.</p>
               <p>These are the Punishments of the unregenerate,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> which they suffer before the
Resurrection: There are also Punishments which God's own Children, after
their Regeneration, and beginning of the estate of Justification, suffer in this
life.</p>
               <p>For as they have their Negligencies, Ignorances, Failings, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
their grievous Sins; So they have their Punishments accordingly. For
the most just God, who is most holy, and of purest Eyes, will in no wise allow
of Sin in his own dearest Children. For, though his greatest design is to save
the sinner, yet he will punish, and destroy the sin. As, the greater their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
care, and zeal shall be, the greater their peace, joy, and comfort, shall
prove; So, if they offend, be negligent, carelesse, cold, the lesse Communion
they shall have with their God, and the greater their doubts, feares, troubles,
griefs, shall be. And these spirituall Desertions of their God, and the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings
of the Spirit, are sad and heavy Judgments. How great must their
discomfort needs be, when God doth hide his face, Christ standeth at a dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and the Spirit doth not appear. This is evident, from the many dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
complaints and lamentations of God's Servants, and dearest Children.
They suffer many temporall Afflictions, in their Persons, Goods, Families,
Children, near Relations besides. For they are many times chastened of the
Lord, that they should not be condemned with the World, 1 <hi>Cor. 11.
35.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sword departs not from <hi>David</hi>'s house, and his Children wrong and
murther one another, for his crimes of Adultery and Murther. Yet these,
though grievous, were not his most grievous and greatest Punishments. The
sting of sin, and guilt thereof, doth deeply pierce, and torment his Soul; the
sanctifying and sealing Spirit was abated, and in a great measure withdrawn;
as his divine Vertues, so his blessed Comforts were almost reduced to a spark
raked up in the ashes; and if God had not in due time, out of depth of Mercy,
revived it, What had become of him? What his case was, we may easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
by <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. at large; especially by that earnest Petition, <hi>Create in
me a clean Heart, and renew a right Spirit within me. Cast me not away from
thy presence; and take not thine holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of
thy Salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit,</hi> that is, <hi>Comfort me with the
Spirit of Adoption. Psal.</hi> 51. 10, 11, 12. This Punishment <hi>Peter</hi> felt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
his Soul, when he reflected upon his Sin in denying his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
And surely to find the Power of Sanctification, and spirituall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
to abate in our Hearts, and the Vigour of it, for present, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
is an unvaluable losse, and an intolerable Punishment to God's
Saints.</p>
               <p>Therefore we are advised not to grieve, or offend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Spirit of God,
whereby we are sealed unto the day of Redemption, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 30. and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted

but as walking in the Light.</p>
               <p>It's strange that Saints, and Martyrs, in the midst of flaming fire, and
whilst under most cruell, and most exquisite, Torments, should rejoyce
with unspeakeable joy; and in these Desertions, should be so fearfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.
Yet the cause is, God will not abate the least Jot of his Justice,
when he shews the greatest Mercies.</p>
               <p>After the Punishments inflicted by this most just Lord,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IX</label> and King, upon
single Persons, declared briefly; something must be said of the Punishments
rendred to Persons associated, as such. These are considered, either in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Capacity making up the body of a civill State; or in an Ecclesiasticall and
spirituall Capacity, constituting a Church. The Punishments of civill States
and Kingdoms, we may read, and understand, in sacred and humane Stories.
And so great are the Motions, Shakings, made in these great Bodies through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the World in all times, that we may easily understand, that there is an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall,</hi>
and <hi>supreme Lord,</hi> and that there is <hi>one most high,</hi> whose Throne is in
Heaven, that ordereth the Kingdoms of men, and disposeth all things in it,
according to certain Rules of Justice, and Wisdome. It's a great Mercy of
God to affoord us civill Government, and to preserve the same: And though
the benefit thereof be generall, and extends to all Mankind, yet in the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and establishing Common-weales, God hath a speciall care of the
Church, and the Society of Pilgrims, and Strangers, here on earth, who seek e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
peace in Heaven, as Subjects, and Citizens, of an eternall State. This he
continues, protects, and ordereth aright, by his almighty hand, and profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
wisdom, in the midst of all the Tumults, Confusions, Ruines, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Kingdoms of the World. These have their Beginning, Increase, Corruptions,
Alterations, Ruines, and fatal Periods, not according to any certain Numbers
or revolution of times, nor the motion and influence of heavenly bodies, and
Aethereal lights, nor from the power, or weaknesse, the imprudence, or policy
of man; but from God, according to the eternall rules of Justice, and Wisdom
determined, and observed by him. Yet he doth all things in number, weight,
and measure, most exactly, and in the execution of his Judgments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th the

corrupted, and Corrupters, and, especially, Persecutors of the Church; and
when States, professing knowledge of the true God, and the faith of Jesus

Church, persecute the power of Godlinesse, under what pretence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

superstitious, idolatrous, prophane, administer Injustice, Cruelty; be
imprudent, negligent, unmercifull, vitious, and degenerate; then the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
both of the one and other, shall be Famine, Pestilences, Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
civill Wars, forreign Invasions, Captivity, Poverty, Desolations, many
other Miseries, and, many times, change of Government, or the Translation of
the Power Civill from one People to another, and sometimes <hi>Anarchy,</hi> and
a totall dissolution of all order. God useth the Governours to punish the
People, the People to punish their Princes, and sometimes the Sword of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Prince, to punish or destroy both. And when no Justice can be had
from men on Earth, he executes Vengeance, in some extraordinary manner,
from Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:64164:156"/>
Thus it was in the beginning of civill States, and it shall be so unto
the end of the World. God will have it to be so. To all these Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
must be added, the losse of safety, peace, plenty, and all other Blessings,
and Comforts, which God doth usually give to men by good Government.
In the Execution of these Judgments, the great Lord respects no Persons; He
punisheth many, as well as few; the mighty Monarchs of the World, as well
as the meanest Subjects. The ruine of so many royall Families, of so many
large and potent Empires, and Kingdomes, might teach the Princes of the
World to do Justice, and to fear this everlasting Judge.</p>
               <p>As there be civill,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>X</label> so there are spirituall, and ecclesiasticall Societies, which,
as such, have their proper Sins, whereby they make themselves liable to those
Punishments which God, from Heaven, inflicts upon them. This Church,
which we call a spirituall Society, began in a Family, the first Family in the
World, of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> being penitent, and believing in that Seed of the
Woman, which should break the Serpent's head, which was Christ. It en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
and was enlarged in that Family by their Children, especially, <hi>Abel</hi>
first, and then <hi>Seth:</hi> and as mankind was multipled, so it multiplied. And
at length there was a separation of the Sons of men from the Sons of God;
which Sons of God were, in processe of time, so degenerate, mixed, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted,
and the former Worthies, and Sons of God translated into a better
World, that it was reduced again to that one Family of <hi>Noah.</hi> Yet the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of the Posterity of that Family, who peopled the Earth, did so apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
that a great part of Mankind was ejected, and excommunicated out of
this blessed Society. And out of this great Body, God calls <hi>Abraham,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
the Promise of Christ unto him, more particularly and explicitly then
formerly he had done. He continues his Church, in a more speciall manner,
in his Family, and entailes the great Promise upon his posterity <hi>Isaac,</hi> and
<hi>Jacob,</hi> and then in his Children, who being multiplied into a Nation, he
brings out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and settles them in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and encloseth
them from all Mankind; makes them his peculiar People, continues the great
Promise unto them, trusts them with his Oracles, and gives them Lawes, and
Statutes, sends them Prophets, and takes speciall charge of them, till the
Son of God was exhibited and incarnate. Yet these, with the Proselytes,
had their sins, and according to their impenitency, besides their temporall,
their spirituall Punishments.</p>
               <p>But when Christ was once come into the World, had finished the work
of Humiliation, was exalted to the right hand of Glory, had powred down
the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles, God calls the Jewes first, then the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
and by them, commissioned to go into all Nations, he begins to gather
a Church Christian: For they preach; the Jewes and Gentiles bear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
professe their faith, and so are admitted as Subjects of God's spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Kingdom of Grace.</p>
               <p>As Disciples and Professours were multiplied in any City or Country, the
Apostles, or their Assistants, and Commissioners, appoint Elders, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Word, over them, to take care of their Souls, for to conform the
converted, and build them up, and perfect them that were converted, and
convert others, for to enlarge Christ's territories. The Officers of Christ were
extraordinary and ordinary; and some did plant, and some did water, but
God gave the increase. And the Elders, and ordinary Officers, were trusted
with the Word and Sacraments, for to dispense the one, and administer the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
according unto their Commission.</p>
               <p>After that not onely People, but Ministers, were encreased, and severall
Congregations setled under severall Ministers, they begin to <hi>associate,</hi> and
combine for Discipline, according to their Vicinities, and other conveniences.

               <p>All the particular <hi>Churches</hi> of the World on Earth at one time make up one

I say as one <hi>Universall</hi> body, its subject onely to Christ. For as for outward
discipline, we cannot find that Christ Instituted any <hi>Vicar-generall,</hi> or erected
any Court supreme in any one City, or place of the World. As God never
made an Universall <hi>King,</hi> so He never made a <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>Vniversall Bishop.</hi>
Men may fancy such a thing: But it's only a fancy, not a reall truth, nor ever

there are good, and bad; sincere Believers, and bare Professours, and
Hypocrites. And of these visible societies, I now intend to speak, when I
declare the judgments of God inflicted upon the Churches. When Ministers,
and People begin to neglect the duties of worship, are remisse in discipline,
as the Church of <hi>Ephesus, Corinth, Laodicea,</hi> and many others were, fall
from their first Love, Purity, Piety, abate in devotion, and the fire of their
zeal is quenched. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>heir punishments spirituall, besides, their temporall are
<hi>Persecutions</hi> from without, <hi>Schism,</hi> and <hi>Heresy</hi> from within. By the one the
body is torn asunder, and by the other the members are poysoned. And as
they abate in their duty, God abates in the powerfull, and comfortable <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings</hi>
of the Spirit: And if they continue in their sins, God in the end will
wholly take away his spirit, and remove the Golden <hi>Candlestick;</hi> as He once

And He will send his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Messengers</hi> unto another People, and will let out
his <hi>Vineyard</hi> unto other <hi>Husbandmen,</hi> which shall render him the fruits in their

Cities, an their Countries, where they professe the Gospel, but not <hi>Practise</hi> it,
<hi>Cruel,</hi> and Barbarous enemies. Thus He gave the <hi>Northern,</hi> and <hi>Western
Churches,</hi> and Nations to the <hi>Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> who like a mighty deluge
overflowed them, and like an impetuous stream did carry all before them.
This was the judgment of the <hi>Eastern,</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> Christians, invaded by the
<hi>Saracens,</hi> and possessed by them from beyond <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> unto <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi>
and <hi>Spain;</hi> where they met the <hi>Northern Barbarians.</hi> In these latter

These were not meerly temporall judgments, but spirituall: Because the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
did not onely invade and possesse their Countryes, but in many places
deprive them of their Teachers, and the Gospel; the glorious light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

Smoak, and mist of Hell, the doctrine of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and that in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the World. This is a just judgment of God <hi>(which Christ avert from
us)</hi> because they walked not in the light of the Gospel, when it so clearly shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64164:157"/>
upon them. And its one of the most feafull punishments of Christians to
be delivered up to believe lyes, and false doctrine in matters of Salvation. Yet
<hi>Turks,</hi> and other <hi>Mahumetans</hi> do not professe themselves Christians, as we
in this <hi>Western Corner</hi> of the World do. But amongst us, there be such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
their faith in Christ, who yet are, in the just judgment of God, delivered
up to superstition, Idolatry, and most dangerous doctrines, which have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been, and now are, dispersed into severall Nations. We read, <hi>That
because men received not the Love of the truth, that they might be saved: for this
cause God shall send them strong delusions, that they should believe a Lie,</hi> 2 Thes.
2. 10, 11. Where we may observe,</p>
               <p>1. The sin, which is, Not to receive the love of the truth that they might be
saved.</p>
               <p>2. The Punishment; God shall send them strong delusions, that they should
believe a lye: For when God doth take away his Spirit, from such as enjoy the
word of God, which they will not believe and practise, it's an easy thing for
the Devil to delude the wisest, and most learned in matters of Religion: and
then there is no Doctrine so false, and absurd, which man so deluded will not
believe. This hath been confirmed by experience of former times, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that Temple, or Church, wherein the Son of Perdition, shall exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
above all Civil, and Ecclesiasticall powers. The seat of this Wicked one
must be some eminent City, so the Scripture tells us: and this City shall be
called <hi>Babylon</hi> in a mystery, and stand built upon seven hills. Some say, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
which was called <hi>New-Rome,</hi> is so. Yet that cannot be it: Because
it must be that City which did Reign over the Kings of the Earth, when <hi>John</hi>
received the Revelation from Heaven, and that was not <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which
was obscure at that time. The Character of this <hi>Whore</hi> was,</p>
               <p>1. That She made the Nations of the Earth drunk with her cup of fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
And</p>
               <p>2. She Her self was drunk with the blood of the Saints, and the <hi>Martyrs</hi> of
Jesus. Fornication is Superstition, Image-worship, and Idolatry: The
drinking of the blood of the Saints is the persecution, and murder of all such
Christians, as shall refuse to acknowledge Her power, and to receive Her abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
and Idolatrous worship. Lest any therefore should be ignorant what
City this is; The spirit informs us,</p>
               <p>1. That it's a City which professeth Christ.</p>
               <p>2. It's the seat of the Son of Perdition, arrogating Supreme power not only
in temporals, but spirituals.</p>
               <p>3. It's Idolatrous and Superstitious; worshiping of Images.</p>
               <p>4. It sheds the blood of such Christians, as will not acknowledge Her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and drink of Her cup of fornication.</p>
               <p>5. It's a City that was built, and once stood upon seven hills.</p>
               <p>6. It Reigned over the Kings of the Earth, in the times of <hi>John</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
               <p>7. It's a City that boasts of many lying signs, and wonders, and believes lies,

effectuall, that not only the ignorant sort of people, and silly women, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

most excellent parts, profoundest Learning and Policy, are enchanted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
by this great City. This is one of the greatest trialls of Christians,
and the Church of God, that ever came upon the World. And if we Seriously
consider, we may easily understand that it's God alone, who preserves us in the
truth: And all such as love the truth, and endeavour to practise it, according
to the plainnesse, and simplicity of the Gospel, may expect this blessing from
Heaven, even in the midst of these most dangerous times. This is a fair war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to us all, who enjoy the Scriptures, and therein the word of God, to
take heed least we live unprofitably through our own neglect under the means
of salvation. For if we do not seriously attend unto the saving doctrine of
the truth, and give all diligence to practise it so far as <hi>we know it;</hi> it will be
just with God to suffer Sathan to delude us, be a lying spirit in the mouths of our
Prophets, and to give us over to believe lyes, errours, heresies, as we see it
come to passe with many amongst us at this day. By the former sins, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of our duty, we do not only lose all the benefits, and comforts, which
God hath promised, and we might enjoy in a well constituted Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, according to the word of God, but
also make our selves liable to the former punishments and all others, which
God hath threatned against us in his Book.</p>

we upon obedience to his Laws may expect from him, and what fearfull pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishments
will follow upon our disobedience, and impenitency. The Law-givers,
and Rulers of the World think it sufficient to publish their Laws once enacted;
and to leave every man to take notice of them, or neglect to do so at their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill.
But our gracious, and most mercifull Lord sends his Messengers conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
time after time, to teach us his Laws; to call them to remembrance
often, and by them to reprove our sins, exhort us to obedience, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and daily to set life and death before us; So unwilling he is to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
so willing to reward: And the use we are to make of all the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
recorded in Scripture, both as threatned, and executed, we may learn
from the Apostle: For what he saith of the judgments executed upon <hi>Israel,</hi>
is true, not only of all the rest written in Scripture, but of all those, which
we ourselves both hear of, and see, and of those we read of in other Histories.
They all happened unto them for ensamples; and they are written for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
upon whom the ends of the World are come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. God by
them speaks unto us in this manner: Avoyd such sins, and you shall escape
such punishments; But if you will sin, as they did, ye shall suffer as they did.
And we upon whom the ends of the World are come, should be more
carefull to avoid sin; because as we have more examples to warn us; So
if we sin, our guilt will be the greater, and our punishment the heavier.
And though these punishments be a reason, yet they are not the principall,
why we should take heed of disobedience. For a wicked man may fear to sin
because he fears to suffer. But such is the love of God, of goodnesse, justice,
virtue, in the regenerate, that they hate sin, because it's so base and unjust in it
self, and so offensive to their Heavenly Father.</p>

               <p>THe Scriptures many times speak of rewards before Punishments:<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>I</label> especially
in such places, as describe the finall <hi>Doom;</hi> yet here I have changed the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and that for severall reasons, and have first declared the punishments, and
now proceed to the rewards. And in this place I take Reward for any mercy,
and blessing of God, which follows by Divine ordination, according to promise,
upon the performance of any duty required by the Laws of God-Redeemer.
And as the proper, and formall object of punishment is disobedience to the Law
of Redemption; So reward looks at obedience, performed according to that
Law: and the subject immediately capable thereof is the penitent believer. Yet
no man by obedience, faith, repentance can merit any thing at God's hands:
For all rewards given to sinfull man, are merited by Christ; and onely upon
his merit, and Gods promise, the obedient derive their right unto them. God
cannot be bound to reward either man or Angel, though innocent, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
obedient, except by promise he bind himself; How then can he any
other way be bound to sinfull man? So that it's hence Consequent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that though
man perform his duty, yet the reward is free. These rewards are either Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
or Spirituall: For (as you heard before) Godlinesse hath the promises
(that is) the rewards promised, of this life and that which is to come; whether
they be deliverances or blessings.</p>
               <p>We may understand by the holy Scriptures that God did not onely promise,
but gave unto his obedient Children in all times, even Temporall rewards, and
not onely blessed them with earthly blessings, and upon their prayers delivered
them out of afflictions, and their enemyes hand; but also upon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
either removed, or diverted by way of prevention, Temporal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>And because these are many, and may be easily understood by the promises,
I passe them by, forbearing all further mention of them in this place, either as
they are proper to single persons, or to Societies. For so Cityes civil have
their proper blessings, if they be just, and well ordered; as safety, peace, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
prosperity, victory over their enemyes, and help and comfort from their
confederates, and allyes.</p>
               <p>Neither will I enlarge my discourse with a debate, whether heathens, and
others out of the Church, may not obtaine from God temporal rewards for their
moral Virtues.</p>
               <p>That God doth blesse them Temporally for their justice, and other deeds vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
in that low degree, is evident.</p>
               <p>Neither will I enquire how far, <hi>Ahab,</hi> and other unregenerate persons, by
their humiliations, and repentance, such as they are, may prevail with God to
avert, or put off judgments.</p>
               <p>It's very certain, he is mightily inclined to mercy, and will encourage the lest
degree of goodnesse in any Person. He prevents us with many blessings, and
doth many things even to the great sinners, which he was in no wise bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> and to these I proceed, whether they be
proper to single persons or societies, and Churches. There be some indeed
which a society as such may enjoy, for a society doth add unto our happinesse,
both on earth, and in heaven. If a Church as a Church shall be obedient, her
reward no doubt will be Gods speciall protection, the continuance of the
meanes of conversion, and confirmation, plenteous store of the gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and other speciall favours. To know these, we must consider the promises
God hath made to the Church, as a Church, and especially a Church obedient:
The principall whereof may be observed in his promises to the seven Churches
of <hi>Asia.</hi> For there is hardly any Church, that is not fearfully degenerate, but
may be found in the same condition, and case with some of them. Yet because
most of the rewards there promised are such as single persons regenerate may
enjoy, I therefore single out some of the principall of them.</p>
               <p>Before I can enter upon particulars,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> because it's properly a reward that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
upon duty performed, I must shew what is necessarily required, and to
be presupposed before the performance of any spirituall duty. For there is some
mercy wherein God must of necessity prevent us before we can serve and obey
him, so as to be capable of a spirituall reward. God made men, and so Angels
at the first righteous and holy, before they could do any acts of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
And when God at the first promised Christ, and commanded men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and believe in him, in that very promise was included a promise of the
meanes of conversion, without which man could never have believed, so as to
have benefit by Christ. It's true, that man by a demerit antecedent may lose
these, as the first Apostate Gentiles, and afterwards the unbelieving Jew caused
God to take these from them: But no man by any duty, prayer, or such meanes
can merit them, no nor obtaine them. For God in these mercyes must preven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
man, because without them it's not possible for any, especially such as have
wholly lost them to perform any spirituall duty; in this case God must needs
say, I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ought of them that asked not for me, and am found of them that
sought me not, <hi>Esay.</hi> 65. 1. For no man by the light of nature, especially so
much darkned in man, doth ask for God, or seek him first. God must first seek
us before we can seek him. As God loved us first, and gave Christ for us when
we thought of no such thing; so he calls us first, before we can do so much as
call upon him for spirituall mercyes. And it was a great mistake in <hi>Pelagius</hi> to
think that if man did any good, though but by the power of nature, God was
bound to reward him, and that necessarily: For this was his great errour (as
some tell us): So it's no lesse an errour to assert that there can be in any man
<hi>(meritum ex congruo)</hi> to deserve the first spirituall rewards. The one takes
away grace, and the freenesse of Gods spiritual mercyes; the other, preventing-grace.</p>
               <p>Such men as these little know themselves, and their condition by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>These meanes of conversion are the Word, and the Spirit: The word must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
the spirit must reform us: For we are both blind &amp; impotent. We have no
spirituall knowledge of Jesus Christ by nature; no active power to do so much
as effectually desire him.</p>
               <p>The word alone is not sufficient without the spirit; the spirit without the
word will not ordinarily do any thing. The word concerning mans <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in,
Gods love, Christs redemption, mans duty, as it is an outward revelation, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
or spoken, cannot penetrate the heart of man. Something it may teach
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:64164:159"/>
and something it may move, and work upon a man, that attends unto it, and by
naturall reason considers it. But this is nothing to purpose. Whether God
concurs with any measure of his preparing Spirit, with the first publishing, or
making known his word by man to naturall man, is hard to determine. He may
do so if he please: and there can be no doubt thereof. Yet if he do, I think its
a speciall, if not an extraordinary gratuity. But this is certain that man is
bound to this duty of hearing, and attention to the word first spoken unto him.
And besides if any man will neglect this duty at the first, or to do any thing in
this kind, which by nature he can do, God may justly both deny the Spirit,
and also take away his word for ever from such a person. To alledge in this
point that of our Saviour; To him that hath it shall be given; that is to him
that useth that power, which he hath, God will give him more, and reward him,
is to little purpose: For our Blessed Saviour is not to be understood of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
which man hath by nature; but of some stock, or talent of grace, which
He his Lord and Master had given him. And suppose it were true, that to him
that doth <hi>(Quod in se est))</hi> what he can do, more shall be given him; Yet</p>
               <p>1. No man doth what he can do by nature.</p>
               <p>2. Nor can do any thing in spirituals without grace.</p>
               <p>3. Though he should ever answer man in this kind, Where do we find that he
hath bound himself by promise so to do. Men may talk at randome this, and
that; yet the Crosse of Christ was such a doctrin, as neither Jew nor Gentile
could by nature digest: It was to the one <hi>a Stumbling block,</hi> and to the other
foolishnesse, though some of them might be of exquisite and highly improved
naturall parts. This doctrin is Gods Wisdome in a <hi>mystery,</hi> and so hidden,
that it poseth the great wits, and profoundest learning of the World; and if
<hi>Paul</hi> himself had not preached it in demonstration of the Spirit, and power, it
had taken little effect. It's far above nature. God must give man so much
of his Spirit, as he may see the want of the Spirit, before he can pray for the
Spirit so as to obtaine it for conversion, and consolation.</p>
               <p>The first duty that man being instructed by the word can perform,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> is, <hi>Hearing</hi>
the Word. Yet there be many kinds of hearing, and many degrees thereof:
neither is any kind of hearing such as upon which faith doth follow. For when
the Apostle saith, That faith is by hearing, he intends some special hearing,
which requires a due preparation, of the heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntecedent. For when a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
person heares the Word with an unprepared heart, he shall find little effect:
neither can man hope for a benefit by the Word, when he doth not hear it in
due manner. A man may heare the Word with attention, and he may hear
the Word without attention. He may heare, and forget; heare and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
it. He may heare, and consider, with application of it to himself; He
may heare, and neither seriously consider it, nor rightly apply it. He may
heare for knowledge, or some other end onely; He may hear for practise, and
reall practise. He may hear it as the Word of God, or not as the Word of
God, but of man. He may heare it so as to obey the commands, and to do
the dutyes commanded, to avoid the sins prohibited, to trust in the mercyes
promised, to fear the punishments threatned, He may hear it as casting away
all filthinesse, and superfluity of naughtinesse, and with a meek heart; and he
may hear it another way. Though notwithstanding the Word may be heard
many and severall wayes; yet these things are certain,</p>
               <p>1. That a man is to hear the Word of God according to the best power
naturall God hath given him, and to proceed so far as a naturall Morall Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
may do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:64164:160"/>
2. Whether there be any promise of further grace to be given upon this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
or no; yet if he neglect to do what he can in this particular, its
just with God to deny any further grace, then that which hath been granted, the
teaching of the Word.</p>
               <p>3. That the Word of God ought to be heard as the Word of God.</p>
               <p>4. That it's never heard as the Word of God, so as to assent to the truth,
and consent to the practise of it effectually, without the power of the Spirit go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
along with it, and carrying it close to the heart.</p>
               <p>5. One effect, if not the first, which by the Word, God works upon the heart
of him that useth the meanes of conversion aright, is, to make the heart sensible.
For by nature it's senslesse, stupid, stony.</p>
               <p>And this is one promise of God to put a new Spirit within us, and to take
away the stony heart out of our flesh, and give us an heart of flesh, <hi>Ezek.
36.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>This is not to give us a new soul; but a new quality, another disposition of
the Soul, different from that which we have by nature.</p>
               <p>And even in this work as he maketh use of our senses, so he doth of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
reason, and wit.</p>
               <p>He, by illumination, and inspiration, takes away the blindnesse of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
which naturally cannot judge of spirituall things, as spirituall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by the Word; and the stupidity of the Will, which doth not, cannot,

effectually.</p>
               <p>Because the word finds the heart of man under the guilt and dominion of sin,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label>
and his corrupt lusts, therefore one of the first things man is made sensible of, is,
his sinfull and miserable condition.</p>
               <p>Upon this the heart begins to bleed, grieve, smart, as being deeply and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
wounded.</p>
               <p>And it may be God doth not at the first represent unto man all his sin, but
it may be one, and the same principall, or more predominant, or some other;
nor discover all the punishments due, but some few, or one, especially the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
               <p>This may be called that part of judgment which we tearme to be Conviction
upon <hi>Summons,</hi> and a charge, and the same confessed.</p>
               <p>For when God hath thus made the heart of man sensible, he is convinced, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
accuseth, and condemneth himself.</p>
               <p>And though at the first the work begins with the apprehension and sense of
one sin, yet afterwards he begins to see his sins to be many and heinous, and so
his condition to be very miserable.</p>
               <p>And in this case a man may continue a longer, or a shorter time as it shall
please God: and this his sad condition is sometimes made more sad by outward
afflictions, or inward terrours, or both: and all this while the sinfull wretch is
in danger of dispair, if God prevent it not by restraining Satans rage, who then
will be very busie.</p>
               <p>Yet God gives man no occasion to cast away all hope; because he doth not
at the first represent sin as unpardonable, but pardonable, nor the punishment as
unavoydable, but avoydable.</p>
               <p>Some say this is done by the Law, and they meane the morall Law, discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto man his sin by the precept, and his misery by the commination:

1. God doth not use onely the morall law, but all other laws, or any law in
force, and he maketh use of the History of the first sin, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>all of man, nay of
the sufferings, and death of Christ, of his judgments executed upon others.</p>
               <p>2. No man ought to preach the law of works unto sinfull man as in force:
for that makes sin unpardonable, and is the high way to cause dispaire. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that will onely threaten death, and punishments according to the Law
of works, and silence, and conceale the promise of the Gospel is a <hi>Legal-Preacher</hi>
indeed, and can be no faithfull Servant unto Christ in this work.</p>
               <p>3. It's not the Law, nor any other Doctrin preached by man, which can
break his stony heart, without the Spirit and power of the Gospel. That
Doctrin which, used by God in this work is most effectuall, is, the Doctrin of
Christ Jesus crucified for our sins, and it must be the law of the Spirit of life, that
must free us from the Law of sin, and death.</p>
               <p>In this sad condition,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> whilst man continues guilty, and convicted by his own
conscience, at the bar of divine Justice, he will begin to cast about, and look on
every side to see whether there be any help, deliverance, and hope of escape:
and he finds nothing in himself, nothing in any Creature, no not in Angels to
help him, and so despairs of any comfort in any thing excepting Christ, and so
casts away all confidence in any other things: and with the Jews, pricked in their
hearts, cryes out <hi>Men, and Brethren what shall we do?</hi> Acts 2. 37. And with the

               <p>
                  <hi>To this question made in the anguish and bitternesse of Spirit, the answer is,</hi>
Repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the Remission of sins, and
ye shall receive the Holy-Ghost, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38.</p>
               <p>And, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 31,
This implyes,</p>
               <p>1. That the Sinner is <hi>Savable,</hi> and remission possible.</p>
               <p>2. That Remission, and Salvation is onely by Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>3. That the meanes to obtaine both by Christ, is, repentance and faith. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this follows an appeal from the Throne of Justice, to the Throne of Grace,
and mercy: Christ is pleaded; the guilty person offers the sacrifice of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
heart, and bruised Spirit to the supreme Judge, and earnest suit is made,
not onely for pardon of sin past, but for power against sin for the time to
come.</p>
               <p>And though man desires and endeavours to repent, and beleive, and quiet his
mind in Christ's merits, and Gods promises, yet he cannot do these things to
purpose, nor any man in the world can give him effectuall comfort by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the promises, till God put his laws in his mind, and write them
in his heart by his <hi>Divine Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus to do is a work of the Divine Spirit, who alone can write immed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and imprint the Divine precepts, and promises of the Gospel upon the
heart of man; and so give him a divine power to repent, to believe, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
to do the Laws of God, and apply his promises.</p>
               <p>The word now is no longer onely in books, or in mens mouths, or in their
eares, but also in the heart.</p>
               <p>Yet it's here to be noted.</p>
               <p>1. That this great promise of the Gospel is not absolute, as though God pre-required
no duty to be performed by man.</p>
               <p>2. That he doth not this work without the word both taught, heard, and
learned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:64164:161"/>
3. That this Law is not fully and perfectly written in any mans heart, in this
life.</p>
               <p>4. That therefore the most illuminated, and sanctified man in this life hath
need of the written Word. This is not any precept, or promise of the Law:
it's a performance of a promise upon some precepts performed, and so an
act of judgment, and the same not a bare sentence pronounced out of
man, but executed in the soul of man; and not a punishment, but a
blessed reward.</p>
               <p>Upon this follows another performance,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> and that is repentance and belief,
and the same of a far higher degree then can be performed by any strength <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
and <hi>moral:</hi> They are divine and supernaturall, not performed by any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
power, but by a strength from Heaven. For in writing these divine
precepts in the heart of man, God himself so immediately speaks to man, that
he receives the Word of God, as the Word of God indeed, is taught of God,
drawn to Christ, and comes unto him, never to depart from him again.</p>
               <p>I will not deny but there may be some supernaturall illumination, and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the heart of man, and some comforts thereupon in an heart not fully
humbled.</p>
               <p>But for God so to write his laws in our hearts, as to cause us to walk in
his statutes, and keep his judgments to do them, and that sincerely, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. is a far higher degree of grace in Christ, and the duty
performed thereupon is far more perfect, and excellent. In this repentance
and faith there are severall branches. The</p>
               <p>1. Is a sincere and totall submission unto Christ alone, as our onely Saviour,
and to God as our onely Lord, and Redeemer by him, and so we take him to be
our God. The</p>
               <p>2. Is totall reliance upon God as our Redeemer in Christ Jesus dying; and
rising again for us.</p>
               <p>3. An engagement with the whole heart, unto the obedience of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and to be his people, his loyall, and obedient subjects. And because
this duty is a return unto our God formerly forsaken by us, therefore it's call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Repentance: And because it's not onely a belief of his truth, but a reliance
upon his promises, its called Faith.</p>
               <p>By this we turn from darknesse to light, and from the power of Satan unto
God. The reward that follows upon this, is that God will be to <hi>us</hi> a God,
and we shall be to <hi>Him</hi> a people; <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10.</p>
               <p>This is our admission of us as subjects of his Kingdome, wherein as we must
perform dutyes, so we shall enjoy priviledges.</p>
               <p>This makes us one with Christ, ingrafts us unto him, so as we become his
living members, and derive from God by him all grace, and peace, and saving
blessings.</p>
               <p>But of this there are degrees.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. We have Christ as our Saviour, and Redeemer.</item>
                  <item>2. A right unto the mercyes merited by him, and promised by God in
him.</item>
                  <item>3. Some degree of possession and enjoyment of them.</item>
                  <item>4. In the end a full communion with God the Father, and Jesus Christ
his Son, so that our joy is made full.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Before I proceed to the next benefit or reward, something must be observed,
both concerning this duty, and this reward.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:64164:161"/>
1. The repentance, faith, and submission unto God Redeemer in Christ is
in consistent with the habituall dominion of any sin.</p>
               <p>2. Though it be such, and therefore sincere, yet it's not perfect, but admits of
degrees, and must encrease untill we come to perfection.</p>
               <p>3. They do not look at any particular promise of God, or office of Christ, or
benefit merited by Christ, but at God Redeemer in generall, as the fountain of
eternall life, and all benefits conducing thereunto, and at all the offices of
Christ, and all the merits of Christ, even at whole Christ, as by whom God will
give us this eternall full salvation.</p>

               <list>

such, as are under the dominion of sin, and liable to the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto eternall death.</item>
                  <item>2. As the duty, so the reward is imperfect at the first.</item>
                  <item>3. It's no particular reward, as of justification, or reconciliation, or adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the rest formally, actually, and particularly considered, but
virtually all. For we have God to be our God, whole Christ to be
our Saviour, and be in Christ, Christ is in us by his Spirit. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
formerly the Spirit was in us to prepare us, now he as the Spirit of
Christ our head, is in us to abide, and constantly to sanctifie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,

                  </gap>s, in this judiciall processe, consider God as a Judge, and
Christ as an Advocate: as may appear, <hi>Rom. 8. 33, 34. Heb.</hi> 7. 25. &amp; 9. 24.
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2. In which places Christ is made the propitiatour, and interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or advocate.</p>
               <p>7. Though God by Christ as King may passe this judgment, yet he must, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

as a priest; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uch he must be before he can be a Judge, and so looked
upon, not onely by God the Judge justifying, but the sinner to be justified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Judge proceed to passe and execute the judgment by his Son as King.
For man must first be justificable by Christ a Priest, before he can be justifyed by
Christ a King. The generall nature of justification is a reward. It's a reward
merited by Christ, as Priest, and Mediatour, promised by God Redeemer, as a
Law-giver, and rendred by him as Judge upon a duty performed, by the Sinner
to be justified: and this doth difference it from the retributions of punishment,
according to the Laws of Redemption violated.</p>
               <p>The party judged,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> and justified, is</p>
               <p>1. Man.</p>
               <p>2. Man a Sinner.</p>
               <p>3. Man a Sinner believing.</p>
               <p>4. Believing in Christ, as propitiatour, and intercessour: Propitiatour
by his blood shed, and offered unto God: Intercessour by his blood being shed,
offered, and accepted, as pleaded.</p>
               <p>1. The subject of this act, and the materiall immediate cause of this act is
Man: For it's not a judgment passed upon Angels good, or bad.</p>
               <p>2. Man is here considered, not as innocent, as he was first Created, but as a
Sinner, and disobedient, and so guilty. For it is God that justifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
that is sinners, and guilty persons, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Apostle, making way for his Doctrin of Justification, proves
Jew and Gentile <hi>(that is all men)</hi> under sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 9. and that all the world
was guilty before God, <hi>(that is Gods tribunal) verse</hi> 19. and again affirms that all
have sinned, <hi>verse</hi> 23. For death passed over all men, because all have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in one man. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
               <p>For he that hath the least sin, is guilty of the first sin of the first man, and lyes
under the penalty thereof, till he be delivered. For by the offence of one,
many were dead; and, by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to
condemnation, <hi>verse</hi> 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>For there can be but two wayes whereby men or Angels can be justifiable
before God the universall, and supreme most just Judge: and that is either by
their own righteousnesses, and perfect obedience; or by the mercy of this
eternall Judge propitiated, pardoning their disobedience upon a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>By the former way the Blessed Angels were, but man cannot be, justifiable, or
justified.</p>
               <p>3. It's man as a Believer: For though every man that's justifiable, and
justified, is a sinner, and may be so considered <hi>(specificative)</hi> as the School-men
speak; yet as a sinner <hi>(for maliter, et reduplicative)</hi> he cannot be justifiable: For
then every sinner should be justified. Therefore it is so often said, that man a
sinner is justified by Faith.</p>
               <p>4. To be a Believer, so as to be justifiable, presupposeth Christ,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As Propitiatour, and Intercessour.</item>

1. Presupposeth Christ; who Christ is, what his person, natures, with the
union, and distinction of them, and his offices be; Who sent him, and upon
what inward motive, and to what end he was sent, what his work was, what
the immediate effects, and the mediate of the redemption applied were, you
have heard before: and all these things must be understood, believed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.
But the principall thing here to be considered, is, how Christ
made God propitious, and placable: and how he procures actuall remission.
That which made God propitious and mercifull to sinfull man, was, his great
Sacrifice: That which obtaines actuall remission, is, his intercession. Both
these are proper acts of him as Priest, and Mediatour. For mediatour and
Priest, the Apostle takes to be the same, as if you consider, you may observe,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. &amp; 8. 6. &amp; 9. 15. He may be called a Mediatour, <hi>Nuntius
inter Deum &amp; hominem;</hi> A messenger between God and Man, as <hi>Moses</hi>
was between the Lord and <hi>Israel,</hi> as a third person really and essentially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from both, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. So Christ never was: Or, he may be a Mediatour
participating in nature with both, being God with God, and Man with Man.
But though it's true that Christ may be called Mediatour in these two respects;
yet where doth the Scripture call him so, in either way? <hi>The man Christ Jesus
is the one mediatour between God and Man, as giving himself a ransome for all;
that is as a Priest,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5, 6. <hi>That, He as Priest, is the propitiation for our
sins, through his blood, is expresse Scripture,</hi> Rom. 3. 25. <hi>For by his own blood en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
once into the holy place, he obtained eternal Redemption, or Remission for
ever,</hi> Heb. 9. 12. For as the High Priest in the Sacrifice of the great and
generall expiation, when the Sacrifice was slain, enters with the blood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
into the holiest place, and presents, and sprinkles it before the throne of
God, and then comes out again: So Christ having suffered; and shed his blood,
being slain, presently enters into the Holy place of Heaven, and presents his
soul, as separated from his body, and so himself as having suffered; and so the
propitiation, and the eternal expiation was made. And to signifie this instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Vail of the Earthly Sanctuary was rent from top to bottome, that
men might know that the great High Priest was entred the eternall Sacrary of
Heaven, to appear before the Tribunall of the great Judge. This Sacrifice
was truly propitiatory, and by the eternall spirit being offered without spot to
God; <hi>had power to purge the conscience from dead works, to serve the living
God in the Heavenly Temple, to confirme the everlasting Covenant, to consecrate
the Sanctified for ever,</hi> Heb. 9. 14, 15. &amp; 10. 14. <hi>And He that knew no sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
was made sin, that is, a Sacrifice for sin, for us, that we might be the righteousnesse
of God through him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1. <hi>He knew no sin; for he was holy, and without
sin in his Conception, Birth, Life, Death; And perfectly obeyed all the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
of God. Otherwise he could not have offered himself without spot,</hi> Heb.
9. 14. <hi>Nor have been an offering and sacrifice to God, for a sweet smelling Savour,
as he was, Ephes.</hi> 5. 2. Without this purity, this sacrifice could have had no
expiatory, and redemptory power; <hi>So that we might be Redeemed from our
vain conversation with his blood, as of a Lamb without blemish, and without spot,</hi>
1 Pet. 1. 19. And as without this spotlesse purity, He could not have offered
this spotlesse Sacrifice; so though He was pure, yet without this sacrifice and
death, He could not have bin a propitiation for sinfull man. So that purity,
and death must both concur to satisfie Gods justice, and make sin pardonable.
Yet sinne can never be actually pardoned, nor immediately pardonable to any
particular person, except this propitiation is made, and accepted, be pleaded
in Heaven by him that was consecrated by Death, constituted upon the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and confirmed upon his Assension; to be the High Universal, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Priest in Heaven after the order of <hi>Melchizedeck.</hi> For if we have sinned
(as who hath not) <hi>we must have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64164:163"/>
righteous, who is the propitiation for ours sins,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1, 2. This Christ
and Son of God is King, and Prophet; yet neither as King, or Prophet,
doth He either make propitiation, or intercession, but only as a Priest; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
His first service of sacrifice was finished, and He made immortall, and set
at His Fathers right hand, He begins this second service of His Priest-hood,
and shall continue it till all His Saints be fully justified for ever: And
oh! How happy are they that have Him Advocate in the Heavenly
Court?</p>

ready to procure actuall pardon; this yet is not sufficient, except the sinner
to be pardoned doth believe in him, both as propitiating, and pleading his
propitiation. And here it's to be noted, that He makes intercession in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
only for penitent and believing sinners; for whom alone His inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
is effectuall. For though He died for man, as a sinner to make his
sin pardonable; yet He pleads only for a sinner, believing, to obtain actuall
pardon. <hi>He ever liveth to make intercession for such as come to God by Him,</hi> Heb.
7. 25. Where we must observe,</p>
               <p>1. That the place speaketh of Christ as a Priest.</p>
               <p>2. Such a Priest, as having offered the great Sacrifice of expiation is risen
again, and entered into the Temple of Heaven.</p>
               <p>3. Such a Priest as hath obtained an unalterable Priest-hood, confirmed to
him by the Solemn Oath of the eternall God.</p>
               <p>4. Such a Priest as is immortall, and ever liveth.</p>
               <p>5. This Priest doth make perpetuall intercession.</p>
               <p>6. Those for whom he makes intercession, are such as come to God by
Him.</p>
               <p>7. To come to God, is to present our selvs before His Throne of grace, and
sue for pardon, and Salvation.</p>
               <p>8. To come to God by Him, is to sue for these in His Name by Faith in
Him. For otherwise there is no accesse for guilty persons to the Throne of
grace: <hi>Therefore is He said to be set forth, or ordained to be a propitiation through
faith in His blood,</hi> Rom. 3. 25. For we are not immediately made justifiable
either by Christ dying, or Christ pleading, but by Christ dying and pleading,
believed upon. <hi>The righteousnesse of God is by faith in Jesus Christ, unto all and
upon all that believe,</hi> Rom. 3. 22. This is an unspeakable comfort to sinfull
guilty man, deserving to be sentenced unto eternall death and the extreme
punishments in Hell, that</p>
               <p>1. There is a Court of Grace, Equity, and Mercy ever kept in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>2. A propitiated, and most merciful God is the Judge.</p>
               <p>3. Jesus Christ His Son being once tempted, and having suffered cruel pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishments
is very sensible of our miserable condition, and full of compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>4. Every penitent, and believing sinner on Earth is his client, and he will
vndertake his cause, and plead it as his own.</p>
               <p>5. A prayer, a sigh, a groan, will mind him of our cause.</p>
               <p>6. A most righteous Advocate, pleading vehemently, and before a Father of
eternal mercy, for penitent, believing, and heart-bleeding sinners, and that with
his own blood, and urging Gods own promise must needs prevaile. Oh! fear
not guilty Wretch, thy cause will be carried in Heaven: There can be no doubt
of it.—Yet the Saints of God, who lived and died before Christ's exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:64164:163"/>
to glory, had faith in Christ, and were justified by it, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was:
Their faith indeed was implicit, and far short of ours, yet it pleaded <hi>Mercy,
a Promise, a Messias, a Sacrifice,</hi> though very darkly: and God did look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christ though to come as a Propitiatour, and intercessour: and for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation,
and intercession foreseen, and fore-accepted, and imperfectly yet
sincerely believed, did justifie them.</p>
               <p>This Faith whereby we are justified is opposed by the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> to the
Faith of the <hi>Jew,</hi> in his Letter to the <hi>Romans;</hi> to the Faith of the Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Christian, in that to the <hi>Galatians;</hi> unto the Faith of <hi>Jews,</hi> of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
of the Worshippers of Angels, in that to the <hi>Colossians.</hi> Its opposed to
these severall faith's in a twofold respect:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As an <hi>assent,</hi> and perswasion,</item>
                  <item>2. As a confidence or reliance.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Jew believed that he might be justified by the Works of the Law, and
so trusted unto, and relied upon his own Works alone. The Judaizing
Christian believed that Christ alone without the Law could not save him, but
with the Law he might, and so his confidence was not in Christ alone, but in
Christ and the Law. The Jew, the Jewish Christian, the Philosopher, the
Worshipper of Angels, were perswaded either that Christ was needlesse; or
yet, if he was needful, he was not sufficient without the Law, or without Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
or without the Worship of Angels; and did either trust in Christ
with these, or in these without Christ; and none of these would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate
without, or with Christ, without some of these. The Doctrine
of the Gospel different from, and opposed to all these, proposeth Christ, and
him only, and Christ alone as the complete High Priest, Sacrificing himself,
and pleading his Sacrifice, as the meanes, and only meanes of justification.
Justifying faith believes all this, and out of this belief rests upon Christ,
and Christ alone, and pleads him, and him alone; and none else, nothing
else.</p>
               <p>This Faith is not a perswasion that our sins are already forgiven,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> nor a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
<hi>assent</hi> to the truths of the Gospel, concerning Christ as our Saviour;
which vanisheth with the speculation, and doth not pierce the inwards of the
soul; nor is it any kind of resting upon Christ, as our High Priest, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour;
neither is it a sincere receiving of Christ, as our Lord, and King,
much lesse is it a generall act of faith in God Redeemer, meerly considered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that generall notion.</p>
               <p>1. It cannot be a perswasion, that our sins for Christs sake are
already forgiven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For we must believe before we can be justified,
much more before we can be assured that we are justified: But this
perswasion follows justification, and remission it self. It puts the act
before the object, and the reward before the performance of the duty, and so
makes justifying faith which is antecedent, to be consequent and needlesse:
and from hence its consequent that a man may be justified without faith, by a
faith which follows justification: But these things are absurd to a considerate
Christian.</p>
               <p>2. It's not a mere speculative <hi>assent</hi> to the truths of the Gospel concerning
Christ: for it presupposeth practicall acts antecedent, and issues from a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
habit. It looketh upon, and closeth fast with the object, wherein there
be the Highest and most powerfull motives unto practise and obedience, that
ever were, or possibly can be. How is it possible that a man should believe
seriously that stupendious love of God which moved him to give his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:64164:164"/>
Son, <hi>That whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
life:</hi> and not be powerfully stirred up to love that most loving and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
God, who loved him so much? How can Faith look upon the Son of
God, blee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing and dying for his sins upon the Crosse; and not hate sin with
an eternall hatred, and give himself wholly to Christ, as infinitely more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and beneficiall to him then many Worlds? Our reformed Writers
had good reason to say, that though this faith in receiving Christ Satisfying,
meriting, interceding, was <hi>Sola,</hi> yet not <hi>Solitaria:</hi> for it must of necessity
work, and work by love: For it's a lively principle of all heavenly virtues,
and sincere obedience. That faith which is not predominant over all lusts, and a
mother of universall obedience, is no faith, whereby a man can be justifiable,
and justified.</p>
               <p>3. It's not any kind of resting upon Christ, as our High Priest, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour:
For we may rest in part on Christ, and in part on the Law and our
own Works, and in Saints and Angels, and Superstitious rites of men. We
may rest on Christ for benefit and not duty: We may rest on Christ, and yet
continue in sin, be Hypocrites, and so presume. It must be a totall, and a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
dependance with a detestation of sin.</p>
               <p>4. It's not a receiving him as Lord, and King, in that it presupposeth him
as so received already. For faith it self is a duty of obedience, and presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
a submission unto him as Lord and King, to command and bind us to
obedience. But it's one thing to receive Christ for duty, another to receive
him for benefit: Justification is a Benefit, a reward; not a duty, not an act of
obedience. And though faith receiving Christ as Priest for justification, be a
duty as doing that which is commanded, yet it's but the generall nature of it,
whereby it agrees with, and differeth not from, any duty commanded by God
Redeemer: And consider it as a duty, it's a work, and faith it self as a Work
is not justifying. But to come more closely up to the point and head of the
matter, now by some much agitated; and to speak distinctly, and pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
We may consider faith in Christ alone propitiating, and interceding for
sinful man, as a duty; and as a duty,</p>
               <p>1. In generall commanded by God Redeemer.</p>
               <p>2. As this particular duty, receiving Christ as Priest in this matter. But neither
of these wayes considered, is it a receiving Christ as Lord and King, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth
him as so received: For so to receive him is the act of submission,
or subjection, which is necessarily antecedent to the performance of any
particular obedience to any particular command, as this faith in Christ is.
Submission hath for object the power of the supreme Lord: Duty looks at the
command of the Lord acknowledged.</p>
               <p>2. Faith, this faith, may be considered as looking back upon the command,
or forward at the benefit. In the former respect it's a duty properly, in the
latter respect it's a condition, the performance whereof leads unto the receiving
of the benefit.</p>
               <p>3. Faith may look at the command, or at the promise, both parts of the Law:
and it's justifying as looking at the promise, not as resting in the performance of
the duty, though without the performance it cannot be justifying: For
these things which God hath joyned together, no man must put asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>4. Faith may be considered as having connexion with the reward, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of justification, or as having an aptitude for the connexion. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with the benefit is not Physicall, that's certain, but it's morall, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
and ariseth from Christs merit, and Gods promise; with respect unto
the merit. If Christ had not merited, God had never promised: If God had
never promised, justification had never followed upon this faith: For let a
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:64164:164"/>
man believe with the highest degree of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith in Christ, and in the greatest sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
yet justification had never followed thereupon, nor could have been
expected with any certainty, except God for Christ's sake had promised that
upon such a duty performed, justification should have followed. So that the
indissoluble connexion of this faith and justification, is, from Gods institution;
whereby he had bound himself to give the benefit, upon the performance of the
duty, to him that performeth it. Yet there is an aptitude in this duty, in this
faith to be made a condition, and have connexion, and such an aptitude as
can be in no other duty. For no other duty commanded by God-Redeemer, nor
any other act of faith but this, can receive Christ, as Priest propitiating, and
pleading the propitiation, and the promise of God for his sake, as such to give
the benefit. As receiving Christ, and the gracious promise in this manner,
it acknowledgeth mans guilt: and so renounceth all righteousnesse in himself,
acknowledgeth God the Father, and Christ the Son, the onely Redeemer, and
so gives God the greatest glory of justice, wisdome, mercy, and free grace,
and doth virtually acknowledge it self to be a gift, and performed by the Spirit
of God Redeemer; and that, as a duty, a work, an act of obedience, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
challenge any right to justification. This no other duty, no other act of
faith, no good works can do.</p>
               <p>Therefore God in his infinite Wisdome thought good to pitch upon this,
and make it the meanes, the only meanes, whereby justification both for the
right unto it, and the possession of it, should be derived from Christ meriting,
and himself promising for Christs merit.</p>
               <p>This aptitude is intrinsecall to the duty it self, the connexion is extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
for Christs merit, and Gods promise. This act of faith must look not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the promise, but at Christ, not onely at Christ but the Promise too. It
must look at Christ as sufficiently, and abundantly meriting, and that without
any Promise; and at the Promise as grounded upon Christs merit, not adding
any Meritorious Vigour unto it, but as added for mans sake, that when the
benefits were merited already, man might know them, have some hope of
them, and a remote conditional right unto them.</p>
               <p>Christ is the speciall object of our faith, and He is so, not onely in respect
of His Person, Natures, Acts, but also of His Offices: For He is King, Priest,
and Prophet, and faith receives Him in all His Offices: But this act of saith,
as a duty presupposeth Him, (as you heard before) received as King, or else
this act is no duty, no obedience; and as Prophet, or else this act could not
be a belief of the truth revealed, and taught by him infallibly, as a Prophet.
Yet if we consider the matter of this particular act believed formally, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
it's Christ as a Priest.</p>
               <p>Now let us abstract, though not seperate the generall nature of this act, as it
is a duty and a belief, according to both which, though not without either, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
presupposed both must be, it cannot be justifying faith, then it will appear
that it's properly, particularly justifying, as receiving Christ as a Priest, and as
having formerly received Him as King and Prophet. For there can be no
justification of sinful man, if we believe the whole tenour of the Gospell;
but as merited by Christ alone; and promised, as merited, and procured by
Him alone: But its no wayes merited, and procured by Him, but as a
Priest.</p>
               <p>And if it be so represented, <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> it must be so received by this
act of faith, <hi>ex parte subjecti.</hi> As the act must be conformable, so it must be
commensurable to the object represented; it must neither exceed and be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor contract and be lesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:64164:165"/>
If it be not conformable, it's irregular; if not commensurable, it's either
imperfect, and defective, or or else falls, and fancy. But the truth is, it's
impossible for an act to exceed its object, as its object.</p>
               <p>To say that faith as a duty, is justifying, will bring in all other good works,
and duties to share with it in justification. But this act of faith, truly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
renounceth all good works; even at the last judgment, as giving any right
unto justification, and eternall life. It annihilates all righteousnesse, merit,
confidence in it self, or any other thing but Christ: It rests in Christ alone,
and pleads for pardon only in his name, and urgeth Gods promise, as made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for his sake.</p>
               <p>Its the most glorifying and magnifying act that ever was performed by Man,
or Angel: It glorifies Gods mercy, and free grace in the highest degree. It
acknowledgeth on Earth, as it will be perpetually acknowledged in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
that the whole Salvation of sinfull man from the very First beginning,
unto the Last degree thereof, whereof there shall be no end, is from God's
freest love, Christs merit and intercession, his own free and gracious promise,
and the power of his own holy spirit.</p>
               <p>And since the first sin, and fall of man, it could not be otherwise: For man
lost all power to save himself, forsook the fountain of his happinesse,
made himself a slave to Sathan his deadly enemy, and deserved eternall
death.</p>
               <p>This is the duty which qualifyes the subject,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> and makes the subject ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the reward, according to the eternall, and unchangeable Laws of God-Redeemer.
It doth not justify, but makes us justifiable: To justify must be an
act of the Judge: To believe is the duty of the Subject. To the duty, man is
bound by the command: to render the reward, God is bound by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
               <p>But faith doth not only make him capacable, and a fit subject to receive justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
but upon it by vertue of the promise made in the blood of Christ, the
party thus, as thus believing, hath a right unto it. The foundation of this
right, or the title (which is sometimes taken for the right, sometimes for the
foundation of this right) is faith, but not faith as a duty performed, or such a
duty in particular, but as it is specified, and made a condition, in the grant
and promise made for Christs sake.</p>

punished.</p>

               </list>
               <p>But before I proceed to unfold the nature of it, I must digresse a little,
and examine the different opinions of men in this point.</p>
               <p>For some question whether it be a sentence properly or no: and, if it
be a sentence properly; when, and where it's passed; and, if it be
passed, whether it be a bare sentence without any execution, or
with some execution.</p>
               <p>1. That tis a sentence, most will grant; but some distinguish of, <hi>Sententia
Legis,</hi> and <hi>Sententia judicis:</hi> The one is not, the other is properly a sentence:
and this no doubt is an act of judgment, not of Legislation: For if it be
an act of Legislation, it's then onely promise: and that looks at none in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
but all in generall to whom the promise is made; and presupposeth
a duty to be performed.</p>
               <p>But justification presupposeth a particular person, a particular cause,
a duty performed, and the performance, as already past, is pleaded, and
the Judge sollicited to passe judgment accordingly. But let it be a sentence,
and that properly, and of the Judge as it is; When and where is it passed?
For passed if properly a sentence it must be. For it's not a sentence as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the breast of the Judge, but as judicially pronounced. It's not <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia,
mere concepta, sed prolata,</hi> some wayes declared.</p>
               <p>Whether for the time, is it passed in eternity before time, or in time? For
the place, whether is it passed in man, or out of man? If out of man whether
in Heauen or in Earth? If on Earth whether by God and Man? If by God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the promise of the Law, <hi>that whosoever believeth is not condemned,</hi> or
some other thing? If by man, whether by the Minister, or the Church bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or loosing so on earth, as to be bound, and loosed in Heaven? If it be,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64164:166"/>
whether it be an act of conscience, or the blessed spirit? If the spirit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be by inspiration and enthusiasm, or by some real operation? Thus the
wit of man, forsaking the rule of Gods word, will wander, and ignorance,
joyned with curiosity, will start many doubts, puzzle a clear truth; &amp; infinitely
multiply questions, not so much for edification, as destruction, and distraction.</p>
               <p>1. The sentence was not passed in eternity, and onely manifested in time:
for if it were, passed then and onely manifested now, it might from hence be
argued, that the world was created from eternity, and so is eternall; and
the glorious work of creation in the beginning, had only been a manifestation
of that, which was from everlasting.</p>
               <p>And how absurd, if not blasphemous, must such a fancy be? It is tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, that
as God before the foundation of the World, did decree all things to be
done in time, so he decreed to passe this sentence. But the decree it self,
without the issuing out, and exercise of an almighty executive power is no sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
In eternity before time, no man was created, no sin committed, no Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
promised, no law published, no duty of faith performed, no person con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed,
no promise pleaded; and therefore no sinner believing, justified.</p>
               <p>2. For the place.</p>
               <p>1. It's not passed in Heaven, and only there: for no Scripture saith so; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any meanes discovered, how the poor guilty sinner should know
whether it be past, or no; and if past, when and so till it be known to be passed,
and that certainly, the believer must alwayes be in doubt. The cause indeed is
pleaded in Heaven by the great High Priest, and his plea is effectual: But that
the sentence is always passed presently upon the cause pleaded, cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
It's true that if a man doth certainly know his faith, and the sincerity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he may certainly know his right unto justification: and so he knows his cause
to be good in Law. He is justified in law-title, that is, he is justifiable by Law.</p>
               <p>But whether this be all the justification the Scripture speaks of, especially the
Writings of the Apostles, shall be considered hereafter.</p>
               <p>3. It cannot be the sentence only of the Church or Minister, because they
do not alwayes judge, and absolve, <hi>Clave, non errante,</hi> infallibly: and so one
may be absolved on Earth, and not in Heaven; or in Heaven, and not on Earth,
either <hi>in foro interiori, aut ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>riori;</hi> as many use to expresse themselves. It's
true, that when it is exactly agreeable to Gods rule, then it's ratified in Heaven,
that is by Christ, and manifested so to be by the execution. For Gods sentence
is not a bare word, or distinct sound in the Aire.</p>
               <p>4. It's not the sentence of the conscience: For conscience is neither the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
judge, nor infallible. 5. That it's not pronounced by inspiration or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm,
as the words are ordinarily taken will easily be granted.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Whether it be signified to the soul in man by some real operation, with some
execution, is more disputable. That it is signified by some real operation of the
spirit, with execution, seems very probable, if not very certain. But let others
judge when they have considered these places following: The justified by faith
have peace with God, through our Lord Iesus Christ: by whom also they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
by faith into his grace, wherein they stand, and rejoyce in the hope of the
glory of God, &amp;c.</hi> And the love of God is shed abroad in their hearts by the holy Ghost
which is given them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. 2, 5. Believers in Christ by the spirit, mortifie the
lusts of the flesh, and are led, moved, acted by this spirit, have received the spirit
of Adoption, whereby they cry Abba Father: This spirit witnesseth to their spirit that
they are the Sons of God, &amp; having the first fruits of the spirit, they groan within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
waiting for the Adoption the Redemption of their body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13, 14, 15, 16, 23.
Now he that stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us is God, who hath
also sealed us, and given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. 22. We
know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the Brethren, 1 <hi>Ioh. 3.

written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17.</p>

1. All these places, with many more, speak not onely of Believers, but Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
justified, and in this life.</p>
               <p>2. All these places, either expresly, or by consequence, speak of the Spirit of
God, and of this Spirit in us, and the effects of this Spirit in particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>3. The Effects are Divine, and such as onely God can produce.</p>
               <p>4. These Effects are the shedding of the love of God; that is, the Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the evident and abundant manifestation of God's special love, accepting us
to Eternal Life, the Sanctification of the Spirit, and enabling them to mortifie
the Deeds of the Flesh, and acting them to Obedience; Adoption, whereby
call upon God as a Father, their Father, and giving them boldness and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to approach the Throne of Grace; testifying inwardly, testifying in them,
and to them, that they in particular are the Sons of God, and Heirs of Glory, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them assurance of Eternal Glory, as giving the first-fruits thereof, being a
Seal, and Earnest of the same, making them know, and certainly know, that they
are passed from Death to Life, and that God is in them, and they in God, and that
God abides in them, and they abide in God.</p>
               <p>5. All these signifie and declare, and that evidently, that there is a great change
wrought in them, both for disposition, and condition. For disposition, they are
regenerate, and sanctified: For condition, they are in the state of Life, not of
Death; of Salvation, not of Damnation; and neither of these can be without
Justification actual. And this change is the more evident, because the Spirit
abides in them constantly, as a constant Spring of Sanctification, and unspeakable
consolation, and joy.</p>
               <p>6. Therefore, God by this Spirit in them, by these Effects, and real operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
speaks plainly, with some execution, that particular persons, in this life, are
justifyed; not merely by the Promise of the Law, but the Sentence of the great
Judge. God's Word is not like man's word, which is a bare sound, but it's a
Word with power: It's like the Word of Creation, saying, <hi>Let there be Light,</hi>
and there was Light; like the Word of Christ, to the man of the Palsie, <hi>Arise,
take up thy bed, and walk;</hi> and presently the thing is done: Health, and Strength
is given: He takes up his bed, and walks, and so his sins were forgiven, and the
remission was signified by a real operation, and word of power. And certainly,
there is no greater Evidence of sin past, forgiven, then power given to subdue sin
for the time to come: and after fear sorrow, and trouble of men; sweet peace,
joy, and Heavenly Consolation. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> this Word, which the Spirit speaks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
is the very same Word, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Word, which the Spirit speaks without us,
in the Scripture. Yet with this difference, that there it is a Promise made to all
Believers in general; here, a Word, with performance, unto particular Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
The Word is not the Sentence of the Conscience. The Witness of the
Spirit, is not the Witness of Conscience. The Sentence of the Spirit is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
the Sentence of the Conscience is fallible. The Spirit is the Supream Judge
by which God so justifies, as no man can condemn; the Conscience is an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and subordinate Judge, and the Sentence thereof may be revoked, and made
void. The Spirit speaks with power, and produceth Divine Effects, and in the
very Soul, and such as neither Man nor Angels can produce: These, or like
Effects, the Conscience cannot reach. If any say, or ask, How can God pass this
Sentence, but by the Conscience? It's answered, That such men seem to be
ignorant, what the Conscience is, and what the Sentence of it is; what the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Sentences of the Conscience, before, and after Justification be. The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Spirit is a principle; but that of the Conscience, a conclusion: And
the Spirit must speak by these real Effects, before Conscience can certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Justification to be past, or the state of Justification to be present.</p>

But this Point will receive some further Light,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> after that we understand
what this Judicial Act of Justification is: Yet here ye must know, that the act
of Justification is one thing, and the state of the party justified is another; and
they must be distinguished as cause, and effect. The general nature of it is, that it
is not the Promise of the Law, nor the convention of the party to be judged, nor
the discussion of the cause, but it's a Sentence. Yet because there's a Sentence
against a party, and a Sentence for him: the one whereof is called <hi>Absolution;</hi>
the other, <hi>Condemnation;</hi> it's that of <hi>Absolution,</hi> called Justification: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it's opposed to <hi>Condemnation,</hi> Rom. 5. 16. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 33, 34. This Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
follows Christ's Intercession, which is opposed to the Devil's Accusation.
The party sentenced, is a sinner guilty, and unjust, and so condemnable by the
Law of Works; yet believing in Christ, and so justifiable by the Law of Grace.
This Sentence is not like the Sentence of Man, which many times being onely
in words is antecedent unto, and separated from the Execution, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
follows, sometimes fails; but it's pronounced by God with power, and is
always executed: and many times, if not always joyned, if not the same with
execution, as the Sentence of <hi>Phineas</hi> was. This Sentence doth not take away
sin, so as to make it no sin, or that which was done, not to be done: neither
doth it take away the desert of sinne committed: neither doth it abrogate the
Law, or relax, and abate the power of it, either in the Prohibition, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
Neither doth it prevent the guilt of sin, nor the shame, sorrow fear,
hatred, which follow upon sin, and go before Judgment. But the proper act
thereof is known by the effect, which is a freedom of the sinner from the guilt of
sin wherewith he is chargeable, and for which he is condemnable and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
For the end of it, it is not to destroy the sinner, but to remove the sin, in
the consequents thereof, so that it be not his ruine. Yet ye must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</p>
               <p>1. That to take away the guilt, is to take away the condemnation, and the
punishment too. <hi>For there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ,</hi> &amp;c. Rom.
8. 1.</p>
               <p>2. Though guilt cannot be taken away by prevention, but removal; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
and punishment may be taken away, both by removal and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For if the Sentence of Condemnation be past, and the Punishment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
inflicted, then there is no way to take them away but by removal, which
is by nulling the Sentence, and taking off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Punishment. Thus the Sentence
passed upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his, is revoke, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Justification in Christ, and the
Punishment removed.</p>
               <p>3 Freedom from Obligation, may be total, or partial: if it be total, the puish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is totally prevented, or removed; if partial, it is not,</p>
               <p>4 If any punishment lie still upon the party justifyed, the Obligation is not
wholly taken away; for if it were, the punishment would be unjust: for where
there is no guilt, there can be no just punishment.</p>
               <p>5 He that is totally freed from the punishment, is totally freed from the
guilt and obligation.</p>
               <p>6 That Believer, which is justifyed by God, is freed from the Eternal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by way of prevention, though not wholly, from either Temporal or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
punishments. For the state of the justifyed, is inconsistent with the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
unto Eternal Death, whether it be in privative loss, or positive torment.
Otherwise, the Apostles arguing from justification, to conclude freedom from
Condemnation, and a certain right unto Eternal Glory, was invalid.</p>
               <p>7 Justifyed persons, once entred into the state of Justification, may sin and
contract new guilt: and by the same means, they obtained mercy at the first,
they must seek freedom from new-ly contracted guilt, and use the means to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
and evidence their Title to Eternal Glory. Yet this new guilt is not a
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:64164:167"/>
total intercision of Justification, or putting them wholly out of the state of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
to make their condition such as it was before they believed. For
whilest there is the Root and Habit of justifying Faith in them, they have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
and virtual, though not an immediate actual right unto the reward. And
if God put His fear into their inward parts, so as they shall never depart from
him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. Then certainly, He, by that Promise, is bound to preserve, and
revive that Faith, and not suffer it to be totally lost in it self, or to be finally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.
That Promise is of the same nature with the former, in <hi>Chapter 31,
33,</hi> 34. But something of this, hereafter.</p>
               <p>8 There never was any man justified by God, but he was instantly put in the
state of Justification. But this cannot be done without some execution: and in
this respect, though we may distinguish between the Sentence and Execution,
yet we must not separate them. For though the final Judgment be so described,
<hi>Math.</hi> 25. from the 31. unto the end of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> as that the Sentence of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Reward is represented as pronounced first; and, after that, the Sentence of
punishment, and both, before the Execution: Yet,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Any man may easily understand, that the final Judgment is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
there after the manner of Humane Judgments, and in some
sort parabolically.</item>
                  <item>2. In other places, we find the Judgment and Execution the
same.</item>
                  <item>3. Neither is it evident from that very place, that the Sentence and
Execution were separate. For though the Sentence be related be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as separate from the Execution: yet it doth not follow, that
because it is so in the relation, therefore it shall be so indeed: For
the very saying, <hi>Go ye cursed,</hi> &amp;c. might be the very casting of the
wicked into Hell.</item>
                  <item>4 Suppose it should be so; yet it doth not follow, that it shall be so in
our Justification in this life. That the Sentence, and the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be considered under distinct Notions, I do not deny. The
Scripture doth sometime so represent them.</item>
               </list>
               <p>9 Though the state of Justification be begun, <hi>Simul &amp; Semel;</hi> yet it's not
perfected, but by degrees. For all our life, after our first entrance into that estate,
should be a continued Repentance and Faith, every day renewed, and exercised,
till we attain perfection.</p>
               <p>10 This state of Justification once begun, doth not prevent all future guilt
contracted by sins afterwards committed, though it prevents such a guilt, as lay
upon us before we were first converted. The reason hereof will be manifest
hereafter. Whether there be two parts of this Sentence; the one, remission of
sin; the other, imputation of Christ's Righteousness, shall be examined anon.</p>
               <p>That we may understand the Nature of this Act of Justification more
fully,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IX</label> we must</p>
               <p>1 Remember, that it's a freedom from the guilt and obligation, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and by consequence, from the punishment.</p>
               <p>2 That it is an Act of the Supream Judge, who so justifies, that no one can
condemn, and is passed upon the intercession of Christ, who so pleads, that none
can lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect: For who shall lay any thing
to the charge of God's Elect, for whom Christ not onely dyed, but role again,
and ascended into Heaven, to make intercession for them there? <hi>It's God that
justifieth, who is he that condemneth?</hi> Rom. 8. 33, 34.</p>
               <p>3 We must consider the punishments, whereunto the sinner to be justified,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:64164:168"/>
is liable, as either justly suffering them, or bound in strict Justice to suffer
them.</p>
               <p>4 These punishments are Temporal, or Spiritual, as opposed to Temporal:
For, otherwise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bodily punishments, which we call Temporal, may, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
be Eternal. To pass by, therefore, these Temporal Penalties, one Spiritual
Punishment, and the greatest, is the want and loss of the Holy Spirit, to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
and constant Principle, and cause of Sanctification. This Spirit was given
Man in the day of his Creation and was taken away from <hi>Adam;</hi> and, in him,
from all his Posterity, by the judgment of God, and a Sentence yet in power
and force, and to continue to the end of the World. The Law, indeed, of Works,
is ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ogated; but it was in force at that very time when the Sentence was pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and upon the Promise of Christ, the Law was abrogated, as a Law of Works;
but the Sentence remained in force still. Concerning the sanctifying Spirit, we
may observe, and consider,</p>
               <p>1 That the loss, and so the want of it, is a punishment.</p>
               <p>2 This punishment, lying upon every Man before this Spirit be restored,
presupposeth a guilt.</p>
               <p>3 This punishment and guilt is never taken away, till this Spirit be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored.</p>
               <p>4 This Spirit may be testored for preparation of a sinner for justification, or
in, and after, to continue as a constant cause of Sanctification: Or, as others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it, for perpetual Habitation, to prevent the Dominion of Sin, and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for time to come. It doth not prevent all sin, and so the contracting of
new guilt nor is given in that measure to us: and this is the reason, why your
estate of Justification is not perfect at the first.</p>
               <p>5 God never justifies any man with that justification, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in
the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> and elsewhere; but in justifying them,
He gave them instantly this Spirit; as the Spirit of Christ, to be in them, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
cause of Regeneration, and Sanctification: and, therefore, that Justification
is not without some Execution.</p>
               <p>6 Consider this restoring of the Spirit, as the removal of a Punishment, and
the loss and want of the Spirit as a Punishment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it must needs be essentially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in Justification, and Remission of Sin. For that which</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Takes away the Punishment of sin; And,</item>
                  <item>2 The Guilt and Obligation unto Punishment, is, properly remission
of sin. If the Punishment, as a Punishment, should remain so far
as it doth remain, it doth invincibly prove, that the guilt is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, so far, and in that respect. If any distinguish of the
Sentence and Execution, and make the one, the cause; the other,
the effect; I will not quarrel about words: Onely I will demand,
Whether it's not better to say, in this particular judgment of God,
that the Sentence and Execution are really the same, and differ
onely in respect, or at most in degree.</item>
               </list>
               <p>7 The active sanctification of this Spirit, taken in it self, either habitually, or
actually, and as inherent in us, can in no wise be Justification, or any Branch of
Justification, as Justification is a remission of sins. For God gave this Spirit to
Angels He gave it to <hi>Adam</hi> in the day of Creation; and this Spirit did sanctifie,
and now doth sanctifie the blessed Angels: yet this Sanctification is not re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mission.
But consider remission of sin, as a removal of punishment as punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whether of sense or loss, deserved by sin, and the loss of the Spirit, and the
blindness, perversness, and slavery under the power of Sathan, following necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
upon the taking away, and denying the Spirit by a just Judgment, as a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty;
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:64164:168"/>
then this restoring of the Spirit must needs put on another Notion, as it
hath another Nature. This restoring of the Spirit is so necessary, that a bare
Sentence, without it, can give a man no comfort; nay, Heaven, without it, is no
Heaven, or place of Bliss, and abode.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But lest I may be thought to agree with the Doctrine of the Councel of</hi>
Trent, <hi>or at least come too near it; Let us consider what they say: Their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
Sess. 6. Cap. 7. <hi>is this:</hi> That Justification is not onely remission of sins, but
also the sanctification and renovation of the Inner-Man, by the susception of Grace,
and Gifts; whereby, or whereupon, a man of unjust, is made just, and of an Enemy a
Friend, that he may be an Heir, according to the hope of Eternal Life. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
The onely formal cause of Justification, is the Righteousness of God, not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he is just but whereby He makes us just, They mean inherently just. <hi>Thus far
they. Now let's examine, Whether, there be any Agreement between the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Doctrine and this: And</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 I grant, with all our Divines, that Justification and Sanctification, go al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
inseparably together: and this they of <hi>Rome</hi> know well enough, to have
been always the constant Doctrine of the Reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>2 They say that Justification is not onely remission of sins, but <hi>Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
I say it's onely remission.</p>
               <p>3 They assert, that this Sanctification and Renovation is by voluntary Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
and so understand this Sanctification passively, as formally inherent; I
make neither Sanctification active, nor much less passive, as considered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be justification, nor any part of justification.</p>
               <p>4 They make the formal cause of Justification, to be this Sanctification, I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
disclaim this. I had said before, that Sanctification in it self is no remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and is in Angels without any such thing: and do affirm, that this Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as they understand it, is no part of that justification which the Gospel
speaks of: and that the restoring of the sanctifying Spirit for Renovation, as an
act of God, as Judge, for to remove a punishment, as a punishment; and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
thereunto is properly remission. And here I cannot but much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what these <hi>Tridentine Divines</hi> did understand by Remission: For if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
cause of Justification, be Sanctification, and inherent Righteousness, as they
make it so to be, I find no place, nor need of any place, for remission: Yet first they
make it a part of Justification distinct from Sanctification. It's neither final,
nor efficient, nor meritorious, nor material; neither by their own words can it
enter the formal. That this Sanctification considered in it self, especially Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and inherent, cannot be Justification, is evident: For,</p>
               <p>1 Sanctification, thus understood, is not properly any act of God, as a Judge,
much less a Sentence passed upon a guilty Wretch.</p>
               <p>2 That justification of Believers, in this life, whereof the Scripture speaks,
doth leave the party chargeable with no sin, is perfect, and bears out the severity
of God's Justice before His Throne. This our inherent Righteousness, in this
life, can never do, both because we are guilty before, and also it's imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>3 A man may be sanctifyed, and that perfectly, so as to prevent all sin for
time to come, and yet the party may remain guilty, and liable to Eternal Death
for the guilt of former sins committed before this Sanctification, and not remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by it. Some make remission two-fold, <hi>Remissio Culpae, Remissio Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi>

               <p>The Learned and profound <hi>Bradwardine</hi> understands it so, that the former, of
unjust, makes a man just and holy; the latter renders him, of miserable happy:
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:64164:169"/>
The one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> takes away sin to come; the other, the punishment of sin past: The
former is Sanctification, as we understand it: The latter is Justification pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly.
Here it's remarkable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that He makes both the one, and the other to be
Remission, contrary to the Doctrine of <hi>Trent:</hi> yet, to speak properly, there is no
remission of sin, as sin, but of the guilt and punishment of sin.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>X</label> three Questions are briefly to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>1 Whether God, at the first Justifycation, or in remission of particular sins,
after the first Justifycation, doth totally remit, and justifie at once; or sometimes,
nay often, in part.</p>
               <p>2 Whether there be two parts of <hi>Justification:</hi> the first whereof, is remission
of sin: the second, the imputation of Christ's Righteousness?</p>
               <p>3 Whether good Works be a condition of <hi>Justification</hi> continued, and of
final <hi>Absolution?</hi>
               </p>
               <div n="1" type="question">
                  <head>QVEST. I.</head>
                  <p>FOr this, we have the Example of <hi>David;</hi> who, after his first justifycation,
contracts the guilt of two heynous sins, <hi>Adultery,</hi> and <hi>Murder.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Nathan</hi> is sent by God to reprove him, and charge him with them, Upon
this, through the mercy of God, and the Spirit, renewing him, he confesseth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth
prayeth. <hi>Nathan</hi> returns from God, declareth the Sentence of <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi>
and saith, <hi>Thou shalt not die.</hi> Yet withall, lets him know, that the Child
should die, the Sword should not depart from his house; his Concubines should
be defiled in the sight of the Sun, and all <hi>Israel:</hi> And all these things came to
pass; the event was answerable, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 11, 12, 13, 14. where many things
are remarkable; As,</p>
                  <p>1. That a Regenerate Man (though not as Regenerate, yet Regenerate) may
sin grievously, and so as to deserve Death: and if Death be due to sinne;
Eternal Death: yet in such a person removeable, and not onely so; but remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
in that manner, as it is in no unregenerate man. For whilest there is Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Faith, and Repentance, though for the time dormant, and not acting, the
Covenant of Grace is not totally violated, because the Condition of it is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Faith; both which were in <hi>David,</hi> though, through negligence, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
sins, divine desertion, for a time, were laid asleep, or stupifyed. For onely a
total <hi>Apostasie,</hi> and a final Desertion, takes these away wholly: neither of which
can be affirmed, and proved of <hi>David:</hi> whom God did not regenerate again,
but renew and stir up. This the Author of <hi>Censura Censurae</hi> doth confess: and
further saith, That he lost not <hi>Spiritum Regenerantem, sed obsignantem</hi> For the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of the Spirit, both as sanctifying, and sealing, was abated, and little or none
for the time.</p>
                  <p>3 God saith, Thy sin is forgiven thee: <hi>Thou shalt not die:</hi> Yet he must suffer,
and for these very sins, which are said to be forgiven, which doth teach us,
that</p>

                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:64164:169"/>
The Obligation to Punishment was not wholly taken away, but in part
onely; yet in the principal part. The Remission, therefore at that
time was not total, but partial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it was Remission, and Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>3 In the same kind he sinned, he was punished. He sinned in Adultery, and
the Sword: By Adultery, and the Sword, he is punished. This is a fair War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to God's Regenerate Saints, <hi>To watch, and pray,</hi> and beware of
grieving that good Spirit wherewith they are sealed till the Day of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
                  <p>4 He suffers all this in His Children, in the Child begotten, and conceived
in Adultery, in <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Tamar,</hi> in <hi>Absolon,</hi> and his Concubines.</p>
                  <p>This proves clearly, that Parents and Children, the Head of the Family, and
the Family are considered, by God, as one Person, in Law, and that in Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Whether there be two Parts of Justification, Remission, and Imputation of
Christ's Righteousness?</head>
                  <p>FOr Answer whereunto, it may be</p>
                  <p>1 Remembred, what I have said formerly against Imputation of Christs
active Righteousness separated, or abstracted for Reward from the
Passive. The Reasons against this Opinion, seem to me strong;
yet when I find the force of them dissolved, I shall abate of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
                  <p>2 If we examine the Doctrine of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> and other Scriptures,
we shall find (if I very much mistake not) that Remission and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Righteousness, are taken for the same. We read that
<hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, and it was counted to him for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3. Now to him that worketh, is the Reward not recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of Grace but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Debt. But to him that worketh not, but belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
on him that justifyeth the Ungodly, his Faith is counted for
Righteousness, <hi>Vers.</hi> 4, 5. Even as <hi>David</hi> describeth also the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
of the Man to whom God imputeth Righteousness without
Works, saying, Blessed is the Man whose Iniquities are forgiven,
and whose sins are covered: Blessed is the man to whom the
Lord imputeth not sin, <hi>Vers.</hi> 6, 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. And therefore it was imputed
to him for Righteousness. Now it was not written for his sake alone,
that it was imputed to him, but for us to whom it shall be imputed,
if we believe in Him, who raised up Jesus our Lord from the Dead,
<hi>Vers.</hi> 22, 23, 24. Here many things are very observable,</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, that is, as the <hi>Chaldie Paraphrast</hi> turns it, <hi>In the
word of Johovah,</hi> in that word, which being with God, in the beginning was
God, by which the World was made, and who was made flesh, and to whom the
Lord said, <hi>Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine Enemies thy Foot-stool.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:64164:170"/>
2 It was reckoned to him for Righteousness, that is, his Faith, or in that
he believed in that Eternal Word <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> to be incarnate. The plain mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
whereof is, that he judged him believing in Christ to be righteous by
Christ.</p>
                  <p>3 To him that worketh, that is, to him that so worketh, or obeyeth, as not to
disobey, nor sin at all, the Reward of Righteousness is adjudged to him, as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
perfectly; as of Debt by the Law of Works, not of Grace by the Law of
Redemption.</p>
                  <p>4 God justifieth the Ungodly, or the Sinner, and the Guilty Person; not as
such, but believing on him that justifieth the guilty; yet as Penitent, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
                  <p>5 This Imputation of Righteousness, is the forgiveness of sin: for to have
Faith counted, or imputed for Righteousness, is explained by <hi>David,</hi> to have sin
forgiven, covered, not imputed.</p>
                  <p>6 The estate of the Party justified, even in this life, is blessed, and very happy.
<hi>Blessed is he whose sin is forgiven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>7 That the Party to whom Righteousness is imputed, is he that believeth on
him that raised up Christ from the Dead; not he that believeth that Christ per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
perfect obedience active to the Law in his Person. For though he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
obeyed the Law, as without which he could not have offered himself an
un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>potted Sacrifice for us; yet He did it not, that that active personal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
should be imputed to us. Though God in His absolute Power might have
done so; yet His Wisdom did not think good to do it; neither do we read that
he doth it. The principal thing to be noted, is, that this is the principal, if not
the onely place, that speaks of Imputation of Righteousness; and this
Imputation is Remission of Sinne, by a Sentence of the Supream
Judge.</p>
                  <p>3 Remission, and Justification, and Eternal Life, is ascribed to the
Sacrifice of Christ's Death, as the meritorious cause thereof, in
many other places, especially <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. And Christ is said by one
Offering to have perfected, that is, consecrated the Sanctified for
ever, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 14. To be consecrated for ever, is to be made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Priest to serve the Living God in the Temple of Heaven, and
to be eternally glorified: And this is ascribed to the <hi>Death</hi> and
<hi>Offering</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>

                  <head>QUESTION III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Whether Justification, continued, and finally consummate, be by Works, and not
by faith alone, as the first Justification is?</head>
                  <p>MIne Answer hereunto is negative,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XII</label> that neither Justification continued,
nor finally consummate, is by Works, but faith onely, though that faith
be not alone. For the Scriptures inform us that there is but one way of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of a sinfull man, and that is by faith in Christ. For seeing the Apostle
determines but two wayes possible, the one by Works, the other by faith, and
proves that no man living, by Works can be justified in God's sight, because all
are sinfull, no man, no, not the best, without sin, no man performs perfect,
and perpetuall Obedience, it seems strange to me, that any man should affirm
that Justification, either continued or finall, should be by Works. If it be by
Works, then the reward of Righteousnesse is of debt, according to the Law
of Works, and then it's not of Grace. If it be by works, then works must be
perfect, and such as can endure the severity of God's Justice, at our last triall.
If by works, then the worker is so righteous in himself by reason of them, that
no one can lay any thing to his charge: For Justification first and last must
look upon man, as chargeable with no sin, otherwise he will not be justifiable
by the most just God: But no works of man are such. If by works, then by
faith as a work we may be justified; but that cannot be. If by works, then
works may receive Chirst, as our Propitiatour, and Intercessour: But that's
the proper act of faith. If by works, then we receive not the reward of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
and eternall Glory, as merited by Christ, and derived immediately
from Christ to us, as believing on him, and renouncing all righteousnesse in
our selves. If by works, then our finall Justification is not a Remission of sin.
If by good works, then our good works may be pleaded in the title unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
and eternal life, before the Tribunal of God: But the Promise it
self, and the Reward promised were merited by Christ, and God promiseth
this righteousnesse, and reward, for Christ's sake, and for his sake alone, and
he promiseth it unto him, and onely unto him, that resteth upon Christ, and
Christ alone, for it, and pleads Christ's merit, and onely Christ's merit, upon
the promise of God. If by good works, then good works can expiate our sins,
and satisfy for our evill works. If by works, then there is some promise made
in the Gospel to justifie us by them, and as righteous through them; and so
righteous, that we need not plead Christ, or remission upon Christ's propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But there is no such promise in the Gospel. The Law indeed saith
<hi>Do this, and live;</hi> But the Gospel saith, Confesse with thy mouth the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and believe in thine heart, that God hath raised him from the dead, and
thou shalt be saved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. If by works, then why doth the Apostle
say, <hi>By Grace you are saved, through Faith, and that not of your selves; it is the
gift of God. Not of works</hi> &amp;c.? Why might he not as well have said, By
Grace ye are saved, through faith and works? It was as easy for him to say the
one as the other. The power to do good works, and our doing of them is a
reward derived from Christ by faith. For we are his workmanship, created
in Christ Jesus unto good works, <hi>Ephes. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 8, 9, 10. After that we are once
ingrafted into Christ Jesus, we derive all the good from first to last, whether
for duty or reward from him. All the vertues which we have; all the good
works, which we do on earth, or in heaven, presuppose us in Christ, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by, and for, his merits, All good works of regenerate persons are vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
in faith receiving Christ, and no such faith continuing can be without
good works. It is certain that as God in the Gospell commands good works,
commends such as do them, promiseth rewards unto Well-doers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o he will in
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:64164:171"/>
his last Judgment justifie good Works, and the doers of them, so as <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is justified of her Children:</hi> But this Justification is onely Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
whereby man may justify God, as well as God justify man in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Therefore we must needs say, that as good Works are commanded by
God, pleasing unto God, so they are approved and rewarded of God. They,
so farr as good, prevent future guilt, take away no former guilt, do evidence
our faith, and Title, unto everlasting Glory, strengthen our union with Christ,
because they strengthen faith, confirm our hope, glorify God, give good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
unto men, make us more capable of Communion with God, tend towards
the possession of Glory, distinguish us from the prophane, and hypocrites,
give some content to our Consciences, and there is a kind of happinesse in the
doing of them, and in the remembrance of them done: Blessed are they who
alwayes abound in them; For they know that their labour is not in vain in
the Lord. Yet <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> though a great advancer of <hi>Merit,</hi> thought it not
onely safe, but the <hi>safest Way,</hi> to put our whole and sole trust, not in these our
good Works, but in Christ. But it is not onely the safest, but the onely way
so to do, if we would be justified before God. To say, that good Works are a
condition of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace; we shall be judged according to our
works; remission of Sin is promised to such as forgive others, and that such as
love God, fear him, serve him, do his commandements, shall be rewarded, and
have eternall life, therefore We are not justified by faith alone, but by good
works also, is no good arguing. If the Sequel be denied, as it must be, no
wit of man can prove it, and make it good. They may be a condition of the
Covenant, yet not such a condition as faith, receiving Christ as Propitiatour,
and Advocate, and resting upon God's Promise in him alone: and such must
of necessity be that condition, whereby we are justified, and stand blamelesse,
and without Spot, before the Throne of God. Though we shall be judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our works, it doth not hence follow that we shall be justified by our
works. In the matter of Judgment, and the Cause to be tried, there are two
things; the <hi>Merit,</hi> and the <hi>Evidence:</hi> And who dare say, that good works are
the <hi>merit</hi> of the cause, which are only the Evidence? <hi>Gregory the Great</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
in this case, &amp; saith we shall be judged, and so rewarded, <hi>Secundum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sed
non propter Opera.</hi> Where Promises of Life, Blessing, Reward, and of Glory, and
of Remission of Sin, are made to such as do works of Mercy; or suffer for
Christ's sake, or love God, or serve and fear him, we must observe that where
any one of these is named, all the rest are meant; and that the Person qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with one is qualified with all: and the reason is, because there is such a
connexion between them, that where one is predominant, and in sincerity,
all the rest are inseparably joyned. Yet none of these can be, where faith in
Christ is not; neither can a living faith continue, without all these, or any of
these; and where such a faith is not, none of these can be, in such a Subject,
or if they could be without it, yet without it, they could not be acceptable,
nor rewardable. Neither could this qualifie the Person aright, nor faith qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify
aright if it were not fixed on Christ. The Apostle <hi>James</hi> indeed saith,
that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by works; and that by works a man is justified,
and not by faith onely, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 23. Yet we must consider</p>
                  <p>1. That he speaks of the same justification of <hi>Abraham,</hi> wherein <hi>Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanceth,
who affirmeth that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by faith, and not by
works and proves it out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 12.</p>
                  <p>2. That <hi>James</hi> speaks against such as professe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith without practise: and
his principall Scope is to shew that a vain faith, a dead faith, a faith without
works, the faith of Devills, which may be in Devills, cannot justify, nor can
any man be justified by such a faith; and implies, that when <hi>Paul</hi> or any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
speaks of justifying faith, they do not mean such a faith; and that no
<hi>Solifidian</hi> can be justified at all before God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:64164:171"/>
He speaks of such works as follow faith, and Justification by saith, which
did evidently prove the sincerity of their faith, and the certainty of their Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
One cause of this mistake, both in them of <hi>Rome,</hi> and others, is;</p>
                  <p>1. Because they do not consider that the Righteousnesse required before
the Judgment Seat of God, especially, at last triall, must be perfect, and such
as the party to be justified cannot by law, that Law, which should be the Rule
of Judgment, be chargeable with any the least Sin.</p>
                  <p>2. They do not consider that the party to be justified is in himself a guilty
Sinner, and as such, can in no wise be justifiable before the most just, and sin-detesting
Judge.</p>
                  <p>3. That the Justification, so much spoken of in Scripture, especially, in the
Apostles <hi>writings,</hi> is Remission, and onely Remission of Sin; in which respect,
no man guilty can be justified by Works. For all the good works a man can
do in a thousand years cannot expiate one Sin antecedent, intervenient, or
consequent, nor free him from the guilt of eternall death. <hi>Austin</hi> saith tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that our righteousnesse is true, because referred to the right end, yet in this
life it consists, <hi>potius remissione Peccatorum, quàm perfectione Virtutum,</hi> rather
in Remission of Sin then perfection of Virtue. For as he manifestly shews,
our righteousnesse of good works is imperfect, many wayes imperfect; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he exhorts us to give thanks to God for our good works; whereby he
implies that they are God's gifts, and more God's then ours. And certainly
they are so, and God never gave them to us that we should stand upon Terms
with God, and plead that the Righteousnesse of them was such as, that for
them, he in Justice was bound to justify them. No penitent Sinner dare
plead so; No wise man will plead so: and the best of men in that last day of
Triall will wave the Plea of Works, and will onely plead God'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

because God hath freed us from the Dominion of Sin, and the Power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,

<hi>God</hi> did never ordain good works, which are the fruits of a sincere faith in
Christ, to acquire a right unto Remission of Sin, and eternall life, but to be a
means, whereby we may obtain the Possession of these Rewards he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.

the true Scope of the Apostle can hardly avoid it; but must contradict the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine

Works, for the main, use the same arguments to maintain it, and give the same
Answers, to Objections against it, which they do; though, in some Terms,
and Circumstances, they may differ.</p>

the several Branches, or Parts, and degrees thereof, if we may so call them;
and the continuance of them to us, till the final, and universal Judgment of our
great and glorious <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>King-Redeemer.</hi> These are <hi>Regeneration, Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
Adoption, Ministery of Angels,</hi> and the rest. And they may be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 As they free us from the guilt and punishment of sin; Whether the
punishment be privative, or positive.</item>
                  <item>2 As they make the estate of the justified person, of miserable, to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and blessed.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The first is <hi>Regeneration;</hi> which, in the Execution of this great and special
Judgment, frees us from that great Penalty of Original Unrighteousness, the
Dominion of sin, and slavery under Sathan: of this you have heard before, and
shall hear more distinctly and particularly of it, in the continuance hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>For the first thing in order, though not in time, seeing all go together, is, the
restoring of the regenerating and sanctifying Spirit to abide in us, after it hath
prepared us: and it is so necessary a part of Justification, that if we distinguish
between the Sentence removing the guilt, and the Execution removing the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
the Sentence without the Execution could be little advantage unto
us, nor could it minister any comfort. And God knowing this, doth alwayes,
in this particular, declare the Sentence by the Execution, and never did justify
and person, and left him unsanctified. And, by this Sactification, doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
testify unto the party justified, that he hath freed him from the guilt and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to the greatest Punishment of all.</p>
               <p>Yet this Regeneration is not perfect at the first, neither shall be fully perfect
in Body and Soul, untill the Resurrection. This must needs be the first part of
branch; because all that follow depend upon it, and without it we are unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of them. For as God, for order, so far as our shallow capacity will
reach, is first conceived to be holy, before he be conceived as happy, so man
must needs be.</p>
               <p>The greatest, and first, penalty for Sin, was to take away the sanctifying Spirit;
and the greatest mercy is, to restore it again. And this, as all the rest, is derived
immediatly from Christ believed upon. For, by faith, we first have Union &amp; then
Communion with him, and derive both Grace, and Peace, from God the Father,
and his Son Jesus Christ: and are blessed in him with all spirituall Blessings.
It's called Regeneration, because we are by it delivered from that most fearfull
death, we call the death of Sin, and receive a new, and spirituall life, being cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
anew, according to his Image, in Righteousnesse and true Holinesse. It
may be said to be begun (though at some distance) in Vocation, when ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Hearts are first prepared for, then informed with, Faith, and so we are ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into Christ, and made one with him. Yet all this was but a preparation
for it, and tending unto it, to complete our union with our Saviour. And when
we are once united, that Spirit which did onely prepare us is given to abide in
us constantly, and first as a Spirit of <hi>Sanctification.</hi> In this, the foundation of
eternall Joy, and Glory, is laid, and now we begin to move directly towards
our full happinesse. This not onely takes away former guilt, but the very Root
of former guilt of Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:64164:172"/>
The second Branch is our Reconciliation:<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XI</label> for being justified by Faith, we
have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have
accesse into the Grace wherein we stand. This is said to be an effect of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
strictly taken. In the words of the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2. we must
consider</p>
               <list>

               </list>
               <p>1. Because Reconciliation presupposeth Emnity, therefore the condition of
the party to be reconciled must be, that he is at <hi>Emnity</hi> with God, and God at
<hi>Emnity</hi> with him. There is Emnity between them: and this is a very sad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to be at Emnity with that God, in whom all our comfort is, and upon
whose favour depends our spirituall and eternall happinesse. The cause of
this <hi>Emnity</hi> is Sin, considered either in the habit, or in the act, or guilt. By
the habit, and the act, we are contrary to God as just and holy: and God must
needs abhorr us. Therefore the Scripture represents Sin, as base, and filthy,
polluting the Sinner; and God, as pure, and holy, hating, detesting, abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
sin. For nothing is so contrary to God, and so odious in his sight, as sinne.
Therefore is it said, <hi>Thou art not a God that hast pleasure in Wickedness, neither
shall evil dwell with thee. The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: Thou hatest the
Workers of Iniquity,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Psal. 5. 4, 5. <hi>And thou art of purer eyes then to behold evil, and
canst not look upon Iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1. 13. <hi>And there shall in no wise enter into the new
and holy</hi> Jerusalem <hi>any thing that defileth,</hi> Rev. 21. 27. And, <hi>without,</hi> as in no wise
admitted to enter, <hi>are Dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murderers, and
Idolaters, and who so maketh a Lye,</hi> Rev. 22. 15. That is, men polluted and defiled
with sin, are uncapable of this Society, and communion with the most holy God,
and his most holy people. Nay we are commanded to be holy, as He is holy:
and if we be not so, He will not admit us into his presence hear our Prayers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
our Persons, or our Service: nay, He will cast us out of His Presence. And
though He may love us as Men, yet He cannot love us as polluted with sin. As
sin, so the Emnity begins on our part: for we first sin, and so are alienated, and
Enemies, in, or by, our mind by wicked Works, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. Where the Learned
Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> observes,</p>
               <p>1 The miserable estate of those <hi>Colossians,</hi> before they were reconciled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it was an estate of Emnity and Hostility. And,</p>
               <p>2 The cause, and that was the mind in sin, set on sin: so he, with <hi>Beza,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
it. The first Emnity therefore is from sin, as sin. But this is not all; for
sin, as a transgression of the Law of God threatning punishment, offends God,
and provokes him to anger, as it makes man liable to punishment. So as that
God, who as merciful, is inclined to reward, as just is bent to punish, and so
not onely take away his mercies, but inflict <hi>Positive Penalties,</hi> to take vengeance
upon the sinner, for the Transgression and Contempt of His Law. And he that
continueth in his sin, without repentance, must needs be an Enemy, and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of His Wrath. God is an enemy to him, not as a man, but as a sinful man
&amp; continuing in sin: and as he is unclean, he can have no fellowship with God,
who is Light, and in whom there is no Darkness, because he walks in Darkness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and he is deprived of his special favour and love, and lies under His heavy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:64164:173"/>
This is the condition of the party before He be reconciled.
The</p>
               <p>2d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thing to be considered, is, What this peace with God should
be? And</p>
               <p>1 It's peace after Emnity: Therefore called Reconciliation.</p>
               <p>2 It's a removal, and taking away the emnity, by taking away the cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
(as you shall hear hereafter.)</p>
               <p>3 This Emnity is so taken away, that the state of the Person reconciled, is not
a bare Neutrality between God and him, but a state of special love and favour,
whereupon follows an acceptation of the person, and an admittance into God's
presence, to come with boldness and confidence unto the Throne of Grace, a
delight in his Prayers and Service, and a Peace, and quiet calm of Conscience,
which cannot be without great joy. God before did hate, hide his face, cast
out of his presence; and man, once sensible of his sin, doth fear, and fly from
God's pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence, as from a con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uming Fire. As <hi>Adam</hi> hearing the voice of God
was afraid, and hid himself, and <hi>Israel</hi> trembled before <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> burning
with fire up to the midst of Heaven. Now God loves, and man is bold and
confident. This is a special favour God bears unto his People, which the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi>
prayeth for, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 4. The light of God's countenance, whereby His
frowns are turned into smiles, and he looks chearfully upon us.</p>
               <p>4 This favour is not a fancy and conceit, that God doth love us, but it's really
and fully manifested in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which God hath given us,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5.</p>
               <p>5 As this Emnity begins on Man's part, turning away from his God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
him; so this Peace and Reconciliation begins on God's part, in mercy,
turning unto man.</p>
               <p>6 As the hatred and displeasure of God, and the want of his favour, maybe
considered as a Penalty, and the same removed by Reconciliation; so it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Justification, and Remission, as a branch thereof, without which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be perfect.</p>
               <p>3 The party reconciled, is the justified by Faith. For being justified
by Faith, we have peace with God. Take this Peace <hi>Passively,</hi> as a
benefit and reward received by Man, it's an effect of Justification,
and may so be called: but take it <hi>Actively</hi> as coming from God, it
may be a part or degree of Justification, essentially included in it.
For God in justifying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that very act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accepts him as a friend, and
looks not on him as an Enemy. It presupposeth the taking away
of the general guilt, and the removing the great penalty of sin and
corruption by restoring the regenerating Spirit. For how can man
as guilty and polluted with sin, and under the dominion of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
be a subject of this special love and favour? According to the
Scriptures, and His Eternal Laws. He cannot possibly be such. God
may so love Man, when he is his Enemy, as to give his Son for him,
and his Spirit, to take away the cause of this Emnity; but to love
him with this special love, as such, is impossible: For this Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
necessarily presupposth the cause of the Emnity, not as to
be taken away, but as taken away already. Otherwise God should
love those whom He hates, as He hates them, and be well pleased
with those, that lye under his fearful displeasure.</p>
               <p>4 We have this peace by Jesus Christ our Lord: for by whom we have
Justification, by Him we have Reconciliation. We find two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:64164:173"/>
of this Reconciliation, and both by Christ. For so the Apostle
informs us. For, saith He, God was in Christ, reconciling the world
unto himself, not imputing their Trespasses unto them, and hath
committed to us the Word of Reconciliation. Now we are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we
pray you in Christ's stead, to be reconciled to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20.
By which words we easily understand, that the Foundation of this
Reconciliation was laid in Christ's suffering. For even then God
did not impute our sins to us, but unto him, and punished them, in
him, for us. For, <hi>He who knew no sin was made sin for us, that we
might be the Righteousness of God in him,</hi> Ibid. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. And if this
first Reconciliation had not been made, and so God made propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the second had never followed. Again, if when we were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son: much
more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. And not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so, but we also joy in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom we have received the <hi>atonement, Rom.</hi> 5. 10, 11. Where we
may observe, that the first degree of Reconciliation,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Was by Christ's Death. The</item>
                  <item>2 By his life, when we are justifyed.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For, by His Death, He merited it; and by His life and intercession, procures
the actual enjoyment of it. The first is, Reconciliation made: The second,
Reconciliation and Atonement received: and both by Christ, who reconciled
us to God, both Jew and Gentile, in one Body, by the Cross, having slain the
Emnity thereby: <hi>And came and preached Peace to them which were afar off, and
to them that were nigh. For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the
Father,</hi> Ephes. 2. 3, 12. <hi>In whom we have boldness, and access, with confidence, by
Faith, in Him,</hi> Ephes. 3. 12. So that by Christ we have this Peace with God. For
by his death, he averts the Wrath and Displeasure of God, and merits his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
He, by his Ambassadours, preacheth Peace, and beseecheth us to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
and so by his Word and Spirit converts us. He, by his intercession, takes
us by the hand, and brings us before the Throne of Grace, as though He were
the <hi>Master of Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>Admissionate of Heaven:</hi> and presents us holy, and
unblameable, and unreproveable in His sight, as washed in His Blood believed
upon, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 22. Upon this Reconciliation it follows, that we cease</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 To be Enemies.</item>
                  <item>2 To be Strangers.</item>
                  <item>3 To be Neutrals.</item>
                  <item>4 We are Friends, Fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the Family
of God. This Reconciliation makes the state of the Reconciled ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
happy, and it's an unspeakable mercy, as may appear.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1 From the sad condition of <hi>Cain,</hi> when he was driven from God's presence,
and others in his case, from the Lamentations and Complaints of God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
when he did hide his face, absent himself, withdraw his Spirit, and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
(as it were) cover himself with a Cloud, that their Prayers could not pass
through, and be heard: By their Deprecations of God's anger, least they should
be cast out of his presence, and his Holy Spirit taken from them: From the
unspeakable joy, and consolation, which did diffuse it self, and warm their hearts
upon this Reconciliation, and return of the Spirit, after their penitent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
Prayers. For as it's lost by sin, so it's regained by Repentance, and
Faith, We seek the love and favour of great ones, and fear their frowns. But
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64164:174"/>
what are their frowns to God's displeasure? or their love unto his favour,
which is the Fountain of Eternal joy?</p>
               <p>A third degree of Justification,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> which reacheth Salvation, and toucheth Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life immediately, is, that which the Gospel calleth <hi>Adoption,</hi> whereby those
who were no Sons, believing in Christ, are made the Sons and Heirs of God, and
joint-Heirs with Christ of Glory. Where we must observe,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 How this Adoption agrees with Justification, and differs from Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
and Reconciliation.</item>
                  <item>2 What the nature of this Adoption is?</item>
                  <item>3 Who they are that are Adopted?</item>
                  <item>4 What the condition of the Adopted is?</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. It agrees with <hi>Justification,</hi> as a part or degree thereof, as it doth remove
a great penalty, and so the guilt; which <hi>Justification</hi> properly doth. The guilt and
penalty you shall know hereafter. It differs from <hi>Regeneration,</hi> because that gives
onely a n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w life of Grace, and Sanctification altering our disposition. And this
new Being and Life might be given us, without a further <hi>Dignity,</hi> and Title to
an <hi>Heavenly Inheritance.</hi> It's true, that if God beget us again, and renew us, we
may be said to be His Sons; yet it doth not follow, that if we be Sons only
in that sense, that therefore we are Heirs: though if we be adopted Sons, we
are Heirs according to express Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. It differs from <hi>Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
because God may love us as his Servants, and yet not as Sons and Heirs.
Therefore it's a further degree of God's love and special favour. For we may be
His Subjects, and yet not of His Houshold and Family. We may be of His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
as Servants and Friends, yet not as Sons and Heirs in the highest Rank, and
Degree of Dignity, in His Family. And we must here take special notice,</p>
               <p>1 That God, by one act, doth justifie, regenerate, reconcile, and adopt. For
though we may distinguish them, and conceive of them under <hi>several notions,</hi>
yet we must not separate them. For though God might have separated some of
them, yet He doth not.</p>
               <p>2 That Justification, Regeneration, Reconciliation, are not distinct, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Titles, but one and the same Title unto <hi>Everlasting Life,</hi> which God doth
give us by these in our Lord Jesus Christ. For we are justifyed by His Grace,
that we should be Heirs according to the hope of <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> Tit. 3. 7. Where
<hi>Justification</hi> gives right unto <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> And, Blessed be God, and the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, of his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again
unto a lively hope, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the Dead, unto an
Inheritance, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4. Where <hi>Regeneration</hi> is said to give right unto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And again, If Children (that is, adopted) then Heirs, joint-Heirs with
Christ. Where Adoption is said to be the Title unto this <hi>Heavenly Inheritance,</hi>
Rom. 8. 17. The like may be said of Reconciliation. For, having Peace with
God, by Jesus Christ our Lord, by whom also we have access by Faith into this
Grace wherein we stand, we rejoyce in the <hi>Hope of Glory,</hi> Rom. 5. 2. How Faith
and these, may be the Title, shall be known hereafter.</p>
               <p>The second thing to be considered,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> and observed, is the nature of Adoption.
This actively considered, in general, is a gracious act of God in Christ: But in
particular, it's such an act, as whereby we are made, of no Sons, Sons and Heirs
of God with Christ of glory. Where we must acknowledge, that by Nature, we
are not Sons: For, according to the Laws of men, such as are adopted, are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from Natural Sons, which are Sons necessarily: but these are made Sons
freely by an act of free grace. For Adoption is a free Election, and always makes
a person who is not a Child, to be a Child: By Nature, indeed, we are the Sons
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:64164:174"/>
and heires of <hi>Wrath,</hi> or rather Slaves to sin, and Satan. By sin we lost our <hi>

                     </gap>ilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and our right to the inheritance of eternal life: and this was a very sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and an heavy judgment of God. This is our condition before Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But presently upon our Adoption, we who were no Sons are Sons of God,
and heires of an eternall Kingdom, and being washed in Christs blood, are as
Sons advanced to the dignity of Kings and Priests unto ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God for ever. Yet
we are not heires severally, and apart from, but joyntly with Christ, and of the
same estate in our measure, but in his right. For as one with him, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his body, as he is a Son, and heir; so we must needs be Sons, and heirs
with Him.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> The parties, who are adopted, are Believers in Christ: for

or dignity to be the Sons of God, even to them that <hi>Believe</hi> on his name,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. You have heard often before, that faith is the Title to justification,
by vertue of Christs merit, and Gods promise; But the immediate title to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

subjects of this right to glory are the justified, regenerate, reconciled, and
adopted Saints, and Sons of God. For though God give this inheritance of
glory unto Believers; yet he gives it to Believers as justified, regenerated, and
adopted. This faith is fixed on Christ as meriting, and interceding for this
adoption. For such as believe in his name are made the Sons of God. <hi>Joh. 1.
12.</hi> And as God predestinated us unto the Adoption of Children by Jesus
Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his Will, <hi>Ephes</hi> 1. 5. So
he also by him according to this Pedestination by him before time <hi>adopts</hi> us by

               <p>The fourth thing to be considered,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> is the estate and condition of these adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Sons of God, which is imperfect in this life, and onely begun. For it was a
great, and transcendent love of God, that we should now in this life be called
the Sons of God, and have not onely the name, but the thing it self. And
though now in this life we be the Sons of God, it doth not yet appear what we
shall be: but we know, that when Christ shall appear, we shall be like him: for
we shall see him as he is, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 1, 2. And now we have the first fruits of the
Spirit, and we our selves groan within our selves, waiting for the Adoption, to
wit, the Redemption of our bodyes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. Where, by the Redemption
of our bodyes, is understood the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> when our Adoption shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
And this is our great comfort for the present that we not onely are, but
certainly know that we are the Sons of God. For the Spirit it self beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
with, or rather to, our Spirits that we are the Children of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16.
And we are assured, and have good security, that in due time, when we shall be
at full age, and past our minority, we shall have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For we have the first fruits now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance untill the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13, 14.
Where, the Redemption may be the <hi>Resurrection:</hi> and it's the Redemption of
Acquisition; because upon the same we shall have full possession. <hi>Great</hi> is the
happinesse, joy, and comfort of the <hi>Adopted Sons of God: For</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. By Adoption, we are not onely freed from the slavery of sin, but the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and servitude of the Law now in the times of the Gospel. We have not
received the Spirit of <hi>Bondage</hi> to fear again, as it was under the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15.
We are not now under Tutours, and Governours, nor in Bondage un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Elements of the World, that is, the <hi>Ceremonial Law, Galat.</hi> 4. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</p>
               <p>2. We have the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry <hi>Abba Father, Rom. 8.
15. Gal.</hi> 4. 6. We cry, and pray: and we pray unto God as a Father, and that
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:64164:175"/>
with greatest confidence. For what may not Children expect from a Father,
such a Father, before whose Throne of Grace we may approach without fear. We
are free Children of a free Mother: We are not Servants born of <hi>Hagar</hi> the
Bond-woman; but free women of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which is above, and Mother of
us all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26. And as <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is our Mother, so God is our Father, who hath
given us the Spirit of Adoption.</p>
               <p>3 We being adopted, enjoy the Ministery of Angels, those Blessed, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Spirits, who have a charge to keep us in all our ways, guard us, and pitch
their Tents about us. If we be in any place, in any danger, at any time, they
must be ready at hand. If <hi>Jacob</hi> fear his Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> two Armies of them
shall meet him, and secure him from danger. When man, by sin, forsakes his
God, he's out of God's special Protection, and the Angels have no Commission
to take care of him. But if he return unto his God again, they rejoyce upon
his Conversion, and, upon God's Command, do pitch their Tents about him.
And since Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was made Lord of Angels, as soon as any
do believe in him, and are made the Sons of God, he gives them special charge
concerning his little Ones. For they are all ministring Spirits, sent forth to
minister for them, that shall be Heirs of Salvation <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               <p>4 So soon as we are Sons, we fall under God's special Providence, and so He
takes a far greater care of us, than of others. If we offend, He, in dearest love,
will chastise us; not to destroy us, but correct us; because He will not suffer sinne
to lye upon us. He will try us, not vex us, but to exercise our Virtues, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our Faith that so we may come out of the Furnace of afflictions, more pure
then finest Gold. If we fall, He will raise us up again: If we grow cold, He will
quicken us. If we fall into danger, He will deliver us; if into want, He will
provide for us necessaries. For our Heavenly Father knoweth, that we have
need of all these things.</p>
               <p>5 He, in His excellent Wisdom, out of greatest mercy, so orders all events,
all conditions, either of Prosperity, or Adversity, all his Works of Providence
so that Heaven and Earth, Men and Angels; yea, all Creatures, and all things,
shall conspire and work together for our good, and all shall unite Forces, and
full power; which united, as in one single cause, shall further our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>6 God loves them as his Children with a special love, and pities them far
more then any Father in the World pities his Child, and nothing shall be able
to separate from the love of that Father whom they love.</p>
               <p>7 He gives his Spirit of Adoption into their Hearts, to anoint them, seal
them, assure them of their present right unto, and the full Possession, in due time,
of their Heavenly Inheritance. God their Father loves them; and they must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
know it. Their estate, therefore, is an estate of unspeakable joy &amp; comfort:
Yet it requires, that we should be obedient and dutiful Children; and the love
of God, which is so great, and advanceth them so high, should deeply engage
them to the love and obedience of their Heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>This is the beginning of God's Judgment,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> in dispensing and disposing of his
Spiritual Rewards of Conversion and Justification, which include all the rest,
and bring them into an happy and blessed estate. After this, the continuance
of this blessed estate is to be considered. For God continues to judge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
according to the continuance of their Faith: and this, in all parts of the
World, where any of his Saints shall be. For all jointly, and every one several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are the subjects of this Judgment, which continually proceeds according to
his Laws of Redemption.</p>
               <p>As their Faith and Repentance are not made perfect at the first, so their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
joys, and comforts, are, not consummate, but by degrees.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:64164:175"/>
And as their Faith may be sometimes greater, sometimes less; so this estate
is better or worse, or rather not so good. Whilest Faith habitual, remains rooted
in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> heart, they are virtually justified: When it's actual, their Justification
actual will follow: When their Faith is lively, and continues to act vigorously,
their estate is so much the more comfortable.</p>
               <p>In this continuance of Rewards, (the same Rewards formerly given) there is
required a continuance of the grace of God's Spirit abiding in them, to enable
them to Duty, and observance of his Laws: and according to the continuance of
this grace, a continuance of performances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without both which, there can be no
continuance of Rewards. The grace of God is so continued, that it doth not
prevent all sin and disobedience, and therefore we are not free from all punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Yet as we contract new guilt every day, so every day, we should renew our
Repentance, and Faith, and so present our selves before the Tribunal of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Judge, and sue for Pardon in the Name of Christ, and suffer no guilt to lye
long upon us.</p>
               <p>And as this Court is continually open to dispense Rewards, so it is to punish,
and chastise, according as our deserts shall be. If our sins shall be greater, and
our neglect of our renewing our Repentance and Faith longer, the greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
both of loss and pain, shall be; as was evident in <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This state of Conversion,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> and Justification, may be considered, as continued in
this Life, or after Death, until the Resurrection. And it's a continuance of it
in the several Branches of Justification, as in the continuance of Regeneration,
Reconciliation, Adoption. Regeneration, which is commonly called Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as continued, is the first. For that which they call Sanctification, which
follows Justification, is the continuance of the first Regeneration, which is a
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ification, and a removing of that great Penalty, of loss of the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the woful immediate consequent thereof: as Blindness, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness,
and the Dominion of Sin, from which, issue all Actual Transgressions,
which would multiply to a great number, and rise to a higher degree of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
if God, by Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>raint, or Renovation, did not prevent both. To understand
this Sanctification continued, the better, we must distinguish of it, as <hi>Active,</hi> and
<hi>Passive.</hi> As <hi>Active<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> it's an act of God sanctifying us; <hi>Passive,</hi> it's those gifts
and graces of the Spirit, whereby we are enabled to avoid sin, and obey God. For
though this be an active Power, yet in respect of God giving it, and us recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it, it may be called <hi>Passive,</hi> though properly it be an effect of God, the cause,
and a cause of an obedience following. The active Sanctification is</p>
               <p>1 The acting of the Spirit to prepare us, convert us, work Faith in us, and by
Faith unite us unto Christ. For all these may be called Acts of Sanctification in a
large sense: yet, in Scripture, they are called <hi>Vocation,</hi> whereby God, through
the power of the Spirit, accompanying the Word, doth convert us, and bring us
to Christ.</p>
               <p>2 This Sanctification active, when we are once in Christ, and the Spirit, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from him, to us, in him, to abide as a constant Spring of Regeneration at
the first, is that I call Regeneration, as a Branch of Justification: and as neither
before nor after the first judgment of justification.</p>
               <p>3 This Sanctification active, not being perfect, in respect of the Subject, is
continued. For we being in Christ, as Branches in the Vine, derive continual
Sap, or sanctifying Vigour from him, that we may bring forth Fruit. Christ
communicating this continually unto us, by his Spirit, may be said to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to sanctifie us. From all this, you may understand a three-fold Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

               <p>In the third sense, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 23. Yet this must be known, that <hi>Regeneration,
Sanctification, Renovation,</hi> are taken for the same, several times: and <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
in Scripture, is taken for <hi>Justification,</hi> and that we call <hi>Sanctification</hi> too; as
<hi>Ephes. 5. 26. Heb.</hi> 9. 15. &amp; 10. 10, 14. &amp; 13. 12. and many other places. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it's taken for that purity we acquire by the Works of Sanctification, and
the constant practise of Righteousness; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19, 22. As for Sanctification
Passive, it's easily understood by the Active.</p>
               <p>This Sanctification differs from that of <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IX</label> and the <hi>Blessed Angels:</hi> for
this finds us unsanctified, corrupted, unclean, perverse, and blind. Therefore it's
called <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and <hi>Renovation,</hi> and <hi>Cleansing:</hi> the other did not find them
such.</p>
               <p>What this doth at first, it continues to do: it makes us at the first Righteous,
and holy, and imprints God's Image upon us, and continued it; continues us
such, and makes us more and more holy. And the more we exercise this
Active Power, the more we are sanctified; according to that Promise, <hi>To him
that hath</hi> (that is, useth and exerciseth) <hi>it shall be given;</hi> that is, more shall be
given.</p>
               <p>It's a Reward given at the first; and it's a Reward continued, enabling us to
perform Duty, that the Reward may be greater, and greater. For the effect of
it, is, to cause us to walk in God's Statutes; and the more our obedience is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
the more our comfort is increased, because our estate of Justification,
and our Title to Eternall Glory, is thereby the more evident. There is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
necessity of the continuance thereof: For if God desert us but a moment,
there presently follows a Relapse.</p>
               <p>The subject of it is the whole man, Soul, and Body; the Soul chiefly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily;
the Body, secondarily. In the Soul, it enlightneth the Understanding
more and more, and dispelleth the Mists of Ignorance and Errour; and rect fies
the Heart, declining it from sin, inclining it to Righteousnesse. It fixeth it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the right Object Christ, and Eternal Glory in Him, and continues to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
and incite us to the performance of Obedience, and the practise of those
Duties, whereby Eternall Life is obtained.</p>
               <p>All the Motions, and Inclinations, and Dispositions, and those we call Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
are by it set in a right order, especially the Affections of Love and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
which principally move and sway the Soul. It limits and directs the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Appetite, and makes the Body and the Members thereof Instruments of
Righteousness to Holiness. Yet this Sanctification was neither given to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
sin past, nor merit life to come, but to prevent sin, and bring forth the fruits
of Righteousness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:64164:176"/>
In respect of Sin, and Corruption, yet inherent, it's called <hi>Mortification;</hi> in
respect of righteousnesse, this heavenly active power is called <hi>Vivification:</hi> And
by vertue of Christ's death it destroies Sin, and by vertue of Christ's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
it quickens us to an heavenly life. Yet this <hi>Mortification,</hi> and <hi>Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
are not properly <hi>integrall Parts,</hi> but onely <hi>Adjuncts</hi> of this <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
For take away Corruption wholly, there will be no <hi>Mortification;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there remains nothing to be <hi>mortified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Because this regenerate power is not consummated at the first,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>X</label> therefore it
will meet with continuall opposition from Corruption within; and the Devill,
and the World, without. For in every regenerate man, there is in this life
Flesh and Spirit, Corruption and Grace: and these two being contrary one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another, have continuall conflicts, both habituall and actuall. Yet Grace
and the Spirit is predominate; otherwise Regeneration could not be Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
These are <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> continually striving in the Bowels, and
Womb, of our Souls, The Assistants to the Flesh, are the Devill and the
World: The Assistants of Grace, are the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Angels, Ministers, and sanctified Christians. For as God useth the Ministery,
and Discipline of the Church, in the declaring, outwardly, with the Word, the
Sentence of Absolution; so he useth them to stir up, continually, to holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to restrain Sin, to strengthen us, and promote our Sanctification. And I
cannot see but the blessed Angels should have as much power to help us, as the
Devill to hurt us. For they are ministring Spirits, not onely for temporall
Safety, but spirituall Assistance. And from this opposition ariseth that spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Warr, so much mentioned in Scripture: in respect of which, all spirituall
and heavenly Vertues are called <hi>Armour,</hi> the <hi>Armour</hi> of God, and the more we
exercise them with Prayer, and Watchfullnesse, the more and the faster we
gird them upon us; the stronger and safer we are. Some of these, though
onely the principall, are named, <hi>Ephes. 6. 11, 12, 13. &amp;c. 1 Thes.</hi> 5. 8. Yet
all are understood: for Sanctification inclines to Obedience, and fenceth us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all Sin.</p>
               <p>The event of this War is either intermediate,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XI</label> or finall. The intermediate
from the first Regeneration is often, and for the most part Victory, yet not
without many wounds, hurts, foils, falls, and the same sometimes very griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
And though Grace in us be habitually predominant, yet actually it is not
alwayes so. We may neglect our watch, be too carelesse, and then we suffer.
Yet the weaker, by Humility, Prayer, Watchfulnesse, may stand, when the
stronger fall. And the Victory doth not depend so much upon the eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of gifts, and graces, in us, as upon divine Assistance from without. The
more we fight, according to the rules of this war, the stronger we are by God's
Assistance, and our Saviours intercession, who prayed, that <hi>Peter</hi>'s faith, and so
ours, though fearfully sometimes shaken, might not fail. This war is to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
not onely by strength, but policy and holy prudence, whereby we foresee
dangers, to prevent them, and take all opportunities and advantages for our
safety, and our Enemies ruine. Because our weaknesse is great, we must often
pray, humbly depend upon our God, and work out our salvation with fear, and
trembling; because it's God that worketh in us the Will and the Deed of his
good pleasure. Because of our many foils, and falls, one worke of our Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is to renew our Repentance, and our Faith in Christ, and that daily, that
as we contract new guilt, and are weakned, so we may be cleansed, and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Therefore <hi>David,</hi> after his grievous fall, petitions to God to create in
him a clean Heart, and renew a right Spirit within him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 10. And <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
goes out and weeps bitterly; and, no doubt, prayes fervently. Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:64164:177"/>
are fearfull, and we must take heed of offending the sanctifying Spirit of
God. By these frequent returnes unto God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ, our
Sanctifycation is renewed, and recovered. What should be the reason, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Eternal Wisdom of God should determine, to put his Regenerate
Ones upon this Bloody War, sometimes continued long, and not wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
sin at once; and so, in an instant, give us perfect and perpetual Security, is
hard to know. Yet this is certain, that he thought it best to teach us <hi>Humility,</hi> so
as that we might learn that Lesson perfectly, and that we should fully know our
total and perpetual dependance is upon his grace. For <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Security, was

compleat Armour of God was given us. And this is the Promise; that God,
the God of Peace, who will put an end unto this War, will bruise Sathan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our feet shortly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 20. And the God of all grace, who hath called us
to his Eternal Glory, by Christ Jesus, after we have suffered a while, will make
us perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10. We shall overcome the
<hi>Great Dragon,</hi> and <hi>Old Serpent,</hi> by the Blood of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and his <hi>Testimony,</hi> not
loving our lives to Death, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 2. The Reward, upon this <hi>Victory,</hi> is an
<hi>Eternal Crown,</hi> which will be certain. For when <hi>Paul</hi> had fought this good
Fight, had finished his Course, and kept the Faith, from thenceforth there was
laid up for him a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord, the Righteous Judge,
would give him at that day: and not to him onely, but unto them also that
love his appearing, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. This Victory is obtained by final <hi>Perseverance,</hi>
which is often<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in part, interrupted by our many failings, and falls; yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
by a continual Supply of inward strength, and outward Assistance, upon
which it doth chiefly depend.</p>
               <p>God requires, on our part, a constant Exercise of that Power He hath given
us, and humble dependance upon his strength, a continual Watchfulness, a day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
renewing of our Repentance, and Faith: For, without Duty, there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of solid comfort.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Perseverance</hi> is never totally interrupted by Apostasie in the Saints of
God, once regenerate, and sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the first-fruits of glory, as an earnest of the full possession of the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.
That these ever did, or may, according to the Eternal Rules of this
Government fall totally, and so finally, never any yet could clearly
prove.</p>
               <p>That others, though baptized, enlightened, changed in their hearts, reformed
in their lives, so as to forsake, in some measure, their former sins, endued not
onely with ordinary, but extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, and out of an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
hope of Salvation, have tasted of the joys and comforts of the Gospel, may
fall, will not be denied. Yet all these things are not sufficient, sufficiently to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
the subject of this Question concerning <hi>Perseverance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Question, Whether those, who by a sincere Faith are living Members
of Christ, have received the Regenerating Spirit, as a Seal and Earnest of Eternal
Glory, can, according to the Laws of God-Redeemer, fall away totally from the
estate of Justification?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:64164:177"/>
The Question may be,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VII</label> 
                  <hi>De esse, aut Posse,</hi> or both. That any such did ever so
fall, no man yet did ever prove. That they may fall, according to the tenour of
the Gospel, hath not been yet, nor I think can be, made evident. The Scripture
doth sometimes take Righteousness, Calling, Regeneration, Sanctification, the
purging away of sin, in a large sense; and attribute all these to such as have been
baptized made profession of their Faith, and have not by Scandal, or Apostasie,
stained their Profession: and as the Scripture, so the ancient Writers also term
these Saints, Righteous and Regenerate. But a thousand such places will not
evince this Fall that's here denied. For they changed the subject of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and so the Question it self. Many do instance in <hi>David,</hi> who, no doubt, was
regenerated, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ealed with the Spirit of Promise, and he fell grievously, and
contracted the guilt of Adultery and Murther. But what though? Was this a
total Fall? It was not. For,</p>
               <p>1 Though the sins were heynous, and did highly offend God, and deserved
Death; yet this Death was removeable. For they were not the sins of Apostasie,
or final Unbelief; nor properly, nor immediately Impenitency and Unbelief,
which are the sins directly and formally against the Covenant and Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Law of Redemption. Therefore they could not make him of a subject to
be no subject; neither did God wholly reject him, and take his Spirit wholly
from him. A man may commit heynous offences against the Law, and yet be
a Subject: but if he be guilty of Rebellion, or High-Treason, he loseth all right
of a Subject. Thus <hi>David</hi> was not guilty.</p>
               <p>2 This Death was more easily removable, then that Penalty of that Party,
which never did believe, never was regenerate.</p>
               <p>3 Though the Sins were actually, yet they were not habitually contrary to
the Law or to Repentance, and Faith: For to be an Adulterer, and Murderer
was not his constant temper.</p>
               <p>4 God made such promises to <hi>David,</hi> and those personal, as were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
either with total, or final rejection. This was one promise, and that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall;
<hi>My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and may Covenant shall stand
fast with him.</hi> And for his seed, <hi>if they transgresse, he would chastise them:
Neverthelesse his loving kindnesse He would not take utterly from them,</hi> Psal. 89.
28, 29, 30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this did include an obligation on Gods part, to revive
his Faith, if <hi>Actual,</hi> and <hi>Particular</hi> Faith, and Repentance were necessary to
<hi>actual Remission.</hi> Though it's certain, that many great sins are remitted upon
<hi>a General Repentance,</hi> if sincere.</p>
               <p>5 That 51. Psalm, wherein we have so full an expression of serious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and a very lively faith, was not made by a new faith upon a new
Regeneration, but by his former faith, which for the time was <hi>Dormant,</hi> and as
it were dead.</p>
               <p>6 The divine Apostle saith unto his little Children. <hi>The annoyntment
which ye have received abideth in you,</hi> 1 Iohn 2. 27. <hi>And the seed of God is not
onely in him, who is born of God but, remaineth in him,</hi> Chap. 3. 9. <hi>And hereby
we know that God not onely is, but abideth in us by his Spirit, which he hath given
us</hi> ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 24. Upon what other ground could <hi>Paul</hi> be perswaded, <hi>that nothing
could separate true believers from the love of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 38. And except there
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:64164:178"/>
were some promise in the Covenant to this purpose, why should he be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of this very thing, that God who had begun a good work in the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi>
would perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ; <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. And lest he
should terrifie the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> by his doctrine of the peremptory rejection, and
perdition of Apostates; as though he understood it of them personally; He
explaines himself, saying: <hi>But, beloved, we are perswaded better things of you,
and things that accompany Salvation, though we thus speak. For God is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed to his name;
in that ye have ministred to the Saints, and do minister,</hi> Heb. 6. 9, 10. Where
reall love to Christ, and his Saints, is joyned with salvation, as having an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
connexion with it, by vertue of the divine ordination. Yet he doth
not cease in these places, and others, to presse duties and perseverance; because
the performance of their duty, and endeavour of perseverance, was a meanes
of Perseverance. And surely that God, who never deserts man, before man
deserts him; will never totally desert man, before man totally deserts
him. Certainly, there is a state of confirmation in this life, wherein, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the earnest of the Spirit, the Sons of God may be certain of their present
right unto, and thier future Possession of, eternall glory: Though few attain to
this, till the end of thier lives. But of this more fully upon another occasion in
mine exposition of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> For the present, we may observe
these particulars:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That we may make our calling, and election sure in this life.</hi> For we
are commanded even in this life, to give all diligence, to make our calling and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sure: For if we do these things, we shall never fall, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
               <p>2. That the highest degree of sanctification in any intellectuall subject, Men
or Angels, may be lost.</p>
               <p>3. That the perpetual continuance thereof in a created subject, depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an extrinsecal cause, which is Gods perpetual conservation.</p>
               <p>4. The certainty of our perseverance in this life, both for the thing it self,
and the certain knowledge of it, depends upon a promise in the Covenant of
grace in Christ.</p>
               <p>5. The controversy in this point between the <hi>Contra-remonstrants,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants,</hi>
if both parties had dealt plainly, had been near an end, and so far
more easily determinable. For if God hath made a promise, that he will put
his fear into the hearts of his Children in this life, so that they shall not depart
from him, though they may sin, and fail in many Particulars grievously; then, if
the question be rightly stated, the quarrel is ended.</p>
               <p>6. The first proof of the Remonstrants out of Scripture, which by some is
held unanswerable, out of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. it nothing at all to purpose: Because it
speaks of the judgment of God, and his judicial proceedings with <hi>Israel, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Law, and Covenant made at</hi> Horeb, which the Apostle saith expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly,
is a distinct Covenant from the Covenant of grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 9. But for the
present to lay aside the controversy, let us every one endeavour, and give all
diligence to persevere; and every day pray for perseverance: for that will be
better then to dispute; because by this meanes we may attain to that which
many do deny. But this you must know, that no promise can give us comfort
upon, and in the time of disobedience, and neglect of duty.</p>
               <p>

Thus far,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIII</label> the continuance of <hi>Regeneration:</hi> The continuance of <hi>Reconciliation</hi>
and <hi>Adoption</hi> follows, which makes our condition, to be a condition of peace
and joy in this Vale of Death. In this I shall be brief, because I have spoken
more at large of the nature of both formerly. It's God's Will, that the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of these should depend upon the continuance of Sanctification: For no
man can be happy, if he be not first holy. Therefore, he that hath the hope of
glory, and joy upon that hope, doth purifie himself, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. The more God
continues to sanctifie, and assist us, the more we improve our Heavenly Graces:
the more diligently we practise, pray, and watch, the greater evidence we shall
have of the continuance of our Reconciliation &amp; Adoption, and the greater will
be our assurance of God's special love unto us. And the greater this Assurance
of His love shall be, the greater our peace and joy will be. The more we love
God, and the more we keep His Commandements, the more He will love us. He
loved us much, before we loved Him, and even then He gave His Son to be the
Propitiation for our sins. But when we receive His Son, He loves us more, and
several ways discovers, that His love to us, loving Him, is everlasting, and far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the heart of man can imagine. And nothing can more quiet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
the heart of miserable man, then assurance, that God loves him with a
special love, which He hath manifested already, and will manifest it more on
Earth, and most of all in Heaven. For when we are fully glorified, we shall fully
know how much He loved us. And, for the present, what can disquiet our
hearts within, when the Love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy
Ghost, which is given unto us, and continued within us? Surely, no tribulation
without, no muttering of the Conscience within, can disturb our peace, abate
our joy, diminish our comfort. We joy in Tribulation, and in the midst of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Afflictions we can quietly repose our minds in God, and sweetly rest in His
Fatherly Affection. Yet this requires an heart above the Earth, and such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Faith, as to overcome fears, and desires of the World. For if we love our
God above the World, desire Heaven, as infinitely more excellent then the
Earth, scorn the menaces of the Devil, and wicked men; disdain to look upon
the glory and prosperity of the World, as not worth the seeking; so that no
Worldly Cross, nor Crown, can work upon us, to affect, or disquiet us, then our
peace must needs be great. This love of God is manifested to us many ways:
As</p>
               <p>1 By Trials, Chastisements, Corrections, which are bitter for the present,
sweet in the end; so that we know God, in these, was not angry, but did love
us.</p>
               <p>2 By strange and wonderful Deliverances, wherein his Power, his Wisdom,
and special love unto us, do evidently appear.</p>
               <p>3 By the return of our prayers, which is many times such, as that we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know, that we were heard in Heaven, and God did far more for us, then we
desired, or could have desired.</p>
               <p>4 And most of all, when we find our Faith strengthned, our Graces increased,
our Power over Sin improved. For, by these things, we know assuredly, that
God, by the Spirit of Christ, dwells in us, and we are very sensible of his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
presence in our Souls, as in his Temple. By these things, when we look back,
we begin to discover God's everlasting love in <hi>Predestination,</hi> and those stable
and unchangeable Decrees made in Christ before the Foundation of the World:
And when we look forward, we see Heaven open, Christ our Saviour, at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
right hand, making intercession for us; our Eternal Mansions there by him
prepared, and an excellent estate of glory ready for us, as reconciled and adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to this estate. And upon our Prayers, our Eyes are enlightned, so that we
gain a further knowledge of the hope of his Calling, and the Riches of the glory
of his Inheritance in his Saints, and of the exceeding greatness of his power to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:64164:179"/>
us. The more we do good, and suffer ill for his sake; the greater, and
more certain our hope of eternall glory is. And though we live by hope, and
see somewhat dimly our heavenly Country afar off, and have but some glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings
of the eternal light, that there doth ever shine; yet for the present Faith
is the substance of these things hoped for, and the evidence of these things that
are not seen, nor enjoyed. These imperfect Representations, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of this glorious estate do inflame our hearts with vehement desires of
nearer approaches to our God, cause us to presse with all our power towards
our heavenly Prize, and warmes our hearts with unspeakable joy; because
we know one day, we shall have full Communion with our God, and shall
never be in danger to sin again.</p>
               <p>Yet this joy,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XIV</label> and Peace may be interrupted, much abated, and sometimes
seem to be extinct for a while: For according to our neglect, and abatement
in the exercise of that Sanctifying <hi>Power</hi> God hath given us, and the use of
those meanes, and our opportunities he hath afforded; so our peace, and joy
abate. And much more are they lessened and abated by our grievous sins.
As by word and prayer this heavenly fire was first kindled, so by these it's kept
alive, and increased. Fervent, and frequent prayers, serious meditations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Gods holy Precepts, and his gracious Promises, with constant practise, are
like fewel to this fire, and like Bellows to stirr it up, and cause it burn with a
clearer, and more ardent flame, and so improve this joy unto an high degree.
But as when we either withdraw the fewel, or powre water upon the fire, it's
abated, and ready to be quenched; so by neglect of the former duties, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by grievous sins, we grieve, and offend the blessed spirit of joy, peace,
comfort; and so he begins to withdraw himself. Therefore let us not with
<hi>Ephesus</hi> fall from our first love; nor with <hi>Laodicea</hi> cool in our zeal, nor with
<hi>David</hi> contract the guilt of haynous <hi>Crimes:</hi> For we must know that the
most just God will judge his own people according to their Works, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or punish them. If we neglect to walk with Him in the light of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
He will refuse to give us the light of joy, and comfort. When we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abate in our performances, or fall into grievous sins, our God either
by <hi>afflictions,</hi> or admonitio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, and reproofs, or by the working of the blessed
Spirit, or by some or all these, doth cause us to see our guilt, and make
us sensible of our sins, and so bring us back again. And upon our serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
our joyes are revived, and our peace restored: And great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
is his care over his Children in this kind; for as he prevented them with
his grace at first to convert them, that he might make them his Children; much
more when they are his Children, and do fall, will he prevent them by his
grace, to raise them up again, and revive the sparks of fire remayning: He
will not suffer them to dye; He will punish them that He may Reward:
as He afflicted the offending <hi>Corinthians,</hi> with sicknesse, and some of them
with death; and so judged, and chastened them, that they should not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
with the World. Lest this first Regeneration, and title to the eternal
inheritance should be in vain, <hi>He will keep them by his power through faith unto
salvation, which is ready to be revealed in the last time,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3, 4, 5. And if
his power should not preserve their Faith, as well as their Persons, they must
needs perish. He hath signified that the Connexion between their Faith, Love,
Patience, and eternall glory is <hi>indissoluble:</hi> For the patience, and faith of
the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> in all their persecutions and tribulations they endured, were
a manifest token of the Righteous judgment of God, <hi>That they might be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
worthy of the Kingdome of God, for which they did suffer,</hi> 2 Thes. 1. 4, 5. <hi>For
if we suffer with Christ, we shall be glorified with him,</hi> Rom. 8. 17. 2 Tim. 2. 11,
12. <hi>And this is a faithfull saying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:64164:179"/>
These things being so, there was little reason why the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> in their
Synoda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Acts and Writings, should so mince the matter, as though they were
afraid to give any advantage to the Truth. Upon the 5th Article of <hi>Perseverance,</hi>
they say, that God</p>
               <p>1 According to his absolute Power, not according to the Law of Grace;</p>
               <p>2 In an extraordinary, not an ordinary way;</p>
               <p>3 May reward, not will reward;</p>
               <p>4 Not constantly, but sometimes;</p>
               <p>5 Not all his Children, but some, long and much exercised in <hi>Piety,</hi> and tried
in Afflictions, with the grace of not-<hi>failing Perseverance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6 This they will not determine, but leave indifferent: How this can consist
with the Scriptures, I know not.</p>
               <p>As there be Spiritual Rewards in this life; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>XV</label> so there be after Death, and before
the Resurrection. As for the Body, because it hath been the Tabernacle of a
Regenerate, and sanctified Soul, and with it a Temple of the Holy Ghost; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though it be separated from the Soul, and turned into Dust; yet it's laid
down in certain hope of the Resurrection: For if the Spirit of him, that raised
up Jesus from the Dead, dwell in us, then He that raised up Christ from the
Dead, shall also quicken our Mortal Bodies, by his Spirit which dwelleth in us,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 12. Besides, it's freed from all <hi>weariness, faintings, diseases, annoyances,</hi> and
<hi>pains;</hi> so that the loss of <hi>Sense</hi> is turned to a benefit, though in it self it be a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
As for the Soul, the reward thereof is excellent, though not perfect.
It hath obtained a final Victory, over sin, Sathan, the World, and is out of all
danger of Hell. It's freed from all trouble and inconvenience, that did arise
from the Body, and is delivered up with great peace and joy into the hands of a
gracious Redeemer, who sends his Angels to receive it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> guard it, and set it in the
<hi>Heavenly Paradise;</hi> where Satan can never come near it, or tempt it any more,
either to sin or despair. And now it's free from all sin, all fear, and sorrow, and
temptations, and, washed in Christ's bloud, shall be presented pure and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
before God's Throne. The place, whatsoever it is, is full of comfort, the
Society excellent, it's secure of the great reward of <hi>Eternal Glory.</hi> And that which
is the accomplishment of all comforts, it is with Jesus Christ it's blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
who takes the charge and protection of it: <hi>Paul</hi> desired to depart, and be
with his Saviour, which was far better, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. Which words inform us,</p>
               <p>1 That the Soul lives, after it is separated from the Body.</p>
               <p>2 That Death is not a destruction, but departure.</p>
               <p>3 It's departure from a worse place and condition, to the better.</p>
               <p>4 Though it's absent from the Body, yet it's present with the Lord.</p>
               <p>5 Though it had many sweet and excellent joys and comforts in Christ, in
this life; yet now it hath more and greater.</p>

joy to true believers, it's certain: For God hath said so; and all his Saints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him, and long for that day, and wait for their Saviours comming from
Heaven. That it will be a day of judgment; and that Christ shall be the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
judge, we doubt not. Yet the manner of his comming, and the way of
his proceeding, we do not perfectly, and distinctly, for the particulars, know.
Something of it God by his Son Jesus Christ hath signified unto us, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us of: as that an <hi>Eternall Kingdome</hi> upon a finall and totall absolution will
be adjudged to some; but others shall receive the doom of an eternall curse,
and excommunication, to be cast out of Gods presence, and condemned to suffer
eternall Punishments with the Devill, and his Angels. All secrets shall then
be brought to light, and the judgment shall be exactly just, according to mens
works; and the execution shall be answerable: For the condemned shall go
into everlasting Punishment: but the righteous into life eternall, <hi>Math. 25.
46.</hi> So that of this judgment and the execution thereof we have two
parts;</p>
               <p>1. The Reward of the Righteous.</p>
               <p>2. The Punishment of the unrighteous, according to their obedience, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
unto the Laws of God Redeemer.</p>
               <p>The reward of the righteous shall be of the whole man,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> both soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
both united together, and joyntly partakers in the reward, as they were in
obedience. The body being raised shall be immortall, free from all evils inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to a body; free from all imperfections and defects, and made glorious and
perfect with all perfections a body can be capable of: For from Heaven we look
for the Saviour the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, that it
may be fashion'd like unto his glorious body, according to the <hi>Working,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:64164:180"/>
he is able to subdue all things to himself, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. The greatest perfection
shall be this, that it shall be united to a Soul fully sanctified, from which it shall
never any more be separated; and both together shall be the Eternal Temple
of the Holy Ghost. The Soul it self shall be finally and totally justified fully san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
and endued with all the graces of the Spirit requisite to happiness: and
then their Reconciliation and Adoption shall be consummate, the whole man
shall be firmly established in Righteousness and Holiness, never to sin, never to
be in danger to sin again. They shall be with their Saviour, and behold his glory,
enjoy the clear Vision of God, be ravished with his Beauty, filled with Eternal
Joy and Delights, and be secure of their perpetual full Bliss. All tears shall be
wiped away from off all faces, and they shall never sorrow any more. No evil
that can be feared, shall come near them, and all good that can be desired shall
abound there. As the Light of God's Eternal Favour shall ever shine upon them
in full strength; so the streams of Eternal goodness shall ever issue from the
Throne of God, and the Lamb; so that they shall be fully satiated with all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
for evermore. The place will be glorious, the company excellent, and no
good thing that may add unto their happiness shall be wanting. Then shall they
know how much God loved them, and how much Christ hath done for them.
They believe now that the Reward is great; but then, by the enjoyment, they
shall know it to be far greater, then ever entred into the heart of Man.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Camaracensts</hi> saith truly,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> That we may know God to be infinite; but know
him infinitely we cannot: so we may know, that this Reward is great, but how
great we cannot know as yet. We believe it, because God hath revealed it;
we hope for it because Christ hath merited it, and God hath promised it: We
seek it, because we hope for it; and we shall attain it, because the Spirit doth
sanctifie us, and prepare us for it. Our Conceits and Notions of it, in this Life,
are poor, and very imperfect; for we see but darkly, as through a glass. And if
God had manifested it fully as it is, so narrow is our capacity we could not have
understood it. The more we know it in this life, the more effectually we are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
&amp; stirred up unto obedience: For it's a mighty motive thereunto. For what
would not an understanding and considerate man do, or suffer to gain so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
an estat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>? It's an unspeakable mercy of God, that he will give us some glimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
now and then, even in this life, of this Eternal Light, and some taste of these
sweetest pleasures. For, these refresh and revive us much in this Wilderness of
our weary Pilgrimage, and stir up in us a longing and vehement desire of a full
fruition; and cause us with greater diligence to press towards the enjoyment of
this excellent Reward. And though we may think the time long; yet certainly,
he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry. Surely, says Christ, <hi>I come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Amen. Even so, come Lord Jesus.</hi> For, till thy coming, our hearts will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be at rest.</p>
               <p>The punishment of the Unrighteous shall be contrary to this <hi>Blessed Reward.</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label>
The very sight and presence of this Judge will appale them much; the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
&amp; appearance more; the Sentence and Execution most of all. For the Lord
Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, to
take vengeance on all them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of
our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 7, 8. They shall not onely lose the comforts of
this life, but the Eternal joy and glory of Heaven, which was promised in the
Gospel, and shall suffer the contrary evils, and that for evermore. Their bodies,
indeed, shall be raised again, and shall be immortal; and they shall ever live, that
they may ever die, and ever suffer. Their Souls shall be stripped of all holiness
and comfort; and both Body and Soul shall be cast into utter Darkness, and
everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil, and his Angels; where their Worm
shall never die, and their Torment shall be extream, without any intermission,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:64164:181"/>
without any abatement, without any end. The dismal place, and cursed Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
will add no little to their misery; and there is nothing which man fears, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors,
and detests, but they shall suffer there.</p>
               <p>God,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>V</label> by his Word, and other ways, hath made known these things to mortal
men, hath promised these glorious Rewards, and threatned these horrid and
external Punishments. Yet, though his Ministers and Messengers, by Command
from him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et Eternal Life and Death before mens eyes, yet these seem but
Dreams &amp; Fancies unto Profane and Atheistical Wretches, and are not seriously
considered by many who profess the Truth. Few do really believe these things;
&amp; fewer do effectually desire, or seek the great Reward, or fear the dreadful Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
God's Blessed Word makes no lively Impression upon their Hearts.
Promise Heaven, they are not much affected with it: Threaten Hell, they
are not much afraid of it. The Jews had <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets: Christians
have them with Christ, and his Apostles; yet men will hearken unto none of
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se, and so sink into the place of Torment, and are undone for ever. God hath
done much, to save us; but we do all, to damn our selves; and our destruction
is of our selves. God need not have promised Heaven, but that He would stir
us up to seek it; neither need He have threatned Hell, but with this intention,
that men might escape it. Oh cursed Wretches! who, for a little Vanity, lose
the Eternity of Bliss! Oh! that men would hearken unto God betimes, and
not delay their Repentance, till it be too late, when no Tears, nor Prayers, nor
any other means, that Men or Angels can use, can do him any good. And this
will not be the least of the Torments of the Damned, to remember, that once
they had an opportunity to have escaped these Eternal Punishments, and yet
they let it pass, and must needs acknowledge they suffer justly, who contemned
the expence of Christ's most precious Blood, the greatest love of God, and
would not obey the Precepts, nor trust in the Promises of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Thus have I,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VI</label> according to my <hi>Talent,</hi> declared out of the Scriptures, that Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
and Eternal Kingdom of God, according to the Laws and Judgments
whereof; Man is ordered unto his final and Eternal estate.</p>
               <p>The Rule of this Doctrine, is, the Word of God revealed from Heaven.</p>
               <p>The King, is God, who is most perfect and glorious in Himself; and by the
Work of Creation, acquired an absolute Dominion over all Creatures, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
over Men and Angels, and continued it by <hi>Preservation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Power acquired, He did exercise in the Constitution of His Government
over Men and Angels, and in the Administration of the same by Laws and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Many of the Angels obeyed, and were confirmed: Many of them disobeyed,
and were condemned to Eternal Punishments.</p>
               <p>All men in the first man sinned, and so became liable to Death.</p>
               <p>Yet the Supream Judge, in passing Judgment upon the Tempter, promised
Deliverance by a Redeemer.</p>
               <p>This Redeemer, is the Word made Flesh; by whose <hi>Humiliation</hi> unto
Death, a new power over man is acquired, and the same exercised first in the
Constitution and New-Modelling of His Kingdom of Grace and Mercy, and
in the Administration by Laws and Judgments. The Laws command Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
forbid Impenitency and Unbelief, promise Temporal and Eternal Rewards,
threaten Temporal and Eternal Punishments: and, as Men shall obey or diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
so they shall be rewarded, or punished. And these things are declared, not
onely that men may know them, but do God's Commandements; that so they
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:64164:181"/>
may live for ever, and not howl and curse, and gnash their Teeth in Hell; but
serve their God in the Temple of Heaven, and there sing an Eternal Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah
to Him who sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb;
To whom be Praise, and Glory, and Thanks for ever:
And let all Saints, and Angels say,
<hi>AMEN.</hi>
