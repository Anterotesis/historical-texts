            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WEE were pleased vpon one Petition exhibite vnto WS in Our Soveraine and high Court of Parliament, Concerning the vniversall abuse in Tanning and Barking of Leather throughout this Our whole Kingdome, To recommend to the Lords of Our Privie Counsell the order taking for reforming of the said abuse. Wherevpon the saids Lords having taking some paines and travells for trying of the said abuse and the ground and occasions of the same; And they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at length conferred thereanent as weell with a number of the principall Tanners of this Our Kingdome of best judgement, knowledge and experience, in that trade, as with sundrie Cordonars of good fame and credite: And all the particulars which might produce a cleare discoverie of the said abuse and occasions thereof, with the meanes how the same might bee reformed being amplie proposed reasoned and discussed, In end IT was found by the saids Lords out of their owne reason and judgement, and by the declaration and confession of the Tanners them selfes, that the abuse and corruptions of their trade did proceed from their owne ignorance and want of skill, in the trew and perfyte forme of Tanning: And that therefore there was a necessitie of inbringing of Strangers to instruct them thereintill. Wherevpon the saids Lords having entered in deliberation how the strangers might bee broght in; In end the charge thereof was embraced and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by Our traist Cousing and Counsaller IOHNE Lord ERSKENE who hath verie cairefullie behaved him selfe therein, and hath broght in and exhibite before the saids Lords the persons particularlie vnderwritten; They are to say, <hi>George Harason</hi> in Durham. <hi>Nicolas Richardson</hi> there. <hi>Cuthbert Hutcheson</hi> elder there. <hi>Edward Craiges</hi> there. <hi>Cuthbert Hutcheson</hi> younger there. <hi>Ihon Robeson</hi> there. <hi>Thomas Dobieson</hi> there. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Dobieson</hi> younger there. <hi>Robert Halfard</hi> there. and <hi>George Lambert</hi> there. <hi>Iohn Heroun</hi> in Hexem. <hi>Reynold Milbourn</hi> there. <hi>Harie Twedaill,</hi> there. <hi>Thomas VVallace</hi> there. <hi>George Ogill</hi> there. <hi>Philip Shilton</hi> of Chester of the street. and <hi>George VVilsoun</hi> in Morpet. Which whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are all of good skill knowledge and experience in the trade of Tanning. And vpon their great Oaths they haue promised to deale faith fullie and trewlie with the Tanners of this Our Kingdome, And to instruct them in the right forme of Tanning, and how to dresse their pottes: Lyke as they haue sett doune some groundes how the Hydes shall bee drest and handled, from the tyme they are broght from the Boutcheour, vntill they bee perfytlie and weell Tanned.</p>
            <p>AS namelie they haue declared that there is a great abuse committed by the Boutcheours, by slashing of the Hydes and cutting of some of the Rimme away, whereby a part of the substance of the hydes is taken away and the hydes are thereby the more apt to receiue water.</p>
            <p>JT is requisite that everie Tanner having a good Stock shall haue Two lyme-pottes at the least, for changing of the hydes from one potte to another, To witt, One for greene leather, and the other for Rype leather: But if his Stock will not answere to Two pottes, then hee must refresh the Lyme the oftner; And those pottes are to bee of Sax, or Seaven foote in length, Foure foote in breadth, and foure or fyve foote deepe.</p>
            <p>The Hydes being brought from the Boutcheour to the Tanner, they are to be casten in fresh watter there to lye three or foure dayes, till the bloode and filth bee sucked out and taken away.</p>
            <p>Thereafter they are to bee put in a Lyme-potte, there to lye fyve or sax weekes till they bee sufficientlie lymed, And three dayes euerie weeke they are to be handled and sighted and changed from potte to potte for eschuing of putrifactioun, And being taken out of the lyme-pottes, they are to bee casten in fresh water there to lye one day or one night, till the lyme bee washin of, Thereafter they are to bee put in a baitte of fresh watter with pigeon or Dow-dung, or Hen-pen, there to lye eight dayes till the lyme bee cleane wroght out of them.</p>
            <p>The Lyme being cleine wroght out of the hydes, they are then to bee broght to the wouseis of the Barke-pottes, of which pottes everie Barker must haue at the least fyve or sax, two for lopping, and the rest for handling, and the pottes for lopping must bee seaven foote long fyue foote deepe, and fyue foote braide, and the pottes for handling one yaird square euerie way lyned with timber or stone, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
<pb facs="tcp:26470:2"/>
affoords, and covered if the owner thinketh meete for eschwing of Thift.</p>
            <p>The Hydes being broght to the Bark-pottes and wouseis, they are to bee chifted and handled from one potte to another, to witt, from a worse to a better everie thrid day or oftner as the occasion presenteth, till they bee sufficientlie Tanned: And the wouseis are made of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Bark, and of the Bark which the Tanners of this Our Kingdome cast foorth of their Bark-pottes, the English Tanners make their best wouseis and liquour with some litle refreshing and renewing.</p>
            <p>And the Hyde for over-leather must lye twentie foure weekes in the Bark-potte, And the Hyde for sole-leather twentie eight weekes, or lesse if the leather bee weell followed at the discretion of the Owner.</p>
            <p>The hydes being sufficientlie Tanned and taken out of the Barck-pottes, they are then to bee dryed with the Aër, to wit they must bee hung vp vpon sparres to bee dryed in convenient places according as the season and weather falleth out, and they are to bee keipt from rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and neuer to bee dryed by fyre but vpon plane necessitie, and in drying of the hydes all violent and extreame heates ar to bee eschewed.</p>
            <p>Many other thinges haue they declared concerning the trew and perfyte forme of Tanning, the particulars whereof will bee better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by practize and sight, then by verball informations and discourses.</p>
            <p>And whereas those Strangers haue left their owne Cuntrie houses and families, and are come heere to bee directed to the severall pairtes of this Our Kingdome for instructing of the cuntrie People in the right forme of Tanning, which will prove verie gainefull vnto them and profitable to Our whole cuntrie, And will not onlie spaire a great deale of Barck which is vnnecessarie, vnprofitablie, and vnworthelie, spent by them, but besyds will hold a great deale of money within this Our Kingdome; which is yeerly exported for inbringing of forrain leather.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is verie necessar and expedient for the honour and credite of this Our Kingdome, that the saids persons shall not onlie bee kyndlie and freindlie vsed with all respect favour and duetie that apperteineth; but that they haue some Privileges and liberties in the said trade, during the tyme of their abode heir for the better inco<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
