         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THere is here a Congregation, yea, a Congregation of great ones, yea, of Gods, convocat and congregat together. And O how necessary is Gods presence in all Congregations and Assemblies; even as necessary as the presence of the soul is to the body naturall, as necessary is his presence to the body politicall, or as the Sun to the air and to the earth, to recreate all with his light, to revive all with his hot beams; therefore <hi>Moses</hi> the supream Magistrate, the hie Governour, who was appointed to lead his people like a flock through the wildernesse, he doth breath out this as the marrow of all his desires, that the Lord would go alongst with him, <hi>If thy presence go not with me, let us not go up hence, for wherein shall it be known here, that I and thy people have found favour in thy sight, is it not in that thou goest with us, so shall we be separate from all the people which are on the face of all the earth,</hi> Exod. 33. 15.</p>
               <p>And as his presence is necessary, so it is promised here to you thus convocate together, he who said, Mat. 18.20. <hi>Wheresoever two or three come together in my Name, there will I be in the midst of them,</hi> in futuro, here he performeth what he had promised, and saith <hi>in praesenti, God standeth,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>As for the duties we ow to God in reference to these gods whether we shall repair for redresse, if we want Kings, or if they be unjustly deprived of that power due to them in the Lord, even to him who hath said, <hi>By me Kings Reign,</hi> and this was our sacred Anchor whether some of us did flee for refuge in these sad dayes of our late confusions, propounding that same question to the Son of God, which he did to the son of Man, Exek. 37. <hi>Can these dead bones live.</hi> Now the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath made the four winds to breath life into these slain ones, that they not only live, but reign with glory.</p>
               <p>And as to have our refuge to him by prayer, so to return unto him the praise due to his Name, when a gracious Prince reigneth over us, or is restored unto us. This late wonderfull Revolution and Restauration of our sacred Soveraign, hath so clear characters of Gods own finger graven on it, that he who runneth may read them.</p>
               <p>As, 1. That it was done so unexpectedly, <hi>When the Lord turned back the captivity of our Zion,</hi> Psal. 126. <hi>we were like these that dream,</hi> even these among the heathen say, <hi>The Lord hath done great things for them,</hi> and we say cordially, The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof our hearts are glad.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it was done to us undeservedly, to a undeserving, yea, to an ill-deserving Nation. Were they not many of perverse spirits, who were saying with the wicked men, <hi>we will not have this man to reign over us,</hi> Luk. 19.27. Yea, some who with that cursed high Priest were prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying, <hi>It is expedient for us that one shuld die rather then the whole Nation perish,</hi> Joh. 11. 50. So that for the iniquity of our covetousnesse he was wroth, yet (saith the Lord) <hi>I have seen his wayes and I will heal him, I will lead him also, and restore comfort unto him and to his mourners,</hi> Isa. 57.17,18. The second Character of his hand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By whom was this delivery first intended and wrought, by one who ruleth in chief among the very souldiers, our noble and renowned <hi>Jerubabel,</hi> the scatterer of our confusions. When <hi>Saul</hi> was among the Prophets, the wise among them said, but who is their father, even the Lord was their prime mover.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Char.</hi> Look to the assisters and carriers on of this great work, we may say of many of them on every hand as <hi>Ioseph</hi> said of his brethren, whom they had sold, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.20. <hi>You did it unto me for evil, but the Lord turned it about to good, as at this day, to save many alive,</hi> and to breath life into a dying and languishing Nation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Char.</hi> How was it effectuat, <hi>sine sudore sine sanguine,</hi> not by might, not by strength, no ax, no hammer heard in the erecting this wonderfull fabrick; may we not cry, <hi>Grace, grace unto it,</hi> Zech. 4.7, from the very <hi>Alpha</hi> to the <hi>Omega</hi> of it. <hi>This then is the Lords doing, and it is marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in our eyes,</hi> Psal. 118.91. Therefore since this is the Lords own work so eminently, I would advise all with that Ruler <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> Acts 5.39. let us not intend to overthrow it, <hi>lest we be found fighters against God.</hi> Have we not then cause to blesse this great JEHOVAH by whom Kings Reign.</p>
               <p>And that 1. That we have a King: the showt of a King is a joyfull shout, saith even <hi>Balaam</hi> himself, and that he is given to us <hi>renascendo,</hi> in that same day wherein he was given to the world <hi>nascendo,</hi> born again in that same day he was born.
