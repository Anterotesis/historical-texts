         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And ſeeing a Paper emitted under the Title of <hi>An humble Remonſtrance,</hi> yet being in effect, A Band againſt God and his Covenant, Us and our authority, and this our native Kingdom and its Peace and Happineſſe, tho covered with the ſpecious pretences of Pietie and publike Liberty, Have found themſelves oblieged in dutie to take notice thereof, And to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive our good Subjects by unfolding the wickedneſſe and treachery of the ſame, which evidently appears, The perſons who have ſpeciall hand therein being formerly under the like guiltineſſe of Banding, contrary to the Nationall Covenant which themſelves had ſworn; And having ſince by ſeverall Bands and Oaths to be ſeen under their hand writings joyned themſelves to the Rebellion of that Excommunicate Traitour <hi>James Grahame</hi> and his Iriſh aſſociates, with whom they have correſponded this time paſt, Have now (as it ſeems) by his advice entred into this Band (the naturall iſſue of thoſe conſultations and meetings they have kept together of late) without the knowledge of the publike Judicatories of our Kingdom, contrary to the Law of the Land, and Acts of Parliament expreſly made in that behalf: And that they may the more eaſily inveigle the ſimpler fort, they have uſurped to themſelves the flouriſhing Titles of Lovers of Religion, Our Royall authority, and Our Kingdoms Peace; their Paper notwithſtanding clearly evidencing their intentions to be contrary to all theſe, By their changing and omitting ſeverall eſſentiall Articles in the Covenant, which are at length diſcovered by the Commiſſioners of the Kirk in their Declaration; By their ſlighting and contemning the wayes propoſed by both our Kingdoms, in ſending Propoſitions to us, for attaining a ſafe and well-grounded Peace: And preſumptuouſly taking upon themſelves to preſcribe other wayes, and to be Arbitrators of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent differences betwixt us and our people: By their traducing the publike proceedings of that our Kingdom, in their ſeeming regrait of the ſilence of the civil Judicatories, which by the Plague of Peſtilence and preſent Rebellion (fomented by the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants themſelves, who deſpiſed the maine Orders given to them by the publike Judicatories for ſuppreſſing thereof) hath been ſo long occaſioned, and is now happily provided for by the care of our Parliament, which hath appointed theſe Judicatories to meet at the ordinary time, if they be not letted by the indirect practiſes of thir Banders, and ſuch others, who under fair pretexts ſtudie the continuance of the preſent troubles, And by their open withholding their aſſiſting, and ſecret reſiſting the reſolutions of the Kingdom, Do what in them lies to weaken the ſtrength thereof, and render it a prey to Forreign powers: As alſo by their large enumerating the publike Burdens, which have been ſo neceſſarily laid on for preſerving our Kingdom from ruine, and are ſo much the heavier on theſe parts, That theſe who now complain moſt, have by their complyance with the Rebels, and refuſall to joyn againſt them, been altogether free thereof as yet: and which have been ſo ſparingly impoſed and providently diſpoſed of, that no juſt occaſion of complaint can be made thereof, as will appear by the publike Accompts at length peruſed by the Eſtates of our Parliament; and yet extant to the view of the world. And laſt, theſe Banders finding no readier mean to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten our good Subjects in the purſuance of this Cauſe, make large expreſsions of their ſenſe of the diſtreſſed condition of the Countrey, whiles they themſelves by their by-gone correſpondence and preſent Banding with declared Traitours and bloodie Iriſhes who have invaded this our Kingdom, Do really witneſſe their intentions to continue, and (ſo far as they are able) increaſe the troubles and diſtreſſes thereof, and ſeare the bowels of the ſame.

All which being at length conſidered by the Committee of Eſtates, And they finding this Band to be Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the Covenant, and ends conteined therein, Illegall, and againſt the Laws of our Kingdom, Prejudiciall to the publike Peace (now drawing towards a happy cloſe, if not interrupted by ſuch treacherous Plots) and Diviſive for fomenting of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and continuing the bloody Wars within our Kingdoms, Have declared they will proceed againſt the ſame accordingly: And therefore</p>
