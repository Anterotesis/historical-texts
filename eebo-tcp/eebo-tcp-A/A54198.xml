            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS the Tranquility and Welfare of Old <hi>England</hi> is a thing of univerſal Concern to all <hi>True Proteſtants,</hi> ſo ſhould our endeavour to preſerve it, be the ſame: If the Danger be general and publick, ſo let the Care alſo; ſince the ignorant Paſſenger may as well expect to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the ſinking Ship and drowned Pilot, as any man of an Eſtate (how little ſoever it be) to proſper under the Ruines of a <hi>Civil War,</hi> and downfal of Monarchy, Rebellion and Gaming being only fit for men that have nothing to loſe; 'Tis a meer <hi>Lottery of State,</hi> wherein are an hundred <hi>Blanks</hi> to one <hi>Prize.</hi> For the miſeries of a <hi>Civil War,</hi> we need not any Information from the Hiſtories of ancient <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Tiberius Gracchus, Marius,</hi> and <hi>Sylla, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the <hi>Triumvirate, &amp;c.</hi> Nor from the Diſſentions in <hi>Florence,</hi> begun by the <hi>Guelf</hi> and <hi>Ghibiline</hi> Factions; Nor from the Diſcords of <hi>France,</hi> under the Tumultuous Reigns of <hi>Henry</hi> III. and <hi>Henry</hi> IV. No, we have too freſh, and too ſad an Example of our own late Inteſtine <hi>Broils,</hi> which rendred this unhappy Nation little better then a Den of Thieves and Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, for almoſt the ſpace of 20 years; when under the diſguiſe of Religion, they committed the greateſt Impiety; and under the pretence of defending their Countries Liberty, enſlaved it: only with this difference, that inſtead of <hi>one good King,</hi> they ſet over us <hi>many Tyrants.</hi> What Prince, nay what Tyrant ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated the thouſandth part of thoſe outrages upon a People, which they did? till at length, out of an unſatiable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ravenous humour, like Beaſts of Prey, they fell to ſeclude and devour one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What Landlord was then Maſter of his own H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Nay what ſecurity had any man of his own Life, Family and Eſtate without being in danger of Hanging, Plundering, Sequeſtring and the like? Now who were the Authors of theſe miſchiefs, I ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to determine, only this I am ſure of, that the Fanaticks were no leſs guilty then the Papiſts: nor can any moderate Perſon think of the 30<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> with leſs Horrour then the 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> They are both equally enemies to the Government; and ſo alike declared by act of Parliament; they had both the ſame need of his Majeſty's moſt gracious <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi>; Neither were the Acts of one, leſs cruel then the other, as many who writ of, or lived in thoſe times inform us. I need not here acquaint you with the Papiſts murther of <hi>Henry</hi> the III. and <hi>Henry</hi> the VI. of <hi>France,</hi> their St. <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew</hi>'s <hi>Maſſacre,</hi> their <hi>Cicilian</hi> Veſper's, their <hi>Iriſh Maſſacre,</hi> and Rebellion, their ſeveral Plots againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi>; The <hi>Gunpowder-Treaſon,</hi> and how great, a ſhare they had in our late Civil Wars, as well as of their preſent inhumanity againſt the diſtreſſed <hi>French Hugonites</hi>; No, there are ſo many Tracts written of this Subject, and people are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſo well acquainted with their barbarous, and cruel Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that it would be but time loſt here to repeat them; Wherefore I ſhall wholly apply this diſcourſe to their Brethren in iniquity, the Fanaticks, Who are no leſs Culpable, though leſs diſcovered to the World; wherefore to take off their Holy Mask, give me leave out of a ſmall Treatiſe (called <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Ruſticus,</hi> or the <hi>Countries Complaint</hi>) to Epitomize to you ſome few Barbarous proceedings of theſe Sectaries, which were Executed upon the moſt Loyal Proteſtants by ſpecial or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Parliament.<note place="margin">A.D <hi>1642.</hi>

            <p>Secondly this Parliamentary Dominion, was no leſs Bloudy, and Tyranical then the moſt abſolute Monarchy of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Turkey,</hi> witneſs their <hi>High Court</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> which murthered
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43659:7"/>
the <hi>King,</hi> Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> and other Loyaliſts, nay, their own Friends the two Sir <hi>John Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thams,</hi> whom upon a vain Suſpition they ungratefully Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to death; but what was an Inhumanity equal to any thing in <hi>Popery,</hi> was, that the <hi>Godly Sectaries</hi> once put it to the Vote, whether they ſhould Maſſacre all the Royalliſts or no, which was carried in the Negative, but by two Voices; And had it once paſs'd, there are few but know, that <hi>Lambert</hi> and his Levelling Party had deſigned to deſtroy all the Nobility, and Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> cutting their Throats by the name of <hi>Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> whether they were ſo, or no; As for the Nobility, I mean the Houſe of <hi>Peers,</hi> that <hi>Parliament</hi> which put the King to Death, likewiſe preſently Voted them uſeleſs, Whereby we may obſerve, how entirely the Nobility and Gentry depend upon the King's Proſperity; Who was no ſooner Dethroned, but preſently the Lords are turned out of the Government, and the Gentry deſigned to be Maſſacred. So that of all Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranies, God deliver us from a perpetual Parliament, and of all Governments, from that of <hi>Geneva Fetters</hi> which conſiſts of many Links, being more troubleſom then thoſe of one. But to argue upon the ſquare, pray let me ask any of theſe <hi>Rumpers,</hi> why the <hi>King</hi> might not then as well <hi>Levy Money</hi> without <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> as the <hi>Commons</hi> without <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords</hi>? Why the <hi>King</hi> might not then intereſt himſelf in appointing what Members the People ſhould chuſe for <hi>Parliament,</hi> as well as <hi>Cromwels Major-General</hi> awed the <hi>Electors</hi> in the like caſe? And why the King might not then Govern by a <hi>Court Rump of a Parliament,</hi> as well as they by an <hi>Independent Rump</hi>? For my part, I think them alike grievances, and equally unlawful.</p>

            <p>Moreover, as the Government of the <hi>Long Parliament,</hi> was moſt Tyrannical and wicked, ſo alſo was the Uſurpation and behaviour of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> if rightly examined; for as Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> well obſerves,
<q>What can be more extraordinarily wicked, then for a private Subject to endeavour, not only to exalt himſelf above, but to trample upon all his equals and betters? to pretend freedom for all men, and under the help of that pretence, to make all men his Servants? to take Arms againſt ſcarce 200000 <hi>l.</hi> a year, and to raiſe for himſelf above two Millions? to quarrel for the loſs of 3 or 4 Ears, and ſtrike off 3 or 400 Heads? to fight againſt an imaginary ſuſpicion of 2000 Guards to be fetcht for the King, I know not from whence, and to keep up for himſelf no leſs then 40000? to pretend the defence of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and violently to diſſolve all, even of his own Calling, and almoſt Chooſing? to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Reformation of Religion, to rob it even to the very Skin, and then to expoſe it naked, to the Rage of all Sects and Hereſies? to ſet up Councils of Rapine, and Courts of Murther? to fight againſt the King, under a Commiſſion for him? to take him forcibly out of the hands of thoſe, for whom he had conquer'd him, to draw him into his Net with Proteſtations, and Vows of Fidelity; and when he had caught him in it, to Butcher him with as little Shame, as Conſcience, or Humanity, in the open face of the whole World? to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Commiſſion for King and Parliament, to murther (as I ſaid) the one, and deſtroy no leſs impudently the other? to fight againſt Monarchy, when he declared for it; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt it when he contrived for it, in his own Perſon? to abaſe perfidiouſly, and ſupplant ingratefully his own Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral firſt, and afterwards moſt of thoſe Officers, who with the loſs of their Honour, and hazard of their Souls, had lifted him up to the top of his unreaſonable Ambitions? equally to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Faith with all his Friends, and Enemies? to make no leſs frequent uſe of the moſt ſolemn Perjuries, then the looſer ſort of people do of common Oaths? to uſurp three Kingdoms without any ſhadow of the leaſt Pretenſions, and to govern

all theſe generally men of no Moral honeſty, or Religion, let them pretend what they will, but Drunkards, Whoremaſters, and Atheiſts; men of the worſt Converſation themſelves, who yet have the impudence to blame others for that which they themſelves ſtand convict of. If a Magiſtrate ſhews any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to his Under-Officers, or Servants, they complain againſt his being a Slave to Favourites, never looking into their own private Family, where ſome Favourite Steward, Waiting-woman, or <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> cheats him, and makes Slaves of all the reſt of the Servants. If a Magiſtrate caſts his Eye upon a handſom Woman, how do they cenſure his Effeminacy, as a meer <hi>Sardanapalus</hi>; when the very ſame perſons themſelves do oftentimes keep Wenches to domineer over their own virtuous Wives, ſpend their whole Eſtates upon Strumpets, and ſupplant their own Legitimate Children, with Baſtards.

            <p>That His Majeſty would comply with His Parliament in what may be for the good of both, ought to be the prayers of every true <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant,</hi> I am ſure they are mine, but ſome of theſe perhaps deſire ſuch a fatal Complyance as was that of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King <hi>Ninus,</hi> to his Queen <hi>Semiramis,</hi> who granting her the Regency but for five days, ſhe did in that ſhort time make a ſhift to deſtroy him; or as his Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Condeſcention to let the Parliament ſit during their own pleaſure, who never quitted their own Reign, till they had ended his; So dangerous is it for a Prince to fulfil the unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied deſires of a Craving Mobile; Who being without doors, have it not in the Orb of their underſtandings to Comprehend or Judge aright of the proceedings of a King and Parliament. Theſe are the Fomenters of the Common people, Who (though a moveable Body like the Ocean) yet never ſwell, but when blown upon by ſuch intemperate winds; or like the Swine in the Goſpel, are more furiouſly agitated by the diſcontented Spirits of others, than their own; They are like <hi>Eſop's</hi> Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter, who ſet people together by the ears with their Libels or falſe News, and therefore of all others the leaſt deſerve Quarter. And as heretofore by the names of Roundhead, and Cavalier, ſo now again they diſtinguiſh, and mark out for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction His Majeſty's Subjects by thoſe Factious Epithites of Whig, and Tory; which like Rogue, Raſcal, and other Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious terms do rarely paſs over without a bloudy Noſe, Like ill Servants betwixt Husband and Wife, they endeavour to breed a Jealouſy and miſ-underſtanding between King and People, hoping to advantage themſelves by the quarrel, and accordingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uſe their utmoſt endeavours to mis-repreſent his mildeſt Actions to his People; As for inſtance, if His Maieſty grants Liberty of Conſcience to the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> they, poſſeſs the people it is done in favour of the <hi>Papists</hi>; and on the contrary, if he ſuppreſſes them, then they ſay he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to it by the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Councels: So uncapable are they of being ſatisfied! Again, whilſt he deſiſts to proſecute the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> they call him a favourer of them; and when he puts out his Proclamation againſt them, then they preſently ſay it is Sugar-plums for the Parliament: ſo humourſom are theſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43659:10"/>
men. Such Enemies are they to Monarchy, that they hate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, for the ſame reaſon they love Petitions; oppoſition to the King. That Petitioning for a Parliament is lawful, I do not oppoſe; but to Petition ſo often for one and the ſame thing, and that too after his Majeſty has ſhew'd his diſlike of it, is (I am ſure) uncivil, and ſhews as if hereby they would either publiſh to the World their diſtruſt of his Majeſties ſingle Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or elſe render themſelves and their Party formidable to the Royal Authority, by the counterfeit number of their Petitioners. That the power of Calling and Diſſolving Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is ſolely in the King, their very Act of Petitioning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes; and yet if his Majeſty complies not with them at a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes warning, they preſently complain of Injuſtice.</p>
            <p>Again for Addreſſes, they are abſolute Abhorrers of them, as thinking it lawful to give our thanks to any one but the King, the Parliaments themſelves have often expreſſed their grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Loyalty to the King, Voting him thanks for many of his Speeches, and promiſing to ſtand by him with their Lives and Fortunes, againſt all his Enemies whatſoever: Nay the City of <hi>London,</hi> and many other Corporations, Burroughs and Counties, have done as much even to their own ſingle Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, Voting them their thanks, and promiſing to ſtand by them; and yet theſe men would deny his Majeſty tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Surely no man of ſence can har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour a thought ſo ridiculous, and void of Reaſon; Beſides, his Majeſty (as all men know) is of ſo mild and peaceable a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that no perſon upon Earth can be more averſe to ſuch a Tyrannical and bloudy undertaking, than himſelf: What one Act of ſeverity or cruelty, can his greateſt Enemy charge him with, throughout his Reign, nay in his whole life-time? Alas, 'tis our too great ignorance of other Neighbouring Princes, makes us not enough eſteem our own.</p>
            <p>No <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarch, even King <hi>James,</hi> or Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her ſelf, were ever more tender of, and careful to preſerve the Rights and Priviledges of the People, then King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second now is; Parliaments themſelves were never handled with that love, tenderneſs, and caution by any Prince, as by him; whoſe chief and only care is, not to violate their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, contrary to the proceedings of many of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; As for inſtance, in the 23. year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Paul Wentworth</hi> moved in the Houſe for a publick Faſt, and for a Sermon every morning at ſeven of the clock, before the Houſe ſate, and it was ordered accordingly. But the Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed hereof, ſent this Meſſage to the Houſe by her Vice. Chamberlain; <hi>That Her Highneſs much admired the Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43659:11"/>
of the Houſe, in committing ſuch an apparent Contempt of her expreſs Command, as to put in execution ſuch an Innovation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her privity, or pleaſure firſt known.</hi> Whereupon the Houſe acknowledging their ſaid offence and contempt, craving her pardon for the ſame, and promiſing to forbear the like for the future, Mr. Vice-Chamberlain by the Suffrage of the whole Houſe did accordingly carry up this their Submiſſion to the Queen.</p>
            <p>Alſo 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Peter Wentworth</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Bromley</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered a Petition to the Lord Keeper, deſiring the Lords of the Upper Houſe to be Suppliants with them of the Lower Houſe unto her Majeſty, for entailing the Succeſſion of the Crown, whereof a Bill was ready drawn. The Queen being highly diſpleaſed herewith, ſummoned the parties concern'd in this motion before her Councel, and made the Lord Keeper <hi>Buckhurſt</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Heneage</hi> commit <hi>Wentworth</hi> priſoner to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bromley</hi> to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> together with Mr. <hi>Stephens,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> Knight for <hi>Worceſterſhire.</hi> Another time this Queen, the 28<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of her Reign, ſent a ſevere Reprimand to the Houſe of Commons, for chooſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Knights of the Shire for <hi>Norfolk</hi>; a thing which ſhe ſaid was impertinent for the Houſe to meddle withal, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd only to the Office and care of her Chancellour, from whom the Writs iſſue, and are Return'd. Again, the Houſe of Commons by their Speaker (39 <hi>Eliz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>) complained of ſome Monopolies: whereupon the Lord Keeper made anſwer in her Majeſties Name, <hi>That her Majesty hoped her dutiful and loving Subjects, would not take away her Prerogative, which is the chiefeſt Flower in her Garden, the principal Pearl in her Crown and Diadem, but that they will rather leave that to her own diſpoſal.</hi>

            <p>In one Parliament, when Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> (afterwards Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>

Whereupon Mr. <hi>Wroth</hi> moved the Houſe, that they would be humble Suiters to her Majeſty, that ſhe would be pleaſed to enlarge thoſe Member<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

ſelf; and to preſs her Highneſs with this Suit, would be of dangerous conſequence; that the Houſe muſt not call the Queen to account for what ſhe doth of her Royal Authority; that the cauſes for which they are reſtrained, may be high and dangerous, and that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty liketh no ſuch Questions; neither that it did become the Houſe of Commons to ſearch into matters of that nature.</hi> And likewiſe (in the 39<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi>) the Commons were told, <hi>that their Priviledges were Yea, and No</hi>; and that her Majeſties pleaſure was, <hi>that if the Speaker perceived any idle heads which would not ſtick to hazard their own Eſtates, but meddle with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Church, and transforming the Commonwealth, by exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting Bills to that purpoſe, the Speaker ſhould not receive them till they were viewed and conſidered by thoſe who were fitter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of ſuch things, and can judge better of them.</hi> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,<note place="margin">

Alſo in the 21 of King <hi>James,</hi> a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſent from <hi>New-Market</hi> to the Parliament, wherein he aſſerts, <hi>That moſt Priviledges of Parliaments gr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Thus in the 13<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, a Parliament was called to conſult of the Domeſtick quiet, and the defence of the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the ſecurity of the Seas from Enemies: But the Commons humbly deſired, <hi>not to be put to conſult of things, Queux ols n'ont pas cognizance, whereof they had no cognizance.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:43659:12"/>In the 12 of the ſame King, the Commons being moved for their advice touching the proſecution of a War with <hi>France,</hi> after four days for Conſultation by an Elegant Speech of Juſtice <hi>Thorp,</hi> they anſwered <hi>that their humble deſire of the King, was, that he would be adviſed therein by the Lords, they being of more Experience then themſelves in ſuch Affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſixth year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, a Parliament was called to conſult whether the King ſhould go in perſon to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue the City of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> or ſend an Army thither, Wherein the Commons being asked their advice, by Sir <hi>Thomas Puckring</hi> their Speaker, they humbly anſwered, <hi>that the Councels did more aptly belong to the King and his Lords.</hi> The next year the Commons are deſired to adviſe of the Articles of peace with <hi>France,</hi> but they again <hi>modeſtly excuſe themſelves, as too weak to Councel in ſo weighty matters</hi>: And being a ſecond time preſs'd as they did tender the repute of their Countrey, and Right of their King, <hi>they humbly delivered their Opinoins rather for Peace, then War</hi>; Nay, and touching the point we are now upon, of naming a Succeſſor, I have ſeen (ſaith a late Author) a Manuſcript which makes mention that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, ſome two years before his death, Summon'd a Parliament, wherein he intimated to them, that one of his main deſigns of Confining that Parliament, was, <hi>that they ſhould declare a Succeſſor to the Crown,</hi> but the Parliament with much modeſty anſwered, <hi>that touching that point, it belonged to His Majesty to conſider of it, And conſul<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Let me not here be miſconſtrued, or cenſured to juſtifie his Majeſty, by Reflecting on the priviledges of the Commons: for as I would not have the King loſe the leaſt Tittle of his Prerogative, ſo neither would I have the Commons one hairs breadth of their priviledges; nor do I go to preſcribe the late Houſes by the Foot-ſteps of their Predeceſſors, ſince by the Conceſſion, or Connivance of late Princes, 'tis poſſible their priviledges may be increaſed; no, my only deſign is partly to ſatisfie the World that no King of <hi>England</hi> ever dealt more Candidly with a Parliament then our preſent Soveraign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no not Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her ſelf, who is ſo much the peoples Darling; and partly, by the Loyal Moderate example of former Houſes, to prevent any heats for the future.

               </note> theſe Malecontents encourage the moſt hainous Criminals, and thoſe who have more perſonally and particularly offended his Majeſty, to Petition the Houſe of Commons, thereby thinking either to force the King, as it were, againſt his own inclinations, to releaſe ſuch his Enemies, or elſe to put him upon a neceſſity of diſobliging the Houſe by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial; and ſo on the contrary, they (too often) excite them to Addreſs themſelves to his Majeſty, for the Removal of ſuch Miniſters who are chiefly in his favour; as if it were a thing of that ſmall concern to a Prince, to ſacrifice his moſt intimate Friends, to whom he hath unboſomed his moſt ſecret Councels, and who perhaps is ſo charged only, for executing his Maſters Precepts. Alas! let every man but make it his own Caſe, and ſee how uneaſie he ſhould be to part with, or give credit to any

evil report againſt an old Friend, Relation or Servant, without ſome convincing undeniable proof made out againſt him: Not but that ſuch Addreſſes may be lawful, and many times expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; alſo Miniſters of State, too often faulty. Nevertheleſs, ſuch Votes and Petitions ought not to be raſhly undertaken, but firſt duly weigh'd and conſidered, with the grounds, and evidences againſt them; and this more eſpecially now, ſince his Majeſty hath been pleaſed to declare, as he will not govern Arbitrarily himſelf, ſo neither ſhall his Subjects one towards another. Which puts me in mind of the ſtory of the two <hi>Roman</hi> Embaſſadors, <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Horatius,</hi> who being ſent by the <hi>Decem-viri</hi> to the People, to enquire of their grievances, the People amongſt other things complained of the Tyranny of the <hi>Decem-viri,</hi> deſiring to have them deliver'd up into their hands, that they might burn them alive: But the Embaſſadors not conſenting to their demand, replyed, <hi>Crudelitatem damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, incrudelitatem ruitis</hi>; you condemn Cruelty, and practiſe it your ſelves.</p>
            <p>I do not find that the Houſe of Commons was ever Petition'd till about the middle of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh's Reign, which Petition is inſerted among the Statutes: But though the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be directed to the Houſe of Commons in its Title, yet the Prayer of the Petition is turn'd to the King, and not to the Commons. The Petition begins thus; <hi>To the Right Worſhipful Commons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled; Shews to your diſcreet wiſdoms, the Wardens of the Fellowſhip of the Craft of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholſterers within</hi> London, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the concluſion is, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may it pleaſe the Kings Highneſs, by the Advice of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and his Commons in Parliament,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, I find many Examples to prove that though the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance and debating of great State-affairs, belong to the High Court of Parliament, yet heretofore the Lords have oftentimes tranſmitted ſuch buſineſs to the Kings Privy-Council; amongſt others let this ſuffice: When one <hi>Mortimer,</hi> who ſtiled himſelf <hi>Captain Mendall,</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Jack Cade</hi>) came with a Rabble of the Vulgar, with a Petition to the Lower Houſe, the Commons ſent it up to the Lords, and the Lords tranſmitted it to the Kings Privy-Council to conſider of. But to conclude this point, the difference between King and Parliament is, that the one repreſents <hi>God,</hi> the other the <hi>People</hi>; the Conſultative power by the Kings permiſſion is in Parliament, but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43659:15"/>
power remains inſeparable in him; the reſults and productions of Parliaments, at beſt are but Bills, 'tis the Kings breath makes them Laws; which are till then but dead things, they are like Matches unfired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis the King that gives them Life, and Light: The Lords adviſe, the Commons conſent, but the King ordains; they mould the Bills, but the King makes them Laws.</p>
            <p>Having thus now ſufficiently vindicated our moſt Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, againſt all the malicious aſperſions of his Enemies, who would falſly and treacherouſly charge the beſt-natur'd Prince under Heaven, with having a deſign to introduce an Arbitrary Government here amongſt us; give me leave in the next place to ſpeak to their no leſs Devilliſh, and wicked Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his being a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> which theſe Traytors caſt upon him in Revenge, to alienate (were ſuch a thing poſſible) the hearts and affections of his Loyal Subjects, from that Duty and Allegiance they owe to him. They firſt pretended his Majeſty to be in a Plot againſt his own Life, and now becauſe that ſeems too ridiculous, they give out, that whereas there were two parts of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> the one to introduce <hi>Popery,</hi> the other to <hi>kill the King,</hi> his Majeſty was made acquainted only with the former part of it, (<hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>) the introducing of <hi>Popery,</hi> and not with <hi>his own death.</hi> But here let any Rational man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for what end they ſhould deſign to take off the King, unleſs it were that he would not aid and aſſiſt them in bringing in the <hi>Popiſh Religion</hi> into this Kingdom; for if he were (as theſe men ſay) privy and aſſiſting to their <hi>Plot</hi> of ſubverting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for what purpoſe ſhould they then conſpire againſt his Perſon? we muſt therefore either ſuſpend our belief of the one, or the other at leaſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in favour to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party they would make the world believe that in an unnatural manner, his Majeſty ſhould for his Royal Brothers ſake, conſent to the deſtruction of his own natural Son the D. of <hi>M.</hi> and accordingly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs his Grace with an opinion, that he was ſent into <hi>Flanders</hi> on purpoſe to be deſtroyed; hoping by this means to ſet the Son againſt his Father, and render him like that worſt of Men, <hi>Darius,</hi> who together with Fifty of his Baſtard Brethren Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the Life of his moſt Indulgent Father <hi>Artaxe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>xes,</hi> that good King of <hi>Perſia</hi>; in which Conſpiracy (as the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ſays,)
<q>it was prodigious, that in ſo great a Number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:43659:15"/>
Parricide could not only be contracted, but concealed, and that amongſt Fifty of his Children, there was not one found, whom neither the Majeſty of a King, nor the reverence of an Ancient man, nor the Indulgency of ſo good a Father, could recall from ſo horrible an Act.</q>
               <hi>Justin lib.</hi> 10. We read how <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> uſed to ſay, That ſuch men as He reſembled <hi>Oaks,</hi> to whom men come for ſhelter, when they have need of them in Rain, and deſire to be protected by their Boughs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But when it is fair, they come to them to ſtrip and peel them. <hi>Aelian lib.</hi> 9. <hi>ch.</hi> 18. In the ſame manner do the Brotherhood by the D. of <hi>M.</hi> make all their preſent Applications to him, as thinking him a fit Pole to ſupport thoſe helpleſs Hops, and the only perſon of whom for Quality and Courage they may make uſe as a General againſt a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor</hi>; they make him the Claw to take the Cheſnut out of the Fire, which being done they will as ignominiouſly caſhier him, their deſign being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to erect a <hi>Geneva</hi> Republick, and no other: Nay, did they yet intend a Monarchy, their malice would after ſuch a Rebellion reject him, even for his <hi>Royal Fathers</hi> ſake; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as his Grace muſt draw his Virtue from His Bloud, ſo I doubt not but e're long to hear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fatted Calf is kill'd, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince he is bleſſed with ſo merciful a King, and ſo indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent a Father.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, Another Argument which they urge to prove the King a favourer of <hi>Popery,</hi> is, his being unwilling to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherit his only Brother, and (if his Majeſty die before him without Iſſue) his next lawful Succeſſor. On this ſubject out of <hi>Doleman</hi>'s Succeſſion of the Crown, (though a <hi>Popiſh Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>) they ſteal many <hi>Protestant Arguments,</hi> which (to be thought Learned men,) they vent for their own; as indeed upon all other ſubjects, their Speeches are nothing but fragments out of old <hi>Parliament Pamphlets,</hi> collected, pack'd together, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their own; <hi>Ephemeris Parliamentaria</hi> is a Book of main uſe to them for this purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But to return to our ſubject: Now let any man make this his own Caſe, and conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould not think it a hard put upon him, to be forced to diſ-inherit his own Son, (the objection lying as well againſt a Son, as a Brother) only for his changing his Religion, and that too as well for turning <hi>Presbyterian, Anabaptiſt,</hi> or <hi>Quaker,</hi> as for turning <hi>Pap<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Land, witneſs the 35 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> Nay to Sacrifice, and deliver up a Brother, who hath ſo often expoſed his Life amongſt crouds of Bullets, and to the raging of the boiſterous Seas, for the Security and Honour both of King and Kingdom; a Brother who was an equal ſharer with him in all his late Afflictions, as well in the loſs of a Father, as in other ſad effects of the late dreadful Rebellion, this muſt be no ſmall violence to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; eſpecially ſince it was never yet made appear, that his R. H. was in the leaſt privy to any <hi>Plot,</hi> or <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> againſt the Perſon of his Sacred Majeſty; nay, by Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion it appears, that theſe bloudy-minded <hi>Papiſts</hi> had as well deſigned to take away the Duke's Life, as the King's, had they not found him fitting for their turn; which ſhews that they were never aſſured of his Highneſſes joyning with them, but rather that he was altogether ignorant of their Intrigues, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made them queſtion his adherence: ſince it may be very poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a younger Brothers Servant, to conſpire the death of his Maſters elder Brother, in hopes to better his Service, without ever acquainting his Maſter with the deſign. Which things conſidered, it ſeems to me very unreaſonable to cenſure his Majeſty for his unwillingneſs to diſ-inherit his Brother, purely upon a ſurmiſe, and no proof; alſo to argue from the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that muſt attend the Dominion of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> were to diſown that Precept of Chriſtianity, which forbids us <hi>to do evil that good may come of it.</hi> Nevertheleſs, as the Houſe of Commons voted, I cannot but acknowledge, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate pervertion of his Royal Highneſs, may have been a great encouragement of that Party to hope once more to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their Superſtitious Worſhip amongſt us, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they may, (contrary to his Highneſſes knowledge,) enter into Plots and Conſpiracies, to divide and ſet us altogether by the Ears; when in the mean time, like the Kite in the Fable, they would come and ſeize upon us both; for the <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> maintaining throughout the World a Traffick of <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>privy Conſpiracy,</hi> have yet had ſo much wit, as to Land it in <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Bottoms, (fit Veſſels for Rebellion) and to cover their diſobedience to Governours, under the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> who naturally acknowledge none; ſo that to ruine this <hi>Popiſh Fabrick,</hi> we muſt extirpate this <hi>Fanatick Foundation.</hi> Therefore I could heartily wiſh, and I do believe that moſt moderate men are now of the ſame opinion,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43659:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that if the Parliament had embraced his Majeſties gracious offers of hampering and fettering a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> by Laws, ſo as to render him (as much as was poſſible) uncapable of Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Government either in Church or State, and that by ſome Parliamentary expedient they had taken away his Sting; ſince now by refuſing to accept any thing, becauſe we cannot have every thing, we expoſe our ſelves both at home and abroad to danger, we miſs the opportunity of making other good Laws both againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> who might have come upon us in this Interim, when we had no Law to oppoſe Him, and his Majeſty (whom we daily think in ſo much danger) done otherwiſe then well, alſo for fear of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain danger of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> (whom with Gods bleſſing his Majeſty may ſurvive) we expoſe not only our ſelves,<note place="margin">Nec quies gentium ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne armis, nec arma ſine ſtipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio, nec ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendia ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Tributi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Moreover, excepting this Bill of Succeſſion, which never came to his hands, what other Security for the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion has His Majeſty ever denyed the Parliament; has he not offered to paſs any expedient that could be propoſed, has he not put out what ever Proclamations they deſired, either to baniſh the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſo many miles, or to encourage more Witneſſes to come in, with promiſes of Rewards, and pardon! In Fine, what has he left undone that might tend to promote further Diſcovery, to extirpate <hi>Popery,</hi> and to ſecure the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion?

And this I make no queſtion has been one main reaſon. (together with their promiſe of Salvation to the Converter) that allured many of the moſt vertuous ſort of <hi>Papiſts</hi> into this Conſpiracy of introducing <hi>Popery</hi> amongſt us; Another reaſon which may have prompted their Clergy, and the moſt diſſolute ſort of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to this undertaking, was perhaps, the vaſt Rich Abbies, and Revenues which did heretofore belong to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and the which they cannot but with envy now behold in the poſſeſſion of their Enemies; neither would they give themſelves the leaſt trouble for our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, were it not more for our Eſtates-ſake then for our Souls good; Wherefore as their Intereſt why there ſhould be a <hi>Plot,</hi> is one argument to me there is one; So the <hi>Plot</hi> is likewiſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument to me, that they have a deſign upon Church-Lands; for which reaſon I could almoſt wiſh that all the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies in <hi>England</hi> had been demoliſhed and Levelled with the ground at the time of the Reformation, ſince the beſt way to deſtroy <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as well as Crows, is to pluck down both their Neſts.

you would not too eaſily credit thoſe idle reports and jealouſies concerning the King and Government, which are raiſed only to deceive you; that, as well in your <hi>Judgment</hi> as <hi>Obedience,</hi> you would follow the Supreme Authority of the Nation; eſteeming the King's Glory your Honour, and His Grandeur your Security.

               </gap>ſty ſhall ſummon your Picture again to ſit in the Parliament-houſe, be ſure it be drawn by a good Hand: The Government by King, Lords and Commons is the beſt of all others, therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſupport it, by following every man his own Vocation, reſigning State-affairs to the Conduct of King and Parliament, to whom they more properly belong; As for my ſelf, I was ever before of a different opinion, and bluſh not to own that my Principles are changed, ſince 'tis not out of any Preferment, Intereſt or expectation at Court, (which as I never wanted, ſo I never ſought after) but purely upon the merits of the Cauſe. I now perceive ſo much Faction and Knavery among the <hi>Whig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Party,</hi> and ſo much uncertainty among the Witneſſes, that he who wiſhes well to King <hi>Charles</hi> and old <hi>England,</hi> muſt equally abhor both <hi>Whigs</hi> and <hi>Tories,</hi> that is, both Enemies to King, and Enemies to Parliaments.</p>
            <p>Again, Gentlemen, as well our Intereſt as Duty obliges us to promote Peace; and though we ſhould (as we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to do) apprehend our ſelves to be under ſome ſmall grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, yet let us eſteem it as a Scab, that oftentimes breaks out in the moſt wholeſom conſtituted Bodies of States, and may with leſs ſmart be continued on, then picked off. If hopes of raiſing a Fortune be any motive to engage you to a Party, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member firſt, that the ſole power of rewarding Virtue, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Vice, is in the Kings Breaſt; all Imployments both of Honour and Profit, ſolely at his Majeſties diſpoſal:<note place="margin">☜</note> and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, remember that the Die of War ſeldom turns to their advantage that firſt caſt it: Thus <hi>Oliver,</hi> who was not known or heard of at the beginning of the late War, nevertheleſs went away with the Prize. Therefore (ſaith a late Author) 'tis good to have patience, and ſee the Tree ſufficiently ſhaken, before you run and ſcramble for the Fruit, leſt inſtead of Profit or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, you meet with a Cudgel or Stone; and then too, ſee that you fall in rather by Compulſion, then Deſign. The example of <hi>Brutus,</hi> rather then <hi>Cato,</hi> is to be followed in bad times; it

being ſafer to be patient, then active; or appear a Fool, then a Malecontent. Should you ever live to be reduced under the extremity of a Tyrants Reign, and he ſhould exact an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of Obedience from you, I ſee not how either in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience or Intereſt you could refuſe him, it being the higheſt frenzy imaginable to diſpute your Innocency with thoſe able to convert the greateſt into a fault; no Plea is ſufficient to bar the Lyon of his Right. Alſo if it be no diſhonour to ſubmit to a ſtronger Party, (though of Thieves) when fallen into their hands, then let not the example of a few Fools, who (like Lice) thrive no where ſo well as in a Priſon, tempt you to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your felicity againſt the Imperative power, under which the diſpoſure of your perſon doth wholly remain, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore madneſs to deny it words. It is moſt dangerous to be the Pen or Mouth of a multitude congregated by the Jingling of their Fetters, leſt a Pardon or Compliance knock them off, and all the Reckoning left for you to pay; when if you expect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from the Common people, you will then too late find the wiſe <hi>Florentine</hi>'s words true, <hi>That he who builds upon the People, builds upon dirt;</hi> ſince the zeal of the Rabble is not ſo ſoon heated by the real oppreſſions of their Rulers, but may be as eaſily cooled by the ſpecious promiſes and breath of Authority. <hi>Maſſianello</hi> adored by the Mobile one day, is torn in pieces by the ſame the next; therefore Nurſe not Ambition with your own Bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor Sacrifice a Gallant Perſon for the Applauſes of an ungrateful, unthinking Croud, which Fame (like <hi>Venus</hi>) is formed only out of the foam of the People. Neither are any grown'd more in this Warlike Mill of Viciſſitudes, then ſuch obſtinate Fools, who glory in the repute of State-Martyrs after they are dead; which concerns them no more, then what was ſaid an hundred years before they were born; it being the greateſt odds their Names will not be Regiſtred,<note place="margin">☞</note> or if they be, after death they are no more ſenſible of Honour, then any dead Animal whatſoever. Moſt perſons have enough to do about their own private concerns of Family and Eſtate, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what greater folly can there be, then to ſend to Market for troubles, as thoſe do that vex themſelves about State-affairs, Foreign Wars, and the like?</p>

another; ſo let me conclude with this diſſwaſive from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary attempts, by ſhewing you the happy difference betwixt our preſent condition, and that of 41. Firſt, God be thanked our Enemies want ſuch a Factious Parliament, with malice and cunning to invent miſchief. Secondly, (God be praiſed for it) they want ſuch a perpetual Parliament, with power to countenance and ſupport all Factious deſigns, without fear of being diſſolved. Thirdly, That Providence which I truſt will defend both King and Kingdom, hath denied them at preſent ſuch a Popular General, and Officers to carry on the Sedition for them in the Field, without which their Treaſon muſt ſoon fall to the ground; for a Multitude without a Head, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unſerviceable, as appear'd upon the Accident of <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>; When the People having taken Arms, and re<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Fourthly, and Laſtly, <hi>Astrea</hi> (ſince his Majeſties happy Reſtauration) hath deſcended and fixed the Militia up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its right Owner, which Militia (under pretence of belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the People) was before made uſe of againſt the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now all theſe Conſiderations, together with the never-to-be-forgotten ſmart of the late Civil War, may I hope conduce to that everlaſting Peace and Union of King and Kingdom, which is ſo continually and earneſtly implored of Almighty God, by</p>
