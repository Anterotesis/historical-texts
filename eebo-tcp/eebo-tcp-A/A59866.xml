            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
RESOLUTION
Of some
CASES of CONSCIENCE,
Which respect
Church-Communion.</head>
            <p>IN order to state such cases as particularly relate
to Church-Communion with all possible clearness,
it will be necessary to premise a brief explication
of some words, which must be used in questions of
this nature, but are not so commonly understood.</p>
            <p>As,
<list>
                  <item>1. What is meant by a Church, and a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church.</item>
                  <item>2. What Church Communion is.</item>
                  <item>3. What is meant by Fix't Communion and by
Occasional Communion.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, What is meant by a Church. Now the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
description I can give of a Church is this,</hi> That
the Church is a Body or Society of Men separated from
the rest of the World, and Vnited to God, and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by a Divine Covenant. <hi>I shall briefly explain this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62060:3"/>
description to fit it to the meanest understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Then a Church is a Body or Society of Men, for
I speak only of the Church in this World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shall not enter into that dispute, in what sense
Angels belong to the Church.</p>
            <p>And when I call the Church a <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Society</hi> of
Men, I oppose a <hi>Body</hi> to single <hi>Individuals,</hi> or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Men, and to <hi>a confused Multitude,</hi> without
any order or Union among themselves. For tho the
Church consists of particular Men, and when their
Numbers are encreased, of great Multitudes, yet the
Church consists of such particular Men, not considered
in a private and separate capacity, but as United into
a regular Society, which is called a <hi>Body,</hi> in allusion
to the natural Body, in which all the parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are United in an exact Order, <hi>Eph. 4. 16. 1 Cor.
12. 15, 16, &amp;c. For God is not the Author of Confusion,
but of Peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints.</hi> And
if the meanest Societies cannot subsist without Order,
wherein their strength and beauty and usefulness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
much less the Church of God, which is a Society
Instituted for the most Spiritual and Supernatural
Ends.</p>
            <p>And therefore we find, that God ordained a most
exact Order and Government in the Jewish Church,
which for the greater strength and Unity he formed
into a religious Common-wealth: And our Blessed
Saviour ordained the Apostles, and committed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of his Church to them, and their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
with a promise <hi>to be with them to the end of the
World.</hi> And the Christian Church with respect to the
firm and close Union and orderly Disposition of all its
Parts,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 21, 22.</note> is not only called a Body, but a <hi>Spiritual Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15.</note>
and <hi>Holy Temple,</hi> and <hi>the House of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62060:3"/>
But then the Church is a Body, or <hi>one</hi> Body, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to many bodies, for Christ has but one Body,
and one Church, and he is the Saviour of this Body.
The Jewish Church was but one, and therefore the
Christian Church is but one, which is not a new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Church, but is grafted into the Jewish stock or
Root. Believing Jews, and Christians being United
into one Church,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>built upon the foundation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief
corner stone:</hi> Who unites Jews and Gentiles into one
Church, as the corner stone unites both sides of the
House, and holds them together.</p>
            <p>Upon the same account the Church is called the
<hi>Building,</hi> the <hi>House,</hi> the <hi>Temple</hi> of God, and we
know the Temple was but one, and was to be but one,
by the express command and Institution of God. And
for the same reason Christ tells us,<note place="margin">John 10. 16.</note> that there should
be but <hi>one Fold under one Shepherd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed it is extreemly absurd and unreasonable
to say, that the Christian Church, which is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the same foundation, which worships the same God
and Saviour, which professes the same Faith, are Heirs
to the same promises, and enjoy all priviledges in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
should be divided into as distinct and separate
bodies, tho of the same kind and nature, as <hi>Peter,
James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> are distinct Persons, tho they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the same common nature. That is, it is very
absurd to say, that where every thing is common,
there is not one Community. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi>
tho they partake of the same common nature, yet each of
them have a distinct essence and subsistence of their own
(as it must be in natural Beings, otherwise there could
be but one Man in the World) and this makes them
distinct Persons: But where the very nature and essence
of a Body or Society consists in having all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62060:4"/>
there can be but one Body; and therefore if
<hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all,</hi> be common to the whole Christian Church,
if there be no peculiar Priviledges, which belong to
some Christians and not to all, to one part of the
Church, and not to another, then by the Institution
of Christ, there is but one Church, one Body, one
Communion, one Household and Family: For where
there is nothing to Distinguish and Separate, no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closures
or Partitions of Divine Appointment, there
can be, by Divine Institution, but one Body.</p>
            <p>2. I add, that the Church is a Body or Society of
Men separated from the rest of the World, or called
out of the World, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from whence <hi>Ecclesia</hi>
is derived, may signifie, and is so expounded by many
Divines, upon which account the Christians are so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
called, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Called and Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
or Elect People of God, which signifies, that the
Church is distinguished from the rest of the World
by a peculiar and appropriate Faith, by peculiar Laws,
by peculiar rites of Worship, and peculiar Promises
and Priviledges, which are not common to the whole
World, but only to those, who are received into the
Communion of the Church. But there is no contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
about this matter, and therefore I need add no
more about it.</p>
            <p>3. The Church is a Body of Men united to God
and to themselves by a Divine Covenant: The Church
is united to God, for it is a Religious Society, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
for the Worship of God; and they are united
among themselves, and to each other, because it is
but one Body, which requires a union of all its parts;
as I have already shewed, and shall discourse more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.
But the chief thing to be observed here is
this, that this union with God, and to each other,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62060:4"/>
which constitutes a Church, is made by <hi>a Divine Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
Thus it was in the Jewish Church. God entered
into Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and chose him and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
for his Church and Peculiar People, and gave him
Circumcision for a Sign and Seal of this Covenant.
And under the Gospel God hath made a new Covenant
with Mankind, in and by his Son Jesus Christ, who
is <hi>the Mediator of a Better Covenant, founded upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Promises;</hi> and this Gospel Covenant is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Christian Church. For the Christian
Church is nothing else, but such a Society of Men, as
is in Covenant with God through Christ.</p>
            <p>I suppose all Men will grant, that God only
can make or constitute a Church. For such persons,
if there were any so absurd, are not worth disputing
with, who dare affirm the Church to be a human
Creature, or the Invention of Men.</p>
            <p>And I think it is as plain, that the only visible way
God has of forming a Church (for I do not now speak
of the invisible operations of the Divine Spirit) is by
granting a Church-Covenant, which is the Divine
Charter, whereon the Church is founded, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesting
some persons with Power and Authority, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
others into this Covenant, according to the terms
and conditions of the Covenant, and by such Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Rites and Forms of Admission, as he is pleased to
institute, which under the Gospel is Baptism, as under
the Law it was Circumcision.</p>
            <p>To be taken into Covenant with God, and to be
received into the Church, is the very same thing.
For the Church is a Society of Men, who are in
Covenant with God. That can be no Church, which
is not in Covenant with God, he is no member of the
Church, who is not at least visibly admitted into Gods
Covenant, and whoever is in Covenant with God,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62060:5"/>
is made a member of the Church, by being admitted
into Covenant.</p>
            <p>Now before I proceed, I shall briefly observe some
few things, which are so plain and evident, if these
Principles be true, that I need only name them, and
yet are of great use for the resolution of some follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cases.</p>
            <p>As
<list>
                  <item>1. That a Covenant-state and Church-state is
the same thing.</item>
                  <item>2. That every profest Christian, who is received
into Covenant, as such, is a Church member.</item>
                  <item>3. That nothing else is necessary to make us mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Christan Church but only Baptism, which
is the Sacrament of our admission into the Christian
Covenant. For if Baptism, which gives us right to
all the Priviledges of the Covenant, does not make
us Church members, then a Church-state is no part of
the Covenant; then a man may be in Covenant with
God through Christ, and yet be no member of Christ;
or he may be a member of Christ and no member of
his Body, which is the Church.</item>
                  <item>4. That no Church-state can depend upon human
Contracts and Covenants, for then a Church would
be a human Creature, and a human Constitution;
whereas a Church can be founded only upon a Divine
Covenant. It is true, no man, who is at age, can
be admitted to Baptism till he profess his Faith in
Christ, and voluntarily undertake the Baptismal Vow;
but the Independent Church-Covenant betwixt Pastor
and People, is of a very different Nature from this,
unless any man will say, that the voluntary contract
and Covenant, which the Independents exact from
their members, and wherein they place a Church-state
be part of the Baptismal Vow. If it be not, then they
found the Church upon a human Covenant, for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62060:5"/>
Christ hath made but one Covenant with Mankind,
which is contained in the Vow of Baptism. If it be, then
no Man is a Christian, but an Independent, and then
they would do well to shew, how the Baptismal Vow,
which is but one and the same for all Mankind, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
one Man to be a fixt member of Dr. <hi>Owens</hi>
Church, another of Mr. <hi>Griffiths,</hi> or any other Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Pastors; and if they could get over this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
there is another still, why they exact this Church-Covenant
of Baptized Christians, before they will
admit them to their Communion, if Baptism makes
them members of their Church.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This I think makes it plain, that the Independent
Church-Covenant is no part of the Baptismal Vow,
and then it is no part of the Christian Covenant; and
if there be no true Church-state, but what depends
on such human Contracts, then the Church owes
its being to the will of Men, not to the Covenant of
God.</p>
            <p>5. I observe farther, how absurd it is to gather
Churches out of Churches, which already consist of
Baptized Christians. Christianity indeed separates
us from the rest of the World, but surely it does not
separate Christians from each other. The Apostles
only undertook to Convert Jews and Heathens to the
Christian Faith, and to make them members of the
Christian Church, which is a state of separation from
the World; but these Men Convert Christians from
Common Christianity, and the Communion of the
universal Church, to Independency. If the Church
be founded on a divine Covenant, we know no Church
but what all Christians are made members of by
Baptism, which is the universal Church, the one
Body and Spouse of Christ. And to argue from the
Apostles gathering Churches from among Jews and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62060:6"/>
Heathens, to prove the gathering Churches out
of a Christian and National Church, must either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that a Church, and Church-state is a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
and Arbitrary thing, and that Men may be
very good Christians, and in a safe condition without
it; or that Baptized Christians, who are not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of a particular Independent Church, are no better
than Jews and Heathens, that is, that Baptism it self,
though a Divine Sacrament and Seal of the Covenant,
is of no value, till it be confirmed and ratified by a
human Independent Covenant.</p>
            <p>6. I observe, that if the Christian Church be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on a Divine Covenant, on that new Covenant, which
God hath made with Mankind in Christ, then there
is but one Church of which all Christians are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
as there is but one Covenant into which we are
all admitted by Baptism. For the Church and the
Covenant must be of an equal extent. There can be
but one Church founded upon one Covenant, and all
who have an interest in the same Covenant, are
members of the same Church.</p>
            <p>And therefore, tho the distance of place, and the
necessities and conveniences of Worship and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
may, and has divided the Church into several
parts and members, and particular Churches, yet the
Church cannot be divided into two or more distinct
and separate Churches, for that destroyes the unity of
the Church: and unless they could divide the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
also, two Churches, which are not members
of each other, cannot partake in the same Covenant,
but the guilty Divider forfeits his interest in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
without a new grant.</p>
            <p>A Prince indeed may grant the same Charter to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
distinct Cities and Corporations, but then tho
the matter of the Charter be the same, their right to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62060:6"/>
it depends upon distinct Grants. But if he grant a
Charter for the Erecting of such a Corporation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
his Charter to the members of that Corporation,
those who wilfully separate themselves from this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
to which this Charter was granted, forfeit
their interest in the Charter, and must not think to
Erect a new distinct Corporation by the same Charter.</p>
            <p>Thus it is here, God hath made a Covenant of grace
with Mankind in Christ, and declares that by this one
Covenant, he unites all the Disciples of Christ into
one Body and Christian Church, who shall all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the Blessings of this Covenant. By Baptism
we are all received into this Covenant, and admitted
members of this one Church; now while we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in the Unity of this Body, it is evident, that we
have a right to all the Blessings of the Covenant,
which are promised to this Body, and to every member
of it. But if we divide our selves from this Body,
and set up distinct and separate Societies, which we
call Churches, but which are not members, nor live
in Communion with the one Catholick Church, we
cannot carry our Right and Title to the Covenant out
of the Church with us.</p>
            <p>The Gospel-Covenant is the common Charter of
the Christian-Church, and if we are not contented to
enjoy these Blessings in common with other Christians
we must be contented to go without them. For it
is not a particular Covenant, which God makes with
particular Separate Churches, but a general Covenant
made with the whole Body of Christians, as United
in one Communion, and therefore that, which no
particular Church has any interest in, but as it is a
member of the universal Church.</p>
            <p>God hath not made any Covenant in particular with
the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62060:7"/>
with the one Body and Church of Christ, all the
World over; and therefore the only thing, that can
give us in particular a right to the Blessings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
is, that we observe the conditions of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and live in Unity and Communion with all
true Christian Churches in the World, which makes
us members of the Catholick Church, to whom the
Promises are made.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The next thing to be explained is, what
is meant by Church-Communion. Now Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
signifies no more then Church-Fellowship
and Society, and to be in Communion with the
Church is to be a member of the Church; and this is
called Communion, because all Church members have
a common right to Church Priviledges, and a common
Obligation to all those Duties and Offices, which a
Church relation Exacts from them.</p>
            <p>I know this word <hi>Communion</hi> is commonly used to
signifie a Personal and presential Communion in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Offices: as when Men pray, and hear, and
receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper together,
they are said to be in Communion with one another
and to live in Communion with that Church, with
which they joyn in all Acts of Worship.</p>
            <p>Now we must acknowledge, that Publick Acts of
Worship performed in the Communion of the Church,
are an Exercise of Christian Communion, but Church-Communion
is something antecedent to all the Acts
and Offices of Communion. For no Man has a right
to any Act of Christian Communion, but he, who is
in a State of Communion with the Christian Church.</p>
            <p>What natural Union is in natural Bodies, that
Communion is in Bodies Politick, whether Civil or
Religious Societies; a member must be vitally united
to the Body, before it can perform any natural Action
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62060:7"/>
or Office of a member; before the Eye can see, or the
Feet can walk, or the Ears can hear; and the union of
the Eye, or Foot, to the Body, does not consist in
seeing or walking, but seeing and walking are the
effects of this Union.</p>
            <p>Thus in a Body Politick, when Men by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Charter are United into one Society, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one common Body, or one Communion; and
this gives them right to all the priviledges of that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and obliges them to all the Duties and Offices,
which their Charter requires of them; but should any
Man, who is not regularly admitted into this Society,
pretend to the same Priviledges, or do such things, as
are required of those, who are members of this Body,
this would be so far from being thought an Act of
Communion with them, that it would be censured
as an unjust Usurpation. Should a Man, who is no Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
of <hi>London,</hi> open his Shop, and drive a trade
as other Citizens do, or give his Vote at a Common-Hall,
and in all other cases Act like a Citizen, this
would not make him a Citizen, but an Intruder. He
is a Foreigner still, and his presuming to Act like a
Citizen, when he is none, is no Act of Communion
with that Body, of which he is no member, but just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exposes him to censure and punishment.</p>
            <p>Thus it is in the Christian Church, which is one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Society united by a Divine Covenant. Our
Communion with the Church consists in being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church, which we are made by Baptism:
The exercise of this Communion consists in all those
Offices and Duties, which all the members of the
Church are obliged to, and which none have any
right to perform, but they; such as praying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Lords Supper together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:62060:8"/>
Now should any Man who is no member of the
Church, nor owns himself to be so, intrude into the
Church, and Communicate in all holy Offices, this
can be no more called an Act of Communion, then
it can be said to make him a member of the Church,
of which he is no member, and resolved not to be:
Prayers, and receiving the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Acts
of Communion, when performed by Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in the Communion of the Church; but they are
no Acts of Communion, when performed by those,
who are no Church-members, tho to serve a turn,
they thrust themselves into the Society of the Church.</p>
            <p>As for Instance, suppose a member of a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
or Independent Conventicle, should, for reasons
best known to himself, at some critical time, come
to his Parish Church, and there hear the Common-Prayer,
and Sermon, and receive the Lords Supper,
according to the order of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
does this make this Man a member of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> with which he never Communicated before,
and it is likely, will never do again? If it does not,
all this is no Act of Communion, which can be only
between the members of the same Body.</p>
            <p>So that to be in Church-Communion, does not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
meerly to perform some such Acts, which are
Acts of Communion in the members of the Church,
but since the decay of Church Discipline, may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be performed by those, who are not members,
which is such an abuse, as would not have been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Primitive Church, who denyed their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
to Schismaticks, as well as to the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
upon other accounts: but to be in Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
signifies to be a member of the Church, to
be Embodyed and Incorporated with it, and I suppose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
what that means, every one knows, who understands
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62060:8"/>
what it is to be a member of any Society, of a City,
or any Inferior Corporation; which consists of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Duty, and requires all those, who will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the benefits of such a Society, to discharge their
respective trusts and obligations.</p>
            <p>To be in Communion with, or to be a member of
the Church, includes a Right and Title to all those
Blessings, which God hath promised to his Church,
and an obligation to all the Duties and Offices of
Church Society; as Subjection to the Authority, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
Censures of the Church; a Communion
in Prayers, and Sacraments, and other Religious Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and he who despises the Authority, or destroys
the Unity of the Church, renounces his membership
and Communion with it. These things are extemely
plain, and though Men may cavil for disputes sake,
yet must needs convince them, that no Man is in
Communion with a Church, which he is not a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of, tho through the defect of Discipline, he should
sometimes be admitted to some Act of Communion
with it, and I shall observe some few things from hence
of great use.</p>
            <p>1. That Church-Communion primarily and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
respects the universal Church, not any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church or Society of Christians. For to be
in Church-Communion signifies to be a member of the
Church, or Body of Christ, which is but one all the
World over. Church-Communion does not consist in
particular Acts of Communion, which can be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only among those, who are present, and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to each other, but in membership: now a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is a member of the whole Body (not meerly of
any part of it,) how large soever the Body be. All
the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> those, who live at St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids,</hi>
and those at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> who never saw, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verst
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62060:9"/>
with each other, are all members of the same
Kingdom, and by the same reason, this membership
may extend to the remotest part of the World, if the
Body, whereof we are members, reach so far.</p>
            <p>And therefore we may observe, that Baptism, which
is the Sacrament of our Admission into the Covenant
of God, and the Communion of the Church, does
not make us members of any particular Church, as
such, but of the Universal Church; and I observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that a Church-state, which is the same thing,
with Church-Communion, is founded only on a Divine
Covenant; and therefore since there is no other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Covenant to make us members of particular
Churches, as distinguisht from the Universal Church,
such particular Church-membership is at best but a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Invention, and indeed nothing else but a Schism
from the Universal Church: which alone, if well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
is a sufficient confutation of Independency which
is a particular Church-State, as distinguisht from all
other Churches and Societies of Christians.</p>
            <p>2. I observe further, that tho the exercise of
Church Communion, as to most of the particular Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Offices of it, must be confined to a particular
Church and Congregation (for we cannot Actually
joyn in the Communion of Prayers and Sacraments,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but with some particular Church) yet every
Act of Christian Communion, though performed in
some particular Church, is and must be an Act of
Communion with the whole Catholick Church, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Hearing, and receiving the Lords Supper
together, does not make us more in Communion with
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then with any other true and
Orthodox part of the Church, tho in the Remotest
parts of the World. The exercise of true Christian
Communion in a particular Church, is nothing else
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62060:9"/>
but the exercise of Catholick Communion in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church, which the necessity of affairs requires,
since all the Christians in the World cannot meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for Acts of worship; But there is nothing in
all these Acts of Communion, which does more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
Unite us to such a particular Church, than to the
whole Christian Church.</p>
            <p>When we Pray together to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we Pray to him
as the Common Father of all Christians, and do not
challenge any peculiar interest in him, as members of
such a particular Church, but as members of the
whole Body of Christ: when we Pray in the Name
of Christ, we consider him as the great High Priest,
and Saviour of the Body, who powerfully interceeds
for the whole Church, and for us as members of the
Universal Church. And we Offer up our Prayers and
Thanksgivings, not only for our selves and those, who
are present, but for all Christians all the World over, as
our Fellow-members; and Praying for one another is the
truest notion of Communion of Prayers; for Praying
with one another, is only in order to Praying for one
another. And thus our Prayers are an exercise of
Christian Communion, when we Pray to the same
common Father, through the Merits and Mediation
of the same common Saviour and Redeemer, for the
same common Blessings, for our selves, and the whole
Christian Church.</p>
            <p>Thus when we meet together to Celebrate the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of our Lord, we do not meet as at a private Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but as at the common Feast of Christians; and
therefore it is not an Act of particular Church Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
but of Catholick Communion. The Supper of
our Lord does not signifie any other kind of Union
and confederation between those Neighbour Christians,
who receive together in the same Church, than with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62060:10"/>
the whole Body of Christ. The Sacramental Bread
signifies and represents all those, for whom Christ
died, that one Mystical Body, for which he Offered
his Natural Body, which is the Universal Church;
and our eating of this Bread signifies our Union to
this Body of Christ, and therefore is considered, as
an Act of true Catholick, not of a particular Church-Communion.
And the Sacramental Cup is the Blood
of the New Testament, and therefore represents our
Communion in all the Blessings of the Covenant, and
with all those, who are thus in Covenant with God.
So that there is nothing particular in this Feast, to
make it a private Feast, or an Act of Communion
with a particular Church, considered as particular,
but it is the common Feast of Christians, and an Act
of Catholick Communion.</p>
            <p>Which by the way plainly shews, how groundless
that scruple is against mixt Communions, that Men
think themselves defiled by receiving the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
with Men, who are vicious. For tho it is a great
defect in Discipline, and a great reproach to the
Christian Profession, when wicked Men are not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
and removed from Christian Communion, yet
they may as well pretend, that their Communion is
defiled by bad Men, who Communicate in any other
part of the Church, or any other Congregation, as
in that, in which they live and Communicate: For
this holy Feast signifies no other Communion between
them, who receive at the same time, and in the same
Company, then it does with all sincere parts of the
Christian Church. It is not a Communion with any
Persons considered as present, but it is a Communion
with the Body of Christ and all true members of it,
whether present or absent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62060:10"/>
Those who separate from a National Church for the
sake of corrupt professors, though they could form a
Society as pure and holy, as they seem to desire, yet
are Schismaticks in it, because they confine their
Communion to their own select Company, and Exclude
the whole Body of Christians all the World over, out
of it; their Communion is no larger than their ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
Church, for if it be, then they must still Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with those Churches, which have corrupt
members, as all visible Churches on Earth have, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we will except Independents, because they have
the confidence to except themselves) and then their
Separation does not Answer its end, which is to avoid
such corrupt Communions; and yet if they do confine
their Communion to their own gathered Churches,
they are Schismaticks in dividing themselves from
the Body of Christians; and all their Prayers and
Sacraments are not Acts of Christian Communion,
but a Schismatical Combination.</p>
            <p>This does not prove indeed, that particular Churches
are not bound to reform themselves, and to preserve
their own Communion pure from corrupt members,
unless all the Churches in the World, will do so too;
because every particular Church, whether Diocesan,
or National, has power to reform its own members,
and is accountable to God for such neglects of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline:
but it does prove, that no Church without
the guilt of Schism, can renounce Communion with
other Christian Churches, or set up a distinct and
separate Communion of its own, for the sake of such
corrupt members; which was the pretence of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatian</hi>
and <hi>Danatist</hi> Schism of Old, and is so of
the Independent Schism, at this day.</p>
            <p>3. I observe further, that our obligation to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Communion with a particular Church, wholly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62060:11"/>
results from our obligation to Catholick Communion.
The only reason, why I am bound to live in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with any particular Church, is because I am a
member of the whole Christian Church, which is the
Body of Christ, and therefore must live in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Christian Church; and yet it is Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to live in Communion with the whole Christian
Church, without Actual Communion with some part
of it; when I am in such a place, where there is a
visible Christian Church; as no member can be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Natural Body, without its being United to
some part of the Body; for the Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the whole Body, consists in the Union of all
its parts to each other.</p>
            <p>Every Act of Christian Communion, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in a particular Church, or Congregation, is
not properly an Act of particular Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
but is the exercise of Communion with the
whole Church and Body of Christ, as I have already
proved; but it can be no Act of Communion at all,
if it be not performed in the Communion of the
Church, which it cannot be, unless it be performed
in the Communion of some particular Church. And
this is the only obligation, I know of, to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with any particular Church, that as I am a
Christian, I am a member of the Body and Church
of Christ, and in a State of Communion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
am bound to maintain Actual Communion with
the Christian Church, where-ever I find it, and by
Communicating with the Church, wherein I live, if
it be a found and Orthodox member of the Christian
Church, I maintain Communion with the whole
Catholick Church, which is but one Body.</p>
            <p>So that here is no choice, what Church we will
Communicate with, for there is but one Church all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62060:11"/>
the World over, with which we must Communicate;
and therefore we have nothing else to do, but to judge,
whether that part of the Church, wherein we live,
be so sound and Orthodox, that we may Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with it according to the Principles of Catholick
Communion; and if it be, we are bound to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with it, under Peril of Schism from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, if we do not.</p>
            <p>4. From hence we may plainly learn the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Separate Communion, and Separate Church.
For some Men seem to be greatly sensible of the sin
and mischief of Schism and Separation, but then they
use great art, so to confound the notion of Separation,
as that neither they themselves, nor any one else, shall
ever be able to understand what it is, whereas if they will
allow, that there is, or ever can be, any such thing
as Separation from the Church, it is as easie to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
what Separation is, as what it is for a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to be divided from the Body.</p>
            <p>For if there be but one Church, and one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
of which all true Christians, and Christian
Churches, are, or ought to be members, then those
Churches, which are not members of each other,
are Separate Churches. It is not enough indeed to
prove a Separation, that two Congregations meet in
several places for Worship, for this is done by all the
Parish-Churches of <hi>England,</hi> who are in the same
Communion, but yet hold distinct and Separate As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
as to Local separation. Nor is it sufficient
to prove, that there is no Separation, because these
differing Churches agree in all the Articles of Faith,
and essentials of worship; For thus the <hi>Novatians</hi>
and <hi>Donatists</hi> did, who yet were Schismaticks from
the Catholick Church. But where there are two
Churches, which are not members of each other,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62060:12"/>
there is a Schism, tho they agree in every thing else, but
in one Communion; and where Churches own each
others Communion, as members of the same Body,
there is no Schism, though they are as distant from each
other in place, as East and West.</p>
            <p>And it is as easie to understand, what it is for two
Churches to be members of each other; but to make
this as plain, as I can, and as far, as it is possible, to
prevent all Evasions, and Subterfuges, I shall lay
down some few rules according to the Principles of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Communion, whereby we may certainly know,
what Churches are in Communion with each other,
and which are Separate and Schismatical Conventicles.</p>
            <p>1. There must be but one Church, in one place,
according to that Ancient Rule of the Catholick
Church, that there must be but one Bishop in a City;
and this was observed in the Apostolical times, that
in the greatest and most Populous Cities, and where
there were the greatest number of Converts, yet there
was but one Church, such as <hi>Jerusalem, Antioch,
Ephesus,</hi> &amp;c. this is acknowledged by the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
themselves, who endeavour hence to prove,
that there were no more Christians in any of those
Cities, than could meet together in one place for Acts
of Worship, which is a mighty groundless Surmise,
and not much for the credit of the Christian Church,
as has been often shewn by learned Men, both Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
and Presbyterian Divines.</p>
            <p>And there is an evident reason, why this should be
so, because there is no other Rule of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
for private Christians, but to Communicate
in all Religious Offices, and all Acts of Government
and Discipline, with those Christians, with whom
they live; for to renounce the ordinary Communion
of any Christians, or true Christian Church, is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62060:12"/>
the Unity and Communion of the Church, and to
withdraw our selves from ordinary Communion with the
Church, in which we live, into distinct and Separate
Societies for Worship, is to renounce their Communion;
and when there is not a necessary cause for it, is a Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Separation.</p>
            <p>So that distinct and particular Churches, which are in
Communion with each other, must have their distinct
bounds and limits, as every member has its Natural
and Proper place and situation in the Body. But
when there is one Church within the Bowels of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a new Church gathered out of a Church already
constituted; and formed into a distinct and Separate
Society, this divides Christian Communion, and is a
notorious Schism. These Churches cannot be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of each other, because they ought to be but one
Church, and therefore to form and gather a new
Church, is to divide and Separate the members of the
same Church from each other.</p>
            <p>This is the plain case of the Presbyterian and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Churches, and those other Conventicles of
Sectaries, which are among us; they are Churches
in a Church, Churches formed out of the National
Church, by which means Ohristians, who live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
refuse to Worship God in the same Assemblies,
and have bitter Envyings and Contentions, for the
Honour and Purity of their several Churches.</p>
            <p>If all Christians are members of the one Body of Christ,
nothing can justifie the distinction of Christians into
several Churches, but only such a distance of place,
as makes it necessary and expedient to put them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Conduct and Government of several Bishops,
for the greater Edification of the Church, in the more
easie and regular Administration of Discipline, and
all holy Offices; and therefore nothing can justifie
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62060:13"/>
the gathering of a Church out of a Christian Church,
and dividing Neighbour Christians into distinct Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions.</p>
            <p>Churches at a distance may be distinct Churches
under their distinct Bishops, but yet in the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
but distinct Churches in the same place can
never be of the same Communion, for then they would
Naturally Unite and Cement into one. There must
either be Antibishops, or Schismatical Presbyters, set
up in opposition to their Bishops, under different and
opposite Rules of Worship and Discipline, which makes
them Rival and opposite Churches, not members of
each other. From hence I think, it plainly appears,
that all Separation from a Church, wherein we live,
unless there be necessary reasons for it, is Schism;
and we cannot justifie such distinct Churches within
one another, from the examples of other distinct
Churches, whose bounds, and limits, and jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
also, are distinct and separate.</p>
            <p>2. It is plain, those are Separate Churches, which
divide from the Communion of any Church, from any
dislike of its Doctrine, Government, or Worship, for
in this case, it is plain, they leave the Church, and
form themselves into a new Church, out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church, from whence they went, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they did not think it safe to continue one Body
with it.</p>
            <p>This has often made me wonder, what those Men
mean, who take all occasions to quarrel at our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
and assign a great many reasons, why they
cannot Communicate with us, and yet at the same
time will not own, that they have made any Separation
from us. What middle state now shall we find for these
Men, who will neither continue in the Church, nor
allow themselves to be out of it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62060:13"/>
It is possible for two particular Churches to be in
Communion with each other, and yet not Actually
to Communicate together, because distance of place
will not permit it; but for two Churches to renounce
each others Communion, or at least to withdraw or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Communion from each other, from a professed
dislike, and yet still to continue in a state of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with one another, is a down right contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
To be in Communion is to be members of the
same Body and Society, and he that can prove, and
he that can believe, two opposite Societies, founded
upon contrary principles, and Acting by contrary
Rules, and pursuing contrary ends, to the Ruin and
Subversion of each other, to be the same Body, and
the same Society, are very wonderful Men to me.</p>
            <p>3. Those are Separate Churches, who do not own
each others members, as their own. Actual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
during our residence in any certain place,
must be confined to that particular Church, in which
we live, if it be a sound part of the Christian Church;
but Church-membership is not confined to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church. I am no otherwise a member of any
particular Church, then I am of the Universal Church,
which gives me a right of Membership and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in all the particular Churches of the World. Now
I would ask whether every Baptized Christian, who
by Baptism is made a member of the Catholick
Church, and has not forfeited this right by a Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
life, be <hi>ipso facto</hi> a member of an Independent
Church; if he be not, (as it is plain, by the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Independency, he is not, for Independent
Church-membership is not founded on Baptism, but
on a particular Church-Covenant;) then Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is a Separate Communion from the Catholick
Church; for the members of the Catholick Church
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62060:14"/>
are not by being so, made the members of an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Church, and therefore an Independent Church
is a distinct and separate Body from the Catholick-Church.</p>
            <p>Nay I would know whether a member of one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Church by being so, becomes a member of
another Independent Church; if he does not, as it is
plain, he do'nt, (for every Independent Church is
founded upon a particular Church-Covenant between
such a particular Pastor and particular members) then
every Independent Church is a distinct and separate
Body from all other Independent Churches, and so
they are all Schismaticks to each other, as not preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Unity of the Body.</p>
            <p>And tho Independent Churches should be so civil
to each other, as to admit each others members to
some Acts of Communion, yet this is matter of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
not of right, and therefore their constitution is
Schismatical. It is like two Neighbour Families,
which hold good correspondence with each other, and
often visit one another, and Eat, and Drink together,
but yet remain very distinct Families, and have all
their concerns apart and separate. But the Christian
Church is but one Houshold and Family, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
makes two Families of it, is a Schismatick.</p>
            <p>Thus let me ask, whether the Episcopal, and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Churches in the same Christian Kingdom,
be one Church, and members of each other, and own
each others members, as such, to be members of their
own Body and Church; If they do not, as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
they don't, from their holding distinct and separate
Assemblies, under a distinct kind and species of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which both of them assert to be instituted by
Christ, and to be essential to the constitution of the
Church, from their forming themselves into distinct Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62060:14"/>
under different Governors, which have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
as such, with each other, (which yet is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to the Communion of particular Churches, that
their Governors should be in Communion with each
other) from their Condemning each others consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and particular modes of Worship, and their
great endeavours to draw away members from each
other; which necessarily supposes, that they do not
look upon each others members, as their own. I
say, if from these considerations it appears, that they
are not, and do not think themselves to be, one Body,
nor members of each other, then they are two sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Churches, and the Church, which makes the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
is the Schismatick.</p>
            <p>And indeed we may as well say, that a Monarchy,
and Aristocracy, and Democracy in the same Nation,
with their distinct Governours, and distinct Subjects,
and distinct Laws, that are always at Enmity and
War with each other, are but one Kingdom, as to
assert, that the Episcopal and Presbyterian Churches
in England, are but one Church.</p>
            <p>3. The last thing to be explained, is, what is meant
by fixt or constant, and by occasional Communion.
Now this is a question, which would grievously have
puzl'd St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and St. <hi>Austin</hi> and other Ancient
Fathers, who never heard but of one sort of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
For indeed there is no place for this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of constant and occasional Communion, according
to the Principles of Catholick Communion. To be in
Communion with the Church, is to be a member of
the Church, and I take it for granted, that a member
signifies a fixt and constant, not an occasional mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
not a member, which is one day a member, and
the next day upon his own voluntary choice is no
member, which is a member or no member, just as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62060:15"/>
occasion serves. And if Church-membership be a fixt
and constant relation in it self considered, then the
Duties of this relation are fixt and constant also. And
therefore for the understanding of these Terms, which
were unknown to Antiquity, we must consult the
meaning of our Modern Authors, who were the first
Inventors of them.</p>
            <p>Now by fixt Communion they mean an Actual and
constant Communicating with some one particular
Church, as fixt members of it; occasional Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is to Pray, and Hear, and receive the Sacrament,
at some other Church, (of which they do not own
themselves to be members) as occasion serves; that is,
either to gratifie their own Curiosity, or to serve some
secular end, or to avoid the Imputation of Schism.</p>
            <p>Now this distinction is owing to such Principles,
as I have evidently proved to be very great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes.</p>
            <p>For if to be in Communion with the Church signifie
to be a member of it, and that not of any particular
Church, as distinguisht from the whole Catholick
Church, but to be a member of the one Body of Christ,
and of every sound part of it; then our Communion
with the Church is as fixt, as our relation and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership
is, and I think no Man, who understands him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
will talk of an occasional member.</p>
            <p>If no Man can perform any Act of Communion with
a Church, of which he is no member (since all Acts
of Communion have a necessary relation to a state
of Communion, and that, which is an Act of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in a member, is no Act of Communion,
when performed by him, who is no member, as I
have already proved) then it is as plain a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to talk of an occasional Act of Communion, as
of occasional Membership; and there can be no place
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62060:15"/>
for occasional Communion with a Church, of which
we are no members, unless we will say, that a Man,
who is not in Communion, may exercise Acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Church.</p>
            <p>If all the Acts of Christian Communion, which
respect Christian Worship, such as Prayer, receiving
the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho performed in a particular
Church, be not Acts meerly of a particular Church-Communion,
but of Catholick Communion, with the
whole Christian Church, and every sound part of it,
then every true Catholick Christian, is not only in a
fixt state of Communion with the Catholick Church,
but lives in as constant an exercise of Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with all Sound and Orthodox Churches, as he
does with that Church, in which he lives; for every
Act of Worship, which is an Act of Communion with
that particular Church, in which it is performed (if
that Church be in Catholick Communion) is an Act
of Communion with the whole Catholick Church,
and therefore the very exercise of Christian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
is equally fixt and constant, or equally occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
with the whole Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>There is a sense indeed, wherein we may be said
to be members of one particular Church considered
as distinct from all other particular Churches, but
that principally consists in Government and Discipline:
every Christian is a member of the whole Christian
Church, and in Communion with it, but he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the immediate Instruction and Government of his
own Bishop, and Presbyters, and is bound to Person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Communion with them; and this constitutes a
particular Church, in which all Acts of Worship, and
all Acts of Discipline and Government are under the
direction and conduct of a particular Bishop. And
when Neighbour Bishops unite into one Body, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62060:16"/>
agree upon some common Rules of Government, and
the Administration of Religious Offices, this makes
them a Patriarchal or National Church, and thus by
submitting to the Government and Discipline of such
particular or united Bishops, we become members of
a Diocesan or National Church, considered as distinct
from other Diocesan or National Churches; But this does
not confine our Church-membership and Communion
to such a particular Church, tho it strictly oblige us to
conform to the Worship, and Discipline, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that Church, wherein we live, while it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
nothing on us inconsistent with the Principles
of Catholick Communion.</p>
            <p>But tho particular Christians are more peculiarly
obliged to observe the Rites and Usages, and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Government and Discipline of the Church,
wherein they live, and to maintain Personal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with it, (and upon this account may in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
manner be called the members of that Church)
yet every Act of Communion performed in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church is an Act of Catholick Communion;
and an exercise of Christian Communion with the
whole Church, and every sound part of it. Baptism
makes us members of the whole Church, and gives
us a right to Communion with every sound part of it;
every Act of Christian Communion in a particular
Church is a vertual Communion with the whole
Church, with all particular Churches, which live in
Communion with each other; and notwithstanding my
relation to a particular Church, by my constant Abode
and Habitation in it, when ever I travel into any other
Church, I Communicate with them as a member;
so that wherever I Communicate, whether in that
Church, in which I usually live, or in any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church, where I am accidentally present, my
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62060:16"/>
Communion is of the same Nature, that is, I Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
as a member of the Church, and it is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
I should Communicate otherwise; for I have
no right to Communion, but as a member, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
I can do, can be an Act of Communion, if I
be not, and do not own my self to be a member.</p>
            <p>And yet this is the occasion of this mistake about
Fixt and Occasional Communion; that according to
the Laws of our Church, which are founded on great
and wise reasons, and indeed according to the Laws
of Catholick Communion, every Christian is bound
to Communicate with that part of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he lives; now Men may have Houses in different
Parishes, or distinct Diocesses, or may Travel into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the Country, and Communicate with
the Churches, which they find in those places, where
they are, or they may sometimes go to Prayers, or
hear a Sermon, or receive the Lords Supper at
another Parish-Church; now our ordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with those Churches, where our constant
Abode is, may be called constant Communion, and
our Communion with those Churches, which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
visit, and Communicate with, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
occasional Communion; and all this without
Schism, because we still Communicate, either with
the same National Church, or (which is often the
case of Travellers) with some other sound part of the
Catholick Church, of which we are also members,
and so still keep in the same Communion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with no Churches, but those, of which we
own our selves members; as being all in the same
Communion; as being either sincere members of the
National or Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>From hence our Dissenters conclude, that their
Communion with an Independent, or Presbyterian,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62060:17"/>
Church, of which they profess themselves fixt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
is as consistent with their occasional Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when to serve some
present turn, they hear the Prayers, and receive the
Sacraments with us; as our fixt Communion with
our Parish-Churches is, with our occasional Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
with other Parish-Churches; which no Body
accounts Schism, tho when it is too frequent and
causeless, it is a great disorder.</p>
            <p>But the difference between these two is vastly great,
for in the First case, we only Communicate with such
Churches, which are all in Communion with each
other, and therefore he, who is a member of one,
is a member of them all, and Communicates with
them, wherever he is, as a member. But he, who
is a fixt member of a Presbyterian, or Independent
Church, cannot Communicate so much as occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as a member, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is a member not only of another particular,
but of a separate Church; and it is impossible for any
Man, who is one with himself, to be a member of
two separate Churches, and whatever Acts of Worship
we joyn in with other Churches, of which we
are no members, they are not properly Acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p>Having thus premised the explication of these terms,
what is meant by <hi>Church,</hi> and what is meant by
<hi>Church-Communion,</hi> and what is meant by <hi>Fixt or
Constant,</hi> and <hi>occasional Communion,</hi> the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of these things, will make it very easie to
resolve those cases, which Immediately respect
Church-Communion, and I shall Instance in these three.</p>
            <p>1. Whether Communion with some Church or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
especially when the Church is divided into so
many Sects and Parties, be a necessary Duty, incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on all Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:62060:17"/>
2. Whether constant Communion with that Church,
with which occasional Communion is Lawful, be a
necessary Duty.</p>
            <p>3. Whether it be Lawful for the same person, to
Communicate with two separate Churches.</p>
            <p>Case 1. Whether Communion with some Church
or other,<note place="margin">Case 1.</note> especially when the Church is divided into
so many Sects and Parties, be a necessary Duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on all Christians.</p>
            <p>Now methinks the resolution of this is as plain, as
whether it be necessary for every Man to be a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
For every Christian is Baptized into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church, and must continue a Member
of the Church, till he renounce his Membership by
Schism, or Infidelity, or be cast out of the Church by
Ecclesiastical censures.</p>
            <p>Baptism incorporates us into the Christian Church,
that is, makes us Members of the Body of Christ,
which is his Church and is frequently so called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For there is but <hi>one Body and one Spirit. Eph.</hi>
4. 4. one Christian Church,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 23. 4. 12.</note> which is animated and
governed by the one Spirit of Christ. And we are all
Baptized into this one Body.<note place="margin">Col. 1. 18.</note> 
               <hi>For as the Body is one, and
hath many Members,</hi> and all the members <hi>of that one
Body, being many, are one Body, so also is Christ,</hi> that is,
the Christian Church, which is the Body of Christ, of
which he is the Head;<note place="margin">1 Cor 12. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>for by one Spirit we are all Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
into one Body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we be Bond or Free, and are all made to drink into
one Spirit; for the body is not one member, but many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I have already proved, that Church Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is nothing else, but Church-Membership, to be
in Communion with the Church, and to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church, signifying the same thing. And I
think, I need not prove, that to be in a state of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62060:18"/>
contains both a right; and an Obligation
to Actual Communion. He, who is a member of
the Church, may Challenge all the Priviledges of a
member, among which Actual Communion is none
of the least; to be admitted to all the Acts and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of Christian-Communion, to the Communion
of Prayers and Sacraments, and all other Christian
Duties, which no Man who is not a member of the
Church, has any right to. And he who is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
is bound to perform all those Duties and Offices,
which are Essential to Church-Communion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is bound to Communicate with the Church in
Religious Assemblies, to joyn in Prayers and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to attend publick Instructions, and to live like
a member of the Church.</p>
            <p>But to put this past all boudt, <hi>that external and
actual Communion is an essential Duty of a Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
I shall offer these plain proofs of it.</p>
            <p>1. That Baptism makes us Members of the visible
Church of Christ, but there can be no visible Church
without visible Communion, and therefore every vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Member, by vertue of his Membership, is bound
to external and visible Communion, when it may be
had.</p>
            <p>2. This is essential to the notion of a Church, as it
is a Body and Society of Christians. For all Bodies
and Societies of Men are Instituted for the sake of some
common Duties and Offices to be performed by the
Members of it. A Body of Men is a Community, and
it is a strange kind of Community, in which every
Member may act by it self, without any Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with other Members of the same Body. And yet
such a kind of Body as this, the Christian Church is,
if it be not an essential Duty of every Member, to
live in the exercise of visible Communion with the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62060:18"/>
Church, when he can. For there is the same Law for
all Members, and either all or none, are bound to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Communion.</p>
            <p>But this is more absurd still, when we consider, that
the Church is such a Body, as consists of variety of
Members, of different Offices and Officers, which
are of no use without actual and visible Communion
of all its Members.</p>
            <p>To what purpose did Christ appoint such variety of
Ministers in his Church,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>Apostles, Prophets, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
Pastors, and Teachers, for the perfecting of the
Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of
the Body of Christ;</hi> to what purpose has he instituted a
standing Ministry in his Church, to offer up the Prayers
of the Faithful to God, to instruct, exhort, reprove,
and administer the Christian Sacraments, if private
Christians are not bound to maintain Communion
with them, in all Religious Offices?</p>
            <p>3. Nay the Nature of Christian Worship obliges us
to Church-Communion. I suppose, no Man will deny,
but that every Christian is bound to Worship God
according to our Saviours Institution: and what that
is, we cannot learn better, than from the Example
of the Primitive Christians, of whom St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives
us this account,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 41.</note> that <hi>they continued Stedfast in the
Apostles Doctrine, and Worship, and in breaking of
Bread, and in Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which makes any thing in a Strict sense, an
Act of Church-Communion is, that it is performed in
the Fellowship of the Apostles, or in Communion with
the Bishops and Ministers of the Church; They are
appointed to Offer up the Prayers of Christians to God
in his Name; and therefore tho the private devotions
of Christians are acceptable to God, as the Prayers of
Church-Members, yet none but publick Prayers,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62060:19"/>
which are Offered up by Men who have their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from Christ, to Offer these Spiritual Sacrifices to
God, are properly the Prayers of the Church, and Acts
of Church-Communion. If then we must Offer up
our Prayers to God according to Christ's Institution,
that is, by the hands of persons Authorized and set
apart for that purpose; we must of necessity joyn in
the Actual and Visible Communion of the Church.</p>
            <p>The Sacrament of the Lords Supper is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
part of Christian Worship, and we cannot Celebrate
this Feast; but in Church-Communion; for this is a
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a common Supper, or Communion-Feast,
which in all Ages of the Church, has been admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
by Consecrated Persons, and in Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
for it loses its Nature and Signification,
when it is turned into a private Mass, so that if every
Christian is bound to the Actual performance of true
Christian Worship, he is bound to an Actual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Christian Church.</p>
            <p>4. We may observe further; that Church Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is exercised only about Church-Communion,
which necessarily supposes, that all Christians, who
are Church-Members and in a State of Communion,
are bound to all the Acts of external and visible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Church. The exercise of Church Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
consists in Receiving in, or Shutting out of
the Church. To receive into the Church, is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them to all external Acts of Communion, to Shut,
or Cast, out of the Church, is to deny them the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and visible Communion of the Church; not to allow
them to Pray, or receive the Lords Supper, or perform
any Religious Offices in the publick Assemblies of the
Church. Now all this Church Authority would signifie
nothing, were not External and Actual Communion,
both the Priviledge and Duty of every Christian; and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62060:19"/>
yet this is all the Authority Christ hath given to His
Church.</p>
            <p>5. And to confirm all this, nothing is more plain
in Scripture, than that Separation from a Church, is
to withdraw from the visible Communion of it, and
there can be no Notion of Separation without this; now
if Separation from Religious Assemblies be to break
Communion, then to live in Communion with the
Church requires our Actual Communicating with the
Church in all Religious Duties.</p>
            <p>And that this is the true Notion of Separation is easily
proved from the most express testimonies; 2 Cor. 6.
17. <hi>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye
separate, saith the Lord, and touch no unclean thing, and
I will receive you:</hi> Where, <hi>come out from among them, and
be ye separate,</hi> plainly signifies, to forsake the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of Idolaters, not to Communicate with them in
their Idolatrous Worship; So that not to joyn with
any Men or Church in their Idolatrous Worship, is to
Separate from their Communion, which is a very
Godly Separation, when the Worship is Idolatrous
and Sinful, but a Schismatical Separation, when it is
not. Thus St. <hi>John</hi> tells us of the Ancient Hereticks,
<hi>They went out from us because they were not of us, for if
they had been of us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 2. 19</note> 
               <hi>they would, no doubt, have continued
with us, but they went out, that they might be made
manifest, that they were not all of us.</hi> Where their
going out from them, plainly signifies, their forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christian Assemblies, upon which account the
Author of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> admonishes
the Christians, <hi>not to forsake the Assembling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
together,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 25.</note> 
               <hi>as the manner of some is,</hi> in which he
refers to the Separation of those Ancient Hereticks.</p>
            <p>And thus accordingly to have Fellowship or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with any, is to partake with them in their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62060:20"/>
Religious Mysteries. By this Argument St. <hi>Paul</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from Eating of the Idols Feast;
because they were Sacrifices to Evil Spirits, and by
partaking of those Sacrifices they had Communion
with them.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>But I say, that the things, which the
Gentiles Sacrifice, they Sacrifice to Devils, and not to
God, and I would not that you should have Fellowship
with Devils. Ye cannot Drink the Cup of the Lord,
and the Cup of Devils, ye cannot be partakers of the
Lords Table, and of the Table of Devils.</hi> So that,
tho we must first be in a state of Communion with
Christ, and his Church, must first be received into
Covenant, and by Baptism be incorporated into the
Christian Church, before we have any right to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with this Church; yet no Man can preserve
his Church-state without Actual Communion, no
Man has Communion with Christ, or his Church,
but he, who Actually Communicates in all Religious
Offices, and Christian Institutions; a state of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
confers a right to Communicate, but Actual
Communion consists in the exercise of Communion,
and a right to Communicate without Actual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is worth nothing, as no right or priviledge is
without the Exercise of it; for enjoyment consists in
Acts, and all the Blessings of the Gospel, all the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of Christian Communion, are conveyed to us
by Actual Communion. So that if we would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in the Blessings of Christ, if we would Reap the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of Church-Communion, we must live in Actual
Communion, and not content our selves with a dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant
and useless right, which we never bring into Act.</p>
            <p>This is sufficient to prove, the necessity of Actual
Communion with the Christian Church, when it
may be had, for where it cannot be had, Non-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
is no Sin, for we are not obliged to Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62060:20"/>
he who lives in a Country, or travels through
any Country, where there is no true Christian Church
to Communicate with, cannot enjoy Actual
Communion; the right and Duty of Communion
continues, tho necessity may suspend the Act. But
the greater difficulty is, whether it be not Lawful,
to suspend our Communion with any particular
Churches, when we see the Church divided into a
great many Parties and Factions, which refuse
Communion with each other, which is the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
state of the Church at this day among us,
Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptists, Quakers,
all Separate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and from
each other, and from hence some conclude it Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to suspend Communion with all these divided Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which is just such a reason for a Total suspension of
Church-Communion, as the different and contrary
opinions in Religion are for Scepticism and infidelity.
Because there are a great many kinds of Religions in
the World, and a great many divided Sects of the
Christian Religion, therefore some Men will be of
no Religion; and because the Christian Church is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into a great many opposite and Separate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions,
therefore others will be of no Church; and the
reason is as strong in one case, as it is in the other, that
is, indeed it holds in neither: For it is possible to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
which is the true Religion, notwithstanding
all these different and contrary perswasions about it,
and it is equally possible to find out, which of these
divided Communions is a true and sound Member of
the Catholick Church, and when we know that, we
are bound to maintain Communion with it.</p>
            <p>Indeed if such Divisions and Separations, excuse us
from Actual Communion with the Church, Actual
Communion never was, and is never likely to be a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62060:21"/>
Duty long together; For there never was any state of
the Church so happy long together, as to be without
divisions: even in the Apostles times, there were those,
who Separated from the Communion of the Apostles,
and set up private Conventicles of their own, and so
it has been in all succeeding Ages of the Church, and
so it is likely to continue, and if we are not bound
to Communicate with the Church, while there are
any Hereticks, or Schismaticks, who divide from
the Church, farewell to all Church Communion in
this World.</p>
            <p>Should any Man indeed Travel into a Strange
Country, and there find a Schism in the Christian
Church, it were very fitting for him to Suspend Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with either Party, till he had opportunity
to acquaint himself with the state of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
so as to judge, which party is the Schismatick;
and then he is bound (if he understand their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage)
to Communicate with the sound and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
part of the Catholick Church, which he finds in
that place. But this does not reach the case of those,
who are constant Inhabitants of the place, where the
Schism is; for they must not live in a Sceptical sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension
of Communion all their days.</p>
            <p>And there is one plain Rule to direct all Men in this
Inquiry; That wherever there is a Church Establisht
by publick Authority, if there be nothing Sinful in
its Constitution and Worship, we are bound to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with that Church, and to reject the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of all other Parties and Sects of Christians.
For the advantage always lies on the side of Authority,
no publick establishment can justifie a Sinful Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
but if there be nothing Sinful in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the National Church, which is Establisht by
publick Authority, to Separate from such a Church is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62060:21"/>
both disobedience to the Supreme Authority in the
State, and a Schism from the Church.</p>
            <p>But it will be convenient to consider, what these
Men mean by suspending Communion. For is it
Lawful for an <hi>English</hi> Man during these Church divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
among us, never to Worship God in any Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and Religious Assemblies? Never to Pray, nor
Hear, nor receive the Lords Supper together? If this
were so, it were the most Effectual way in the World
to thrust out all Religion.</p>
            <p>But this they will not, they dare not say, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by Suspending Communion they mean, that in
case of such divisions they may refuse to enter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
fixt and setled Members of any Church, but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
occasionally with them all.</p>
            <p>But I have already observed how absurd this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of fixt and occasional Communion is. For
no Act of Religion is an Act of Communion (not so
much as of occasional Communion) which is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in the Communion of the Church; and no
Man is in Communion with the Church, who is not a
Member of it, and whoever is a Member of the
Church is a fixt and not an occasional Member; and
whatever Church he Communicates with, tho it may
be, it is but once in a Year, or once in his Life, as he
occasionally Travels that way, yet he Communicates
as a fixt Member of the Catholick Church, and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
sound part of the Catholick Church; for a fixt
Member does not signifie our fixt abode, or constant
Acts of Communion in any particular Church, but
our state of Communion, and fixt and permanent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the whole Christian Church, and every part
of it, and therefore tho a particular Act of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
may be performed upon some particular occasion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62060:22"/>
with such a particular Church, yet it is not an Act of
occasional, but of fixt Communion, because tho I
Communicate but once and that occasionally, yet I
Communicate as a Member of the Church, which is
not an occasional but a fixt Relation.</p>
            <p>So that when Men Communicate occasionally, as
they speak, with all the different Parties of Christians
in a divided Church, they either Communicate with
none, or Communicate with all of them. If they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
these Acts of Communion, without owning
their relation to them, as Members, then they are
in Communion with none of them, notwithstanding
all these pretended Acts of occasional Commmunion,
and so they live in Communion with no Church,
which yet I hope, I have made it appear to be the Duty
of every Christin to do; if they Communicate with all
these divided Parties, as Members, then they are in
Communion with many Separate Churches, are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Separate and Opposite Bodies, that is, they are
contrary to themselves, and on one side or other, are
certain to be Schismaticks, but this will appear fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from considering the two following Cases.</p>
            <p>Case 2.<note place="margin">Case 2.</note> The Second Case is this; <hi>Whether constant
Communion be a Duty, where occasional Communion is
Lawful.</hi> I have already made it appear, that the
very notion of constant and occasional Communion
is absurd, and a contradiction to all the principles of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Communion, and therefore there is no place for
this distinction, nor for this question, every Christian,
as a Christian, is a fixt Member of the whole Christian
Church, and of every sound part of it, and for Men
to talk of being Members of any one particular Church,
in distinction from all other particular Churches, of
which they will not own themselves Members, is a
Schismatical notion of Church-Membership, because
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62060:22"/>
it divides the Christian Church into distinct Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
and therefore into distinct Bodies, which makes
the one Church and one Body of Christ, not one, but
many Bodies: for if every particular Church has such a
number of Members, which are Members only of that
particular Church, wherein they are fixt, and are not
Members of any other particular Church, then every
particular Church is a distinct and entire Body by it self,
which has particular Members of its own, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to no other Body; just as every particular Man
has his own Body, which consists of such a number
of Members, united to each other, and distinct from
all other Bodies.</p>
            <p>The plain state of the Case in short is this: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true Christian is in Communion with the whole
Christian Church, that is, is a Member of the whole
Church; but he must perform the Acts of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in some particular Church, and the only allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
difference between constant and occasional Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
is this; that we must perform the constant Acts
of Communion in that part of the Catholick Church,
in which we constantly live, and Communicate oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally
with that part of the Church, in which we
are occasionally present; and therefore there never
can be any Competition between constant and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional
Communion in the same place. I cannot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
constantly with that Church in which I
Communicate occasionally, unless I remove my Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
and turn an occasional presence into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and setled abode; nor can I without sin Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
only occasionally with that Church, with
which I may and ought to Communicate constantly,
as being constantly present there, for this is only to do
that sometimes, which I ought to do always. This
is like a Mans living occasionally in his own House,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62060:23"/>
which signifies, that for the most part he is a stranger
at home.</p>
            <p>There cannot be two distinct Churches in the same
place, one for occasional, and another for constant
Communion, without Schism, For it is evident, these
are two distinct Communions, and that our relation
to them is as different, as it is to a House we live in,
and to an Inn, where we lodge for a Night.</p>
            <p>So that there is no foundation for this Inquiry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Men, who understand the true Principles of
Catholick-Communion; It never can be a Case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
whether I should Communicate constantly
or occasionally with such a Church, unless it be a
Case of Conscience, whether I should live constantly
or occasionally within the bounds and jurisdiction of
such a Church; for where my constant abode is, there
my constant Communion must be, if there be a true
and sincere part of the Catholick-Church in that place,
and where I am only occasionally, there I can only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
occasionally also.</p>
            <p>But to meet with the distempers of this Age, and
to remove those Apologies some Men make for their
Schism, it is necessary to make this a question. For
in this divided state of the Church, there are a great
many among us, who think, they cannot maintain
constant Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as
constant and fixt Members, who yet upon some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
think, they may Communicate with us in all parts
of Worship, and Actually do so.</p>
            <p>Now when these Men, who are fixt Members, as
they call it, of Separate Churches, think fit sometimes to
Communicate in all parts of Worship with the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> we charitably suppose, that Men, who
pretend to so much tenderness of Conscience, and care
of their Souls, will do nothing, not so much as once,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62060:23"/>
which they believe, or suspect, to be sinful, at the
time, when they do it; and therefore we conclude,
that those, who Communicate occasionally with the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> do thereby declare, that they
believe, there is nothing sinful in our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and we thank them for this good opinion
they express of our Church, and earnestly desire to
know, how they can justifie their ordinary Separation
from such a Church, as requires no sinful terms of
Communion.</p>
            <p>If any thing less than sinful terms of Communion
can justifie a Separation, then there can be no end of
Separations, and Catholick-Communion is an Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Impracticable notion, that is, the Church of
Christ neither is one Body, nor ever can be. For if
Men are not bound to Communicate with a Church,
which observes our Saviours Institutions, without any
such corrupt mixtures, as make its Communion sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
then there is no bounds to be set to the Fancies of
Men, but they may new model Churches, and divide
and subdivide without any end.</p>
            <p>Is that a sound and Orthodox part of the Catholick-Church,
which has nothing sinful in its Communion?
If it be not, Pray what is it, that makes any Church
Sound and Orthodox? If it be, upon what account is
it Lawful, to separate from a Sound and Orthodox
Church? and may we not by the same reason separate
from the whole Catholick Church, as from any Sound
part of it? Nay does not that Man Separate from the
whole Catholick Church, who Separates from any
Sound part of it? For the Communion of the Church
is but one, and he, that divides and Breaks this union,
Separates himself from the whole Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:62060:24"/>
Excepting the Independency of Churches (which I
have proved above to be Schism in the very notion of
it) the great Pleas for Separation from a Church,
which has nothing sinful in its Communion, are the
pretence of greater Edification, and purer Ordinances.
But these are such Pleas, as must expose the Church
to Eternal Schisms, because there are no certain Rules
to judge of these matters, but the various and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
fancies of Men. What they like best, that shall
be most for their Edification, and these shall be purer
Ordinances, and till Men can agree these matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves, which they are never likely to do,
till they can all agree in the same Diet; or in their
judgment and opinion about beauty, decency, fitness,
convenience, they may and will divide without end;
and if the Peace and Unity of the Church be so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
a duty, it is certain, these Principles, which are
so destructive to Peace and Unity, must be false, as to
consider these things particularly, but very briefly.</p>
            <p>What purer Administrations and Ordinances would
Men have, than those of our Saviours own Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without any Corrupt and sinful mixtures, to
spoil their vertue and efficacy? (as we suppose is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by those, who occasionally Communicate
in all parts of our Worship, that there is nothing sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in it) the purity of divine Adminstrations must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in their agreement with the Institution, that there
is neither any such defect or addition, as alters their
Nature and destroys their Vertue. For the Efficacy
of Gospel Ordinances depends upon their Institution,
not upon particular modes of Administration, which
are not expresly Commanded in the Gospel; and he,
who desires greater purity of Ordinances than their
conformity to their Institution, who thinks, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
and the Lords Supper lose their Efficacy, unless
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62060:24"/>
they be administred in that way, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
best like, are guilty of gross Superstition, and
attribute the vertue of Sacraments to the manner of
their administration, not to their divine Institution.</p>
            <p>And what Men talk of greater Edification is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
as little understood as the other; for Edification
is building up, and is applied to the Church, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as Gods House and Temple, and it is an odd
way of building up the Temple of God, by dividing
and Separating the parts of it from each other.</p>
            <p>This one thing well considered, <hi>viz.</hi> That <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
Edification or Building, according to the Scripture
notion of it, does always primarily refer to, or at
least include, Church-unity and Communion, is
sufficient to convince any Man, what an ill way it is,
to seek for greater Edification in breaking the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church by Schism and Separation; and
therefore I shall make it plainly appear, that this is
the true Scripture notion of Edification; and to that
end shall consider the most material places, where this
word is used.</p>
            <p>Now the most proper signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which
our Translators render by <hi>Edification,</hi> is a House or

All these Spiritual gifts, which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on the Christians, were for the Building and

               <hi>which is the head, Even Christ from whom the
whole Body fitly joyned together, and compacted by that,
which every joynt supplieth, according to the Effectual
working in the measure of every part, maketh increase
of the Body, unto the Edifying it self in love.</hi> This
is an admirable description of the Unity of the Church,
in which all the parts are closely united and compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, as Stones and Timber are to make one
House; and thus they grow into one Body, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in mutual Love, and Charity, which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Building and Edification of the Church,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 1.</note> which is
Edifyed and Built up in love, as the Apostle adds,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62060:25"/>
               <hi>that knowledge puffeth up, but Charity Edifieth,</hi> this
Builds up the Church of Christ; and that not such a
common Charity as we have for all Mankind; but such
a love and Sympathy, as is peculiar to the Members
of the same Body, and which none but Members can
have for each other, and now methinks I need not
prove, that Schism and Separation is the not for Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Church; to Separate for Edification is
to pull down instead of Building up.</p>
            <p>But these Men do not seem to have any great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Edification of the Church, but only to their
own particular Edification, and we must grant, that
Edification is sometimes applied to particular Christians
in Scripture, according to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Exhortation,
<hi>Comfort your selves together, and Edifie one another,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 11.</note>
               <hi>even as also ye do.</hi> And this Edifying one another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
question signifies our promoting each others growth
and progress in all Christian Graces and Vertues: and so
the Building and Edification of the Church, signifies
the growth and Improvement of the Church in all
Spiritual Wisdom and knowledge, and Christian graces,
the Edification of the Church consists in the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of particular Christians, but then this is called
Edification or Building, because this growth and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
is in the Unity and Communion of the
Church, and makes them one Spiritual House and
Temple. Thus the Church is called the Temple of
God, and every particular Christian is Gods Temple,
wherein the Holy Spirit dwells, and yet God has but
one Temple, and the Holy Spirit dwells only in the
Church of Christ; but particular Christians are Gods
Temple, and the Holy Spirit dwells in them, as liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Members of the Christian Church; and thus by
the same reason, the Church is Edified and Built
up, as it grows into a Spiritual House and Holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62060:26"/>
by a firm and close Union and Communion of all
its parts; and every Christian is Edified, as he grows
up in all Christian Graces and Vertues in the Unity of
the Church.</p>
            <p>And therefore whatever extraordinary means of Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
Men may fancy to themselves in a Separation,
the Apostle knew no Edification, but in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church; and indeed if our growth and
increase in all Grace and Vertue, be more owing to
the internal assistances of the Divine Spirit, than to
the external Administrations, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>I
have planted, and</hi> Apollos <hi>watered, but God gave the
increase: So then, neither is he, that planteth any
thing, nor he that watereth; but God that gave the
increase:</hi> And the Divine Spirit confine his influences
and operations to the unity of the Church (as the
same Apostle tells us, that there is but <hi>one Body and
one Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 4.</note> (which plainly signifies, that the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this one Spirit, are appropriated to this one
Body, as the Soul is to the Body it Animates) then
it does not seem a very likely way for Edification to
cut our selves off from the Unity of Christs Body.</p>
            <p>3.<note place="margin">Case 3.</note> The Third and Last Case still remains, which
will be resolved in a few words, according to the
Principles now laid down, which is this: <hi>Whether it
be Lawful to Communicate with two distinct and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Churches.</hi> For this is thought of late days, not
only a very Innocent and Lawful thing, but the true
Catholick-Spirit, and Catholick-Communion, to
Communicate with Churches of all Communions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
perhaps they may except the Papists, and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.
It is thought a Schismatical Principle, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to Communicate with those Churches, which
withdraw Communion from us. And thus some, who
Communicate ordinarily with the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:62060:26"/>
make no Scruple to Communicate in Prayers and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
with Presbyterian and Independent Churches,
and Presbyterians can Communicate with the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and with Independents, whom formerly
they charged with down-right Schism; and some
think it very indifferent, whom they Communicate
with, and therefore take their turns in all. But this
is as contrary to all the Principles of Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
as any thing can possibly be.</p>
            <p>To be in Communion with the Church is to be a
Member of it, and to be a Member of two Separate
and opposite Churches, is to be as contrary to our
selves, as those Separate Churches, are to each other.</p>
            <p>Christ hath but one Church, and one Body, and
therefore where there are two Churches divided from
each other by Separate Communions, there is a
Schism and Rent in the Body, and whoever Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
with both these Churches, on one side or
other, Communicates in a Schism.</p>
            <p>That the Presbyterian and Independent Churches,
have made an Actual Separation from the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> I have evidently proved already; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the Communion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> be
Lawful (as those, who can, and ordinarily do Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to acknowledge) then they are Schismaticks,
and to Communicate with them is to partake in their
Schism.</p>
            <p>Now if Schism be an Innocent thing, and the true
Catholick Spirit, I have no more to say, but that the
whole Christian Church, ever since the Apostles
times, has been in a very great mistake; but if Schism
be a very great Sin, and that which will Damn us,
as soon as Adultery and Murder, then it must needs
be a dangerous thing to Communicate with Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:62060:27"/>
The Sum of all in short is this. Besides these Men,
who justifie their Separation from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
by charging Her with requiring Sinful terms of
Communion, (which is the only thing, that can justifie
their Separation, if it could be proved) there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who Separate lightly and wantonly, for want
of a due sense of the Nature of Church-Communion,
and our obligations to preserve the Unity of the Spirit
in the Bond of Peace. They have no notion at all of
a Church, or no notion of one Church, or know not,
wherein the Unity and Communion of this Church
consists; and these Men think, it is indifferent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they Communicate with any Church at all, or that
they secure themselves from Schism by Communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sometimes with one Church, and sometimes with
another; that they may choose their Church accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their own fancies, and change again, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their humor alters. But I hope, who ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
carefully, what I have now writ, and attends
to those passionate Exhortations of the Gospel to Peace,
and Unity, and Brotherly Love, which cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
but in one Communion, which is the Unity of
the Body of Christ, and the Peace and Love of fellow
Members, will not only heartily Pray to the God of
Peace, to restore Peace and Unity to his Church, but
will be careful, how he divides the Church himself,
and will use his utmost endeavours to heal the present
Schisms and Divisions of the Church of Christ.</p>
