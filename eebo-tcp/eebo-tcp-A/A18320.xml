            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thus you ſee an Ambaſſade of rebellion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Popes</hi> holines, the Ambaſſadour an old doting Engliſh Prieſt a fugitiue and conſpirator, ſent as he ſaieth to ſome noble men, and thoſe were the two Earles of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> heads of the rebellion.</p>

            <p>This noble fact here mencioned was the rebellion in the North: the noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were the Earles of <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> and <hi>Northumberland:</hi> the lacke of the euent or ſucceſſe was that the traitours were vanquiſhed, and the Queenes Maieſtie and her ſubiects had by Gods ordinance the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie: and the cauſe why the rebels preuayled not, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the Catholiques had not bene duely informed that the Queenes Maieſtie was declared to be (as they terme it) an heretike: which want of information, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make the rebels mightier in nomber and power,
<pb facs="tcp:5159:9"/>
was diligently and cunningly ſupplyed by the ſending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the realme of a great multitude of the Seminaries &amp; Ieſuites, whoſe ſpecial charge was to informe the people thereof, as by their actions hath manifeſtly appeared.</p>
            <p>And though <hi>D.

ſhewed howe they and other Catholiques did deſire to haue the ſayd Bull to be vnderſtand againſt the Queen of Englande: yet to make the matter more plaine howe all other Ieſuites and Seminaries, yea howe al Papiſts naming themſelues Catholiques, doe and are warranted to interpret the ſaide Bull againſt her Maieſtie and her good ſubiects, you ſhall ſee what one of their fellowes, named <hi>Hart,</hi> who was condemned with <hi>Campion,</hi> did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many other thinges declare his knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the laſt of December in the ſame yeere <hi>.1580.</hi> in theſe wordes following.</p>
            <p>The Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> (for ſo much as it is againſt the Queene) is holden among the Engliſh Catholiques for a lawful ſentence,<note place="margin">Harts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Wherefore to make ſome concluſion of the matters before mencioned,<note place="margin">A conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous bookes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Queene &amp; the realme, are falſe.</note> al perſons both within the realme and abroade, may playnely perceiue that all the infamous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels lately publiſhed abroade in ſundrie languages, and the ſlanderous reportes made in other Princes courtes of a multitude of perſons, to haue bene of late put to torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and death onely for profeſſion of the Catholique religion, and not for matters of ſtate againſt the Queenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
<pb facs="tcp:5159:11"/>
are falſe and ſhameles, and publiſhed to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of traitours and rebelles. And to make the matter ſeeme more horrible or lamentable, they recite y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar names of all the perſons, which by their owne Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue exceed not for theſe twentie fiue yeeres ſpace, aboue the number of iii. ſcore,<note place="margin">Difference of the ſmal numbers that haue bene exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the ſpace of xxv. yeres, from the great numbers in v. yeres of Queene Maries ſaigne.</note> forgetting or rather with their ſtonie and ſenſles heartes not regarding, in what cruell ſort in the tyme of Queene Marie, which litle exceeded the ſpace of fiue yeeres, the Queenes Maieſties raigne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fiue times as many, there were by impriſonment, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, famyne and fire, of men, women, maidens and children, almoſt the number of foure hundred: and of that number, aboue twenty that had bene Archbiſhops, Biſhoppes, and principall Prelates or Officers in the Church lamentably deſtroyed, and of women aboue three ſcore, and of children aboue fourtie, and amongſt the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſome great with child, out of whoſe bodyes the child, by fire was expelled aliue, and yet alſo cruelly burned: examples beyond al heathen cruelty. And moſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> youth that then ſuffered cruell death, both men, women, and children (which is to be noted) were ſuch, as had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer by the Sacrament of baptiſme, or by confirmation, profeſſed, nor was euer taught or inſtructed, or euer had hearde of any other kinde of religion, but onely of that which by their blood and death in the fire they did as true Martyrs teſtifie. A matter of another ſort to be lamented with ſimplicitie of words, and not with puffed eloquence, then the execution in this time of a very fewe Traytors, who alſo in their time, if they exceeded thirtie yeeres of age, had in their baptiſme profeſſed, and in their youth had learned the ſame religion which they now ſo bitterly oppugned. And beſide that, in their opinions they differ much from the Martyrs of Queene Maries tyme: for though they continued in the profeſſion of the religion wherin they were chriſtened, yet they neuer at their death
<pb facs="tcp:5159:11"/>
denied their lawfull Queene, nor maintained any of her open and forreine enemies, nor procured any rebellion or Ciuill warre, nor did ſowe any ſedition in ſecret corners, nor withdrewe any ſubiects from their obedience, as theſe ſworne ſeruants of the <hi>Pope</hi> haue continually done.</p>
            <p>And therefore all theſe thinges well conſidered, there is no doubt, but all good ſubiects within the realme doe manifeſtly ſee, and all wauering perſons (not being led cleane out of the way by the ſeditious) will hereafter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, how they haue bene abuſed to goe aſtray.

the rebelles &amp; traitours, either in England or in Ireland in their rebellions or warres: of which ſort of wretches y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comiſeration is made, as though for their contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in religion, or for teaching of the people to diſobey y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes of the Realme, they might haue bene otherwiſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and corrected, &amp; yet not with capitall peane.

For which purpoſe let theſe perſons be termed as they liſt, ſcholers, ſchoolemaſters, bookemen, ſeminaries, prieſtes, Ieſuites, fryers, beademen, romaniſtes, pardoners, or what elſe you wil, neyther their tytles, nor their apparel doth make them traitours, but their traiterous ſecret motions &amp; practiſes: their perſons make not the warre, but their directions and counſels haue ſet vp the rebellions.

And now examine theſe which you cal your vnarmed ſchollers and prieſtes, wherefore they liued and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant in companie of the principall rebels and traitours at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in other places, where it is proued that they were partakers of their conſpiracies? Let it bee anſwered why they came thus by ſtealth into the realme? why they haue wandered vp and downe in corners in diſguiſed ſort, changing their tytles, names, &amp; maner of apparel? Why they haue intiſed and ſought to perſwade by their ſecrete falſe reaſons, the people to allowe and beleeue all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and attempts whatſoeuer the <hi>pope</hi> hath done or ſhal do, to be lawful? Why they haue reconciled &amp; withdrawen ſo manie people in corners from the lawes of the realme to the obedience of the <hi>pope,</hi> a forreyne potentate and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen enemy, whom they know to haue already declared the Queene to be no lawful Queene, to haue mayntayned the knowne rebels and traitours, to haue inuaded her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties dominions with open warre? Examine further, how theſe vagarant diſguiſed vnarmed ſpies haue anſwered, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were taken and demanded what they thought of the Bul of <hi>pope Pius Quintus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Six Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to trye tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſchollers.</note> which was publiſhed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue the Queenes Maieſtie, and to warrant her ſubiectes to diſobey her: whether they thought that all ſubiectes ought to obey the ſame bull, and ſo to rebell? Secondly, whether they thought her Maieſtie to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawful Queene of the realme, notwithſtanding the ſaid bull or any other bull of the <hi>pope</hi>?

moue warred as he did in Ireland? Fourthly, whether the <hi>pope</hi> may diſcharge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubiectes of her Maieſtie, or of any other princes chriſtened, of their othes of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce?

To theſe queſtions very apt to trie the trueth of falſhoode of any ſuch ſedicious perſons, being iuſtly before condemned for their diſloyaltie, theſe lewde vnarmed traytours I ſay would no wiſe anſwere directly hereto, as all other faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubiectes to any prince chriſtian ought to doe. And as they vpon refuſall to anſwere directly to theſe queſtions onely, might haue bene iuſtly conuinced as guiltie of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">The offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for treaſon, not for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſo yet were they not thereupon condemned, but vpon all their other former actions committed both abroade and in the Realme, which were no leſſe traiterous then the actions of all other the ſpyes and traitours, and of Iudas him ſelfe afore remembred which had no armour nor weapon, and yet at all times ought to be adiudged traitours. For theſe diſguiſed perſons (called ſchollars or Prieſtes) hauing bene firſt conuerſant of long time with the Traitours beyonde the ſea in all their conſpiracies, came hither by ſtealth in time of warre and rebellion by commaundement of the Capitall enemie the <hi>Pope</hi> or his Legates, to be ſecret eſpialles &amp; explorers in the Realme for the <hi>pope,</hi> to deliuer by ſecret, Romiſh tokens, as it were an earneſt or preſt, to them that ſhoulde be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to ioyne with rebels or open enemies, and in like ſort with their hallowed baggages from <hi>Rome</hi> to poyſon the ſences of the ſubiectes, powring into their hearts malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and peſtilent opinions againſt her Maieſtie and the
<pb facs="tcp:5159:20"/>
Lawes of the Realme, and alſo to kindle and ſet on fire the hearts of diſcontented ſubiectes with the flames of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and to ſearch and ſound the depthes and ſecretes of all mens inwarde intentions, either againſt her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, or for her: and finally, to bring into a beadroll, or as it were into a muſter roll, the names and powers with the dwellings of all them that ſhoulde be readie to rebell and to ayd the forrein inuaſion. Theſe kinds of ſeditious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the ſeruice of the <hi>pope</hi> and the traitours and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels abroade, haue made them traitours: not their bookes nor their beades, no not their cakes of waxe which they call <hi>Agnus dei,</hi> nor other their reliques, nor yet their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions for the ceremonies or rites of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: and therefore it is to be certainly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded that theſe did iuſtly deſerue their capital puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts as traitors, though they were not apprehended with ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> armour or weapon.</p>
            <p>Nowe if this latter repetition, as it were of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cauſes and reaſons afore recited, may not ſerue to ſtop the boiſterous mouthes, and the peſtiferous tongues, and venimous breathes of theſe that are infected with ſo groſſe errors, as to defende ſeditious ſubiectes, ſtirrers of rebellion againſt their naturall Prince &amp; countrey:<note place="margin">Vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are left to Gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> then are they to be left without any further argument, to the iudgement of the Almightie God, as perſons that haue couered their eyes againſt the ſunnes light, ſtopped their eares againſt the ſounde of Iuſtice, and oppreſſed their heartes againſt the force of reaſon, and as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>They ſpeake lyes, they are as venemous as the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a ſerpent, euen like the deafe Adder that ſtoppeth his eares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore with charitie to conclude, if theſe rebels &amp; traitors, and their fautors woulde yet take ſome remorſe and compaſſion of their natural countrey, and would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how vaine their attempts haue bene ſo many yeres,
<pb facs="tcp:5159:21"/>
and howe many of their confederates are waſted by miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and calamities, and would deſiſt from their vnnatural practiſes abroade: and if theſe <hi>Seminaries,</hi> ſecret wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and explorators in the darke, woulde imploy their traueiles in the workes of light and doctrine according to the vſage of their ſchooles, and content them ſelues with their profeſſion and deuotion: and that the remnant of the wicked flocke of the ſeedemen of ſedition would ceaſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their rebellious, falſe, and infamous railings &amp; libellings: there is no doubt by Gods grace (her Maieſtie being ſo much giuen to mercie and deuoted to peace) but al colour and occaſion of ſhedding the blood of any more of her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſubiectes of this ſand, ſhould vtterly ceaſe. Againſt whoſe malices, if they ſhall not deſiſt, Almighty God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue her Maieſtie with his ſpirit &amp; power long to reigne and liue in his feare, and to be able to vanquiſh them and all Gods enemies, and her rebels &amp; traitors both at home and abroad, and to maintaine and preſerue all her naturall good louing ſubiectes, to the true ſeruice of the ſame Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God according to his holy worde and will.</p>
            <p>Many other things might be remembred for defence of other her Maieſties princely, honourable, and godly acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſundry other things, wherein alſo theſe &amp; the like ſeditious railors haue of late time without all ſhame, by fained and falſe libels ſought to diſcredit her Maieſtie &amp; her gouernement: but at this time, theſe former cauſes and reaſons alleadged by way of aduertiſements, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to iuſtifie her Maieſties actions to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole worlde in the caſes remembred.</p>
