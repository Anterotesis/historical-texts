            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

prevailed withal to believe, <hi>although an Angel should be sent unto them from the dead</hi> (as <hi>Abraham</hi> told <hi>Dives,</hi> Luke 16.31.) And yet with what small and weak means some others have been converted; as were <hi>Iustine</hi> the <hi>Philosopher, Cyprian</hi> the <hi>Necromancer,</hi> S. <hi>Austin, Fulgentius, Francisco, Iunius, Melancthon, Adrianus, Latimer,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>We read of <hi>two famous Strumpets,</hi> that were suddenly converted with this onely Argument; that <hi>God seeth all things,</hi> even in the dark, when the doors are shut, and the curtains drawn; yea a thought onely hath sometimes served the turn. Nor needs there any more to a clarified understanding, than the bare thought of <hi>Gods Omnipresence, Omnisciency,</hi> or <hi>Omnipotency</hi>; as being present every where, knowing every thought and intent of the heart, and being Almighty to <hi>punish or reward evil and good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence, <hi>Melancthon</hi> having found the <hi>Word</hi> most easily to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him (as <hi>wax</hi> sooner yields to the <hi>seal,</hi> than <hi>steel</hi> to the <hi>

            </p>
            <p>Nor is the <hi>conversion</hi> of a sinner, <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or the <hi>New birth,</hi> so easie a matter as men may imagine: Yea, the <hi>conversion of a sinner</hi> is held by the Learned a greater Miracle than was the <hi>Creation of the World</hi>; and their Reason is weighty: For, in making such an one <hi>

In all which, <hi>God</hi> meets with nothing but <hi>opposition,</hi> which in the <hi>Creation</hi> he met not with.</p>
            <p>The case is this, though the weakest means shall serve the turn, where <hi>God</hi> intends success; yet when he withholds his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned grace, <hi>Paul</hi> himself shall not be able to move a soul. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, as <hi>all bodies</hi> are not equally apt to be wrought upon, by the same <hi>medicine</hi>; so are not <hi>all souls</hi> by the <hi>same means</hi> of grace.
