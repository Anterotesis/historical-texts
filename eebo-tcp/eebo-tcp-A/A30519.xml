            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Light of the Day of GOD Almighty, is arisen
upon us in our day; and the shinings forth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is with great clearness and force, even as the
Sun at noon-day, and many are come to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Appearance thereof, and to walk in its Light with
much joyfulness: for, as the Wise man said, <hi>The Light is
sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the Eye to behold
the Sun:</hi> And so fully is our Morning-Sun now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
that the Upright in heart may walk and not stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and the poor in spirit may run in the path of Life, and
not fall; for, indeed we may say the Night is spent, and
the Day is come; therefore let us walk in the Day, and put
on the Armour of Light, as many as are made the Children
thereof.</p>
            <p>And where the Light of this Sun is arisen, and in whose
hearts it shineth, it cannot but give some Testimony through
such an one, of its own Glory, Vertues and Excellency, to
them that sit yet in darkness and in the bondage of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
that they also may see the same Light and Glory
arise on their Tabernacle: for 'tis the property of this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
heavenly Light, to shine forth out of darkness, and
to give <hi>light</hi> to such as have long sate in <hi>darkness,</hi> that
their souls may live, and be refreshed with the Light of the
Living; And for this cause do we labour and spend, and
are spent, accounting nothing too dear for us, that the
Light of Truth may shine abroad and guide the Upright in
the perfect way, till the Elect be gathered into the pasture
<pb facs="tcp:56503:3"/>
of Eternal Life, and the Sun so elivated on the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ioy and Praises, never to go down, but the saying
fulfilled, <hi>There shall be no night, but the light of the
Sun shall be as the light of seven dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These following Testimonies were written at divers
times, as the Lord drew forth my spirit through the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Life in me; some of them, some years since;
and being cast by among bundels of Manuscripts, and now
lately come to my sight, and looking them over, I have
thought good to send them abroad, as being of service to
many: And this is the Occasion and End of my present
publishing these things. And to the Iudgment of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God in all the Saints, do I commend my Labours,
and may self to be approved;</p>

            <head type="sub">A TESTIMONY concerning LIFE AND DEATH,
with their several Fruits and Effects distinguished.</head>
            <p>THere is only <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and there is but only
<hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> in the whole Creation, that <hi>ruleth</hi>
and <hi>reigneth,</hi> in, and among, and over all the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
of <hi>men;</hi> and <hi>all the Children of men</hi> upon the
face of the Harth are under the Government and Dominion
of <hi>Life,</hi> or of <hi>Death,</hi> in whatsoever they are, and in whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they do; and <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Death</hi> hath the Rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in every Creature, in every Exercise, whether of <hi>Works</hi>
or <hi>Words;</hi> and all People upon the Earth are subject to the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
of <hi>one,</hi> or the <hi>other,</hi> and bring forth the Fruits and
Works in obedience to <hi>Life</hi> or to <hi>Death,</hi> and shews them forth
in visible appearance. Now these <hi>two,</hi> (to wit) <hi>Life</hi> and
<hi>Death,</hi> are <hi>contrary</hi> one to the other, in <hi>being,</hi> in <hi>nature,</hi> in
<hi>works</hi> and <hi>fruits;</hi> and each of these are known and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
the one from the other, in <hi>being,</hi> in <hi>nature,</hi> in
<hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>effects,</hi> which diversly they bring forth in this
World; and each of them hath a Kingdom and Government
in himself, distinct from, and contrary each to other; and each
of them have their several Subjects, which also are <hi>contrary</hi> in
<hi>birth</hi> and <hi>generation,</hi> in <hi>quality</hi> and <hi>kind;</hi> over which they rule
and govern, and to whom they give distinct Portions and
Heirships in this World, and hereafter: And where <hi>Life</hi> rules
and reigns, <hi>Death</hi> is held in captivity and bondage; and where
Death <hi>lives,</hi> the Life <hi>dies;</hi> and where one of these brings forth
<hi>fruit,</hi> the other is <hi>barren;</hi> for they agree not in one, but are in
<hi>all things</hi> contrary: and the Subjects of the <hi>one</hi> are always <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing</hi>
and <hi>striving</hi> against the Subjects of the <hi>other:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> there is continual <hi>war</hi> and <hi>strife</hi> among
the Creatures, who are the Subjects of the one of them, in
whatsoever man is, and in what he doth.</p>
            <p>First, concerning <hi>Life</hi> I will speak. <hi>Life</hi> was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with God, and is without descent, and God is <hi>Life</hi>
in himself, without <hi>beginning</hi> or <hi>ending</hi> of <hi>time, place,</hi> or <hi>matter;</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56503:4"/>
and <hi>Life</hi> put forth it self out of its invisible being, into <hi>work</hi>
and <hi>action</hi> in the beginning of the World, and appeared in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<hi>operations</hi> and <hi>works,</hi> and brought forth <hi>all Creatures,</hi> and
<hi>all things,</hi> into visible appearances; and <hi>Life</hi> was the Author of
all, the Beginning and Foundation of all; and <hi>Life</hi> was and is
that Being and Vertue of all things that are, and it was the <hi>Ioy</hi>
and <hi>Delight</hi> of all things that it self brought forth; for all <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
through it, and it gave <hi>breath</hi> and <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> all
Creatures; and <hi>Life</hi> blessed them all, and in it
were all Creatures at <hi>Unity,</hi> being framed and brought into
visibility, and for the <hi>pleasure of Life,</hi> which was all in all in
the beginning; and there was a sweet <hi>concurrance</hi> and <hi>harmony</hi>
in the whole Creation through the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>being of Life</hi> in
the midst of all Creatures, through which the whole Creation
was made and framed by the Eternal Word of <hi>Life,</hi> and
through which they stood and did remain in <hi>blessedness;</hi> and
<hi>Life</hi> ruled and reigned in every Creature that was brought
forth, and was the glory and substance thereof: for <hi>Life</hi> was
and is that <hi>only begotten</hi> of the Father, the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Heir</hi> of
the <hi>Everlasting Father,</hi> his express <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Brightness;</hi> being
<hi>one</hi> with the <hi>Father,</hi> not separated or divided from him.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Death,</hi> it was not yet known, nor had it any
place in the Creation; if had yet received no Power, nor
Kingdom, nor Government, neither was it in being: But <hi>Life</hi>
was all, over all, through all, and in all, in the <hi>beginning,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>disobedience</hi> and <hi>transgression</hi> entered to war against <hi>Life;</hi>
But <hi>Life</hi> was Prince, Ruler and Governour, in and over all
the works of the Creator. And <hi>Life</hi> in its Being is <hi>God,</hi> and
<hi>God</hi> is <hi>Life;</hi> and in its Government, and Fruits, and Effects,
is <hi>Purity, Righteousness, Truth, Holiness, Meekness,</hi> and all the
works that are just and equal according to <hi>God,</hi> and like Him,
and which shewes him forth in the Creation; and this was, and
it was thus in the begining, before <hi>Death</hi> entred into the <hi>World,</hi>
or had a Kingdom; But it is written, <hi>the Devil abode not in the
Truth,</hi> but went out of the <hi>Truth;</hi> and he is the king of <hi>Death,</hi>
and hath the power of it; he went out of the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
and out of the <hi>Life,</hi> by which all things was made and created,
and abode not in the <hi>Truth,</hi> nor in the <hi>Life,</hi> to live, and act,
and speak in that, but desired to be, and became to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56503:4"/>
of himself without God; and he spoke of himself, and
acted of himself, without the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of the Creator, being separated
from it, and become a distinct being of himself; and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lost his <hi>state</hi> and <hi>first condition,</hi> thus became an Enemy to
<hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and became the King of <hi>Death;</hi> and he was
the first of <hi>Death's</hi> race, and he holds the Power of it upon this
day; he being gone out of the Truth, and out of the Power
and Life of God, and become a distinct being of himself,
having a Kingdom of his own to promote in opposition to the
Kingdom of God. Then he drew mankind out of the <hi>Power</hi>
and <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Life;</hi> beguiled <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> as you read in
the Scriptures, and they lost the <hi>Life</hi> &amp; <hi>Power</hi> (even all <hi>feeling</hi>
of it, and <hi>comfort</hi> in it) by which they were created and made;
and they also transgressed and acted contrary to the <hi>Life</hi> and
<hi>Power,</hi> and acted of themselves, and spake of themselves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of their Creator, being separated from
it; and <hi>were</hi> and <hi>did</hi> something of <hi>themselves</hi> without <hi>God</hi> the
Creator: and then the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> cast them out of all
Peace, Joy, and Happiness, into the <hi>Earth,</hi> and into <hi>Death;</hi>
and <hi>Death</hi> became King and Prince over mankind: And they
had no more <hi>possession</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> nor <hi>blessedness</hi> by it in their <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
estate,</hi> neither did it any longer <hi>reign</hi> in them; but they
having transgressed against the <hi>Life,</hi> and acted of <hi>themselves,</hi>
and spoken of themselves, without the <hi>leadings</hi> and <hi>movings</hi> of
the <hi>Life,</hi> this was their transgression; They went out of the
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> in all <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> and them <hi>Life</hi> drove
them forth of its <hi>Good Pleasure</hi> into the <hi>Earth,</hi> separate from
its <hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and into <hi>Death,</hi> which is contrary to it
self, to live in <hi>anguish</hi> and <hi>sorrow:</hi> and so when the <hi>Devil</hi> was
gone out of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and had led <hi>Mankind</hi> out of the <hi>Truth,</hi>
and out of <hi>Life,</hi> and thereby they were all separated from
<hi>Life,</hi> and drove out from <hi>God,</hi> out of his <hi>pleasure,</hi> into <hi>his wrath;</hi>
Then became <hi>Death</hi> to have a <hi>being</hi> in Mankind, and great <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
and not before; and then <hi>Death</hi> began his <hi>Kingdom</hi> in
the VVorld, and over it, and he set up his <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in, and among, and over all the Children of men.</p>
            <p>And so from <hi>Transgression</hi> came <hi>Death,</hi> that was its <hi>beginning,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56503:5"/>
Man having transgressed against the <hi>Life</hi> that brought him
forth; and being separated from <hi>Life,</hi> then <hi>Death</hi> took place,
and its Kingdom was established over the World, and in all
the Children of men, in opposition to <hi>Life,</hi> and its Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Kingdom; and <hi>Death</hi> reigns, from <hi>Adam,</hi> so saith
the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Life</hi> was transgressed against, and so
provoked into an absence, and to withdraw it self into <hi>invisibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
from the enjoyment of Mankind, that it should not be self
nor perceived of Him to comfort him; and then the whole
body of <hi>Death</hi> came upon Man, to <hi>lead</hi> his Conscience and <hi>vex</hi>
his Soul: and <hi>Death,</hi> and only <hi>Death</hi> hath a Preheminence
over all in Transgression, and is established into a Kingdom,
over sinful Subjects, who are under its Command; and hath
its Rule and Government, and brings forth its Works and
Fruits in Mankind, contrary to <hi>Life,</hi> and in opposition to it,
and to its Kingdom and Power, and opposeth the Kingdom
and Power of <hi>Life</hi> (the Creator;) and in its Nature, and all its
Fruits and VVorks, it is contrary and opposite to <hi>Life,</hi> and its
VVorks and Fruits; and through <hi>Death</hi> is the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in its exercise by Man perverted from the right use and
end ordained of God; and out of <hi>Death</hi> proceedeth all Evil,
as <hi>Lying, Swearing, Drunkenness</hi> and <hi>Whoredom, Pride, Strife,</hi>
and every <hi>evil work</hi> and <hi>word:</hi> These things are the Fruits and
VVorks of <hi>Death;</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> governs the Children of men
in the practice of all these things; and in transgression <hi>Death</hi>
lives, and acts, and speaks through Men and VVomen; and
<hi>Death</hi> rules in them, and hath perverted them in all their
wayes; for they have given their Power to it, and it wholly
captivates them, and is established over them, and hath the
dominion in them, and <hi>Life</hi> is swallowed up of it: And this
Kingdom of <hi>Death</hi> opposeth God, and the Kingdom of <hi>Life,</hi>
and exalts it self against <hi>Life,</hi> and hath its operation in the
Creature, in all manner of <hi>unrighteousness,</hi> bringing forth daily
such <hi>words, works, fruits</hi> and <hi>effects,</hi> as doth oppress and is a
burden unto the <hi>Life,</hi> and unto the God of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> and
its Kingdom doth continually war and strive against <hi>Life</hi> and
its Kingdom, and the <hi>one</hi> opposeth the <hi>other</hi> through all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
since the beginning: for the Devil is the King of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56503:5"/>
               <hi>Death,</hi> and hath the power of it, and he is King in its <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and Ruler in its <hi>Dominion;</hi> and this is the state of all the
Children of men in Transgression, <hi>Death</hi> rules, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Death</hi> reigns in them, and it brings forth <hi>cursed fruits</hi>
through them, and they are <hi>subjects</hi> thereof, and in <hi>obedience</hi>
thereunto in all things: And through <hi>Death,</hi> which hath power
over them, are they separated from <hi>Life,</hi> and have no part nor
portion therein, because of <hi>Death,</hi> that hath separated them,
and vailed and clouded them, and loads their Consciences.</p>
            <p>But now the Promise of the God of <hi>Life,</hi> is, to <hi>restore Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi>
out of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Darkness,</hi> and that <hi>Life</hi> shall <hi>reign again,</hi>
and <hi>subdue Death,</hi> and <hi>destroy it</hi> and <hi>its Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>swallow it
up;</hi> and this is the Promise of the Father: For, in <hi>transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Death</hi> hath subdued <hi>Life,</hi> and overcome it in Mankind; But
in the Restoration, <hi>Life</hi> shall swallow up <hi>Death,</hi> and subdue it,
and overcome it: and this comes to passe through the rising
again of <hi>Life</hi> from under <hi>Death,</hi> which hath held it in <hi>bondage;</hi>
and <hi>Life</hi> that made the World in the beginning, and gave to
all things <hi>life</hi> and <hi>substance,</hi> as I have said; which <hi>Life,</hi> in its
measure in Mankind, hath been overcome and swallowed up
in <hi>Transgression:</hi> That <hi>Life</hi> shall appear, though in another
manner of appearance than it did in the beginning; for then
it appeared freely of it self without opposition, and brought
forth the <hi>first Creation;</hi> But now it doth appear through great
<hi>opposition,</hi> and through all that doth oppose it in this <hi>second Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
when <hi>Life</hi> comes again to reign over <hi>Death,</hi> and swallow
it up, and <hi>overcome</hi> and <hi>subdue</hi> it; and who comes to witness
this (the <hi>new Creation</hi>) they know <hi>Life</hi> appearing through <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi>
and through the <hi>destroying of Death,</hi> and all its <hi>works</hi>
and <hi>fruits:</hi> for <hi>CHRIST</hi> is the <hi>Life,</hi> and he is the <hi>Seed</hi> of
the <hi>Woman,</hi> which <hi>bruiseth</hi> the <hi>Serpents head,</hi> who hath the <hi>power</hi>

of <hi>Death</hi> ruled in them, and brought forth its <hi>works</hi>

And though its power they opposed and gainsayed the <hi>Life,</hi>
and they fought against the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi>
and such were the <hi>Pharisces</hi> who put Christ to death, who is
the <hi>Life. Death</hi> reigned over all these, and they were of the
Stock of <hi>Death,</hi> and they were of <hi>this World,</hi> and had their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
<hi>below</hi> in the <hi>earthly things;</hi> and knew not the <hi>Life,</hi>
not its <hi>Government,</hi> but were strangers to it, and enemies to
it, as all are at this day, who are <hi>transgressors</hi> against the <hi>Life,</hi>
and all such are subject to the <hi>Curse,</hi> to <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Misery,</hi>
and the <hi>Anger</hi> of the LORD; but who comes to feel the
<hi>Life,</hi> and the <hi>obedience</hi> to it again, <hi>Death</hi> is destroyed through
<hi>Death;</hi> for, through the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Death, Death</hi> comes to be

and this is the <hi>second Creation,</hi> and the <hi>new Creation,</hi> where <hi>Life</hi>

            <p>THere are two great <hi>Mysteries</hi> in their invisible being, and

<hi>Mankind,</hi> to be the Instrument to display themselves through,
in visible appearance; for the Creature <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi> is a

            <p>But now more perfectly doth the <hi>Mystery of GOD</hi> appear in
his Servants, and in his Children who are born of Him, and
begotten by Him, and they have the <hi>sence</hi> and <hi>feeling,</hi> and
<hi>understanding</hi> of this <hi>Mystery</hi> more than any other Creatures;
and this is their <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> above all other Creatures
upon the face of the whole Earth; for they only, I say, who
are redeemed <hi>to God,</hi> and <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> they are them that
have the <hi>sence,</hi> and <hi>feeling,</hi> and <hi>understanding</hi> of this <hi>Mystery,</hi>
even of the <hi>Mystery of GOD, infinit, endless</hi> and <hi>eternal.</hi> And
though this <hi>Mystery</hi> be hid in all other Creatures, and manifesting
it self through them, yet this <hi>Mystery</hi> is not <hi>known</hi> to them,
nor <hi>understood</hi> of them, nor of any other Creature (I say) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> in whom this <hi>Mystery</hi> is only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed;
for they are them through whom more manifestly and
plainly this <hi>Mystery</hi> is made manifest, and to them <hi>revealed,</hi>
and <hi>known,</hi> and <hi>felt</hi> in their Understandings; and they have
the enjoyment thereof who <hi>know</hi> God, and are <hi>known</hi> of him,
and are entered into <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, into <hi>Everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
of <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Peace;</hi> and through <hi>them</hi> doth this <hi>Mystery
display</hi> it self, even in the sight of all Creatures, in works of
<hi>Righteousness,</hi> and works of <hi>Purity,</hi> and works of <hi>Goodness,</hi> of
<hi>Mercy,</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> in their exercise of
all things; and in this manner, and by these fruits and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
doth the <hi>Mystery of GOD</hi> shew it self forth through his
Children, in whom the <hi>Mystery</hi> is opened, that is hid in all
other Creatures: And this is the Crown of the <hi>Children</hi> of the
Lord, that are born from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and from <hi>above,</hi> that the
<hi>Mystery of GOD</hi> is <hi>felt</hi> and <hi>enioyed</hi> by them, and more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
to <hi>them</hi> than in any other <hi>Creatures:</hi> And to know this
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56503:8"/>
               <hi>Mystery of GOD,</hi> is <hi>Life Eternal;</hi> and to have the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of his Leadings, of his Judgment, of his Mercy, and
of his Counsel, and of the operation of his Power; to feel this
in the Understanding, this is <hi>Ioy,</hi> and a <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> where
the <hi>Mystery of GOD</hi> is revealed in Spirit.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Mystery of the Devil,</hi> it is <hi>darkness,</hi> and in
<hi>darkness;</hi> and it shews it self forth in the <hi>Ungodly,</hi> and in
the sons of <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>transgression,</hi> and in such onely doth this
<hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> and <hi>of Sin,</hi> and of <hi>the Devil</hi> display it
self forth in all <hi>unrighteousnesse</hi> and <hi>sin;</hi> and that which is
contrary to the Creator in <hi>works, words</hi> and <hi>thoughts;</hi> All
these things are the manifestation of the <hi>Mystery of the Devil,</hi>
and its <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>effects,</hi> who is out of the Truth, who is vailed
and covered, and hidden in the hearts of the <hi>Ungodly,</hi> and in
the hearts of the sons of <hi>Adam</hi> in the <hi>Fall:</hi> This <hi>Mystery</hi> was
not from the beginning, as the other, but when the <hi>Devil</hi>
went out of the Truth, and had led <hi>Man's mind</hi> out of the
Truth, and taken possession of the heart of Man, and become
ruler and lord there, having gained authority over Man
through Man's obedience to him, then began this <hi>Mystery</hi> to
discover it self, and act it self through the Creature; and this
was since the beginning: And though no other creature be an
Agent to manifest forth this <hi>Mystery</hi> but Man, yet Man in his
exercise of all Creatures, or all Creatures through the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Man in transgression, there is shewed forth this <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Iniquity,</hi> that secretly lurks in the spirits of ungodly men;
which spirit of unrighteousness, the <hi>Mystery of the Devil,</hi> leads
Man into all sinfulness, of <hi>drunkenness</hi> and <hi>uncleanness,</hi> and such
like, and hath polluted the Earth, and defiled all Creatures
through Man's exercise in them: and this is truly an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the <hi>Mystery of the Devil;</hi> yet he hath other appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and other makings-out of his <hi>Mystery</hi> (to wit) in a way
of seeming Righteousness, and seeming Holiness, and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Purity; and these shew the <hi>Mystery of Unrighteousness,</hi>
the <hi>Mystery of the Devil,</hi> who deceives the soul that is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of the enjoyment of the Creator, who is the <hi>desire</hi> of the
<hi>Immortal Soul;</hi> and so through a <hi>form,</hi> and <hi>likenesse,</hi> and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56503:9"/>
of a thing is the <hi>Soul Immortal</hi> deceived, and beguiled
with that which hath <hi>appearances</hi> in it, but no <hi>life</hi> nor <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> be but <hi>one</hi> in it self, yet
it manifests it self <hi>divers wayes;</hi> sometimes in <hi>open prophanesse</hi>
and <hi>wickedness,</hi> and sometime in <hi>seeming righteousness</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi>
and in a <hi>form</hi> of Religion without <hi>power:</hi> But the Lord
is arisen to <hi>confound</hi> the <hi>Mystery of the Devil</hi> and <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and
will <hi>discover</hi> it, and <hi>destroy</hi> it; for it is the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi>
that <hi>worketh in the Children of Disobedience,</hi> that are <hi>strangers</hi> to
God; and through the <hi>operation</hi> of this <hi>Mystery</hi> are people kept
at a <hi>distance</hi> from the Lord, and out of <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi>
with Him: and this <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> worketh <hi>hiddenly,</hi> not
known but in the <hi>Eternal Eye,</hi> which sees through the <hi>spirit</hi> of
Creatures, and comprehendeth and fathometh over the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of things, and can judge beyond the <hi>appearance,</hi> even in
the <hi>ground,</hi> before <hi>action</hi> appeareth: for while people are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
and acting <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Righteousness visibly,</hi> and yet
not changed by the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> nor renewed in <hi>nature,
mind,</hi> and <hi>spirit,</hi> from the <hi>first Adam</hi> to the <hi>second,</hi> the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>
and <hi>Holiness</hi> brought forth in that state, is but the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> and the <hi>Wolf</hi> putting on the
<hi>Sheeps cloathing;</hi> And this God will judge, and all <hi>appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
without <hi>life,</hi> and all <hi>shews</hi> without <hi>substance,</hi> All this will
the Lord <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>confound,</hi> and bring <hi>to nought;</hi> for it is
but the <hi>working</hi> of the <hi>Mystery of the Devil,</hi> who is out of the
Truth.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Mystery</hi> hath more abounded since the dayes of
the Apostles, than in Ages since the beginning, in as much
as this <hi>Mystery</hi> hath operated and displayed it self forth in a
<hi>higher appearance</hi> and <hi>fairer shew</hi> than ever it did before; for
this <hi>Mystery</hi> hath sat in <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> and shewed it self
to be <hi>God,</hi> and been worshipped <hi>above all that is called God:</hi>
This <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> which hath put on
the <hi>Sheeps cloathing,</hi> and shews it self as the <hi>Sheep</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
and as <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Churches;</hi> all which hath been for many
Ages the manifestation of this <hi>Mystery,</hi> while that the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi>
of the <hi>Devil</hi> hath not been destroyed: but now is the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56503:9"/>
Lord arisen, who will <hi>discover</hi> and <hi>destroy</hi> this <hi>Mystery,</hi> and
<hi>save</hi> the Creature; and in the <hi>destruction</hi> of this <hi>Mystery,</hi> is
the other <hi>Mystery</hi> revealed, (to wit) <hi>The Mystery of God</hi> and of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and that is the <hi>Mystery</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> that destroyes the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie</hi>
of <hi>Antichrist</hi> and of the <hi>Devil:</hi> And now the Sons and
Daughters of the <hi>Lord Almighty</hi> are coming into this <hi>Mystery</hi>
of <hi>God Eternal,</hi> who is blessed for ever; and all <hi>that</hi> is coming
to be <hi>overthrown</hi> which doth oppose it, and gainsay it; and
there is nothing that can destroy or discover this <hi>Mystery,</hi> but
the <hi>appearance</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> for it is he that doth
<hi>discover</hi> and <hi>destroy</hi> the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> by the Spirit of his
Mouth, and by the Brightness of his Coming; and this are
people coming to: The <hi>Man of Sin</hi> is to be thrown down,
and the <hi>Man of Righteousness,</hi> the <hi>Man of God</hi> is revealed,
and Sons and Daughters shall shew him forth in the World,
and the <hi>Mystery of God</hi> shall shew it self forth over the World,
and in Nations; and blessed are all they that come to the
<hi>opening</hi> of this <hi>Mystery of God,</hi> which is the <hi>Mystery of Life</hi>
and <hi>Eternal Salvation.</hi>

            <head type="sub">A Testimony concerning true Liberty of Conscience,
what it is in it self, and how it is obtained; and what
the true Guide and Rule is of the Exercise of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</head>
            <p>THis is my <hi>Testimony,</hi> as I have received from the Lord:
True Liberty of Conscience, is, <hi>Liberty and Freedom of
the Conscience from the bondage of Sin, and all Transgression past
and present; and from whatsoever hath been, or is a Burden or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon the Conscience, whether inward or outward:</hi> the
<hi>Conscience,</hi> I say, is at <hi>liberty</hi> when it is freed from the <hi>burden
of the guilt of Sin past,</hi> and from the <hi>present temptation unto
Sin:</hi> And till this is <hi>witnessed,</hi> there is <hi>no true Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;</hi>
For every thing whatsoever, which is Sin and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56503:10"/>
against God, in <hi>works</hi> or <hi>words,</hi> brought forth by the
Creature, is <hi>bondage</hi> and a <hi>burden,</hi> and oppresseth the <hi>pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:</hi>
and therefore <hi>perfect freedom</hi> from all Sin and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
is, where the body of Sin and Death is put off, and
where the Evil is crucified, and the guilt of it taken away,
and where the Conscience is truly exercised by the Spirit of
Christ, which leadeth into all Truth, and preserveth from all
Evill; Then is the <hi>Conscience</hi> at <hi>liberty,</hi> and this is <hi>true Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conscience,</hi> when this is brought forth in the Creature:
For where <hi>Sin</hi> is brought forth, and <hi>Transgression</hi> lived in, there
the <hi>Conscience</hi> is <hi>bound,</hi> and the Cord of Iniquity <hi>imbondageth</hi>
the <hi>Conscience,</hi> and it hath not its <hi>liberty</hi> in the <hi>Service of God,</hi>
nor from the <hi>service of the Devil,</hi> because the Spirit of God
doth not exercise it; but the spirit of unrighteousness leadeth
the mind into the <hi>lusts</hi> of this world, into <hi>Lying, Swearing,
Pride, Drunkenness, Hypocrisie,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and the <hi>guilt</hi> of
these things burdeneth and presseth down, and is a <hi>bondage</hi>
upon the <hi>Conscience:</hi> and where the <hi>Conscience</hi> is bound by
<hi>unrighteousness within,</hi> and by the <hi>spirit of the world,</hi> which
leadeth contrary to the Lord, there is no power of man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
can set that Conscience <hi>free,</hi> or give <hi>liberty</hi> to it; because
the Cord of Iniquity hath bound it <hi>within,</hi> and the burden of
guilt is upon it, and <hi>Conscience</hi> lies <hi>under bondage,</hi> unexercised
with the Spirit of God, which <hi>is free,</hi> and <hi>setteth free</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
in the practice of all <hi>Good,</hi> and from the power and
captivity of all <hi>Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, before <hi>true Liberty of Conscience</hi> be <hi>witnessed,</hi> or
any have <hi>true Liberty</hi> in <hi>Conscience,</hi> Iniquity must be <hi>purged
out,</hi> and Sin <hi>crucified,</hi> and the body of Death <hi>put off,</hi> and Guilt
<hi>washed away,</hi> and the Anointing <hi>received</hi> that leadeth into all
Truth, and the Blood of Christ (the Seed) <hi>felt,</hi> that sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the Conscience from all sin, and works of the flesh, and
washeth away all that which stains and defileth the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and then the <hi>pure Conscience</hi> hath its <hi>true liberty</hi> from the
<hi>bondage</hi> of <hi>all Evil,</hi> and from the <hi>guilt</hi> thereof, and in the <hi>exercise</hi>
of <hi>all Good;</hi> and this is <hi>true Liberty of Conscience;</hi> and thus it
is attained, and by no other way nor means, than by the <hi>sword
of the Spirit of God,</hi> which cutteth down the contrary: and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56503:10"/>
where <hi>Conscience</hi> is thus freed <hi>within</hi> by the Power of the
Lord, and delivered from the <hi>bondage of Evil,</hi> and from the
<hi>burden of all guilt,</hi> and exercised <hi>in all good</hi> by the Spirit of God;
Then nothing <hi>without,</hi> nor any Power of Man, which may work
against such by Persecution, and act in <hi>opposition</hi> to such whose
<hi>Consciences</hi> are thus freed, can <hi>imbondage</hi> the <hi>Conscience</hi> to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
or bring it under a <hi>burden</hi> to Godwards, I say: for it is
not altogether <hi>bondage of Conscience,</hi> or the <hi>burden</hi> or <hi>oppression</hi>
upon his <hi>Conscience,</hi> that is set free, as aforesaid, though he is
outwardly persecuted by Men; for that doth but hinder the
exercise of his <hi>Conscience</hi> to manwards, but not to Godwards;
for there his Conscience is <hi>free,</hi> in Joy and Peace, though, by
reason of <hi>Persecution,</hi> he cannot have the exercise of it to men:
I say, though such be put in <hi>Prison, banished,</hi> or whatsoever suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
be laid upon them, by any men, or Laws <hi>without;</hi> yet
their <hi>pure Conscience</hi> is <hi>free</hi> and at <hi>liberty</hi> in it self to Godwards,
through all this, and over it all; for he Lord hath set them
free from all that <hi>bondage</hi> and <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> which hath
been a <hi>bondage</hi> upon their <hi>Consciences within:</hi> and whether
they do <hi>suffer,</hi> or have <hi>freedom</hi> or <hi>captivity</hi> in their <hi>persons</hi> from
men, yet is their <hi>pure Conscience</hi> at <hi>liberty</hi> to <hi>Godward,</hi> and in
<hi>perfect freedom</hi> in it self, and to themselves, though for the
Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Truth,</hi> they be persecuted, and all
evil done against them by evil men, and the exercise of their
<hi>pure Consciences</hi> prevented, as to manwards.</p>
            <p>For that which <hi>defiles</hi> the Conscience, doth bring it <hi>under
bondage;</hi> but that which keeps it <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>free</hi> from <hi>pollution,</hi>
that keeps it in <hi>liberty,</hi> and in <hi>perfect freedom</hi> to God, over all
Persecution and evil men, and unjust Laws, which would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
dominion <hi>in</hi> and <hi>over</hi> the <hi>Conscience</hi> of the Saints, and
bring them into <hi>captivity;</hi> as sometimes their persons are by
evil Laws and Persecutors.</p>
            <p>But who standeth in the <hi>Power of the Lord,</hi> and in the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of the Spirit of God,</hi> which <hi>freeth</hi> the <hi>Conscience</hi> in their own
particulars (as I have said) doth not come into <hi>bondage</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
to Godwards, by Laws, or Men, but enjoyeth <hi>freedom</hi>
and <hi>liberty</hi> therein; as much in <hi>Sufferings</hi> and in <hi>Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
under all the Cruelty of men, as in <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>practices</hi> when
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56503:11"/>
they are not persecuted; for in <hi>Sufferings</hi> the Conscience is
exercised, and hath its liberty in <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>forbearance;</hi> And
at <hi>liberty</hi> of persons, in practice it is <hi>exercised,</hi> and hath its
Liberty, in <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>performing</hi> whatsoever the Spirit of the
Father <hi>moveth</hi> and <hi>leadeth</hi> unto. And thus, where God hath
freed the <hi>Conscience,</hi> and it is <hi>free,</hi> and at <hi>liberty in Him,</hi> and <hi>to
Him;</hi> nothing without can bring it into <hi>bondage</hi> or <hi>captivity;</hi>
but in all <hi>conditions,</hi> and in all <hi>exercises,</hi> whether <hi>doing</hi> or
<hi>suffering,</hi> the pure Conscience is in <hi>liberty in it self,</hi> and in <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
freedom in God,</hi> through all, over all, and beyond all.</p>
            <p>But now, there hath been a great Cry among many (that
have professed Righteousness and Religion) <hi>for Freedom of
Conscience, and begging and craving from the Powers of the Earth
to <hi>tolerate Liberty of Conscience,</hi> and that they might have the
<hi>Liberty of their Conscience in Religion:</hi>
               </hi> and thus some have
been looking too much without for <hi>Liberty of Conscience from
Men,</hi> and <hi>from Powers <hi>without</hi> them,</hi> before their Consciences
were set free by the <hi>Lord <hi>within,</hi>
               </hi> and the <hi>bond of Iniquity <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi>
               </hi>
and that <hi>burden of Iniquity</hi> and <hi>Guilt <hi>done away,</hi>
               </hi> which
hath been a <hi>burden</hi> and <hi>bondage</hi> upon the <hi>Conscience:</hi> For, as I
said, no Man, nor Powers of the Earth can truly <hi>free</hi> or give
<hi>liberty to the Conscience,</hi> which is bound by the Cord of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>within;</hi> But 'tis evident, the cry for <hi>Liberty</hi> hath not been
so much for the Exercise of Conscience <hi>truly so,</hi> as for the
Freedom <hi>each one of their Sect,</hi> and for the Liberty <hi>in practice
of their own Worship</hi> and <hi>Conformity;</hi> and thereupon have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
men, of divers Sects, sought to the Powers of Men, and
of the Earth, to grant them <hi>Liberty of their Consciences;</hi> when
as it hath been rather, for the <hi>freedom to,</hi> and <hi>defence of,</hi> their
<hi>Sect,</hi> and of their <hi>practices</hi> in their <hi>Worship,</hi> than for <hi>Liberty
of Conscience <hi>truly so;</hi>
               </hi> for while they have cryed for Liberty
from <hi>without,</hi> yet Sin, and Iniquity, and Transgression have
lain upon their Conscience <hi>within,</hi> and they have sought from
Men for the <hi>Liberty</hi> of their <hi>Sect,</hi> to <hi>practise</hi> their <hi>own Worship,</hi>
which they have called <hi>Liberty of Conscience:</hi> And to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
by some hath been the Cry for <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> that
their <hi>Sect,</hi> and their own <hi>Wayes of Worship,</hi> might be <hi>defended</hi>
from the <hi>violence</hi> of others, who have opposed <hi>their Practices</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:56503:11"/>
and <hi>Worships:</hi> for people of <hi>divers ways of Worship,</hi> and <hi>of divers
Sects,</hi> have all been at <hi>strife</hi> one with another, and <hi>divided</hi> one
against another; and yet all professed <hi>good Conscience,</hi> and
cryed for <hi>Liberty</hi> thereof from the Powers of the Earth; not
but that the Powers of the Earth ought to grant <hi>free Liberty</hi> of
Conscience in the exercise of every Sect of Religion, and to
suffer all to profess and practise their <hi>Religion,</hi> while they walk
justly and peaceably in a Land: But here hath lodged the <hi>deceit</hi>
and <hi>deceivableness</hi> of the <hi>spirit of Satan,</hi> in the <hi>hearts of men,</hi>
from the <hi>least</hi> to the <hi>greatest</hi> of all those divers <hi>false Sects</hi>
and <hi>Worshippers;</hi> they have therein zealously gone on, and
pleaded for their Sects and Worship, though never so <hi>grosse</hi> or
<hi>dark,</hi> and contrary to <hi>Truth,</hi> under the denomination of <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and <hi>Liberty of good Conscience;</hi> and the very <hi>Title</hi> and
<hi>Name</hi> hath been the <hi>Colour,</hi> and deceived many, while a <hi>false
Worship,</hi> and <hi>false Practices</hi> of <hi>false Sects,</hi> have gone under the
name of <hi>Liberty of good Conscience;</hi> and thousands have been
deceived, and blindly led into such a false Sect, and into such
a Profession, to act and perform with great Zeal, false
Practices in a false Worship, falsly supposing it to be out of a
<hi>good Conscience,</hi> and that they have acted in the <hi>liberty</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
yea, and many may suffer great and grievous things, and
some the losse of their Lives, for the very <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>false
things,</hi> and <hi>false Worships,</hi> in a <hi>false Sect,</hi> and yet under the
name of <hi>good Conscience,</hi> and for <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> as they
may profess and believe.</p>
            <p>But this may seem strange to be spoken to some, who may
enquire how it comes to passe, and how this may be, that many
may suffer <hi>great</hi> and <hi>grievous Cruelties;</hi> and some <hi>the losse of
their Lives,</hi> for the <hi>practice of false things,</hi> and the <hi>exercise of
false Worships,</hi> which they may suppose to be <hi>out of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
and <hi>for good Conscience sake;</hi> whereas it is not truly
so, nor rightly so: <hi>But how happeneth this,</hi> may some say?</p>
            <p>I answer. This cometh to passe after this manner: Because
<hi>Conscience</hi> is made of <hi>that,</hi> and of the <hi>things</hi> and <hi>performances</hi>
which God requires not; and so there is a great zeal in the
<hi>doing</hi> and <hi>performing</hi> of such a <hi>Practice,</hi> and such a <hi>Worship,</hi>
when as the Lord hath not required these things at their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56503:12"/>
hands; and this is, because the Mind, and Heart, and
Conscience is <hi>dark,</hi> and not <hi>truly informed,</hi> nor <hi>guided</hi> with
the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> and of the <hi>Father;</hi> but a <hi>false Spirit</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
and leadeth the <hi>Conscience,</hi> and it is not exercised with
the <hi>Spirit of the Father</hi> that <hi>leadeth into all Truth:</hi> So I do
acknowledge that Conscience may be <hi>mis-led,</hi> and <hi>mis-guided,</hi>
and <hi>mis-informed;</hi> and Conscience may be made of <hi>doing such
and such things which the Lord doth not require,</hi> and there may
be a fear <hi>not taught of the Lord,</hi> not <hi>received by the sence of his
Presence,</hi> but only received into the heart <hi>by the Precepts of
men, Example of others, Custom of times,</hi> or the like; and here
the Conscience being not truly informed, nor guided by the
Spirit of the Lord, there is a false fear and zealousness in the
performing of such things which the Lord doth not require,
nor his Spirit lead into the practice of; but only the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Precepts of men, hath placed a <hi>false Law</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
which requires a <hi>false obedience;</hi> which many, whose
understandings are blinded, and being without <hi>true knowledge,</hi>
they zealously perform and practise as the <hi>Worship of God,</hi>
thinking themselves bound in Conscience to <hi>practise</hi> such
things, and not to leave them <hi>undone;</hi> when as the Lord,
and his righteous Spirit leadeth not to them, nor yet his just
Law doth require the doing thereof; but only a false Law and
Commandment is received by Precepts and Traditions of
men, or from looking upon the Practice of others: By such
means as this, there is a false fear in a blind mis-guided
Conscience, and a zeal without true knowledge.</p>
            <p>And thus it was amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> in the Prophets dayes,
they <hi>sacrificed their Children,</hi> and <hi>cut themselves,</hi> and <hi>caused
their Children to passe through the fire,</hi> and did many things
zealously; when as saith the Lord, <hi>Who hath required these
things at your hands? for they come not into my heart.</hi> And
<hi>Paul</hi> witnesseth the same of the <hi>Iews</hi> in his dayes, and bore
them record, <hi>that they had a Zeal, but it was not according to
True Knowledge.</hi> And thus the <hi>Iews</hi> were zealously perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, as their <hi>Duty,</hi> and as out of a <hi>good Conscience,</hi> which
the Lord required not at their hands; and so they made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to do that, which the Lord required not, and their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56503:12"/>
Consciences were <hi>mis-led,</hi> and not <hi>rightly informed;</hi> and, as it
was amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> in this case in the dayes of old, so now
is it amongst the <hi>Christians</hi> in the Apostacy, their Conscience
being mis-guided by a <hi>false spirit,</hi> they are doing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the things in <hi>great Zeal,</hi> and for the <hi>exercise</hi> of their
<hi>Consciences,</hi> which the Lord doth not require of them: Thus
do the <hi>Papists;</hi> they <hi>do</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> the things in <hi>great Zeal,</hi>
and through a <hi>false Fear</hi> in their <hi>blind Consciences,</hi> which things
are in themselves <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and not <hi>commanded</hi> nor <hi>required <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
the Lord; as in many particulars I might shew, even in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts of their Worship and Religion, which out of a <hi>Fear,</hi>
and <hi>blind Zeal,</hi> and <hi>mis-guided Conscience,</hi> they practise; which
is in it self but <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and not <hi>required</hi> nor <hi>accepted</hi> of the
Lord. And many things in relation to the <hi>Protestants</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and amongst all the several <hi>false Sects</hi> upon Earth; which
are done and practised in <hi>great Zeal,</hi> and out of a <hi>false Fear,</hi>
and as in pretence of a <hi>good Conscience,</hi> and yet are things in
themselves <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> as done and practised by them: And this
comes to passe, as I have said, because the Conscience is <hi>mis-informed,</hi>
and a <hi>false spirit</hi> guides and rules in the exercise of
<hi>Conscience,</hi> and the <hi>understanding</hi> of the People is <hi>blinded,</hi> and
they know not but they do well, though their minds are cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated,
and their <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>judgments</hi> in error; and though
there be a <hi>sincerity</hi> to Godwards, and a <hi>desire</hi> of Him in the
bottom, among some People of all Forms and Sects, and
some of all are zealous towards God in their practices, in
their Religion and Worships; yet among all People, and
the Churches that have been for many Generations, there
hath been great <hi>Error</hi> in <hi>Iudgment,</hi> and much <hi>blindness</hi> in <hi>mind,</hi>
and the <hi>Conscience</hi> falsly exercised towards God, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscription
hath been, <hi>To the Unknown God;</hi> and He hath
been <hi>ignorantly worshipped,</hi> and the Spirit of the Lord hath
not truly exercised Peoples Consciences, nor guided their
Zeal, nor been Ruler in the Judgment; And by this means
the <hi>sincerity</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> towards God hath been eaten out, and
alwayes quenched, and the bare practice of things and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Religion in the <hi>outward appearance,</hi> hath been more

            </p>
            <p>Now it may be objected, <hi>What is the only absolute Rule of
the right Exercise of Conscience; and when are Mens Consciences
truly guided?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer, The only chief and perfect Rule of the
<hi>right Exercise of Conscience,</hi> both to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>all men,</hi> is, <hi>The
SPIRIT of CHRIST:</hi> for it is only <hi>that</hi> which can
truly guide the Conscience, in <hi>Faith, Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi>
and in all things towards God; even the <hi>Spirit of CHRIST,</hi>
which is the gift of the Father, it only <hi>leadeth into all Truth,</hi>
as it is written; and all, whose Consciences are guided and
exercised by it, are in <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> in their <hi>Worship, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
and <hi>Religion;</hi> for the <hi>Spirit of CHRIST</hi> is but <hi>one</hi>
in it self, and guideth the <hi>Conscience</hi> into the <hi>exercise</hi> of <hi>one
Truth</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> and in this same Spirit is the <hi>true Union</hi>
and <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> and this is
manifest through the Scriptures; for the Apostle exhorted to
<hi>walk in the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>by it;</hi> and as many as walked by the
Rule of the <hi>Spirit, peace was upon them:</hi> and it is the <hi>Spirit of
CHRIST,</hi> the <hi>Everlasting Comforter, that teacheth all Truth;</hi>
and <hi>the Holy Anointing of the Spirit</hi> that dwelt in the Saints,
taught <hi>them all things; and they needed no man to teach them,
but as the Anointing that dwelt in them.</hi> And then are Mens
Consciences truly guided in all the wayes of Righteousness,
when the Spirit of God guideth the Conscience, and is the
Rule of all <hi>Faith, Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that <hi>Traditions of Men, Prescriptions of Councils, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of Time, Commandments of Men,</hi> nor <hi>Example of others,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:56503:14"/>
without the <hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> cannot be the <hi>onely true Rule of
the Exercise of Conscience:</hi> for all these things are change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
alterable, and subject to variations, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
infallibly guide the Conscience in the Duty towards God,
nor rightly exercise the Conscience in <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Peace;</hi> but
while a Nation, or Kingdom, or People walk by the Rule of
<hi>Traditions, Prescriptions, Commandments of Men, Example of
others,</hi> or the like, they erre in Judgment, in Faith, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Worship, and are all divided, and in Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
about these matters, because their Rule of Conscience
and Judgment is <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>alterable,</hi> and not <hi>infallible;</hi> and
therefore they have no perfect assurance of God's acceptation
to them in their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> nor perfect Peace and
Unity in their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship;</hi> But as the Rule of their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi>
in their Duty towards God is divers, some makes <hi>one
thing</hi> and some <hi>another</hi> their Rule; so are they divers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
in what they hold, profess and practise, and are but
of <hi>great Babylon</hi> in their Religion: And because that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
besides the Spirit of God exerciseth the Conscience;
therefore is it, that here are so many wayes and Sects of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and kinds of Worship in <hi>Christendom,</hi> and among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
while the <hi>Spirit of Christ only</hi> is not the <hi>Rule of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and <hi>Exercise of Conscience</hi> to God and Man; for the only
<hi>perfect Rule of Conscience</hi> in the exercise to God, is the <hi>Spirit
of Christ,</hi> and not any other thing.</p>
            <p>And now, whosoever shall persecute the Exercise of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
when guided by the Spirit of Christ, such <hi>persecute
Christ Iesus:</hi> And this is Persecution for the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi>
when Sufferings are inflicted, as Reproaches, Imprisonment,
or whatsoever, for the exercise of Conscience towards God
by <hi>his Spirit:</hi> but, and if any are persecuted for <hi>Religion-sake,</hi>
only so, if that in such their Exercise of <hi>Religion</hi> they
are not guided by the Spirit of Christ, yet that suffering is a
kind of Persecution also: If, I say, the suffering be only for,
and because of their <hi>Religion-sake,</hi> and they walk justly and
righteously as men; so that (as is signified about the middle
of this Chapter) though some may profess <hi>good Conscience,</hi>
and cry for <hi>Liberty thereof</hi> in their false Sect and Religion,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56503:15"/>
not taught them by the Spirit of Christ; yet the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
ought not to punish and use violence to such for their
Religion; but if they do, they persecute, and the Lord will
lay it to their charge. But yet this is <hi>safe</hi> for all, first to
obtain <hi>true Liberty of Conscience</hi> to Godwards, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> to be taught only by it, in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> that they may not erre in
<hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Iudgement</hi> in Spiritual matters, nor suffer
wrongfully under pretence of <hi>Righteousnesse-sake,</hi> when as
it is not truly so.</p>

            <head type="sub">Concerning the Diversity of Judgements in
RELIGION.</head>
            <p>TO all ye that are of divers Judgments and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
in, and concerning <hi>Spiritual matters;</hi> who
are divided about matters of <hi>Faith, Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
and <hi>Church-Government;</hi> some of you holding
<hi>one thing,</hi> and some <hi>another</hi> different and contrary to
that; being diversly divided in <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>heart,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the matters that are <hi>one</hi> in themselves, and to
which you all assent, as to the things in themselves,
and yet are different and contrary-minded about the
<hi>self-same things:</hi> To you all I am moved to write, that
so ye may be informed perfectly; first, What the <hi>Cause
is of your Divisions,</hi> and <hi>why it is thus amongst you:</hi>
And secondly, Of the <hi>bad Effects</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> such <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions</hi>
have brought forth: And lastly, the <hi>means</hi> and
<hi>way of Reconciliation,</hi> that ye may come into <hi>Love,</hi> and
<hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Unity with God,</hi> and <hi>one with another,</hi> in
all things pertaining to his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>First, The Cause of your Divisions, and of the
Diversities of Judgements and Opinions that are
amongst you concerning the things and matters of
God's Kingdom, is, <hi>Because you want the Spirit of
God to guide you, and it is not the Rule of your Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Iudgment;</hi> and you wanting the <hi>Spirit of
God,</hi> in which is Unity among Saints, therefore is it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56503:16"/>
you are so divided, and divers, and different, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
one to another in these things; it is, because ye
<hi>want the Spirit of God,</hi> I say, which only teacheth the
<hi>true Knowledge of God,</hi> and gives an <hi>Understanding in
all his Wayes</hi> and <hi>Matters;</hi> It is the Spirit of God
that teacheth <hi>true Faith, true Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
and all things about <hi>Church, Ministry,</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
and if that you had the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> in you,
and were taught and guided by it, it would teach you
into <hi>one Faith,</hi> and <hi>one Truth,</hi> and into the <hi>true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
and into the <hi>true Church-Government,</hi> and you
would be in <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>peace;</hi> And if you all had the
<hi>Spirit of God</hi> that gave forth the Scriptures, and by
which Spirit the Saints of God were guided in dayes
past, it would teach you into <hi>Unity,</hi> and to be of <hi>one
mind, one heart,</hi> and <hi>one soul</hi> in all the matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to God's Kingdom, in <hi>Faith, Worship, Doctrine,</hi>
and all things else; if you had the Spirit of God, I say,
and were taught by it, then you would have <hi>Unity</hi>
with <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>one with another,</hi> in all his wayes, and
there would have been no <hi>Division</hi> nor <hi>Contention</hi>
amongst you about <hi>Spiritual matters;</hi> but because you
want that, therefore you have <hi>strife</hi> and <hi>division</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you, even throughout all <hi>Christendom;</hi> Here's a
Nation and a Kingdom holding such a <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
and there's another People holding <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Worship</hi> contrary to that; and <hi>here's one</hi> Sect of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and <hi>there's another,</hi> different in <hi>Faith, Iudgment,</hi>
and <hi>Opinion;</hi> and this is a <hi>shame</hi> to whole Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that <hi>all</hi> should profess <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi>
in him, and <hi>Salvation</hi> by him, and his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and
<hi>Worship,</hi> and yet be in <hi>strife</hi> and <hi>division,</hi> and in <hi>great
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56503:16"/>
contentions</hi> concerning the same; some holding and
practizing <hi>one</hi> manner of <hi>Faith, Worship</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
and others holding <hi>contrary</hi> and <hi>different;</hi> and this
shews that ye are all fallen from the Life of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as it was held in the Apostles dayes amongst the
true Churches; for they were of <hi>one heart, mind, soul</hi>
and <hi>spirit,</hi> as it is written; they were of <hi>one Faith,</hi> of
<hi>one Worship,</hi> of <hi>one Doctrine,</hi> and hand <hi>one Way</hi> of
<hi>Church-Government;</hi> and this continued amongst the
Churches of Christ, till there were some that had <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
from the Spirit of God in their <hi>own Consciences,</hi>
and then they also erred in <hi>Faith,</hi> in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and in
all other things relating to God: And these were the
<hi>Apostate Christians</hi> that had erred from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and
<hi>divided</hi> themselves from the <hi>true Church,</hi> and <hi>differed</hi>
in <hi>Iudgment</hi> amongst themselves; and this was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had erred from the Spirit of God, which
would have kept them in <hi>unity with God,</hi> and <hi>one with
another:</hi> for the Spirit is <hi>the Bond of Peace,</hi> and the
<hi>Seal of the Covenant of Love</hi> among the Saints. So now
all ye who are divided in your <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and are in <hi>contention</hi> one with another about the
matters pertaining to God's Kingdom, you are the
<hi>Apostate Christians,</hi> and you are without the Spirit of
Christ: The first Apostate Christians erred from the
Spirit, and so became divided from the <hi>true Faith,</hi> and
from the <hi>true Worship,</hi> and also <hi>among themselves;</hi>
and you never yet received the Spirit of Christ that
you might come into <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Fellowship with God,</hi>
and one with another; and that is the reason of all
your Divisions in Religious matters, because you
have not received the Spirit of Christ, to teach you,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56503:17"/>
and to unite your hearts to God, and one to another;
but you having the Scriptures, traditionally, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
through Ages, which do describe and declare
of that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and of the <hi>Worship</hi> and
<hi>Church-Government,</hi> which were among the Saints of
old, which they held and practised, and from the
Scriptures which declare of the things, from thence
you take up a Conceit and false Judgment, and an
Imitation, and a false Conformity; and then each
sort of you call that your <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Church-Government,</hi>
and some after <hi>one manner</hi> of form, and some
after <hi>another;</hi> and thus you are divided, because you
want the Spirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures;
which Spirit did work <hi>true Faith</hi> in the hearts of them
that gave them forth in dayes of old, and it taught
them <hi>Worship, Faith, Doctrine,</hi> and all things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods Kingdom, for <hi>the Spirit led them into all Truth;</hi>
and now you wanting the same Spirit that wrought in
them, and taught them; and you having but their
words (to wit, the <hi>Scriptures</hi>) from thence, in the
Wisdom which is below, and in the carnal Reason,
and in the first mans understanding, each Nation takes
up a conceit, that it is so and so, and takes up an Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Church-Government</hi> according to
their own sensual wisdom, and according to the bredth
and depth of their Conceits; and then imitates, and
that severally and diversly, and in a divided manner;
and this is amongst <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and amongst <hi>Neighbours</hi>
and <hi>Brethren,</hi> this Division in matters of <hi>Faith, Worship</hi>
and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Church-Government;</hi> and yet all these
have had the name of <hi>Christians,</hi> and <hi>Church-Members,</hi>
and <hi>Worshippers of God,</hi> but yet are of many wayes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56503:17"/>
of Worship, holding different and contrary Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and also of <hi>Worship</hi> and
<hi>Church-Government;</hi> and thus have <hi>Nations, Cities</hi> and
<hi>Countries</hi> been for many Ages; and thus hath it been,
and is at this day amongst the <hi>Apostate Christians,</hi> that
want the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ to be their Rule, of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
of <hi>Iudgment,</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> and of their <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Practices</hi> in <hi>Religion.</hi> And this is a shame to
whole Christendom, amongst whom the spirit of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist</hi>
hath entered, which hath thus divided <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Cities, Neighbours</hi> and <hi>Brothers;</hi> for all these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
about Religion amongst the Apostate Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
are of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and not of <hi>God;</hi> it is that spirit
of <hi>Antichrist</hi> that hath wrought all these Divisions, and
planted them in the minds of People.</p>
            <p>Secondly: Concerning the <hi>bad Effects of these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
in matters of Faith and Worship,</hi> as I have said:
This <hi>Division</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> hath begotten and brought
forth very much Evil throughout the World, much
<hi>heart-burning, envy, hard-heartedness, strife</hi> and <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
between <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> and between <hi>Nations,</hi>
between <hi>Cities,</hi> between <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and between
<hi>Brothers;</hi> this <hi>Division</hi> hath wrought <hi>bad Effects</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all these; so that it hath brought forth much
War and Bloodshed between <hi>Kings,</hi> and great Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
between <hi>Rulers</hi> and their <hi>People,</hi> and great
Debate and Strife amongst <hi>Neighbours</hi> and <hi>Friends;</hi>
so that great Murders and losse of many Lives have
been produced and brought forth upon this Quarrel,
about Difference in matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi>
and <hi>Antichrist</hi> hath not only <hi>divided</hi> people in <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but hath also <hi>provoked</hi> people into <hi>rage</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56503:18"/>
to the <hi>killing</hi> and <hi>destroying</hi> of one another; and even
that Division about <hi>Spiritual things,</hi> begotten by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist</hi>
amongst <hi>false Christians,</hi> hath been turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>personal enmity,</hi> and brought forth in the end, <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering</hi>
and <hi>killing</hi> the bodies of Thousands, when the
original debate hath arisen about <hi>Church-Government,</hi>
or <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> and this is the <hi>woful Effect</hi> that
<hi>Division</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> hath brought forth in all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
And all this <hi>Fruit</hi> and <hi>Effects,</hi> as well as the
<hi>Cause</hi> of it, hath been of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and of the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>
and the <hi>Devil</hi> throughout the World; all this <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution</hi>
and <hi>spoyling of Goods, Imprisoning of Persons,
taking away of Lives,</hi> and <hi>Banishment;</hi> and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Persecution otherwise that hath risen and been
inflicted upon any, for and because of <hi>Differences</hi>
in <hi>Religion,</hi> and about <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> all this hath
been of <hi>Antichrist;</hi> and even all <hi>Laws</hi> made for that
end, and all <hi>Executors</hi> of such Laws, and all <hi>Penalties</hi>
of such Laws; and all <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Bloodshed</hi> whatsoever,
that have ensued only and upon the account of <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi>
in <hi>Religion;</hi> that being the first, and the only
<hi>ground</hi> of the <hi>Quarrel;</hi> All this hath been of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi>
and it came out of the <hi>bottomless Pit;</hi> and never
rose from the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> but from the <hi>Antichristian
spirit of Envy</hi> and <hi>Wickedness,</hi> that hath first divided
people about matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and then
provoked them to <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> stirring up Kings
to fight one against another, that was not of their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
but <hi>different</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> to it: And so the
hearts of Rulers have been stirred up to <hi>persecute</hi> all
under them, that were different and contrary in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Faith, Worship,</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> and this the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56503:18"/>
spirit of <hi>Antichrist</hi> hath effected throughout Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
and so each King that hath been strongest,
would maintain the Principles of his <hi>Faith,</hi> and the
Practice of <hi>Religion,</hi> according to his own Conceit, in
his Dominions: And thus hath <hi>Religion, Worships,</hi>
and <hi>Church-Government</hi> been set up and stood amongst
Apostate Christians throughout the World, by <hi>Force</hi>
and <hi>Power,</hi> and by <hi>violent Laws,</hi> and through <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions</hi>
and <hi>Murders;</hi> and all this hath been by the
<hi>spirit of Antichrist:</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> hath had no
hand in those matters, for the setting up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
of <hi>false Faith, false Worship,</hi> and <hi>false Church-Government;</hi>
all this hath depended upon the Powers
and Authorities of the Earth, through many Ages:
and what Religion, and Church-Government, or Way
of Worship, that Kings or Queens have set up, that
only hath been promoted; but all the rest persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and restrained by force and violence; and all this
hath been of <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now to all ye that are of divers Judgments in
matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> this is a
<hi>Caution</hi> to you all; and I do warn you all in the
presence of the living God, that though ye be divided
in the <hi>belief</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of Spiritual things, yet live in
<hi>peace</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> with all men, in all outward relations,
and do not envy nor hurt one anothers <hi>Persons;</hi> though
you are in difference about <hi>Religion,</hi> yet suffer not
that <hi>Difference</hi> to grow into <hi>persecuting</hi> or envying one
anothers persons, but seek to inform one another, and
instruct one another in the Spirit of Meekness, and
perswade one another out of that which is <hi>evil,</hi> to that
which is <hi>good,</hi> by <hi>patience, gentleness,</hi> and <hi>long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:56503:19"/>
and do not force one another by <hi>violence,</hi> nor
<hi>persecute</hi> one another, neither by <hi>words, evil-deeds,</hi> nor
<hi>actions,</hi> but live in <hi>love</hi> to the persons every one of
another; and fight not with <hi>Persons,</hi> nor kill one
anothers <hi>Persons</hi> with carnal weapons about <hi>Religion,</hi>
but take the <hi>spiritual weapons,</hi> and war with the <hi>Spirit</hi>
against the <hi>evil one</hi> in one another; and <hi>love</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
though they are <hi>enemies,</hi> and this is Christ's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
and never hereafter let your <hi>divisions</hi> about
Spiritual things grow into <hi>personal quarrels,</hi> to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
or killing one another. And this is a Charge
to you all in the presence of the living God.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The Means and Way to be <hi>reconciled</hi> and
to <hi>come out of all Division and Strife,</hi> and to <hi>come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Peace with God,</hi> and <hi>one with another,</hi> about Faith
and Church-Government, is <hi>by the Spirit of God;</hi> and
every one of you in particular must receive the Spirit
of Christ, that it may work in every one of your hearts,
<hi>true Faith,</hi> and teach every one of you the <hi>true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God,</hi> and the <hi>way of Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>true Church-Government;</hi>
it is the <hi>Spirit of Christ in every one</hi> both
<hi>male</hi> and <hi>female,</hi> that must <hi>reconcile</hi> and bring into
<hi>unity with God,</hi> and <hi>one with another,</hi> in all <hi>Spiritual
things;</hi> for it is that which is the <hi>bond of Peace and Love</hi>
among true Christians; and it is that which <hi>reconciles</hi>
peoples hearts into <hi>oneness:</hi> And if you receive that
<hi>Spirit,</hi> every particular person of you, it will bring
you to be of <hi>one Faith,</hi> of <hi>one Worship,</hi> and then your
<hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Church-Government</hi> will agree: if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>Spirit</hi> that gave forth the Scriptures, it will
work in you the <hi>same Faith,</hi> and lead you in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56503:19"/>
               <hi>same way of Worship</hi> which the Scriptures speak of, and
then you will cease taking up <hi>Conceits,</hi> and making
<hi>Imitations</hi> of <hi>Church-Governments</hi> from the Letter, but
the <hi>same Spirit</hi> will work in your hearts <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Knowledge</hi> in the fulfilling of the Scriptures; and this
is <hi>true Christianity,</hi> and the other is the way of all <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
Christians,</hi> all Imitations from the <hi>Letter</hi> without
the <hi>Spirit</hi> as gave it forth: for there is a great deal
of difference between making a Conformity in the
<hi>Imitation</hi> of a <hi>Worship,</hi> and <hi>Church-Government,</hi> from
the Scriptures <hi>without the Spirit,</hi> and between the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
teaching and leading into the <hi>same Truth,</hi> and <hi>same
Worship</hi> and <hi>Church-Government,</hi> which the Scriptures
speak of; the one is of <hi>Christ,</hi> and is in <hi>unity, peace,</hi> and
<hi>everlasting fellowship;</hi> the other is of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and is
in <hi>division, strife</hi> and <hi>contention:</hi> so you must all wait
for the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> that you may receive it, to
<hi>work</hi> in your hearts, to <hi>teach</hi> you, and <hi>lead</hi> you, or
else you will never come to <hi>true Union</hi> and <hi>everlasting
Fellowship with God,</hi> and <hi>one with another;</hi> neither can
you be of <hi>one true Faith,</hi> in <hi>one true way of Worship,</hi>
nor in <hi>one way of Church-Government,</hi> except you <hi>receive
the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>walk in the Spirit.</hi> And these be the
words of the Lord God unto you all.</p>
            <p>Now as concerning the way of Uniformity in <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Church-Government,</hi> imposed upon Nations, and
Countries and Cities, by <hi>cruel Laws</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi>
as hath been the practice through Christendom,
to cause a whole Nation and Kingdom to <hi>bow</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi>
to such Principles of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> and
<hi>Church-Government,</hi> according to the will and pleasure
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56503:20"/>
of a <hi>King,</hi> or a <hi>Ruler,</hi> such <hi>Uniformity</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> and
<hi>Fellowship</hi> among Christians hath not been of <hi>Christ,</hi>
where people have walked by <hi>Imitation,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to the <hi>Commands of Men</hi> in such a <hi>Faith,</hi> or to
such a <hi>Worship</hi> or <hi>Church-Government;</hi> this hath not
been of God, neither could this Unity stand or remain
for ever, but it hath <hi>perished,</hi> and will <hi>perish</hi> where ever
it is; and that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> and <hi>Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
which is so set up, and so held, will <hi>never save the
Soul,</hi> nor <hi>comfort it;</hi> but it is blasted of God: whilst a
Nation, or a Kingdom, or a People have <hi>Uniformity,</hi> or
hold <hi>Faith, Worship,</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> either in the <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
of their <hi>Consciences,</hi> or <hi>contrary</hi> to their <hi>Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
by the force of <hi>Mens Commandments,</hi> and not by
the <hi>perswasion</hi> of the Spirit of God in their <hi>own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;</hi>
such Conformity, I say, is of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and not
of the <hi>Father,</hi> neither can it stand in the Day of the
Lord; but the fire of his Wrath will consume it: All
the Apostate Christians in their Uniformity of <hi>Faith,
Worship,</hi> and <hi>Church-Government,</hi> which is some other
way, or by some other means, than only by the Spirit
of God, is of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and will be confounded: for
there is no <hi>true Unity</hi> and <hi>Fellowship</hi> in the <hi>Wayes of
God,</hi> and <hi>his Truth</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> but what is in the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
and that <hi>Unity</hi> will stand <hi>for ever,</hi> for it is <hi>in GOD;</hi>
not <hi>feigned,</hi> neither because of the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> of this
world, as the other is. That <hi>Uniformity</hi> in <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Worship</hi> which is <hi>forced</hi> upon People, is all but <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie</hi>
and <hi>deceit,</hi> both to God and man, and God will
judge it in the <hi>Imposers,</hi> and <hi>Imposed:</hi> Therefore no
true Unity in <hi>Faith,</hi> nor <hi>Worship,</hi> nor in <hi>Religion</hi> but
what is <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> the <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> for as <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56503:20"/>
come to divide themselves into many wayes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
divers Sects when they went from the Spirit of God,
and lost it, and whilst they have been <hi>without the Spirit</hi>
they have remained <hi>in Division, Strife,</hi> and <hi>Contention</hi>
about <hi>Religion;</hi> so now the <hi>means</hi> and <hi>way</hi> of <hi>true Union</hi>
and <hi>Fellowship,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> is by <hi>receiving the Spirit of
God again,</hi> and not any otherwise: and as Christians
are brought again to <hi>receive</hi> this Spirit, and <hi>walk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi>
all <hi>division</hi> and <hi>strife</hi> about Religion will <hi>cease,</hi> and
the cursed fruits and effects thereof will also <hi>wither</hi> and
be no more; but then <hi>Unity, Peace, Blessedness, Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Fellowship</hi> and <hi>Comfort with the Lord,</hi> and <hi>one
with another,</hi> in all his Ways, will be witnessed amongst
all People.</p>
