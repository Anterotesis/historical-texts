         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Reaſons: 1. I conceived the Queſtions touching church-government were
not rightly ſtated by moſt; and that the right ſtating of them by way of Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
would be the beſt and ſpeedieſt meanes to decide them. 2. The Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
party had neither then, nor ſince (to my knowledg) dogmatically reſolved
or diſcovered in print, what that church-government is they ſo eagerly contend
for, and pretend to be ſo plainly ſet down in the Word of God: and therefore
I conjectured ſuch <hi>Queries</hi> to be the onely meanes to diſcover and refute their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:159224:2"/>
concealed Platforme. 3. The controverſies concerning church-government,
were then and now in agitation in the <hi>Synode</hi> and high Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> the
propereſt Iudges of them; therefore I thought it better became me in point of
modeſty and good manners, to expreſſe my opinion of them by way of <hi>Queſtion,</hi>

<hi>Encomiums</hi> of it, but we muſt take all they ſay as <hi>Gospel,</hi> upon their own

<hi>tranſcendent</hi> (that I ſay not arrogant) <hi>Poſitions</hi> touching their <hi>Way;</hi> ſince I ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly

upon my twelve <hi>Queſtions,</hi> pretermitting his <hi>Impertinencies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. To the firſt <hi>Queſtion</hi> the Reſpondent gives no Anſwer at all to the things
demanded, but only miſrecites the Queſtion, without my limitations; and then
ſeemes to refute, what himſelfe propounds, not I: He ſhould have demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by direct Scriptures, <hi>That Chriſt hath preſcribed one ſet immutable forme of
Government to all Chriſtian Nations, Churches in the World, from which none
muſt vary in the leaſt degree, without ſinne, ſchiſme, or being no true Churches of
Chriſt, with whom good Chriſtians may with ſafe conſcience communicate; that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
herein is, or can be left free to humane prudence:</hi> And then have poſitively
delineated, exactly proved <hi>the modell of this pretended Government, Diſcipline,
in every particle thereof, by Gospel-Texts, ſo far as to ſatisfie mens erronious judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
conſciences herein,</hi> that ſo they might either ſubmit thereto without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
or propound their objections againſt the ſame. But in this maine point
(whereon the hinge of the controverſie turnes) the Reſpondent is wholly ſilent,
and I ſhall expect his anſwer <hi>ad Graecas Calendas.</hi> Only leſt he might ſeem to ſay
nothing, he endevours to prove, that there is a ſet forme of Church-government
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:159224:3"/>
preſcribed by Chriſt in the Goſpel, not by direct Texts, but from pretended <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities</hi>
of his owne fancying, (for which he can produce no Text nor Reaſon)
wherein he hath prevaricated, and ſhewes himſelfe <hi>abſurd.</hi>

charged him not to vary from in a tittle:</hi> (well, I grant it, becauſe you produce * two

under the Goſpel, (moſt likely in the <hi>Roman Ceremoniall</hi> and
<hi>Pontificall.)</hi> If the one conſequence be ridiculous, the other muſt needs be ſo.</p>
            <p>But to quell this your principall Argument, Firſt, <hi>the patterne in the mount</hi>
was meant onely of the materials, forme, veſſels and utenſils of the Tabernacle,
not of the Government and Diſcipline of the Iewiſh church; therefore very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to prove a ſetled Church-government, Diſcipline, under the Goſpel.
Secondly, it was ſhewed only to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>temporall Magiſtrate</hi> and chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of the Iſraelites; not to <hi>Aaron,</hi> or any private Independent Prieſt or Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
of the Iewes; yea <hi>Moſes</hi> (not they) <hi>was to make, or ſee all things made
according to the pattern in the mount; Ergo</hi> (if there be any conſequence from
this patterne) not the Independent Miniſter or congregation, but Kings, chief
temporall Magiſtrates, and Parliaments (the ſupreme civill Powers, Councels,
are likewiſe (under the Goſpell) to preſcribe and ſet up ſuch a church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as is agreeable to Gods Word: as <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, David, Solomon, Hezekiah,
Joſiah, Nehemiah, and other godly Princes, Governours,</hi> with their Parliaments or
generall Aſſemblies did under the Law: And then what becomes of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Miniſters, Congregations claimes to this Soveraigne temporall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
(a part of Chriſts Kingly office, delegated onely to Kings, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
temporall powers) which was never conferred on them? In fine, if there be
any ſuch expreſſe unalterable divine patterne of church-government under the
Goſpel, I pray informe me, why it was not as punctually, as particularly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in the new Teſtament, as the forme of the Tabernacle, of its materialls,
with all the ſervices, ornaments, appurtenances of it, and of the Temple were
under the Law? Nay, why was the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> altered into a<note n="*" place="margin">2. Chron. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

the Goſpel, and yet varied, altered ſucceſſively in this manner; then by
conſequence the Government, Diſcipline under the Goſpel is variable, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
too, and ſo not fixed, nor immutable.</p>
            <p>His ſecond Argument, <hi>That Chriſt ſhould neither be faithfull as a husband, head,
nor King of his Church, if he ſhould give others power to order it as they pleaſed to
their owne civill Government, not ſetting downe his owne Lawes for them to walke
by,</hi> is both a fallacy and abſurdity. There is no man doubts but that Chriſt in
the Scriptures (which ſome of you refuſe to heare read in <hi>our Churches,</hi> though

Rules and Lawes both for our faith and lives, either in a generall or ſpeciall
manner; but that Chriſt hath punctually and particularly ſet downe any exact
unalterable form of church-government, for all Chriſtian Nations, Churches to
follow, under pain of <hi>being unfaithfull in all the former reſpects;</hi> and that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
<hi>Modell</hi> alone is that very patterne (the onely point in queſtion) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
on your part to make good. A man may be a faithfull husband, King, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
Father, though he preſcribe not diſtinct particular Lawes, to regulate each
particular action of his Wife, Subjects, Servants, Children:<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 40</note> 
               <hi>Let all things be

excuſe Chriſt from theſe your preſumptuous reproaches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and regulate all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
though left indefinite.</p>
            <p>His third Argument, that <hi>Rev. 11. 1, 2. we read of a</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Belike the Reed by which he meaſured it was Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</note>

and <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 1, 2. of <hi>the new Jeruſalem comming downe from God out of heaven
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband; Ergo</hi> there is a ſetled divine church-government
univerſally preſcribed to all Chriſtians in the new Teſtament; is
no better a proofe of this aſſertion, then the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> is
of our Prelates Lordly hierarchy <hi>jure divino.</hi> He might as well, yea more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

form of Altars in all chriſtian Churches under the Goſpell: which I hope you
dare not averre.</p>
            <p>After theſe three <hi>Independent</hi> Arguments,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 13.</note> he pretends my third <hi>Quere</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
the firſt, becauſe I ſuppoſe a church-government may be conſonant to
Gods Word in the generall, which is not particularly preſcribed in it: A pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
fancy! As if nothing could be conſonant to Gods Word, which is not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularized
or verbally enjoyned in it: Are not our materiall churches, garments,
temporall Magiſtrates, Majors, Corporations, Parliaments, Courts of juſtice,
Laws of all ſorts, yea Feſtivals, Covenants, monthly Faſts, &amp;c. conſonant to Gods
Word, becauſe not literally preſcribed in it? Are your private church-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
unmixt Communions (as you phraſe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) erections of Independent
congregations without the licence of temporall Magiſtrates, not conſonant to
the Word in your owne opinions, though no where extant in it? If not, then
all your divine pretences for them vaniſh and you yeeld your cauſe: If yea, you
muſt then recant this pretence of a contradiction, till you are able to prove it
better then yet you have done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:159224:4"/>
Having played the <hi>Logicians</hi> and contradictors part ſo well, he next betakes
himſelf to his <hi>Anti-queries</hi> to prove a ſet church-modell: which are three.</p>
            <p>1. If no preſeript forme <hi>(of church-government)</hi> in the Word, why not Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
(eſpecially regulated and moderated) as well as Presbytery?</p>
            <p>I anſwere, if you meane it of Lordly Epiſcopacy, there are abundant preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Texts againſt it, to prove it oppoſite to Gods Word. If of moderated or
regulated Epiſcopacy, the ſame with Presbytery: if the Parliament by the Synods
advice unanimouſly eſtabliſh it, as moſt conſonant to the Scriptures, and moſt
agreeable to the civill Government, I ſhall readily ſubmit unto it without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and why not you and all others?</p>
            <p>2. If church-government be ſuited to States, whether Politicians are not more fit
to conſult about eſtabliſhing it? Why is an Aſſembly of Divines called to ſearch the
Word about it?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that my poſition is, <hi>That every church-government ought to be ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Gods Word, as likewiſe to the civill State;</hi> Therefore Politicians and Stateſ-men
are fit to be conſulted with, to ſuit it beſt to the civill State; and an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Divines, to ſquare it likewiſe by and to the Word: the true reaſon why in
this our Realme, and all other Chriſtian States (as I can abundantly manifeſt if
need be) Eccleſiaſticall Lawes and formes of government have ever been ſetled
by Parliaments, with the advice of Synods, Councells, wherein Stateſ-men and
Church-men have jointly concurred in their deliberations and votes, uſing both
the <hi>Bible</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> to ſettle it, and not throwing either of them aſide, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible,
as ignorant or lawleſſe perſons deeme them, but joyning both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To his third</hi> Anti-quere <hi>I anſwer,</hi> That it is more reaſonable the<note n="*" place="margin">But very unreaſonable that Chriſt, the Church, State, Synod, Parliament, ſhould be ſubject to your dictates, not you to theirs.</note> State ſhould be
ſubject to Chriſts rule, then Chriſt to its direction: <hi>But this</hi> Quere <hi>is quite beſides
the Queſtion, till you prove infallibly,</hi> That Chriſt hath preſcribed a ſet unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
divine government, to which all churches, Nations, States, muſt neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;
and clearly manifeſt what this Government is in all its particulars. <hi>Till this be
done the ſole queſtion is,</hi> Whether chriſtian Princes, Parliaments, States, Synods, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Goſpel, have not a lawfull power to preſcribe Eccleſiaſticall Lawes and forms of
Government, not repugnant to the Word, not to Chriſt himſelf, <hi>(as you pretend)</hi> but to
all particular churches, congregations, ſubjects under their reſpective juriſdictions? aud
whether the whole repreſentative Church and State of England in Parliament, have not
ſufficient authority by Gods law to over-rule and bind all, or any particular members or
congregations of it, as well as the major part of an Independent congregation, power to
<note n="*" place="margin">This Rule holds firm in all Church-aſſemblies, Synods, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</note> over-vote and rule the leſſer part, and to order, yea bind any of their particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?
<hi>A truth ſo clear, that no rationall man good Chriſtian or Subject can deny
it. As for the latter part of this Querie,</hi> That the Saints think Chriſt is King alone
over his Churches, and hath not left them to ſubſtitutes, and the politick conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men to be governed by; <hi>If he meanes it onely of matters of Faith, or of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
government over the ſoules of men, it may paſſe as tolerable; but if he
intends it of externall Eccleſiaſticall Government, Diſcipline, or order in the
Church, or State as Chriſtian, hee muſt renounce his Oath of Allegeance, his
late Proteſtation, Nationall Vow and Covenant, and make</hi> Rom. 13. 1, to 6. 1.
Pet. 2. 13, 14. Tit. 3. 1. 1 Tim. 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>to be Apocryphall; the Confeſſions of all

higheſt civill powers, to be Chriſts ſubſtitutes, Vicars, in point of Government,
(to whom Chriſt hath delegated his Kingly power) as truely as Miniſters are his
deputies in point of inſtruction, admonition, to whom he hath bequeathed his
Propheticall office.</hi>

thereto for the preſent, and expect a redreſſe in Gods due time. But if it be ſuch
a Government and Diſcipline, under which we may freely enjoy the ſincere and
powerfull preaching of the Word, the due adminiſtration of the Sacraments,
and all other Ordinances of God neceſſary for our ſalvation and edification, (as
we may doubtleſſe do under a Presbytery, and that government our pious Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament

binds not all Independents to be ſimply of their opinion, unleſſe the reaſons and

               </hi> not anſwering one ſyllable to
the ſubſtance of the Queſtion. To which I reply: Firſt, that the title of <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency</hi>
(of which you are now aſhamed) was at firſt aſſumed, approved by
your ſelves, and many of your party doe ſtill owne, though ſome diſclaim it, of
purpoſe to evade the titles of <hi>Separatiſts</hi> and <hi>Browniſts,</hi> with whom you really
concurre in practice: Beſides, you very well know that this title was impoſed
on, and owned by you long before I writ; therefore I could not father this
brat upon you: But if you be offended with this name, I deſire you in your next
Pamphlet to diſcover to us your owne Chriſtian name, with the true title of
your party, and the government you plead for as the only way of Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
(all which you have hitherto concealed) and then (God willing) I ſhall
give you a further anſwer to this cavill, or retract this title; till then I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
you that it moſt proper for your party, who will have every of
your owne private congregations, a complete abſolute corporation, exempted
from; unſubjected to independent on any other, be it a Nationall Synodall, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall,
Parochiall aſſembly, Parliament or Kings themſelves in any

this your ſuitable name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you object, firſt,</hi> That you are accountable for your actions to every neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Church, that ſhall in the name of Chriſt require it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That you ſtand
not independent from, but hold communion with all other Churches, both in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
and in asking counſell and advice mutually.</p>
            <p>To the firſt I anſwer, 1. That if you are accountable for your actions to every
particular neighbour Church, then why not much more to a Synod or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whoſe eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction over you or your Churches is denied by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:159224:9"/>
you? Secondly, if you are thus accountable to every neighbour Church, doe
you intend it of Parochiall, Epiſcopall, or Presbyteriall Churches, as well as
Independent; or of Independent onely? If of Independent onely, as I ſuppoſe
you doe, then you appeale onely to Churches of your owne partie, frame,
judgment, and make one of them ſubordinate, accountable to another, but not
to any other Church; which is an apparent ſchiſme, ſeparation from all other
Churches, and contradicts your ſecond objection: If of all other ſorts of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
as well as Independent, you muſt either grant them true Churches of
Chriſt, and then you have no ground to ſever from them; or if falſe, or no
true Churches of Chriſt, (as you in truth repute them) then by your own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
they are no competent Iudges of Eccleſiaſticall affaires, nor you accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to them. Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How (I pray) doe you hold your ſelves accountable
to every neighbour Church? by way of ſubordination, or correction? that I am
certain you will deny: or only by way of voluntary information and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when required, which I conceive you mean? If ſo only, then this is properly
no account at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or but arbitrary at moſt, which you may deny if you pleaſe;
and if you erre or prove faulty, this neighbour Church can but admoniſh, not
enforce you to correct your errours or injuſtice: and ſo this will prove but a
meere mockery in ſtead of an account.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond I anſwer, <hi>That if you ſtand not Independent from other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
but hold communion with them in Ordinances, and in mutuall counſell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
Then 1. why doe you ſeparate from them as no true Churches, and oppoſe
their way of Government with ſo much bitterneſſe? Secondly, why doe you
refuſe to adminiſter Baptiſme and the Lords Supper to thoſe who are their
members, in your Churches, unleſſe they be profeſſed members of ſome Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Congregation? Thirdly, why do you not follow their advice, counſell,
or the Parliaments, Synodes, and ſubmit thereto; who now earneſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
you from your way of ſeparation, diviſion, in theſe diſtracted times? the
end of demanding good counſell and advice being but to follow, not reject it,
where there is humility, ingenuity, or ſincerity in thoſe who aske it. You muſt
therefore either diſclaime theſe objected conceſſions, or become more tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the future. 4. You tell us in the next ſucceeding lines, <hi>That neither I,
nor Synods, nor this Synod, are infallible, but as ſubject to errours as others;
and that never</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Yea, never more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous errours refuted, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, then in the 4. firſt general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and ſome Synods ſince, as that of <hi>Dort,</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Synods in the <hi>Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> Where therefore they determine rightly, you muſt ſubmit unto them; where they confirm appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous errours, there you may vary from them when proved ſuch.</note> 
               <hi>more dangerous errours have been confirmed then by Synods: and
therfore men are not bound in conſcience to their decrees upon penaltie of ſinne, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy,
&amp;c.</hi> But pray Sir may not you and your Independent Miniſters Churches
erre as well as others? Is infallibility annexed onely to your private Chaires,
conventicles? If not, then why may not your new-minted <hi>Way</hi> be a meere
erronious <hi>By-path,</hi> and no way of Chriſt as well as other waies, and you erre
herein as well as Synods in other things? Why will you have the major vote in
your congregationall deciſions to over-rule and bind the reſt to obedience; (as
your practice and opinions intimate) ſince the major part may poſſibly be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
as well as the leſſe diſſenting? Shall nothing binde in any Churches, but
what is unanimouſly voted <hi>nemine contradicente?</hi> or ſhall one or two diſſenting
voices over-rule the reſt, or not be bound by the moſt? or where all conſent
may not all yet be in an errour, and not diſcerne it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through ſelfe-love to their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:159224:9"/>
owne wayes and opinions, till others of contrary judgements diſcover and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them of their errour? Away then with this fond argument and evaſion;
Synods and Parliaments may erre in ſome things, <hi>Ergo</hi> they muſt binde us in
no thing: Is this good Logicke or Divinity? Good Miniſters may and
doe erre ſometimes in ſome points of Divinitie, <hi>Ergo</hi> wee will beleeve
them in none, no not in thoſe things in which they doe not erre. Will
you throw away all the Apple becauſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> one part of it only is rotten? or reject
Communion with the beſt of men becauſe they have ſome infirmities? Deal then
with the Eccleſiaſticall decrees of Synods and Parliaments as in wiſdome, in
conſcience you are bound to doe: Where they are juſt, equall, not oppoſite to the
word, embrace, ſubmit unto them; when erronious or contrariant to the expreſſe
word (not to your own fancies, inferences or opinions) you may differ from them
in judgment, but you muſt patiently ſuffer under them in point of practiſe &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
(if meerly practicall) till a further ſeaſon, and not diſturb the Churches peace
by oppoſition or ſchiſm: which is as good, as ſeaſonable Chriſtian advice, as that you

without diſpute; &amp; ſo they breed no contrariety of opinions or diſaffection: but each
different Church deems the other unlawful, &amp; in no way of Chriſt ſo as they cannot
with ſafe conſcience joyn or communicate together; and thereupon they fever one
from another. 2. Every ſeveral trade and ſociety, even in their very trade is ſubject
to the general Government, Laws of the City &amp; Realm wherin they are to which
they appeale and have recourſe upon all occaſions of difference, none craving an
exemption or Independency from the whole Corporation, Parliament or ſupream
Magiſtrate in matters which concern their government, but deriving their Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
Charters, Laws and priviledges from them: which ſubordination keep:
them all in peace and unity. But Independent Churches deny any ſubordination,
ſubjection to the Eccleſiaſticall Lawes and Edicts of Parlements, of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Magiſtrates or Synods, and will be regulated, obliged onely by their own
peculiar Edicts: which muſt needs occaſion infinite Schiſmes and diſorders:
therefore the caſes are far different from one the other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſtians, as Chriſtians, are all of one and the ſelf-ſame ſociety and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
as thoſe of one Trade or Calling are; therefore they ſhould have all but
one common Church and government, as theſe Trades have: To ſet then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon

and one would have one forme of government, another another, and
thereupon divide themſelves into ſeverall conventicles and petty meetings in
corners, not at their common hall, and one chuſe one Government, Maſter, or
Warden, another another, and ſo ſever the company, and continue indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
this (no doubt) would prove an apparent ſchiſme, and ſeminary of infinite
diviſions, to the diſtraction, deſtruction of the whole Company and Fraternity.

I meane the promiſcuous multitude of the Land, yea of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
power then ever Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe had, at leaſt then ever he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed;
For as <hi>dare Regem,</hi> argues a greater power then <hi>eſſe Regem;</hi> as hee that

be beleeved, and what not, is a branch of a greater root of power, then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of the power that is committed to others in this behalfe. Now though
Ieſus Chriſt had a power, and was authorized by God to be a Law-giver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
unto his Churches and Saints in their ſpirituall Republike, yet it is hard
to prove, that he ever he inveſted any other with ſuch a power: His Apoſtles
themſelves were no Lords over the faith of the Saints, nor had they anie
power or authoritie to impoſe any thing upon men, as<note n="†" place="margin">Every Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, have power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>join what is neceſſary to be beleeved, practiſed, by or according to Gods Word, not without or contrary to it.</note> neceſſarie either to

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſumme of this large paſſage is, that there is not onelie an improbabilitie,
but abſolute impoſſibilitie that the Parliament ſhould have any power at all
to enact Lawes and Statutes in matters of Religion, church-government,
Gods worſhip or ſervice, becauſe the people who elect them have no ſuch
power, and ſo an impoſſibilitie of deriving any ſuch authoritie to them; and to
affirme the contrarie, is not onely to awake the eyes of jealouſie upon them,
but exceedingly deſtructive to, and undermining of not onely their power; but
honour, peace, and ſafetie alſo. Whether this be not directly to undermine
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:159224:12"/>
the authority of Parliaments and temporal Magiſtrates in all church-affairs and
matters of Religion, contrarie to your late Covenant and Proteſtation, and that
in the moſt tranſcendent maner that ever any have hitherto attempted in print,
let all wiſe men judg: I am ſory ſuch <hi>ill paſſages</hi> ſhould fall from ſo good a pen.</p>
               <p>But to give a ſhort Anſwer to this <hi>extravagant diſcourſe:</hi> Firſt, this objection
might be made againſt the <hi>generall Aſſemblies, Parliaments, Kings of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
who</hi>

Religion, and Gods worſhip, with his approbation, without any ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
as I have elſewhere proved. Secondly, God himſelf (as I formerly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched)
uſed the miniſtry, aſſiſtance of <hi>Cyrus, Artaxerxes, Darius,</hi> with other heathen
Princes and Magiſtrates, for the building of his Temple, and advancement of his
worſhip, for which they made <hi>Decrees, Statutes;</hi> notwithſtanding this objected rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

by externall profeſſion. Thirdly, moſt Chriſtian Kings and Magiſtrates in the
World, (even thoſe who claime to be hereditary, as the yet continued formes of
their Coronations and inſtalments manifeſt) come in by the peoples election, as
well as ſuch members of Parliament who are eligible, yet you cannot without
diſloialty and abſurdity, deny them authoritie in matters of Religion and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government.
Fourthly, your ſelfe doe not onely grant, but argue,<note n="b" place="margin">Page. 25, 26</note> 
                  <hi>That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
private man hath, yea ought to have power to elect and conſtitute his own Miniſter:</hi>
and no doubt you will grant, that private men have power likewiſe to ſet up inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Congregations, which have authority to preſcribe ſuch Covenants,
Lawes, and Rules of Government, Diſcipline, Worſhip, as themſelves think moſt
agreeable to the Word: If then they may derive ſuch an Eccleſiaſticall authority
to independent Miniſters and Churches, why not as well to Parliaments and
Synods likewiſe by the ſelf ſame reaſon? Fifthly, it is cleare by ſundry inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Scripture, and your owne Text, that God doth oft times make uſe
of unſanctified perſons, and the rude multitude, (whom you ſo much under-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue)
to advance his glory, propagate his Goſpel, promote his Worſhip, vindicate
his Truth, and edifie his Church: He can poure a ſpirit of propheſie upon<note n="c" place="margin">Num. 22. 35 c. 23, &amp; 24. 1 Sam. 10. Act. 5. 34 to 40 Joh. 11. 49, to 53.</note> a

                  <hi>Judas</hi>
an Apoſtle, yea <hi>ſend him to preach</hi> and build his Church, as well as a <hi>Peter:</hi> Wee
read in the Evangeliſts, that none were ſo <hi>forward as the vulgar</hi>

                  <hi>multitude to
beleeve, follow, profeſſe Chriſt, and embrace the Gospel, though many of them did it out
of ſiniſter ends.</hi> Therefore they may well have power to chuſe ſuch perſons who
ſhall and may make Lawes to promote the Goſpel, and Government of the
Church of Chriſt. Sixthly, thoſe who have no skill at all in Law, Phyſick, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,
have yet judgment and reaſon enough to make choice of the beſt
Lawyers, Phyſitians, Architects, when they need their help. Thoſe who are unfit,
or unable to be members of Parliament themſelves, (as moſt of the electors are)
have yet had wiſdom enough in all ages, and eſpecially at this preſent, to elect the
moſt eminent &amp; ableſt men for ſuch a ſervice: Thoſe who are unmeet to be Kings,
Magiſtrates, Commanders, or Miniſters, have yet skill enough to chuſe able per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for ſuch offices, &amp; power to delegate to them ſuch Parliamentary, Royall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſteriall,
Paſtorall authority, as is neceſſary for their ſeverall offices, which thoſe
who elected them never had actually, but onely originally or virtually in them,
not to uſe, but derive them unto others: why then may not our free-holders, who
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:159224:13"/>
have voices in electing the members of our Parliaments, and the Commonalty to
the Land, (whom you ſcandalouſly terme, <hi>the vileſt and moſt unworthy of men,</hi>
though there be a degree of vulgar people viler and unworthier then they in all
reſpects, who have no votes in ſuch elections) have ſufficient authority
in them to elect and nominate ſuch fitte, perſons, who by virtue of ſuch
nomination or election ſhall have right and power to enact Lawes, Statutes, in
matters of Religion, Worſhip, and Church-government, not diſſonant from
Gods Word, to which themſelves and others by Gods owne ordinance muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit?
If the common people, who neither are nor can be Parliaments, Emperors,
Kings Judges, Magiſtrates, Miniſters, have yet a lawful power to make others ſuch
by their bare election &amp; to give them ſuch authority and power as themſelves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
actually were or can be poſſeſſors of, then why by the ſelf, ſame reaſon may they
not likewiſe delegate a lawfull Eccleſiaſticall legiſlative authority in church-affairs,
to their elected Parliamentary and Synodall Members, which was never actually
in themſelves, as well as Mr<note n="*" place="margin">This he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and appeared by a writing before the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Miniſters.</note> 
                  <hi>Goodwin</hi> delegate the power of determining who
ſhould be fit perſons to receive the Sacrament, and to become members of his
independent Congregation, to eight ſelect ſubſtitutes, which was never actually
veſted in himſelfe, nor transferrible thus to others by any Law of God or man?
why may <hi>not a man bring an eccleſiaſtical or ſpiritual extraction out of a ſecular root,</hi>
(contrary to your Paradox) as<note n="*" place="margin">Or as well as himſelfe extracts many ſpirituall Doctrines out of Gamaliels ſecular ſpeech in theſe very ſermons.</note> well as a <hi>Regall, Magiſteriall, Parliamentall, M<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall</hi>
extraction, out of a meere popular or ſervile root? or the beſt ſtrong
waters out of the vileſt Lees; the richeſt Minerals out of the courſeſt earth? the
moſt orient Pearles out of the baſeſt Oiſters? In one word, the very choice <hi>theſe
your vileſt and moſt unworthy of men</hi> have made this Parliament, may for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
this childiſh reaſon, the corner-ſtone of your <hi>Independent fabricke,</hi> faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together with independent crochets, unable to abide the teſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
notwithſtanding this your reaſon, our preſent Parliament may and ought, in
point of right &amp; duty to make binding Laws for regulating church-government,
reſtraining hereſies, ſchiſmes, innovations, erronious doctrines, unlawfull conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and for ſetling the purity of Gods worſhip and Religion, notwithſtanding
this objection; and with as much reaſon, juſtice, raiſe, and eſtabliſh a new church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government,
ſuitable to Gods Word and the civill State, as reforme or repeale
the old, (which grew to burden ſome and offenſive) till Independents can ſhew us
better grounds againſt it then any yet produced: and informe us, why our whole
repreſentative Church and State ſhould not of right enjoy and exerciſe as great or
greater eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, over all particular perſons and Churches who
