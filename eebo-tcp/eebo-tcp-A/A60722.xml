         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>POPE <hi>Iulius</hi> the Second, was a <hi>Genoway</hi> Born;
and though at first a Wherry, or Water-man,
(as <hi>Erasmus,</hi> Writing on the Proverb, <hi>A remo
ad Tribunal,</hi> Reporteth) yet by the help of his
Oar, did he pull up to the <hi>Popedom,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>Admiral</hi> of the <hi>Red See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and those many
<hi>Waters</hi> mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 15. whereon <hi>The Scarlet Whore
of Babylon</hi> sitteth. <hi>Iohn Functius</hi> in his Commentaries
Writeth thus of him:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> being born of a base Stock, rising by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
through good Fortune, and crafty Wit, attained
to the highest; he being a Fellow of a subtil and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and most given by Nature to play the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37343:3"/>
Warriour, did like <hi>Nimrod,</hi> enlarge his Portion by the
Dint of the Sword: So that by his procurement within
the space of 7 Years, were slain and destroyed to the
Number of 200000 Christians.</q> To this purpose Wrote
one <hi>Hulricus Huttenus</hi> an <hi>Epigram</hi> in Latin; Englished
thus, by a Gentleman several Years ago:
<q>
                  <l>Why goeth <hi>Julius</hi> in Steel,</l>
                  <l>And in his Coat of Plate?</l>

                  <l>Vpon his Bushy Pate.</l>
                  <l>Whose frounced Forehead hideth deep,</l>
                  <l>His loathsom streaming Eyes;</l>
                  <l>From whence (with Hell-hounds threatning looks)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <l>The Sparks of Wild-fire flies.</l>
                  <l>He's Terrour unto Western men,</l>
                  <l>By Sea and eke by Land;</l>
                  <l>With bitter Bows, and bloody Bills,</l>
                  <l>And shaking Sword in hand;</l>
                  <l>That unto all the Kings on Earth</l>
                  <l>Hath wrought such Warlike harms;</l>
                  <l>And is a Scourge to th' World, which he</l>
                  <l>Hath raised up in Arms.</l>
                  <l>The Author of such manglings made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To the same purpose Wrote one <hi>Dulcherius,</hi> thus:
<q>
                  <l>Whilst <hi>Julius</hi> (to Mischief fram'd)</l>
                  <l>Did Bloody War prepare,</l>
                  <l>He marched forth in armed Hand,</l>
                  <l>His Weapon thus he bare.</l>
                  <l>A Sword hung by his Side, which out</l>
                  <l>Couragiously he drew,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keys into the deep</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Tyber</hi> Flood he threw;</l>
                  <l>With Blustering thus; <hi>Since</hi> Peter'<hi>s Keys</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>In War cannot prevail,</l>
                  <l>Then with the Sword of <hi>Paul</hi> we will</l>
                  <l>Our Enemies assaile.</l>
               </q>

This <hi>Iulius</hi> was a Man (or rather a Beast) not only gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
excessively to the Desire of Women, but to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Lust, which (tho in his <hi>Holyness</hi> was no Sin, or at
most, <hi>venial)</hi> in a Lay-man might be reputed <hi>deadly.</hi> For
(as the Masters of <hi>Paris</hi> in a Commentary report) he did
usually commit the abominable Sin of <hi>Sodomy,</hi> with Two
Young Noble Men, whom <hi>Ann</hi> Queen of <hi>France</hi> had sent
to one Cardinal <hi>Robert Nevetensis</hi> to be educat. The
same is reported of him by several other Authors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Conradus Gabriel,</hi> wrote these Two Verses.
<q>
                  <l>Venit in <hi>Italiam</hi> spectabilis indole rara,</l>
                  <l>Germanus, redit de puero Mulier.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It were intollerable to write down all the Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and Filthy ways, how this <hi>Monster of Men</hi> defiled
his Body: And the inferiour Clergy (in Imitation of their
infallible Father like wandring Stars of Apostacy) borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Darkness of his wicked Deeds; conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves to his Godless Life and Conversation, in all
manner of Filthiness, impudently working such Villanies,
as ought not to be named among Christians, starting gross
and irreverent Questions, concerning the Incarnation of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and the Conception of the <hi>B. Virgin.</hi> Of this Tribe
was one <hi>Ptolomeus Lucersis</hi> a Monk, who ar <hi>Mantua</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such Doctrine, that the Mid-Wives in Church could
hardly be detained from pulling him to pieces.</p>
            <p>Now this Pope (at great Expence) keeping a Court to
<hi>Venus,</hi> and a Camp to <hi>Mars,</hi> with an Army, the number
whereof was <hi>as the Sand of the Sea,</hi> his Revenues (tho in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
great) were not sufficient to bear out his Pomp,
and make good his Quarrels, against the greatest part of
the Christian World, without improving the Market of
his Ecclesiastick Trade: Therefore reduced to good (or
rather damnable) order, the Rates of his Carnal, yet Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

of every particular Dispensation, for the Profit (as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)

the Clargy to a single life. This last decree of Adultery was
much opposed by the Clargy; and especially the foresaid
<hi>Huldericus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Augusta,</hi> who in the fore mentioned

If he had said <hi>of Men;</hi> Then he had been in danger to be

at <hi>Maguntia,</hi> he utterly condemned the Marriage of the
Clargy. But immediately after this Councel, <hi>Brazutus</hi> the
Famous Poisoner (who is reported to have poisoned Seven
Popes, in 13 Years space, by the Advice of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> and
<hi>Theophilactes)</hi> by a deadly doze sent him to another World

kick'd at her Commands, resolved to daunt and spurn him
to a more sober Course, and with the Rods of cursing and
Exercration (like a loving old Mother) to whip or rather
lash him, to a filial Subjection. Therefore Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi>
the Second, who came to the Popedom <hi>Anno</hi> 1058. clothed
himself with Imprecations, and took the Thunderbolt of
Damnation in his Mouth, and with the <hi>Hobgoblings</hi> of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
frightned the hoodwink'd World out of their

               <p>Now altho <hi>Hilderand</hi> had a sufficient gap to pass to the

Clouds of Inconvenience hanging over his Head, but screw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one <hi>Alexander</hi> into <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, a Cipher and Simple
man, under whom he acted all things, in as full power as if
he had been <hi>Pope</hi> himself. But Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> perceiving
that he was but a Sconce to <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who used him as a
Smith doth his Tonges, and that he was put in to spite the
<hi>Emperour,</hi> who had Elected one <hi>Otho</hi> an <hi>Antipope</hi> (whom

this sell a mumbling Cursing and Damning <hi>His Holiness;</hi> so
that he could scarce forbear boxing of him till Mass was done.
No sooner was Divine Service over, but <hi>Hildebrand</hi> with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

Blocks removed, he set forwards for the Popedom;
and first by false Accusations Imprisoned <hi>Alexander,</hi> who

                  </hi> Elected Pope, before <hi>Alexander</hi> was put in his

considering with himself, that he could not
pinch the Clergy to fill his own Pockets so well, whilst
they had Wives and Children, as when they had none to
provide for but themselves; he Prosecuted the married
Priests, with all manner of Curses and Excommunications,
forcing all Clergy-men, without exception, to live single,
or lose their Benifices. Whilst he himself liv'd in Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with <hi>Mathilda,</hi> Lady to the Marquess of <hi>Esta,</hi> whom

               <p>
                  <hi>Now the Description of this Pope, or Blasheamous</hi>
Necromancer, <hi>is beyond the reach of my Pen, only take
this of</hi> Beno <hi>the Cardinal;</hi> How he lived; how he drave the
Cardinals from him; how he tormented them miserably; how he
Poysoned the World with Heresies; how he committed Perjury;
how great and many Conspiracies he raised; it is hard for many
to utter: But most of all, the Blood of many Christians (which
by him, and his means, hath been miserably shed) doth cry out
for Vengeance on him.</p>
               <p>But Pardon me, to hold out this <hi>Gregory</hi> in some Pranks
which he committed; the Parallels whereof, can hardly
be found in Writing.</p>
               <p>This Pope was the greatest Sorcerer and Necromancer
of his Age; and (as <hi>Beno</hi> the Cardinal writeth) could
when he listed, cast off his Sleeves, and skip and dance in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37343:11"/>
the form of Flames and Sparkles of Fire, in the sight of
men; by these Miracles deluding the simple to confide in
his Holiness: And going out to Battle against the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
(as the King of <hi>Israel</hi> sent to the God of <hi>Eckron)</hi> went
to his Domestick God, that dwelt in a Brazen Head, in his
Closet; and Inquired what should be his Success in the
War: But the Spirit giving him an Ambiguous Answer,
whereof he could make but little Sense, and wherein he
could put no Confidence; he took the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper (his Imaginary Transubstantiate Deity,
which he thought was a God of his own making, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bound to serve him) and set it on a Table, conjuring
it for a response as he had <hi>Baalzebub</hi> a little before. But
the Bread making no Answer, <hi>his furious Holiness</hi> pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it up in Passion, and (in presence and spite of his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals)
threw it in the the Fire, with these Words: <hi>There
is a God indeed, could the Idol Gods of the Heathens give them
Answer, in there Success, and canst thou give me none,</hi> &amp;c.
The Romish Clergy grumbled much at the Affront, and
that he should have burned the God which they made, and
ordained to be Eaten; therefore <hi>Iohn,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Portua,</hi>
(as <hi>Beno</hi> reporteth) who was of <hi>Hildebrand's</hi> Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
for an Apology before the People and Clergy, in St.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, in a Sermon, spoke thus; <hi>What mean<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>This</hi> Hildebrand <hi>was the Sworn Enemy of the Emperor</hi>
Henry <hi>(who at first was not submissive enough, but strove
to stop the current of</hi> His Holiness'<hi>s Pride, and reputed
himself almost equal with the Pope) therefore Invented
and Contrived many Unlawful means, as Poysoning, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,
Murdering,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to put him to an End. And to
this purpose Writeth</hi> Beno <hi>the Cardinal, thus;</hi> The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
used to go to Prayers, to St. <hi>Marys</hi> Church, in <hi>Aventine</hi>
Hill: <hi>Hildebrand</hi> therefore, by his false Spies, caused the
place to be well noted, where the Emperor used to Kneel, or
Sit im the Church, all Service time, and hired one to lay great
Stones secretly in the roof of the Church, right over the same
place; in such manner as he could cunningly throw them down
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37343:11"/>
upon the Emperors Head, and so Slay him: But as this Fellow
was busie with a great Stone, the Weight thereof overturned him,
so that he fell down to the Pavement, with the Stone upon
him, and died by that Mischief which he had contrived to Slay
the Emperor. This Treason being discovered to the Romans, they
bound his Heels to a Rope, and drew his dead Carcass through
<hi>Rome,</hi> three days togeteer for an Examlpe.</p>

they were Convicted, or Confessed their Crime, and caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to be hang'd up, without the Consent or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of any Secular Judge: He put <hi>Centius,</hi> a Senator's
Son, and his own Special Friend in Prison, without any
cause, but Jealousie and Suspition, and caused him to be
Tormented and Rolled, in a Barrel of sharp Nails, till he
was almost Dead: But <hi>Centius</hi> (making his escape) sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
and apprehended <hi>Hlldebrand,</hi> and might have been
revenged on him, but that <hi>His Holiness</hi> Swore deep and
bloody Oaths, that he would not only Pardon him, with
all his Assistants and Followers, but likewise pay him a
Ransom: Which the credulous Young Man believing, set
him at Liberty. But immediately <hi>his forsworn Holiness,</hi> not
mindful of his Oath, caused <hi>Centiues,</hi> and nine of his
Tribe, to be hanged up, and all the rest to be Banished;
and among them the Son of a poor Widow, who after the
Year of his Banishment was expired, did return home, and
to expiate the Pope's Imprecations, and vindictive Passion,
was led by his poor mourning Mother to <hi>Gregory,</hi> with a
Halter about his Neck, in Token of Repentance, Sorrow,
and Submission, earnestly desiring <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> cordially to
take and Pardon him, and restore him again to her, a new
purg'd Man. But his Implacable Holiness (who had no
Grace to forgive) commanded him to be hanged up before
his Mother. But the Justices denying to put this second
Pennance in Execution, and telling him obscurely, that his
<hi>Holiness</hi> was destitute both of Mercy and Justice; <hi>Gregory</hi>
caused his right Foot to be chopp'd off, whereby within
five days he dyed, to the great grief and sorrow of his poor
old Mother. On these, and many such charitable Deeds

This Pope died <hi>Anno</hi> 1125. and left his Quarrel against
the Clargy, to his Successor <hi>Honorius</hi> the Second; who sent
a Riotous Cardinal, one <hi>Iohn Cremensis,</hi> into <hi>England, Anno
1125.</hi> who held a Synod in <hi>London,</hi> and Condemned all
the Married Clargy of Adultery; yet <hi>the Holy Lord Legat</hi>
himself was that Night taken in the very Act of Adultery;
and yet Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> wrote on his behalf, to the Clargy
of <hi>England,</hi> thus:</p>
               <p>We Desire, Charge and Command you, to receive this <hi>JOHN,</hi>
as the Vicar of Saint <hi>PETER,</hi> with Reverence; hear him
with Humility, and at his Commandment be Assistant at his
Synods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a certain Statute made in this Synod, held
at <hi>London,</hi> by this <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Holy Vicar of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> to
this effect: <hi>We by our Apostolical Authority, Command, that
Priests, Deacons, Sub Deacons, Cannonists, shall not come in
Company with their Wives, Concubines, or any other Women,
except their Mother, Sister, or Aunt, or such Women as may
altogether give no Suspition: and who shall break this shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
his Orders. We also Command, that no Marriage shall be
made, between Kindred or Affinity, to the Seventh Degree.</hi>
This Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> died <hi>Anno</hi> 1130. and his Successors
being busied in Crowning, Cursing, Excommunicating,
and Deposing Emperors and Kings, of their Empires, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and Estates, in raising Armies, denouncing War,
and shedding Christian Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> several of the Clargy
had received the Unlawful Sacrament of Matrimony, and
liv'd quietly with their Wives and Children; the Pope
only now and then giving them an <hi>Item</hi> of their Obstinacy
and Error: till Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the Third came to the
Popedom, <hi>Anno</hi> 1198. This is that mischievous <hi>Innocent,</hi>
who (for an old spite) Deposed the Emperor <hi>Philip,</hi> and
gave his Empire to <hi>Otho,</hi> whom (without just cause) he
Cursed, Excommunicated, and Deposed, discharged all
his Subjects of their Allegiance, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd gave his Crown and

                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:37343:13"/>
Cursed, Condemned, and Excommunicated <hi>Iohn</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1215 he called a Councel at <hi>Lateran;</hi> where (after
he had Excommunicated and Deposed the Emperor, for
suing for some of his own Cities, which the Pope had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyn'd
to the Holy Chair) he Condemned one <hi>Almericus,</hi>
a Learned Man, for an Heretick, and commanded his Bones
to be burn'd, with the rest of his <hi>Sect</hi> at <hi>Paris;</hi> because
(as saith <hi>Dominicus Soto) he had Preached against Images:
And thus (saith one) Pope</hi> Innocent <hi>was Iudg both of the quick
and the dead;</hi> contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12. he wrested out
Auricular Confession, and deprived the Laity of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Cup:</hi>
He commanded the Quarrels of Princes to be
brought before him, and by him to be decided: He Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that the Communion-Cake should be kept in a Box
in the Church; and that when the Priest should visit the
Sick, he should go with a burning Taper, and a Bell before
him: He ordained the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Mass,</hi> to be reputed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
in Authority with the Holy Scriptures; and that the
Pope should have power to correct and controul Princes;
and that none should be Emperor, but he that were Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Vniversal Bishop of Rome.</hi> Among many other
Ambitious and Nonsensical Decrees, he Condemned and
Anulled the Marriage of the Clargy for ever. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
that this <hi>Innocent, Anno</hi> 1212. went about to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
three great Designs, <hi>viz.</hi> The Deposing of <hi>Otho,</hi> a
Voyage to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the holding of a <hi>General Councel.
Also the same Year</hi> (saith <hi>Vlricus Mutius) certain Noble-men
of</hi> Alsatia <hi>did condemn this Pope of Impiety; because be would
not suffer the Clargy to keep their Wives; and the Bishops burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Hundred Clargy-man in one day; because they taught,
That Christians might lawfully eat Flesh, and Marry at any
time.</hi>

                  <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> (who it seems had been a great
sinner) was enveigled by the Romish Clargy, to give up
his Kingdom and all his Dominions to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could purchase his Salvation from Pope <hi>Innocent:</hi>

When Pope <hi>PAUL</hi> had seen certain Latine Verses, written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him and his Daughter; it is reported that he wept, and
cried out against the hardness of the Law of single Life, among
his Friends; because that he who ought to have been not only the
Head of the <hi>Church,</hi> but also of <hi>Chast Life,</hi> should see his
Daughter live in the Face and Countenance of the City, with
great shame and disdain, who although she was very Beautiful,
yet it grieved his Heart, that it should be said that he begat her
in Whoredom, because he knew that there was a Law of God,
whereby she might have been Born in Wedlock, unless the Law of
single Life had disanull'd it. They say therefore that he took Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
how he might restore again the Marriage of the Clargy; but
being prevented by Death he could not attain to his purpose.</p>
               <p>Tell me then you Romanists had it not been better for
Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>13th</hi> to have married and liv'd honest, than
to have had it prov'd against him before the <hi>Emperor,</hi> in
open Council, that he had lain with his own Sisters, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished
Virgins and strange women; with <hi>Rainera</hi> and <hi>Ann</hi>
two Widows, with their Neices, and <hi>Stephana</hi> his Father's
Concubine? and that he made the Pallace of <hi>Lateran</hi> a
Stews and open Brothel-house.</p>
               <p>Had it not been more decent and Religious both before
God and Man, for Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> to have taken a
Wife, then to have had this Epitaph written by <hi>Marullus,</hi>
on him after his Death?

of God, without dependance on the Pope. And to deface
the Emperor, he created <hi>Vicounts,</hi> and made them Vicats

that he was content to condescend to such disgraceful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles

Empire, and the Princes were asham'd to own; they with
several Kings and other Princes, Petition'd <hi>His Holiness</hi> on

rigid and shameful Conditions. But <hi>Clement,</hi> void of all
Clemency, perswading himself that this was long of the

Deposed from his Bishoprick: And the rest of the Princes,
partly being afraid of the Pope's Curse, Excommunication,
and Deposition; and partly being Brib'd by <hi>Iohn</hi> King of

Swear Fealty to him, as to the Vicar of Christ, Secondly,
That they should believe that the Emperor had no power

choose that day wherein he setteth forward, a Confessor,
or Confessors; or else in his Iourney by the way, or in any other
place: Vnto the which Confessors or Ghostly Fathers, we give full
power to give Absolution in all cases that concern the Popes own
Prerogative, in as ample manner as if our own Person were
present. <hi>Item,</hi> We grant that if any (being Confessed) die by
the way, that he shall be freed and discharged from all his
Sins. And furthermore, We Command the Angels of Paradise,
(that his Soul being fully delivered from Purgatory) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him into Paradise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>We will not that any man be tormented in himself, with the

Cross, three or four Souls, at their own pleasure, whomsoever
they will to deliver out of Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
