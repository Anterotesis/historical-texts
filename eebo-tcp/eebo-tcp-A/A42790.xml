            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

A PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT may, perhaps ſeem ſtrange and preſumptuous that ſuch an obſcure and inconſiderable Man as I ſhould obtrude at once ſo many Sermons upon the World, and that too without ſheltering them under the Name and Protection of ſome Perſon of Quality and Condition, ſince moſt Authors in all Ages have thought fit to do ſo, and many of the beſt in this Age, upon their Publication even of one ſingle Diſcourſe. The truth is, though I am not ſo vain as to think my ſelf or theſe Papers above the reach of the Captious and Cenſorious, or that I ſtand in leſs need of the Countenance of ſome Eminent Perſon to recommend me, though I affect not to be ſingular, and to depart from any Laudable Cuſtom: Yet there being ſome ſpecial Reaſons moving me to Write, but withal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding me to prefix any Perſons Name whatever, (which Reaſons are not to be made Publick, but will poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be gueſt at by ſuch as know me and my preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances) I am therefore forc'd to expoſe theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, <hi>ſine Titulo, fine Comite,</hi> without engaging any Man that Glories in Titles, or any Familiar Friend to be their God-father. 'Tis confeſs'd, that as the Ear
<pb facs="tcp:44204:3"/>
is not in theſe our days ſatisfied with Hearing, ſo neither is the Eye with Reading. The Pen and the Preſs has no more reſt than the Tongue and the Pulpit: But if it be judged convenient to ſeratch the ore, 'tis ſurely excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to rub the other when it itches.</p>
            <p>The Argument I treat of has born a conſiderable part on the Stage of our late Diſorders, wherein many have already admirably acquitted themſelves in the Defence of the Doctrine h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eady hinted) by way of Apology, ſay thus much for my ſelf; That I am not led unto this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, as if I conceited my ſelf to have hit upon any new thing, not yet taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in this inquiſitive Age, or expreſs'd it better, and to more Advantage than others before me have done. But beſides the Honeſty of my intentions in bearing Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto a Truth ſo important in theſe days, there ſeems to be ſome very good Reaſons juſtifying this Attempt. I cannot learn that any in theſe Northern Parts, have of late Years appear'd in the Defence of the Government, and confirming the Doctrine of Subjection to the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate: And I Obſerve that the People hereabouts are not ſo diligent to enquire out, and furniſh themſelves with ſuch Learned Treatiſes, as would truly inform them of their Duty. But when one of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood known to them is in Print, then the Maggot bites, then Curioſity, or Friendſhip, or Spight raiſes the whole Country, who make Hue and Cry after the Book, and will never be quiet till they have read it. By which means many may be brought to conſider thoſe Truths, which hitherto they have not known, or not duly weigh'd, or would not otherwiſe have re-collected. This I take to be a very Reaſonable Vindication of my ſelf and many
<pb facs="tcp:44204:3"/>
others in ſetting forth our Diſcourſes, which however needleſs they may be accounted to thoſe who know Men and Books, and where to find the ſame Argument more fully and accurately handled; yet thoſe Excellent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Works ſignifie as little to the generality here, as the Learned Sermons Preach'd in the City do to the Edification of the remote Countrey Congregations. But beſides this, ſince things are now brought to ſuch a paſs, that the Factious Party boaſt of their Numbers, and call the Loyal to a Poll; what they want in juſt weight and meaſure, is endeavoured to be made up by telling Noſes: It muſt be acknowledged not only Excuſable, but in ſome meaſure the Duty of every good Subject, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of a Clergy-man, upon all Occaſions to declare in behalf of the Prince, and of the Government, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf, whether he does it in that Excellency of Wiſdom as others have. His Suffrage is nevertheleſs as conſiderable in its ſelf, as the beſt. So that though I ſhould fail of my Principal Deſign (which is to bring over the Adverſaries of our preſent Peace and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment unto the Obedience of Faith (ſo I may very well call Honouring and Obeying the Magiſtrates) which is a Goſpel-Duty) yet this Point however I ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly gain, that I have aſſured the Higher Powers of one Vote, of my own ſteadineſs and fidelity; and ſhall now farther aſſure them of many more in theſe Northern Climates: Though I muſt acknowledge there are ſome Ill-contriv'd Politico's among us, who fear not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to affirm, that the People may call the King to Account for his Miſ-government: That is as much as to ſay, that they may once again Try him before an High Court of Juſtice, and then Murder him. This is that Jeſuitical, Pernicious Principle, that awakened me, and puſh'd me on to undertake this Enterprize. And I
<pb facs="tcp:44204:4"/>
thought my ſelf Obliged unto it, for Reaſons (as is ſaid before) not here to be diſcovered. Now, though the Clergy have learnt to ſit down patiently under ſome little wrongs, or rather miſtakes, as I would call them, in Tenderneſs and Honour to the beſt of Princes, <hi>(ex. gr.</hi> What Man of common ſenſe can give account, why we, contrary to our Priviledge in <hi>Magna Charta</hi> unrepeal'd (as I am told) being look'd in, I know not how, to pay Taxes without the conſent of the Convocation, ſhould yet be excluded from Voting for Repreſentatives in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament? As if we had not as much Wiſdom and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity as the ſcum of the People, or the beſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty have, which I hope will in due time be taken into Conſideration.) Theſe Punctilio's, I ſay, we eaſily and quietly let paſs: But to be revil'd (as we are) for urging the Doctrine of Subjection, of fearing the King, and not meddling with thoſe that are given to Change, is moſt injurious and inſufferable. Surely we may pretend to this, as of Common Right belonging to us, being equally concerned with the reſt of our Fellow-Subjects in the well-fare of the Nation. But much more, ſince it is one part of our Miniſterial Office, to perſwade <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 20.</note>Men that they <hi>abide in the ſame Calling wherein they are called.</hi> We are indeed often told, that this is not to Preach Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified; whereas I make no Queſtion, but that he who Teaches any Chriſtian Duty, does the work of an Evangeliſt, Preaches Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified. Time was, when they only <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 2.</note>were taken for Soul-ſaving Preachers, who (as <hi>Aaron</hi> perſwaded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to <hi>break off the Golden Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, which were in the Ears of their Wives, of their Sons, and of their Daughters)</hi> had a dextrous way of wheadling their Diſciples to fling their Silver Thimbles and Bodkins into the Fire of our Civil Contentions:
<pb facs="tcp:44204:4"/>
From whence came out two Molten Calves; Slavery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dreſt up in the Habit of Liberty and Property; and Hypocriſie, lurking under the Diſguiſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Religion. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto theſe two Idols were the People forc'd to fall down and Worſhip. It was the ſame time, when they only were eſteemed Goſpel-Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who went to Market for the Subject of their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both-Sermons (as the Diſſenters moſt Judaically, but Ignorantly call the Lords Day,) who took their Texts out of the Diurnals, and by the help of ſome Paſſages of Holy Scripture miſ-applyed and Profanely abuſed, brought forth juſt ſuch another Monſter, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> did out of the Law and the Goſpel, <hi>ſcil.</hi> A Bloody and Tyrannical Government, and an Ill-favour'd Religion, which the Church of God never before ſaw. In fine, they only were acknowledged the Faithful Diſpenſers of the Word, who were Trumpeters of Sedition, and turn'd this Kingdom into War and Blood, and Confuſion, and Anarchy; a Work as Diametrically Oppoſite to the Office of a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and to the Nature of the Goſpel, as Light is to Darkneſs. But we, ſilly Wretches as we are, who Inſtruct the People unto Modeſty, and Patient Submiſſion unto the Higher Powers (as our Lord and his Apoſtles did) to reſt content with that form of Government, under which they are born and bred, muſt needs be repreſented as a ſort of Men, that know not, or will not Preach Chriſt, and the Faith of Chriſt, although we ſpeak no other things, than what the Law, and the Prophets, and the Scriptures of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament have ſaid before us, and enjoyned us to Preach; even ſuch things, which being indeed to the Diſſenters a ſtumbling-block, and to the Factious Politician Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs; but I am fully perſwaded, if carefully learnt, and Conſcientiouſly practiſed, will accompany Salvation.
<pb facs="tcp:44204:5"/>
For my own part, I deſire no fairer play, as to the Subject, though not as to the Management of theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, than that what I have here wrote may be Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially ſcann'd; and as it ſhall be found to ſavour of the Goſpel-Spirit, let my Character and Entertainment be accordingly; which is all (Courteous Reader) and what I may juſtly expect from thee.</p>

When the Defence of the Goſpel is taken up in Oppoſition to the Civil Magiſtrate, no terms of Agreement will be accepted, unleſs every point be gain'd exactly Conform to that Enthuſiaſtical Model, to thoſe conceited Schemes of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which every Zealous Bigot lays down for the undoubted Law of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Conſcience is the moſt Formidable Invader of the Rights and Properties of the Subject, of the Power and Soveraignty of the Supream Magiſtrate: And when ſhe gives the Signal to Battel, the word is—<hi>Spare neither great, nor ſmall:</hi> Neither Prince nor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, neither things Sacred nor Profane eſcape her Fury; but all lye proſtrate, and truckle to her Arbitrary Commandment. Whilſt there are any left to make Head againſt her, ſhe will never put up her Sword; her very Mercies are Cruel: She will never give over the purſuit, till glutted with the Blood of her Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, her ſelf burſts aſunder into Faction, Hereſie, and the moſt Irreligious Separations. When the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuch as have been Slaughtered in an Holy War ſhall be reckon'd up, it will poſſibly be found, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and Paſſion, and Revenge, and Civil Faction <hi>have ſlain their Thouſands,</hi> but <hi>Conſcience her Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How this comes to paſs, is not difficult to diſcern. An Opinion of our own Holineſs begets in us Spiritual
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44204:6"/>
Pride, or rather Fleſhly Wiſdom and Confidence. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God is a moſt Powerful Motive puſhing us on unto the moſt dangerous and deſperate Enterprizes. The Propagation of the Kingdom of Chriſt oft-times makes us forget our ſelves, to over-look the means, and to think that the Goodneſs, or Innocence of our Deſign is ſufficient to Sanctifie the Villany, and to Juſtifie the undertakers. To Defend the Purity of the Goſpel is thought (as indeed it is if rightly manag'd) a Glorious work, it appearing to moſt of us the greateſt inſtance of gratitude we can return to God, namely, to advance the Excellent Glory of the Divine Nature. Beſides the Converſion of Men, yea, even the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling them by force to renounce their Errors, and to embrace the Truths of the Goſpel, ſeems at firſt bluſh, a Noble and Heroick piece of Chriſtian Charity, worthy the Zeal and Pains of every one to effect as well in his Enemy as Friend.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe general, but for the moſt part miſapply'd Principles, many Ignorant Conſciences full of Zeal and ſudden flaſhes of Spiritual Light, like <hi>Paul</hi> in his Journey to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> are indeed ſtruck blind with the abundance of Revelation and Knowledge (falſly ſo called:) And from thence forward know not, neither care, nor will give themſelves leave to conſider what courſe they are taking for the compaſſing theſe great Ends; neither will ſuffer others to take them by the Hand, and Conduct them to the Infallible Oracles of God, where they may underſtand what it is which God would have them do, ſatisfying themſelves with the uprightneſs of their remote intentions, but winking at the Iniquity of the means purſuant thereto: Although it is an Eternal Rule of right Reaſon, and an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable

Conſcience in this caſe (which is but an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Paſſion, and may rather be called Self-conceit, or ſullen Perſwaſion) becomes a moſt daring Champion, and that Cauſe is moſt likely to ſucceed wherein ſhe is ſworn of the Counſel, or made uſe of in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence both Ambitious Princes, and Rebellious Subjects in their Foreign Invaſions, or Civil Wars ſtill either in pretence or Truth, have Painted Conſcience and the Glory of God on their Enſigns; thinking it ſufficient to Excuſe their outrages with the pretext of Godlineſs. Some of you I know have read of the Holy War, carried on by the blind Zeal of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom againſt the <hi>Saracens;</hi> ſome have heard of the Holy League in <hi>France;</hi> many of you of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> Invincible <hi>Armado,</hi> Equip'd at the Requeſt of his Holineſs, for the Propagation of the Faith; moſt of you are ſenſible that there was lately a Solemn League and Covenant ſet up in this Kingdom, for the Glory of God; and we are at this day freſhly Alarm'd with the Report of an Aſſociation.

Chriſtian is to take it as he finds it.

            <p>However, neither will this pretence ſerve the turn of our Common-wealths-men, for if you will but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thoſe forementioned paſſages <hi>in Hypotheſi</hi> as well as <hi>Theſi:</hi> if you will remember who was then the higher Power at <hi>Rome</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, namely <hi>Nero,</hi> one of the moſt cruel impious and debaucht Princes, that ever ſway'd Scepter, you will not then think that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks ſtrictly of ſome great and Heroick Prince then in being, (for <hi>Nero</hi> was not ſuch an one) nor that the Precept is laid down as only obligatory, when the Prince hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be <hi>a terror unto evil doers,</hi> and <hi>a praiſe unto them that do well.</hi> We muſt then ſeek for Another ſenſe of thoſe words, which I conceive is this.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle in this deſcription, lays down one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial reaſon and ground of Subjection, fetch't from the benefit generally redounding to the People there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and this with peculiar relation even to <hi>Nero</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Emperor of <hi>Rome;</hi> though one of the worſt upon record in Hiſtory.

            <p>This I take to be the Sum of the Apoſtles Doctrine and Argument, as I have explicated it, and am pretty confident agreeably to the mind of God, to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles drift in this place, and to the unanimous Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Practice of the Primitive Saints. Which that you may after this large explanation, remember and diſtinctly comprehend, I ſhall reduce it into this ſhort Propoſition, <hi>(viz.) That it is the duty of every man, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian, to love, honour, to reverence and obey, and with their ſubſtance to ſupport the Perſon of the Supream Magiſtrate, and this in Conſcience towards God, as well as in order to his own temporal Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though this be plain and obvious, yet in theſe unhappy days; men are and will be otherwiſe minded, their heads begin to turn round again, ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their own perſonal Rights and Properties, that like the Senſitive Plant, do but touch them, they Shrink, as if Wounded to death: or, as untoward Children, when diſciplin'd for their faults, cry out Murder, and make hideous Complaints of Tyranny, Arbritrary Government, and Oppreſſion. The rights of the People are of late ſo ſwell'd, their Properties ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd, their Liberties ſo extended, that the Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick may not unfitly be reſembled to thoſe Crooked men, whom in abuſe we call Lords, whoſe Heads are almoſt Shrunk down into their Breaſts, and become in a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44204:14"/>
manner inviſible, at leaſt-wiſe, whoſe ſhape by that unnatural approach appears Monſtrous and Deformed. If the Head of the Common-wealth riſes not at a due diſtance above the Body of the People, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Form nor Comlineſs in that Government; yea, and for the moſt part (as in the ſaid ſimilitude) the Conſtitution thereof proves Crazy, and the Life ſhort.</p>
            <p>The Supream Magiſtrate is now endeavour'd to be coopt up, and as it were Beſieged with thoſe fore-ſaid Pretences: So that he cannot turn himſelf round in his own Orb, without the Offence of ſome peeviſh Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; nor can make one ſtep forward in the exerciſe of Government, but is accuſed to Treſpaſs upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of ſome waſpiſh Common-wealths-man, and to trample upon the heel of ſome Free-born Subject. So that indeed the Princes Perſon, his Honour, his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Property <hi>(i. e.)</hi> his Royalties and Prerogatives are in danger to be wreſted from him by Force and Craft, and the unwearied Clamours of unreaſonable and unſatiable Men.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now, had I time, and were it fit for me to intrench upon the Patience of this Honourable Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or to Treſpaſs upon the Publick Buſineſs of the Countrey, examine the Grounds, and the pretended Reaſons of all this: For otherwiſe I muſt declare, that I am nothing terrified from this Task by the ſcornful Abuſes of thoſe late Demagogues, who in their Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets are pleaſed to call us Miniſters Sycophants, and Publickly to Indict us of Flattery, becauſe we Preach Obedience to the King, and as much as in us lies in our Places, and according to our Abilities, withſtand the alteration of Government. For my ſelf, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and I am ſure no Man knows my Heart better than my ſelf, nor therefore can in Charity contradict me:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44204:14"/>
I ſay then, I wiſh (were not the thing impoſſible, and therefore in vain to wiſh, otherwiſe I could wiſh) that we were once again in Paradiſe, in the ſtate of Innocence and Perfection, that there were no need of Government or Governours; at leaſt, that we were all ſo good and virtuous, as to deſerve that Liberty ſome Men gape after; that thoſe eſpecially had their Freedom, who could ſo uſe it, as not to abuſe it for <hi>a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs.</hi> But ſince this is not to be expected from the far greateſt part of Mankind, ſince the World is, and ever will be full of Offences, peſtered with the Exceſſes and Diſorders of unruly Men: Since therefore it is the Intereſt of all good Men that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhould be maintained, and Governours Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and Obeyed; ſince the Law was made for a Curb to the Sinner, and not for a Puniſhment to the Righteous; ſince the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God has therefore Ordained all of us unto Subjection to Magiſtrates, and made it our indiſpenſable Duty, yea, our Intereſt and Security ſo to be: And in particular, ſince we Preachers of the Goſpel are Commanded to <hi>put you in mind that ye be ſubject to Principalities and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Titus 3. 1.</note>
               <hi>Powers, and that ye Obey Magiſtrates.</hi> I make no more Account of theſe ſpightful Inſinuations, than I would of the Drunkards Songs, or the Atheiſts Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms, that are ſo plentifully in theſe days exercis'd upon us, for no other Reaſon that I know of, but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we tell them the Truth.</hi> We are indeed by the more cunning part of the Enemies of the Government, in a cooler manner blamed for making Princes Gods, as if they immediately came down from Heaven, which looks like a piece of high Preſumption and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge. And 'tis true, we do ſo in ſome ſort, God himſelf having vouchſafed that Title of Honour to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44204:15"/>
them, and our Lord confirmed it. Beſides, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in my Text, fetches them from Heaven, telling us, they are <hi>of God,</hi> or from God; that they are <hi>Ordain'd of God:</hi> I cannot paſs by obſerving on the other hand, how that God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> condeſcends alſo to aſſume the Titles of Earthly Governours; the word King, and Prince, Lord, and others of the like ſort, being frequently attributed to him in Holy Scripture. And whereas God by way <note place="margin">Dan. 2. 47. Ver. 17.</note>of Excellence is ſtyled King of Kings; nevertheleſs the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſcrupled not to give the ſame Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> alſo. So frivolous in my <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Seld.</hi> Tit. Hon.</note>judgment is that Exception of a Learned Man againſt Soveraign Princes aſſuming Divine Titles. They are therefore called <hi>Gods,</hi> becauſe they reſemble God in Supream Power. And as Man is ſaid to have been <note place="margin">Epiſcop.</note>Created in the Image and likeneſs of God, becauſe of his Dominion over the Creature, according to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome Learned Men; ſo may the Prince be ſaid to bear the Image and likeneſs of God in a ſpecial manner, upon the Account of his Soveraignty over the People.</p>
            <p>In fine, there being you ſee ſo near an Affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the King, 'tis not to be wondred, that we make ſo great a difference between the Prince and the Subject: And in our Diſcourſes lay upon you the ſame burden of Reverence, Obedience, and Non-reſiſtance, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> before us has done, teaching no other Doctrine than what the Holy Ghoſt has war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted and Commanded us to Teach, <hi>That ye be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Higher Powers, which are of God, that they who reſiſt, reſiſt the Ordinance of God:</hi> And oh! that ye would lay to Heart that terrible Puniſhment, which awaits all Rebellious and Diſobedient Subjects, <hi>They</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note>
               <hi>that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:44204:15"/>
But after all is ſaid, the Grand Debate will be, How ſhall we be ſatisfied, who is this Higher Power among us, and in whom that Soveraignty reſts, to whom Subjection is due? Eſpecially in this mixt Monarchy, where not only the greateſt ſhare of the Property, but a conſiderable part of the Legiſlative Power is in the People? For Anſwer, I ſay, that this notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the King is the Higher Power, that Ordinance of God, in the Defence of whoſe Perſon and Authority this Diſcourſe is intended. Or do I ſay it only? Does not the Municipal Law of the Land ſay as much? And this is I am certain (I ſpeak it with ſomewhat more than ordinary Confidence) an Univerſal, an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way of knowing the Supream Power in order to our Non-reſiſtance, according to the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>(viz.) He that beareth not the Sword in vain,</hi> in whom alone the Military Power remains. He whoſe Perſon is inviolate, whoſe Life is Sacred, whoſe Power cannot be taken from him Legally without his conſent; who is Accountable to none but God for any Miſgovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (and theſe are His Majeſties Prerogatives, even by the Political Contract, the expreſs Statute-Law of the Realm) he is that Higher Power St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, and I have been Diſcourſing of, if there be any ſuch thing as an Higher Power among us. Nay, I ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add (though I will not poſitively affirm it, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting my ſelf herein to better Judgments) That Prince who is not reſponſible to the People, is in effect the ſole Soveraign Power, if he pleaſes to Uſurp and Exerciſe it: Nor can the Subject Conſcientiouſly reſiſt him. For I cannot apprehend that any reſiſtance can be Lawful in point of Conſcience, that is forbidden by the Poſitive Law of the Land, which is our Caſe in this Nation. Though the Prince may be culpable in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44204:16"/>
the ſight of God for ſo doing, yet the Subjects can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Juſtified in Rebelling, when the Law has taken from them that Liberty and Power. Common Reaſon and Equity, the Law of Nature, and the Original of Government, and extream Neceſſity, will by no means Juſtifie ſuch violent Attempts upon the Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. It is one main ground of Political Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to deprive the Subject from being his own Judge and Aſſertor of his own Priviledges. Without this Fundamental Principle, there will be only the Name and Shadow of Government, when as really 'tis but meer Anarchy. If the Subject might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to fly in the Face of Authority, and to Aſſault him when ever he apprehends himſelf injur'd, we ſhould but be <hi>Populus virorum,</hi> an Independent Herd of Licentious and ungovernable Men; not <hi>Corpus Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticum,</hi> not a Compact Body of Citizens, United to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Peace, Order, and Subordination. But it is commonly Argued, Is not the Prince Oblig'd to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by Law, and if he tranſcends that Power, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the Peoples Liberty and Property, are we bound to Obey him? I Anſwer, He is Oblig'd, but the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation is between God and his own Conſcience. God only is the Revenger of the Breach of the Coronation-Oath, though the Peoples Liberty and Property, and the Laws are the ſubject-matter of it. Secondly, I grant, that in the Caſe put, we are not bound to Obey him, but we are bound patiently to ſuffer, not actively to reſiſt. Thirdly, I am of Opinion, (but ſpeak it ſtill with Submiſſion) that the King being by all ſober, underſtanding Men, acknowledged the King of Right, before he gives the People that Aſſurance of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning by Law; that that Oath is therefore a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Act of Grace, unto which he is not Oblig'd by the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44204:16"/>
Fundamental Conſtitution: For if ſo, he could not Exerciſe the Supream Governing Power before the Oath was taken; which yet neither he nor his Predeceſſors were ever thought uncapable to do.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing then that the Prince would not give to the People this Aſſurance, I ask whether he is then Oblig'd to Govern ſtrictly by the preſent Law? 'Tis my Judgment, he is not Obliged. He ought indeed, the Law of God and Nature, and the firſt Reaſon of Government requires him to Rule with regard to the good of the Governed; yet that he is ſtrictly ty'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the particular Methods of Government, declared by the preſent Law of the Land, I can by no means allow. For the good of the Governed being the firſt Fundamental Principle directing him what Meaſures to take in the Exerciſe of Government, and as yet there being no other Obligation upon him, it is left to his Conſcience, Judgment, and Diſcretion, before that Oath, what Courſe to take in anſwering that great End of Government: And if any of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent un-repealed Laws ſhall be thought by him repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the good of the Subject, or but Comparatively not ſo effectual thereunto, may he not, nay, is he not in Conſcience bound to lay down to himſelf ſome other Rules, in Order to that End? Fourthly, I might Anſwer, that ſeeing all Men look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as freed from the punctual Obſervation of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Laws in the Caſe of extream Neceſſity (this equitable Liberty God himſelf allows, <hi>I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice;)</hi> and our Municipal Law indemnifies the Subject, in many ſuch Caſes:) And ſeeing the Security the King gives to his Subjects is a Voluntary Act, but the Peoples to the King may be Exacted from them by Force, and by Law; I think
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44204:17"/>
there is much more Reaſon, that the King in Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity may depart from the Letter of the Law, than that the People ſhould: And if the People may Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Reaſon and Equity, to the Law of Nature, and the firſt Reaſon of Government in the Defence of their Priviledges, may not the Prince much more do the ſame in the Defence of his Prerogatives, and in the Exerciſe of his Dominion? And ſhall he be indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably Oblig'd by the Letter of the Law, in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, not allow'd to plead Nature and Equity, the Reaſon and Ends of Government, and extream Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity? And yet the People be at their own Liberty in Arbitrarily Obeying as they ſhall Judge it Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and Agreeable to the Ends of Government? Some of theſe foreſaid Conſiderations (which I muſt repeat, are offered as Problems only, and with Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) or ſomething like them might, I imagine, be in the Mind of that Eminent Lawyer, Serjeant <hi>Hale,</hi> one of the Houſe of Commons in the 43<hi>d.</hi> Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who ſpake there to this Effect. <hi>I wonder</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that the Houſe ſtands either at the greatneſs or time of paying the Subſidies demanded, ſince all we have are in Her Majeſties Power; ſhe may Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully at her Pleaſure take it from us, ſhe has as much Right to all our Land, as to any Revenue of the Crown: All which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am able and ready to prove.</hi> Thus far he: But I ſhall not preſume to go ſo high, nor will it be expected from me to proceed farther upon this tickle Subject: Only I do not find that he was called to the Bar, nor Reprimanded as a Pander to Tyranny, as opening a Paſſage to Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for his plain dealing, and freedom of Speech. But this I ſhall ſay, that this one Speech of that Gentleman exceeds all that has of late been ſaid

            <p>IT is the Univerſal Cuſtom of Mankind to carry on their Publick Triumphs with Feaſting, and among other External Rites of Mirth, to chear their Hearts with a more than Ordinary freedom in the uſe of the Creature. To do ſo, is the Voice of Reaſon, the Leſſon of Experience, a Maxim writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Word of God it ſelf, and Warranted by the practice of the moſt Holy Men we there read of. There is a certain ſourneſs contracted in our Natures by buſineſs; and Abſence is apt to interrupt our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, to eſtrange us from one another: But our Solemn Meetings re-collect us again, and Good Chear ſweetens the Soul, ſoftens the Temper, after all our Care and Travel: Hereby the Spirits being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd, and the Heart putting on her Feſtival Robes (I mean Joy and Gayety) Mutual Love and Friendſhip

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44204:19"/>
the effectual means of Producing or Continuing it. If there be not an inward foundation of Peace laid in the Soul, our good fellowſhip will end in Variance, and Strife, and Riot; and our Love diſſolve as ſoon as our Feaſting is over; and all the ſubſtantial good deſign'd by theſe Feſtival endearments, will be utterly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
            <p>In theſe unhappy days of ours, there is one Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous diſorder crept in among us, whilſt moſt of us are ready enough to joyn in the outward Pageantry's of Peace and good will, in the Ceremonious Practice of love and good fellowſhip; I mean Eating and Drinking, and plentifully entertaining one another; yet our Hearts are divided, neither are we agreed in, that one neceſſary and fundamental Principle of Peace, <hi>viz.</hi> Obedience, and Subjection to the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; without which it is utterly impoſſible to maintain a good and laſting correſpondence among our ſelves, in the mutual aſſiſtance and defence of one another. Whilſt therefore you are Managing the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pomp of your Love-Feaſts, 'tis the Preachers buſineſs and duty too (I conceive) to lay the laſting Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, upon your Hearts; whilſt you are Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings Health, and Continuance of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Happineſs under Him; it will not be thought impertinent that we, who are invited to carry on the Religious part of theſe Solemnities, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to commend unto your Conſcience that Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Doctrine of being <hi>Subject to Principalities,</hi> &amp;c. without which all the ſhews of Friendſhip among your ſelves, of Loyalty to your Prince, and of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs to the eſtabliſhed Government, is but meer Pretence, and the vileſt Hypocriſie, and will at laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf in Treaſon to the Prince, in Faction to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44204:20"/>
the State, and in Treachery one towards another. This then ſhall be my deſign and task at this time, to lay the Groundwork of Peace and Union among you, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Submiſſion to the Governours and Government.</p>
            <p>But alaſs amidſt the many diſcouragements, we the Miniſters of the Goſpel labour under at this day, this is not the leaſt, that we are become hateful, and expoſed to the fury and madneſs of a Stubborn Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that chiefly, becauſe we will not run into the ſame exceſs of Riot as they do; but continue Zealous in maintaining the Peace, of the Preſent Government, as by Law eſtabliſh'd, againſt all oppoſition; that we ſtill reſolutly engage in that part of the Quarrel, where our preſence and aſſiſtance is moſt uſeful, where the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Publick Peace are moſt numerous and Powerful. To omit what might Juſtly be pleaded in our defence, as conſidered in our Politick Capacities, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> that we are members of the ſame Publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and our Intereſts embarkt in the Ship of the Common-wealth, as well as others; that by our Promiſes and Oaths we are oblig'd (what in us lies) with our Lives and Fortunes, and then ſurely alſo with our Tongues and Pens to ſupport the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that our temporal happineſs and well being in this World, depending on the Peace of the Common-wealth, we ſhould be wanting to our ſelves, and ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Eternal Law of Nature, if we did not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour our own preſervation as far as the Laws of God and Man will allow us. Upon which account certainly we might hope to paſs, if not for Men of Conſcience, yet of ſome tolerable degree of Senſe and Reaſon, whilſt we ſtudy to keep our own Ground, to maintain our Rights and Properties, at leaſt we might Paſs for ſuch with thoſe Men, who we plainly ſee reſolve to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44204:20"/>
themſelves, contrary to the Law of the Land, without any regard to Honour and Conſcience and the Religion they profeſs; in ſpite of that tye of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for the Protection they have hitherto enjoy'd, and of the repeated Aſſurances, by Oaths and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations given to the Government, for their Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able demeanour.</p>
            <p>But ſetting aſide all theſe conſiderations, when I recollect, how that in the Perſon of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> there is a neceſſity laid upon us Miniſters, and a Woe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd againſt us all, if we Preach not the Goſpel; and when I remember among other Evangelical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Holineſs, this of Subjection to the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is not the leaſt, unto which we are frequently and moſt earneſtly exhorted in the Holy Scriptures; but chiefly when I obſerve that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who himſelf preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this duty upon the Chriſtians at <hi>Rome,</hi> was alſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to inſtruct the whole Church of God therein, and among many other Topicks and Heads commended <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1.</note>unto <hi>Titus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Crete</hi> to Preach upon, charges him in my Text to <hi>put them in mind to be Subject,</hi> &amp;c. and when, laſtly I cannot but think and do Confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm that in the perſon of <hi>Titus,</hi> all the Succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preachers of the Goſpel, are oblig'd by Vertue of that Apoſtolical Canon in the diſchargè of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Office to Urge upon all Chriſtian Subjects Obedience to Authority, for theſe reaſons I do verily judge no Man of ſenſe can, no one of Conſcience will blame our Forwardneſs and Zeal in this kind.</p>
            <p>For which reaſon, I ſhall here reſume the argument of Subjection to the Civil Magiſtrate, which I lately enter'd upon, on another Publick Occaſion. In the handling whereof I ſhall not need to repeat what was then ſaid, in the Parallel Explacation of that place in the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſince
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44204:21"/>
many of you were preſent at that diſcourſe: Neither will I give you or my ſelf any other trouble, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of theſe Words, more than to make theſe two Remarks. Firſt, That St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes uſe here of three ſeveral Phraſes in declaring the Nature of Chriſtian Subjection, <hi>(ſcil.) To be Subjected to Principalities, to be Subjected to Powers, and to Obey Magiſtrates.</hi> Whence one of theſe two things plainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, either ſuppoſing the Apoſtle to have had different meanings, in thoſe diſtinct Phraſes, he muſt then be underſtood to have provided for the Chriſtians Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or Non-reſiſtance, not only of the Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, but alſo of the Subordinate: Or elſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Apoſtle fell as it were accidentally into this variety, intending no more than Subjection to the higher Powers only, it will however follow from the redundancy of expreſſion, that the Apoſtle was nearly concern'd, and mighty careful to have the Doctrine of Subjection effectually Imprinted upon the Hearts and Conſciences of the <hi>Cretians,</hi> as a Point of greateſt moment: Therefore varying the Phraſe, and expreſſing his mind ſo Copiouſly (as it were dwelling upon the argument) leſt the duty ſhould be ſlipt over as of ſmall account, leſt his meaning ſhould be miſtaken, or any unpeaceable Chriſtian ſhould find a loop hole to creep out at, excuſing himſelf from that indiſpenſable duty by ſome nice diſtinction and ſubtlety.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44204:21"/>
Rebellion.

            <p>Theſe two Remarks preſent you with the full mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words and Satisfaction for what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and ſhall now farther Diſcourſe upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; my buſineſs and intent being to Proſecute three or four difficult Caſes, that uſually fall under Debate, as concerning Non-reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, What if the Supream Magiſtrate be an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? Now, though this Queſtion at firſt bluſh ſeems impertinent to our Condition in this Nation, yet it being look'd upon as a matter of no ſmall moment and difficulty rightly to ſtate it; and becauſe what I ſhall deliver upon this Argument, will in the end, if care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attended to, conduce much to the Confirmation of that Doctrine which is my chief Aim to commend unto you this day, <hi>Scil.</hi> Subjection to the Legal Prince: I ſhall therefore crave leave, as briefly as I can, to reſolve that doubt in the firſt place.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer therefore in the Affirmative, that though he is an Uſurper, yet ſtill he is the Ordinance of God, the ſucceſs of his Arms being a clear Indication of the Mind and Will of God, bearing on it the ſtamp of Divine Approbation, and indiſpenſably Obliging the People unto Patient and Peaceable Subjection. This was (I conceive) the Caſe of the Chriſtians, under
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44204:22"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours; who were Uſurpers, having no Legal Right to the Soveraignty, but what they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſinful Force and Violently abrogating the Ancient Government. At leaſt I make account that that Deſpotical and Arbitrary Power, which they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and exerciſed over the People, was Unnatural, Unjuſt, and Uſurpation; and yet God, whoſe ſpecial Care it is always to provide for Publick Peace, is pleas'd ſo far to own and Countenance the Higher Powers, as not to ſuffer us Turbulently to reſiſt them, though Uſurpers. Trace the Hiſtory of the Church, you will not find Holy Men ſcrupling this point in the leaſt, nor curiouſly ſifting into the Princes Title, in every deſcent, and through a long ſeries of Succeſſion, nor upon any pretence of Weakneſs in their Tittle, putting themſelves in the Head of the Populace, and encouraging to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (as ſome Learned Men think) was <note place="margin">Exod. 9. 16.</note>an Uſurper; <hi>For this Cauſe</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>have I ſet thee up;</hi> that is, have permitted thee to take upon thee the Supream Authority, by proſpering, or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Ambition to Succeed againſt the Ancient known Law of Succeſſion, in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Yet neither <hi>Moſes</hi> nor the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> took this Advantage againſt him, nor did God himſelf any other ways deſign their Deliverance at firſt, than by Ordering them in his Name Peaceably to Supplicate for leave to go into the Wilderneſs to Sacrifice. All the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were Uſurpers againſt the Title of <hi>David</hi>'s Houſe; many of them againſt the better Title of their immediate Predeceſſors. Did the Prophets or Good Men blow the Trumpet, and Aſſemble the People to Oppoſe the Uſurpers? Did not the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> themſelves by Leagues, and Confederating with <hi>them</hi> in Wars againſt their Common Enemies, ſufficiently acknowledge their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44204:22"/>
Providential Right unto the Kingdom? The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> is clear in this matter,—<hi>I have made the Earth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 27. 5, 6.</note>(ſays God by his Prophet to the Jews) <hi>the Men, and the Beaſts that are upon the Ground, in my great Power, and by my out-ſtretched Arm, and have given it unto whom it ſeemed meet unto me; and now I have given all theſe Lands into the hand of</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>King of</hi> Babylon, <hi>my Servant, to ſerve him.</hi> The Caſe of the Jews was thus. God as a Puniſhment had given to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> Dominion over them; that is, had permitted him to Uſurp it, having carried away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive their Legal Prince unto <hi>Babylon.</hi> Hereupon the Jews had ſubmitted to his Empire, and received <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, Jehojakim</hi>'s Brother, as their Deputy-Governour under <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> Theſe things were done not by vertue of any expreſs Revelation from God, but by the Rule of Common Diſcretion, and in Conformity to the Providential will of God. Now, if former Oaths un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Natural Prince irreverſibly Oblige againſt the preſent ſignification of Gods Providence, then did <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and the Jews ſin in thus owning and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fealty to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in prejudice of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hojakim,</hi> which is evident they did not; and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was by God himſelf look'd upon as Lawful, and binding to the Conſcience. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does <hi>Jeremy</hi> in that Chapter chide the Jews for practiſing a Revolt, and the Spirit of God calls it <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 13.</note>I ſhall confeſs here that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> had Sworn Allegiance to the Conquerour, that an unlawful Oath may bind, and conſequently, that this defection of <hi>Zedekiah</hi> might be ſinful by reaſon of the breach of his Oath; but then I muſt ſay in Anſwer, Firſt, That if it had been unlawful for <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and the Jews fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the intimations of Providence, to Swear unto
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44204:23"/>
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> either the Prophet, or the Inſpired Hiſtorian would, and muſt have told us as much, and Reproved the Jews for that ſin: Or, Secondly, if we grant the Oath unlawful, then it could not have Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them againſt the Antecedent and Lawful Oath given to <hi>Jehojakim.</hi> For where there are two repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Oaths, 'tis more reaſonable that the former ſhould bind: at leaſt, that the lawful Oath (that given for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to <hi>Jehojakim)</hi> ſhould take Place of the unlawful (that given to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;)</hi> ſo that in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it appears that the reſiſtance of an Uſurper is ſinful, a reſiſtance of the Ordinance; and that we may Subject our ſelves to him, when Providence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels us.</p>
            <p>Now the Reaſon of this Concluſion of mine is (I think) Obvious. God is Lord and Proprietour of the whole World. 'Tis he that <hi>pulleth down one and ſetteth up another. By him Kings Reign.</hi> We are not always to expect an immediate Revelation from Heaven for the Confirmation of his Will, or Satisfaction of our own Conſcience. He was indeed oft times pleas'd to diſcover his mind to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by his <hi>Prophets.</hi> What Propheſy and Revelation was to them, the ſame is Providence unto us, a manifeſt and ſufficient Proof of the Divine Will. All Mankind, the moſt Religious and Loyal, bare witneſs to this Truth in their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: and the beſt, the wiſeſt Princes allow their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects this Liberty, evermore paſſing bills of Amneſty <note place="margin">Hen. <hi>7</hi>th.</note>upon the Recovery of their Kingdoms. This was the Motive, which prevail'd with one of our Kings for enacting that equitable Law, whereby the People are acquitted of Treaſon, when they ſubmit to a crown'd Uſurper, that Ceremony (it ſeems) being intended for a Legal Token of Gods Providential Will. Thus far
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44204:23"/>
(I am apt to believe) the moſt Diſloyal among us will agree with me. Wherefore that I may not be miſunderſtood, it will be neceſſary to lay down theſe following Rules and Limitations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is the duty of every Subject to aſſiſt his Prince, to maintain the preſent Government againſt an Uſurper to the utmoſt of his Power; and this not only in the beginning of Rebellion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which ſhould always be nipt in the Bud) but continue ſo doing with the hazard of his Life and Fortune, whilſt their remains any Hopes, any Legal Methods of Defence. For I would not be miſtaken, as if I accounted it a matter of ſmall Moment to depart from our Oaths and Aſſurances given to the Government; or as if I took upon me to licence People to practiſe againſt the Peace of the State, or to herd themſelves with tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and ungovernable Men. No, it will not be eaſy for a Loyal and Religious Subject, to proſtitute his Conſcience upon every firſt appearance of danger or to violate his Contracts by a ready complyance with the Uſurper, before he does or ſuffers, or makes any oppoſition in behalf of the Natural Prince. But then only he may and is to ſubmit, when Providence has put an end to the diſpute, and clearly decided the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. And this may happen two ways: 1. When 'tis become morally impoſſible to reſtore the oppreſſed Prince (as appears to have been the caſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when <hi>Jehojakim</hi> was captive in <hi>Babylon)</hi> then the hand of Providence has laid a neceſſity upon us to acquieſce in the Alteration of Government. For as neceſſity has no Law according to the vulgar ſaying, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities fall under no Law, according to the Maxim of the Schools. This is taken for granted by all men, and even the ſupreme Rulers themſelves approve it,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44204:24"/>
No one is or can in the Nature of the thing be oblig'd to impoſſibilities either by God or Man: neither will the Powers in this Extremity require Subjects out of Fondneſs to run themſelves head long into deſtruction in vain and to no purpoſe at all. It is an Aphoriſm in the Divine Oeconomy it ſelf: God has thus (yea more favourably) reſolved the Caſe between him and us—<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 13.</note> 
               <hi>I</hi> (ſays he) <hi>will have Mercy and not Sacrifice.</hi> We are not ſtrictly tied to the obſervation of his Poſitive Precepts.</p>
            <p>His negative Laws oblige <hi>ſemper &amp; ad ſemper,</hi> as the Learned ſpeak. That is plainly thus; our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will never allow us to blaſpheme God, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to ſteal, or to commit Adultery. Becauſe 'tis <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ex.</hi> 20.</note>ſaid, Thou ſhalt not, &amp;c. The Holineſs of the Divine Nature cannot, will not in any wiſe diſpenſe herein. But his Poſitive Commands do not oblige <hi>ad ſemper.</hi> It is permitted us upon urgent Occaſions, for inſtance, to abſent our ſelves from the Publick Worſhip, to do works of Neceſſity and Charity, and we are not always bound to publiſh our Opinions, or to profeſs our Faith. (tho we may not deny it.) The Goodneſs and the mercy of the Divine Nature thus far indulges us as to the performance of our Duty to him. And may we not reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably expect the ſame Meaſure from our Earthly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours? It can never, I own, be lawful for us to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme <hi>their</hi> Honour, to fight againſt them or murder them, becauſe 'tis ſaid, Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the Rulers, thou ſhalt not reſiſt them, (theſe negative Dutys oblige <hi>ad ſemper;)</hi> but 'tis not always our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible Duty to fight for them. In extream ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity then we may ſubmit to an Oppreſſor. Natural Prudence, and ſelf-preſervation will warrant and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force us to it. Our Religion, our Conſcience and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44204:24"/>
Fidelity to our Soveraign being to be guided by the Rule of Reaſon and Diſcretion, to be concluded by the almighty Power of Providence, we muſt ſit down, and like reaſonable men examine, <hi>whether we are able with</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 31.</note>
               <hi>ten thouſand to march into the Field, and meet our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary with twenty thouſand,</hi> as our Lord adviſes. When there is no humane probability of Succeſs, there God has put a ſtop to our Endeavours. <hi>Hitherto we are to go, and no farther.</hi> For the Relation between the Leige Prince, and the Leige People, the mutual Offices of Protection and Aſſiſtance, are now, tho not wholly and eternally diſſolved, yet, ſuſpended for a while. As the Prince deprived cannot be taxt juſtly, becauſe in the Diſcharge of his publick Truſt, he does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately run himſelf into certain ruine for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Subjects: So neither can <hi>he</hi> reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his People ſhould do ſo in his Quarrel, when there is no Hopes of Succeſs. Both the one and the other are patiently to ſuffer under the Diſappointment. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervare ſe meliori fortunoe,</hi> waiting a more favourable conjuncture of aſſerting their Rights and Liberties.</p>
            <p>Secondly when the Natural Prince and his Legal Heirs are all extinct, or loſt, then certainly the Uſurper is the Divine Ordinance and ought to be recogniz'd as ſuch, having the beſt viſible Title, <hi>i. e.</hi> actual Poſſeſſion of the Crown; On whom by Providence and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will the ſupreme Authority is devolved. And I am well ſatisfyed, that if this Rule is not to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, 'tis impoſſible for us to ſubmit unto any Higher Powers at this day, ſo many Invaſions, Uſurpations and violent Changes having been made in all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. Were we permitted to trace every Princes Title from the beginning downward to this preſent time; and then to reſiſt upon the Diſcovery of any
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44204:25"/>
one Flaw in the ſeveral Alterations and Succeſſions, we ſhould find ſcarce one juſt, and might upon that ſcore reſiſt, I verily think. But then</p>
            <p>When I affirm we may and ought to be Subject to a Uſurper, yet (if there be but a bare Natural Poſſibility of our Soveraigns return) I would be underſtood to ſpeak of an unactive Submiſſion, (as I may call it) that is, of ſitting down patiently under his Dominion as Sufferers, and as a conquered People, not actual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters or Defenders of the Change. For conſidering our former Oaths, 'tis Indecent and Treacherous ſo far to comply with Uſurpation, as to become active Inſtruments in the new Tyranny. We may not then ingage in publick Offices, and places of Truſt. We may not inform againſt, nor implead, nor judg, nor perſecute our <hi>Fellow</hi> Citizens upon the Uſurpers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. We may not commend his Government, nor write Panegyricks, nor erect Monuments to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his Perſon and Virtue. We may not enter into Engagements of Maintaining his Authority againſt the juſt and legal Title of the excluded Prince, nor poſitively abjure the Royal Family. If we proceed thus far in Subjecting our ſelves, we are guilty of perjury the downright breach of our Sacred Oaths: at leaſt may bring our Conſciences into ſuch a Snare, that if ever Providence turns our Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Reſtores our Soveraign, we are reduc't into this Streight of Neceſſarily forſwearing our ſelves. For to adhere to the Uſurper, to be active in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, is a Violation of our firſt Oath, which Eternally obliges us not to reſiſt our natural Prince: And to be active in our Princes Cauſe, is manifeſt perjury for the ſame Reaſon. The Sin of forſwearing our ſelves and unfaithfulneſs Will one of theſe Ways of a ſurety
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44204:25"/>
Cleave to us. But if any think to avoid this <hi>Dilemma</hi> by being a Neuter, he is ſo groſsly miſtaken, that he is perjur'd in both Reſpects, and doubly forſwears himſelf. He defends neither the Prince nor the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: at leaſt he reſiſts neither, as he has oblig'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For the avoiding of which inconvenience it is our Wiſdom and Duty, tho to be Subject, yet not active under the Uſurper. Becauſe,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> When Opportunity offers its ſelf of recalling the Prince, and Re-eſtabliſhing the Lawful Government, (which oft times has and will happen, even when it has appear'd impoſſible) then our former Obligation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives and returns upon us. For Providence (which I always maintain is the Finger of God, a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Will) not onely admoniſhes us of our Duty, but by putting it into our Power invites us to pull <hi>him</hi> down; who Ceaſes to be the Divine Ordinance, and as <hi>a rod is flung into the Fire.</hi> Thus <hi>Jeremy</hi> after he had exhorted the <hi>Jews</hi> to be ſubject to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>

Now if what has been delivered upon this Argument be well laid together, I ſhall be ſo far from

giving any juſt Offence, or that I judg my ſelf to have bound ſuch ſtrong Shackles upon the Conſcience, as will not be eaſily ſhook off by any, that have any Spark of Religion and Loyalty left in them.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to a ſecond Query, what if the Natural Prince ſtretches his Dominion beyond the Line, exerciſes his Power beyond the Compaſs &amp; againſt the Rule of the Law? To this I reply, He is ſtill the Higher Power, the Ordinance of God. Thou mayeſt not revile him, nor by Force reſiſt him, nor with danger to his Life, his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, his Crown and Dignity, or the Publick Peace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy ſelf. Thou art notwithſtanding bound to pay him all Reverence, in Patience and Humility to poſſeſs <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13.</note>thy Soul. This I take to be St. <hi>Peters</hi> Doctrine, who, when he had perſwaded Submiſſion to the King, and Subjection to Maſters, even to the froward, backs <note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 18.</note>his Doctrine thus—<hi>For this is Thank-worthy, if a</hi>

               <hi>Man for Conſcience towards God indures grief, ſuffering wrongfully; not ſo much as Anſwering again,</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi> commands; that is, not ſaucily, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully. Which alſo is by <hi>Peter</hi> recommended <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 23.</note>from the Example of Chriſt,—<hi>who, when he was reviled, reviled not again.</hi> Now becauſe, there are among us many, that ridicule this Doctrine, and with much Confidence explode that Principle of betaking our ſelves only to Prayers and Tears, humble and modeſt Petitions, which the Primitive Saints, and we at this day affirm the onely Conſcientious Rule, and Remedy againſt Injury received from the Supreme Magiſtrate; 'Tis worth our pains to obſerve, how thoſe Apoſtles encourage the Chriſtians, and by what Motives they preſs them unto this patient Suffering.

               <hi>are ye called, becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an Example. When he ſuffer'd, he did not ſo much as threaten, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly. Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> comforted not their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with hopes of Opportunity, ſome time or other to aſſert their juſt Rights and Natural Liberty; which had been ſafe enough to have done in theſe their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Letters; Nor do they talk of a Natural tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Power, to reſiſt when they ſhould be able: but as became good Subjects and Preachers of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, dealt plainly with them, putting them in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, what they were to truſt unto, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to the righteous Judgment of God, to the future Recompence of reward, and to the Divine Puniſhments to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon their Oppreſſors. They had now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly learnt their Leſſon, not ſo much as to call down Fire from Heaven to conſume their Enemys, nor muſter whole Legions of Angels in their own juſt Defence and Preſervation: much leſs not inſiſt upon their Natural Right againſt the Publick Peace. Whence I conclude, that in Caſe of Injury and Oppreſſion, God is the onely Judg, to him we are to appeal, to his Care and Goodneſs is the Cauſe to be committed. Our Obligations of Honour, Obedience patient Submiſſion and peaceable Subjection cannot ceaſe in the Mean Time. If any ſhould now reply, that the foreſaid Paſſages concern the Duty of Servants to their Maſters, not of Subjects to the Higher Powers, I ſhall anſwer, that St. <hi>Peters</hi> Diſcourſe and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in <hi>Titus</hi> ſeems plainly intended

of both: and I farther reply, that ſince Chriſtians were commanded to be Subject, not indecently to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their Patrons tho <hi>froward</hi> and unjuſt; that ſince they were not allowed by Diſobedience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Natural Liberties, but to abide <hi>in the</hi>

There is, I will not deny a great Difference between them and us, the Emperours and Heads of Families being much more abſolute and arbitrary, than our Princes and Maſters are at this day. And yet this will not juſtify reſiſtance, which being atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Breach of the Publick Peace and Order, and a Subverſion of Government in its Tendency, is as irregular &amp; ſinful in a Mixt as in an abſolute Monarchy, and every whit as repugnant to the Doctrine of the Apoſtles. The Exorbitances of the ſupreme tho li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Power can be no plea for the Subject to rebell, when the Publick Contract has expreſly forbid it. But if in contempt and ſpite of the Municipal Law the Subjects of a limited Monarch may fly to the Law of Nature, their Moral tranſcendent Power for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their juſt Rights and Properties, I ſee no Reaſon, why the Chriſtians under the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire might not betake themſelves unto the ſame Law of Nature, their natural tranſcendent Power, and by Force aſſert themſelves out of that Deſpotical, Unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Unjuſt and Unſupportable Slavery they were

under. To make an End of this, It is acknowledg'd <note place="margin">Eſpecially Treatiſe of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, &amp;c.</note>by moſt of our ingenuous Adverſaries, that even in mixt Monarchy as great Deference, Obedience and Submiſſion is done to the Perſon of the King, as to an abſolute Prince. And this at preſent I have only pleaded for.</p>
            <p>Now, becauſe when we back this Doctrine with the Chriſtians Practice in the Primitive days, we are wont to meet with Scornful Men, ſuch as will by no means admit the Holy Apoſtles and Martyrs, as the Pattern, but Reproach them for tame Fools, as I have my ſelf heard ſome Cenſuring thoſe Famous Souldiers of the <hi>Thebean</hi> Legion, I ſhall give you further to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that our Predeceſſors in the Faith were not ſo weak, not ſo <hi>Stoical,</hi> not ſo Prodigal of their Eſtates, nor weary of their Lives, but ſo far as the Law of God, and the Political Government gave them leave, were as brisk in their own Defence, and as tender of their Natural and Civil Intereſts as we can be.

            <p>I ſhould now go on to two other remaining Queries, but it being not fit for me to intrench farther upon your Patience, I ſhall reſerve them to the Afternoon. And for a Concluſion, ſhall beg leave to look back to what in the beginning I took ſome little Notice of, and in a few words expoſtulate with our Adverſaries about thoſe unreaſonable Clamours they raiſe againſt us, who endeavour to inform our Congregations of the Nature, Duty, and Neceſſity of Subjection to the Higher Powers.</p>
            <p>If indeed we would become Leaders of the People, and draw them forth into the Wilderneſs, the Field of Rebellion, we need not then Queſtion at our deſcent from the Pulpit, but to meet with the Praiſes of Men for quitting our ſelves ſo dexterouſly in the behalf of the good of the People, as ſome Men are pleaſed to call Faction. Might we Preach to the People what is grateful to their Ears and corrupt Hearts, our Task would be eaſie, our Labours acceptable, and in ſome meaſure ſucceſsful. If we could, or might be ſo wiſe in our Generation, as to ſuit our Diſcourſes to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Diſtemper of the Times, letting our words drop ſmoothly, and our Doctrine run down gently with the Stream of Popular Humour: I am ſenſible we ſhould be hugg'd, as Men of Temper, Peaceable and Moderate Men, Men that meddle not with the Times or State Affairs: That is in Truth, that ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; that is, nothing to purpoſe; that is, nothing towards the Information and Amendment of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſorders among us.

the Nature and Deſign of the Goſpel, and our Duty: and think it ſo far from being an Objection againſt the truth of the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, or a Crime in us, that 'tis its ſingular Excellency, and ought to be accounted our Glory and Commendation; whatever the conceited Atheiſts, the profane Wits, and the buſy Pamphleteers of theſe days ſay to the contrary. For is it not reaſonable thus to Judge, of the Wiſdom, and Righteouſneſs, and Goodneſs of God? That he who <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.</note>
               <hi>takes care of the Lillies of the Field, of the Sparrow on the Houſe top, and numbers the very Hairs of our Head;</hi> that he who regards every particular Mans welfare, and is pleaſed to make known our mutual Duty one toward another in our private Relation, ſhould much more provide for the Honour and ſafety of <hi>Principalities and Powers,</hi> of the Publick Peace and the relative Offices between the Prince and the Subject. Is not this Publick, this General good of infinite <hi>more Value</hi> to the World, and more worthy the Providential care and gracious regard of God by Revelation? He that Quarrels the Goſpel (and all Revelation) as a Trick of State, a Politick contrivance of Prieſts, and Damns the Miniſters of the Goſpel, as baſe Inſtruments of the Princes Tyranny, becauſe both it and they teach Obedience to the Soveraign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; may as well argue againſt our Religion and us, becauſe we inſtruct Children to <hi>Obey their Parents, Servants to be ſubject to their Maſters,</hi> and exhort you all to mutual Love, Peace, Charity, Juſtice and Uprightneſs one towards another. I maintain then, that Peace on Earth, National Peace, is one principal aim of our Chriſtianity, one of the Chief bleſſings deſign'd us here below, by Chriſts appearance in the Fleſh, and was the argument of the Heavenly Hoſt's,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44204:30"/>
Anthem at his Birth. And oh! <hi>How beautiful on the Mountains are the feet of them that bring good Tidings, and publiſh Peace?</hi> who in the Name of God charge the People with the Kings Peace.</p>
            <p>Ay but (ſay ſome) theſe Prieſts are always medling with the Municipal Laws of the Land, obtruding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Auditors ſuch diſcourſes, as would beſeem the Reverend Judges on the Bench, rather than Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the Pulpit. This exception (I confeſs) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies too much of Commendation, tho it carries little of truth in it. However (ſince 'tis made uſe of againſt us) why (I beſeech you) may not we acquaint our ſelves and thoſe that hear us (when the Argument leads us to it, and ſince our adverſaries require it) with the Law, which is in part the meaſure of our Subjection to Civil Authority; as well as others Examine the Goſpel, which is the Rule of their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, and to their Church Governours? Or how is it poſſible for us, to ſtate the queſtion aright? Unleſs we firſt inform the Conſcience of the Law of the Land, which (as many contend) is the only Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of our Duty to the Prince.</p>
            <p>But 'tis yet farther Objected. You are ſuch ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, ſo reſtleſs on this Point, that your Sycophancy is manifeſt, and your Harangues become Nauſeous to the Peoples Stomachs. Ay, and will be ſo, as long as we thwart their quarrelſom Humour, as long as we oppoſe their turbulent Practices againſt the preſent Powers. Is there not reaſon, a neceſſity for us ſo to do? Are there not more Underminers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, than Preachers of Submiſſion to Authority? Are there not more Libels ſent forth to overturn the preſent Eſtabliſhment, than Sermons to uphold the Peace and Order of the State? Yea, are not the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44204:31"/>
of Peace more apparently guilty of Flattery? whilſt they fawn on the Multitude, Court the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, Cajole the People, and raiſe the Mobile into Diſcontent and Mutiny, ſtill keeping them in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Motion, ſtill Heightening their Fears, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laruming them with the Proſpect of remote dangers: and by theſe little Arts improving <hi>their</hi> inſtability and ſuſpicions of danger, (which bleſſed be God, is acknowledged uncertain and at a diſtance) even to the preſent diſquiet of the Nation: Fooliſhly anticipating their own miſery, and bereaving us all of our preſent happineſs, by too careful a providence of future trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; whereas Wiſdom its ſelf has ſaid, <hi>that we muſt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 34.</note>
               <hi>not take care of to morrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſufficient to the day is the evil thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And why (forſooth) ſhould we for diſcharging our Duty, be thus malitiouſly ſlandered, as Hypocrites and Court-flatterers? Did <hi>Paul</hi> flatter <hi>Nero</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans?</hi> It cannot be imagin'd. Did <hi>Peter</hi> flatter all the Princes and Magiſtrates in <hi>Pontus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Epiſt. 1,</note>
               <hi>Aſia, Galatia, Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Bithynia</hi> (to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of which Provinces he wrote, as you learn in the Preamble of that Epiſtle?) It cannot be ſuppos'd. Did <hi>Paul</hi> here in the Text, put <hi>Titus</hi> upon that Unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Servile, that Unmanly art of Flattery? It cannot be thought. Or was our bleſſed Saviour himſelf a Flatterer, when he bids the Jews—<hi>give unto</hi> Caeſar; <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſar<hi>'s</hi>? Surely none will dare to harbour ſo mean, ſo Blaſphemous thoughts of the Son of God. In fine were all the Biſhops, Prieſts, and Holy Men of Old, that laid down their Lives for the Faith, Paraſites? Was <hi>Tertullian</hi> a Sycophant? who Apologizing for the Chriſtians thus boaſts on their behalf—<hi>We Chriſtians adore the Righteous Judgment</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:44204:31"/>
               <hi>of God, who has Ordain'd the Emperor to Govern the Nations: We Chriſtians are Enemies to none, no not to the Emperor, who is appointed Ruler over us by God, and 'tis our duty to Love, Reverence, Honour, and wiſh him Proſperity: We Chriſtians in the firſt place Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Obey God, and next unto him the Emperor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is this Flattery? Was this an unfaithful Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Chriſtians Loyalty in thoſe Days? In no wiſe. To make an end of this Apology, If the Primitive Fathers and Noble Martyrs, if the Holy Apoſtles, if the Bleſſed Jeſus were Sycophants, then, O my Soul, come not thou into <hi>their</hi> Secrets: Mine Honour, be not thou United to <hi>their</hi> Aſſemblies, who whilſt <hi>we</hi> are labouring for Peace, make <hi>themſelves</hi> ready for Battel. I had much rather be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe Hypocrites, and to have my Portion with thoſe Glorious Tranſgreſſors. This ſhort Defence of my ſelf and Brethren will not (I hope) be accounted unſeaſonable; nor can it be look'd upon as impertinent to the Text, if it be well conſidered, as no queſtion it will be by ſo Judicious an Audience. If then it be <hi>right in the ſight of God, to Obey Man rather than God;</hi> to follow the People in their Turbulency, rather than the Apoſtles Canon of putting them in mind <hi>to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Principality,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>IT muſt be confeſs'd that all Parties among us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge (in general) Obedience due to the Supream Magiſtrate; but in the mean time are ſo miſerably Divided in Opinion, in what Perſon or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the Supream Power is Lodg'd, that (as our Lord Prophetically deſcribing the Hereſies and Diviſions of the Church, fore-tells that one Separation would <hi>cry, loe, here is Chriſt; another, loe, he is there:</hi> Even thus it fares with us at this day, as to the Higher Power.) We are not yet agreed among our ſelves, to whom the Supream Authority of the Nation belongs, nor by Conſequence know, how far Non-reſiſtance of the Prince in our preſent Conſtitution is Obligatory. Thoſe who of late have wrote on this Argument, have ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully tormented the Doctrine of Subjection with diſtinctions, that 'tis as hard to come to the knowledge of our Duty, what Governours we are to obey, where
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44204:32"/>
and when, how, and in what Caſe, in what ſenſe and degree Reſiſtance is Unlawful, as 'tis to find the true Doctrine of the Goſpel in the School-men, or to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Conſcience in the Practice of Holineſs out of the Jeſuits Morals. This Evangelical Precept is ſo ſtrangely Wire-drawn, brought into ſo narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, that I cannot apprehend what tye can be laid upon the Subject, ſince 'tis impoſſible, but upon ſome pretence or other a Factious Spirit may ſtill alledge ſomething to Juſtifie his Rebellion: For moſt of theſe Diſputers about the Nature of our Government, do ſtill centre and agree upon this one Peſtilent and Ruining Principle, That the People by the Law of Nature, by the firſt Reaſon of Government, by a Moral tranſcendent Power (not expreſs'd, but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily implyed in every Political Conſtitution) are their own Judges; what their Rights and Priviledges are, when Property is Invaded, when Religion is in danger to be Subverted, when Liberty of Conſcience is Violated, and when their Civil and Spiritual Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts may forcibly be maintain'd. How of late was Obedience to the Higher Powers run down with full Cry, forc'd to skulk, and paſs along the Streets in Maſquerade? And ſometimes to Attire her ſelf in the Harlotry and Diſguiſe of Rebellion its ſelf? So that an inquiſitive Man would have been puzzled to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her, as much as <hi>Diogenes</hi> was to find out an Honeſt Man, or <hi>Elijah</hi> another beſides himſelf, that had not bowed the Knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> The Matter is (Bleſſed be God) ſomewhat amended among us in appearance: Yet becauſe 'tis to be feared that there are ſtill many tainted with Factious Principles (a very little of which, like the Leaven of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> is able to Leaven and Corrupt the whole Lump) ſince many
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44204:33"/>
ignorant People know not which way to turn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor whoſe Servants they are, whom they ought to Obey. I ſhall now proceed farther on the Argument of Non-reſiſtance, and endeavour to reſolve two other Queries relating thereunto: The firſt of which is,</p>
            <p>What if the Supream Power ſets up Idolatry? What if he become an Enemy to Godlineſs, a Betrayer of the true Reformed Religion of the Nation? Still I Reply, he is thy Natural Leige Prince, and the Ordinance of God. When the Citizens of <hi>Delphi,</hi> upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of <hi>Xerxes</hi> in his Formidable Invaſion of <hi>Greece,</hi> Conſulted the Oracle, what courſe they ſhould take for the preſervation of their Religion, their Sacred <note place="margin">

And ſo I fear 'tis with moſt among us, whatever Zeal they make ſhew of for the Preſervation of Religion, and the Glory of God; the care of their Wealth and Eſtates is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of all, which indeed they are not aſhamed in their Diſcourſes many times to own. But whatever it be, and though the Oracle of the Devil ſeems to deny that People Liberty of uſing Lawful means for the Security of their Religious Treaſure (for certainly 'twas Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to defend both againſt the Power and Avarice of an Invader, either by hiding it in the Earth, or removing it into a more ſafe place, which was the only Queſtion put to the Oracle) yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Infallible Oracles of God does not allow us to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44204:33"/>
maintain his Honour by diſhonouring, and illegal Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our Natural Prince: (For God himſelf is able to defend it, and has taken it into his own immediate Protection, if the Prince apoſtatizes.) Nor may we upon Pretence of the purity of Divine Worſhip renounce our Lawful Soveraign.</p>

               <hi>That Dominion is founded in Grace</hi> is as wild a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox as that other of <hi>its being founded in Property,</hi> and is ſo much the more dangerous, in that being the Manufacture of <hi>Rome,</hi> and tranſported hither by their Spiritual Merchants, the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> is bought up gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily by our zealous Huckſters, the true Proteſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters. So far indeed the Government is beholden to them, that they have almoſt monopoliz'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity. But, my Brethren, <hi>ye have not,</hi> I hope, <hi>ſo Learned Chriſt.</hi> I do not read, that our Lord or his Apoſtles give us leave, nor Encouragement to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate Chriſtianity by the Sword, or to defend the Goſpel by Tumult and Railing at Superiors, or Threatening to advance another on the Throne, whom we ſhall pleaſe to canonize for a Saint, contrary to the Known and Fundamental Law of Succeſſion. <hi>Peter,</hi> who miſtaking Chriſts meaning, when he bad the Diſciples to furniſh themſelves with Swords, briskly cut off <hi>Malchus</hi>'s Ear, but received this Check—<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 52.</note> 
               <hi>Put up thy Sword.</hi> 'Tis worth our while to take a view of our Lords Diſcourſe and Behaviour on this Occaſion. <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>they that take the Sword, ſhall periſh by</hi> 
               <note place="margin">v. 52. 53. 54.</note>
               <hi>the Sword. Thinkeſt thou not, that I can pray to my Father, and he ſhall preſently give me more than twelve Legions of Angels for my Defence? But how then ſhall the Scripture be fulfilled?</hi> It was not then (as ſome are pleas'd to affirm of the Primitive Saints) for want of Power that our Lord would not reſiſt, but in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44204:34"/>
Conſcience to the Ordinance, and in Obedience to the Authority of the Prieſts. Beſides, Chriſt to make amends for the raſhneſs of that hot headed Diſciple was pleas'd by a miraculous Cure of the Wound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair that publick Injury and Breach of the Peace (for ſuch it was, <hi>Malchus</hi> being one of the High Prieſts Servants.) This (I imagine) gave ſuch Satisfaction on all ſides, as you read not that the Crime was ever laid to <hi>Peters</hi> Charge, nor roſe up in Judgment againſt our Saviour. Hence 'tis very probable that St. <hi>Peter</hi> afterwards became a moſt Zealous Aſſertor of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Subjection, as you will find in his firſt Epiſtle. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hard Bondage cryed unto the Lord? And God undertook their Deliverance: not by Encouraging them to reſiſt the King, and diſturb the Peace by Rebellion. But ſending <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to ſupplicate in their behalf. God himſelf condeſcended to ſend Ambaſſadors to him, and became a peaceable Interceſſor for them. And leſt <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (as he did) ſhould look upon <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Meſſage as a Sham, and his Miracles, as the Magical Tricks of an Aſpiring Spirit, how did God Evidence the Truth thereof? With what Power and Might, and outſtretched Arms did the Lord of Hoſts ſecond his Petitions? All the Reſiſtance they offered was but running away, and that too by the ſpecial Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. When the Tyrant purſued them, (tho in a warlike Poſture and Able in ſome Meaſure to ſell their Lives at a dear rate, yet) they did not lift up their Hands againſt the Kings Army. And when it muſt needs be, God contriv'd and wrought their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance without their active Reſiſtance, or the Breach of the Peace, himſelf overthrowing <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:44204:34"/>
and his <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the Red Sea. God, who is the Author of Peace and Order, the Ordainer of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeems always to have been ſo tender in this Point, that he never has made uſe of his ſupreme Power and Prerogative, ſo as to Commiſſion or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify any Subject in their Reſiſtance of the Higher Powers, no not when the Higher Powers have been rejected, and their Succeſſors appointed by God himſelf. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> petitioned <hi>Rehoboam</hi> for redreſs of Grievances, and after denyal, ten Tribes revolted, but the Spirit of God has all along term'd it Rebellion. Shew me (if it be poſſible) one ſingle Inſtance in all the Changes of Government among them, where God contriv'd, or countenanc't, or the Spirit of God has commended or excus'd the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. But this Point has been ſo learnedly handled, and ſo fully demonſtrated by many Excellent Pens of late, that I think it needleſs at Preſent to enlarge my ſelf farther on this Subject.</p>
            <p>If it be objected that our Caſe is different from the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians, our Religion being the Religion of the State eſtabliſh'd by Law: (And bleſſed be God it is ſo. Let our Mouths be filled with Laughter, and our Tongues with Joy. Let our Hearts be enlarg'd with Thankfulneſs to God, and the King for this Unvaluable Bleſſing. But if for our Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs and Unfruitfulneſs under this Spiritual Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, God as a Puniſhment of our Sins ſhall pleaſe to turn the Hearts of our Rulers, againſt us and the Truths we profeſs) What then? May we revile them; may we by force reſiſt them; may we ſecretly conſpire againſt them; may we murder or eject them? (God forbid.) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon pretence of being the eſtabliſh'd Law of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44204:35"/>
the Land has no better Security thereby, than thoſe Laws by which we lay claim to our Temporal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. It is then only to be conſidered as ſuch, as to the Formal Nature, tho not as to the ſubject Matter of it. So that look how we are to demean our ſelves towards our Governours upon the Violation of our Civil Rights (of which I diſcours'd in the Forenoon) the ſame Courſe we muſt take upon their Breach of Truſt in our Spiritual. We muſt by no means reſiſt, affront, or libel them. We muſt not bring railing Accuſations, nor vent venemous and ſpiteful Words againſt their Honour, Safety and Government. One Special Advantage we have as to our Religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns above our Temporal, <hi>ſc.</hi> the Promiſe of the more immediate Care and Protection of God, whoſe we are, and whom we ſerve, which is an Anchor of the Soul both ſure and ſtedfaſt: that if the Earthly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of our Faith leaves us, God himſelf will receive us under his Wings, and at laſt crown our Sufferings, with a far more Exceeding and Eternal Weight of Glory. But,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I proceed to the Second, which is the Grand Query and Difficulty of all, which many Men of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Sobriety, Men of Intereſt in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try make a mighty Queſtion of. For (ſay they) Saving to the Kings Perſon all due Honour and intire Submiſſion; may we not by Force reſiſt his evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours, his wicked Inſtruments, his Cut-throat Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, thoſe who for baſe and ambitious Ends invade the Peoples Liberties and Properties? I reply, No, you may not; which Concluſion I ſhall back with ſome following Reaſons, in Order whereunto, I muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, firſt,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:44204:35"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That I do not plead for active Obedience, when  the ſubordinate Magiſtrate Acts contrary to Law, but againſt active Reſiſtance only. No good Subject, no honeſt Patriot, ought, neither will become an Inſtrument of Tyranny, a Betrayer of his own, and Fellow Subjects juſt Rights and Priviledges, by actual Complyance and Execution of illegal Commands. If the Kings Miniſters ſhould order me to cut my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Throat, to pillage his Houſe, to levy Taxes upon his Eſtate contrary to Law, I am not bound to obey, nay, I am bound in Conſcience not to obey. But to oppoſe them by Force is on the other Hand unexcuſable before God and Man. It being a Manifeſt Violation of the Publick Peace, and of Worſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the Government than the arbitrary procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Kings Miniſters can be.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> When I affirm, that the Kings Miniſters ought not to be reſiſted by Force, I underſtand only ſuch as are Legally commiſſionated by him. For they, who by a pretended Secret, or Extraordinary Commiſſions (unto which the Government is a Stranger) invade my Perſon or Eſtate, I may oppoſe them and repell Force by Force. The Kings publick and deliberate Will declared in the known unrepeal'd Laws of the Land is to take Place of his private and ſudden Will expreſt in a Secret Warrant or Commiſſion: An Officer employed and acting in ſuch an illegal and extraordinary Manner is not to be lookt upon as the Kings Miniſter, but is to be treated as a Thief and common Enemy, and ſuch he will be found to be in the Judgment of the Kings Laws. I grant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that in this Caſe Reſiſtance may be made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44204:36"/>
but not when the Officer is Legally Commiſſionated. Becauſe, that would be a Breach of the Publick Peace, and a Subverſion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Tumult and Rebellions.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> When I acknowledge that the Kings Officers not Legally Commiſſionated may be reſiſted, I do not thereby intend ſeditious or Tumultuous Reſiſtance, ſuch as is accompanied with Publick diſturbance. I do not impower the Subject to beat up the Drum, to liſt Soldiers, and to march in the Field, in a warlike or riotous Poſture, tho the Kings Miniſters ſhould act never ſo extravagantly. In ſo doing he exceeds his Political Power, and uſurps ſuch an Authority as is expreſly provided againſt by the Law. It is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over a Breach of the Publick Peace, and directly tends unto the Subverſion of the Government. No Reſiſtance can in Conſcience nor with Safety to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth be made, but what is permitted us by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Law of the Land. The Reſiſtance then I allow of in the Caſe put, is ſuch as I am enabled to by the Politick Contract of the State, as appealing to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Courts or Magiſtrates, or in my ſingle Perſon reſiſting the violence Offered to me, ſuch as I may uſe againſt an Highway-man, a Fellon or a Murderer. For they, who, by Virtue of a private Commiſſion from the King, contrary to his known Publick Will publiſh'd in his Laws, invade my Perſon or my Property are no better than Thieves and Rogues, and may by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Force be thus reſiſted, this being ſo far from being a Breach of the Publick Peace, or taking upon me more than by Law belongs to me, as that 'tis but the Execution of the Kings deliberate Will, the Law,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44204:36"/>
and defending my ſelf, as the Law of the Land per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitts me, and as the Law of Nature, Self-preſervation guides me. Theſe things premis'd, I return to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Query propounded, <hi>i. e.</hi> That upon the infringement of our Liberties, or incroachments upon our Civil Intereſts, we may in no wiſe forcibly reſiſt the Kings Legal Miniſters, however Exorbitant and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary they are in the execution of their Power. The reaſons of this concluſion are as follow:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the holy Scripture has plainly laid down our duty of Obedience and Non-reſiſtance of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, as well as of the Supream Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Thus much I hinted in the explication of the Text, that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> with ſo much variety of Phraſe directs <hi>Titus</hi> to put the <hi>Cretians</hi> in mind, that <hi>they be Subject to Principalities and Powers, and Obey Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,</hi> he cannot in my Judgment be thought to trifle ſo long, and by Principalities, Powers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, in the Plural number, only intend all that while the perſon of the Emperour. He muſt alſo mean the Subordinate Miniſters in <hi>Crete.</hi> Beſides I cannot conceive that the Apoſtle ſhould intend to admoniſh them of their duty towards the Emperour only, and to have ſo little regard to the Publick Peace, as to permit them upon every diſguſt and grievance, to move Sedition againſt the Pro-praetors or Deputy Governours of that Iſland. But I will not inſiſt upon this conjectural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, however unqueſtionable it ſeems to me. <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.</note>Yet St. <hi>Peter</hi> is moſt expreſs herein—<hi>Submit your ſelves to the King as Supream, and to Governours as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that are ſent by him, i. e.</hi> unto Subordinate Magiſtrates and Judges commiſſion'd by the King.

The late Writers about Subjection (the more moderate of them, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the People to have a Power of reſiſting only the Subordinate Miniſters of the King, his deſtructive Counſellers and Agents) ſeldom or never take notice of theſe paſſages in the word of God, as far as I have obſerv'd; eſpecially not that of St. <hi>Peter</hi> upon which I lay the greateſt ſtreſs of my argument, and think it unanſwerable. He certainly knew beſt and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly weighed our Lords Doctrine, who firſt violated this Evangelical Canon in cutting off <hi>Malchus</hi>'s Ear (the High Prieſts ſervant) and was roundly reprov'd by Chriſt for ſo doing. And why St. <hi>Peters</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Succeſſors and their Diſciples ſhould ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get themſelves, as to run into the ſame exceſs, as their firſt Founder did, and yet not, as he did, renounce their error, but ſtand obſtinately in the defence of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, no other reaſon can be given, but their blind Zeal of propagating Religion by the Sword, ſince reaſon and argument and exemplary Lives (which are the moſt powerful and the only Goſpel motives
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44204:37"/>
to perſwade) having ſo long ſince fail'd them. For my own part I doubt not to affirm, that as the King within his own Dominions is the Image and Repreſentative of God in the Government of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſo are the inferior Magiſtrates the Image and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives both of God and the King: that as the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Governour is Gods immediate Ordinance, ſo are they, that are ſent by him, the mediate and derivative Ordinance of God. To deal freely with you, I queſtion not that Obedience and Subjection in all its branches, in its utmoſt latitude is due to one as well as t'other: that in caſe of the greateſt outrages committed by them either through neglect, or miſtake, or Paſſion, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt or Revenge, or Servile Flattery of the Princes Humour, the Subject ought not to ſeek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs but by ſuch Peaceable methods as the Law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes and allows: that in the mean time he ought to abſtain from Violent Defence and Active Reſiſtance. For ſo is the Will of God, that we ſuffer Patiently, that we Honour and Reverence, not Revile, not Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel the Perſons of the Subordinate Governours, ſent or commiſſioned by the King. Let no one think here to avoid the ſtrength of this Scripture argument, by diſtinguiſhing between the Government of an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Arbitrary Prince, ſuch were the Emperours of Old, and a mixt or limited Government, as our's is at this day. This makes no difference, gives the Subject no Priviledge of reſiſting the Kings Miniſters The Power of the Subordinate Magiſtrate, is of the ſame Nature in both theſe Governments, limited in the former by the will of the Emperour, in his publick Edicts, and private Inſtructions; limited in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the known Laws of the Nation, let the Prince be Arbitrary, or not, ſtill his Miniſters are always
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44204:38"/>
limited: though they tranſgreſs and depart from their Rule, the People has in neither caſe Liberty, turbulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to defend themſelves, with the breach of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace, the preſervation whereof is ſtill the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Principle and Care of every Government, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abſolute or Limited. For which reaſon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the <hi>Roman</hi> State were directed to appeal unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> as their laſt refuge, and we in this Nation unto the Kings Supreme Court of Juſtice as our only remedy againſt injury; if they fail'd, or we be diſappointed of our expectations, we have nothing more to do, than pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to ſubmit to the Will and Providence of God. This I take to be St. <hi>Peters</hi> Doctrine, and am ſure was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Practice, as is before prov'd; and I lay it down as the firſt Reaſon of my reſolution of the Queſtion under debate. We muſt not forcibly reſiſt the inferiour Magiſtrates, becauſe it is the expreſs Doctrine of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Becauſe violently to reſiſt the Kings Inſtruments Legally commiſſionated by him, is inconſiſtent with our Duty to the Perſon of the King himſelf. By the Doctrine of the Goſpel we are to Love, to Honour the Kings Perſon, not Libelling Him, not defaming Him. What is the meaning of this? We are not to bring into Queſtion his Abilities, his Juſtice, his Wiſdom, his Vigilance, his Integrity, his Fidelity to his Oaths and Aſſurances given us of Good and Legal Government.</p>
            <p>But he who by Force reſiſts the Kings Officers, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours the Kings Perſon, and Stains his reputation in all thoſe reſpects: by his turbulency and ſturdy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Magiſtrate, he does in effect tell the World, that the King is unable or unwilling to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him, reſolved to cruſh and oppreſs him: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſuggeſts the Higher Power, to be either Fool or
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44204:38"/>
Knave, or Tyrant, or Perjur'd, under which imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons 'tis diſhonourable for him to Lie. For no man that thinks his Prince able to defend him, will Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly defend himſelf. No one that judges him upright, but will peaceably appeal to him, none that believes him a Man of Honour and Conſcience, will queſtion to be relieved by him, and his Superior Courts of Juſtice. In a word, there can be no reſiſtance, no affront Offer'd to the Kings Miniſters, but tends directly to the Diſhonour of the Kings Perſon. The King has the ſame reaſon to complain of thoſe that Violently perſecute his Miniſters, as God had of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whom nothing would ſatisfy but to have <hi>Samuel</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd—<hi>They have not rejected thee, but they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected</hi>

And again as upon pretence of Putrefaction to lop off all the Members one after another, is certain deſtruction both to the Body and the Head, which cannot conſiſt without the Integral parts: ſo they who will never acknowledg the Prince to have any faithful Servants and Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, but are ſtill ready to cut <hi>them</hi> off ſo ſoon as <hi>they</hi> are received into his Favour and Service, whatever kindneſs they make ſhow of to him; yet forcing him to be thus Naked and to ſhift for himſelf, leaving him

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> To uſe Force againſt the Kings Legal Inſtruments is a Breach of the Publick Peace, Fruſtration of the Chief Ends of Society, the Good of the People, and endangers the Diſſolution of the whole Frame of Government. For without Order and peaceable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, there is nothing but Confuſion and Violence, and perfect Anarchy, our Perſons, our Lives, our Liberties and Properties (when once a Civil War is commenc't) being expos'd to the Dominion and Cruelty, and Avarice of the Revengeful and Succeſsful Conqueror. And becauſe I have made the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Publick Peace, the Ground of much of my Reaſoning in this Diſcourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I the rather chooſe here a little to enlarge my ſelf upon that Topick. I ſhall readily grant (if it be demanded) that the Good of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned is the firſt Reaſon, and the great End of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: but the next, and in order to it is the Publick Peace, which is the very Life and Soul of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and abſolutely neceſſary to the Peoples, both Private and Political Happineſs. As therefore 'tis the Princes Office by any means to ſecure it, ſo it is the Subjects Duty and Intereſt to keep it, tho with the loſs of their private perſonal Concernments. Peace is an unvaluable Bleſſing, like that rich Jewell in the Goſpel, 'tis Worth our while to ſell all we have for the purchaſe of it. I have ſeldom read (nor does it often happen,) that the Subjects Circumſtances were ſo hard, their Condition ſo miſerable, where 'twas worth
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44204:39"/>
their while to hazard their Lives and Fortunes by Civil Diſcord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pax bello potior</hi> ſeems to be a Rule almoſt without Exception: But that other <hi>ex bello pax</hi> is a Motto fit only for Traitors and Ufurpers to ſtamp upon their Medals. Let any underſtanding Man ſit down, and with himſelf calmly conſider, how eaſy it is, when once the Sacred Bonds of Civil Peace are broke) for a forraign Enemy to invade and enſlave the Nation; what Devaſtations are made, what Detriment ſuſtain'd in private Eſtates, how much Time and Expenſe of Treaſure is required before any tolerable Settlement can be made; how eaſy 'tis for the Conqueror to ſet up a Tyrannical and Arbitrary Government, which is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Iſſue of Domeſtick Wars; at leaſt, how ſtrangely the Government is weakened, how univerſally the People are debauch't, how difficult 'tis for them to recover both their Publick and Private Loſſes. Where is that wiſe Man, and indued with Knowledge? Let him tell me, whether 'tis not much better, more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and Heroick to flying over Board all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, yea and ſuffer himſelf, with <hi>Jonah</hi> to be caſt into the Sea, for the Preſervation of his Fellow-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, rather than the Ship of the Common-wealth ſhould ſink in the Waves of Popular Inſurrections.</p>
            <p>The Safety therefore of the Government and of the Governours, and the Good of the Governed being thus cloſely twiſted with the Publick Peace, they who take upon them violently to reſiſt and engage the People in Rebellion, do by conſequence overthrow the Ends of Society, and reduce us into that Condition, (which ſome Men call the State of Nature,) wherein every Man having a <hi>General Right to every thing,</hi> but <hi>a Particular Right to nothing,</hi> we ſight and devour one
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44204:40"/>
another. And which is the worſt of all, when we are weary of our Diſſenſions, and an End is put to the Quarrel, the Iſſue is ſeldom to the Advantage of the Subject. We may alter the Government, but for the Worſe: we may change our Maſters, but not eaſe our Shoulders from thoſe Grievances, we formerly groan'd under. 'Tis eaſy to fore-ſee theſe Inconveniencies by the Eye of Reaſon; and Experience, which is the Miſtreſs of Fools, will abundantly convince us of them. But,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Becauſe, when ever we Preachers inforce this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from the practice of Holy Men recorded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or other Inſtances out of Profane or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory, ſtill the Diverſity of Government is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as a ſufficient Bar to the Force of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I ſhall in the laſt Place make good my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from the expreſs Statute Law of the Land. And whereas I could produce ſeveral Acts of Parliament to this purpoſe, yet Chooſing rather to keep my ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Compaſs, within my own Sphere, being unwilling to ſeem too pert and buſy in other Mens Province, I ſhall not give my ſelf the Trouble to examine <hi>Cook</hi> and other Learned Digeſters of our Laws, nor to ſearch the Rolls in the <hi>Tower:</hi> Yet I hope I may be allowed to take my own Book into my Hand without Offence, and put you in Remembrance of that Declaration and Acknowledgement, which I have more than once made. You may meet with it in that Publick Act prefixt before the Liturgy in theſe Words—<hi>I do declare that it is not Lawful upon any Pretence, whatever to take Arms againſt the King, and that I do abhor that Traiterous Poſition of Taking up Arms by his Authority againſt his Perſon, or againſt thoſe that are Commiſſionated by him.</hi> So that to take up Arms, to reſiſt the Kings Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44204:40"/>
and Officers having his Commiſſion, is Treaſon; To maintain the Legality of it is traiterous, and to be abhorred. And hence you ſee that 'twas no Crime, nor Scandal in ſixty two to be an Abhorrer, even in the Judgment of the Wiſdom of the whole Nation. If I ſhould be told, that this Declaration was intended only for the Clergy and School-Maſters to ſubſcribe, I ſhall acknowledge that True: but muſt by the way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, what Opinion our Law-givers then had of thoſe who would be thought the only Preachers of Chriſt and him Crucifyed, but it ſeems were ſuſpected as the vileſt Diſturbers of the Government, and moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Incendiaries of the Common-wealth. And ſince ſo great Truſt is repoſed in thoſe who take upon them theſe Employments, ſince they have Opportunity (if they will) to debauch the Underſtandings of their Diſciples, our Law-givers judged it neceſſary to oblige them to that Declaration, and only to admit ſuch, of whoſe Fidelity to the Peace of the Nation they were aſſured, and of whoſe indeavours of inſtilling no tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and treaſonable Principles into the Ears and Minds of the People they were competently ſecure. However tho the Clergy and School-Maſters only are obliged unto that Acknowledgement; yet if the Taking up Arms againſt thoſe that are Commiſſionated by the King is to be abhorred by us, and is in its ſelf traiterous, then certainly no Subjects ought to reſiſt the Kings Miniſters: the Poſition of its Lawfulneſs being Traiterous, the Execution thereof can be no leſs then Treaſon. But that the People may Lawfully and Conſcientiouſly commit Treaſon, is a Solaeciſm in Government as well as Hereſy in Divinity. Hence the Phanſie of the Author of that Book, entituled <hi>A Treatiſe of Monarchy,</hi> is plainly confuted, who argues
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44204:41"/>
tho not for a Legal Power expreſt in the Political Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, yet for a Moral, Natural Tranſcendent Power (implyed in all Conſtitutions) for the People to reſiſt the Kings Miniſters and Deſtructive Inſtruments. To aſſert this Lawful upon any pretence, whatever is you ſee traiterous, the enterprice is therefore Treaſon, ſtrictly and expreſly provided againſt by the Law of the Land. So much for the Reaſons of my Anſwer to this Queſtion.</p>
            <p>And thus I have ſaid, (as breifly, as I could) what I thought fit upon this Argument, expecting now to be anſwered in the Words of the Diſciples—<hi>This is an hard Saying, who can hear it?</hi> What? may we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our ſelves againſt Manifeſt Injury, againſt Unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Oppreſſion, when all other Relief is denied us, when there is no other Way left to avoid the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of Tyranny and Slavery? If this be our Caſe, who are Chriſtians (as you have ſtated it,) then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well all our Temporal Intereſts, we are then the moſt wretched People in the World. With what eaſe than may ambitious Men and corrupt Magiſtrates trample on us? Where is the Law of Nature, that Great, that Royal Law of ſelf Preſervation? In Anſwer hereunto, I ſhall readily grant, that 'tis an hard Chapter, not eaſily read or believed, not willingly digeſted by Fleſh and Blood. 'Tis one of thoſe high and difficult Points, which I do not expect ſhould take Root in the Heart of every Half-thick Chriſtian and temporary Believer. Either the wicked one Will catch away this Seed ſown, or Perſecution, or the Cares of this Life, or the Deceitfulneſs of Riches, or the Love of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and of this World will choke it. But I would deſire Men of Underſtanding and Integrity (for that ſuch only I can hope to prevail,) to recollect my
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44204:41"/>
reaſons; and moreover to conſider with themſelves, how that there are many other ſtrict Precepts laid upon us by our bleſſed Lord, no leſs difficult in themſelves, and altogether as repugnant to the Law of Nature Self preſervation. How often, how peremptorily are we commanded in general <hi>to crucifie our ſelves to the world, and the world to us? to mortifie our earthly members,</hi> to moderate our ſelves in the deſire and fruition even of ſuch things which nature prompts us to, and allows us; <hi>to vanquiſh our Paſſions, which,</hi> as the Wiſe man tells us, <hi>is a more heroick atchievement than to conquer a City.</hi>

And is it not much more reaſon, that we avoid appearance of evil, and offences towards our Superiors and Rulers, than towards one another?

I would once again here ask, Why may not our Religion be ſuppos'd to reſtrain and interpret the general Law of Nature Self preſervation, in the point of Subjection and Non-reſiſtance of Authority, as well as in the caſe of private Revenge? Why ſhould we not be thought oblig'd to cut off one of <hi>our hands, or feet,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 29.</note>and <hi>to pluck out our right eyes</hi> (thoſe darling, uſefull and neceſſary Members) for the ſake of Publick Peace, as well as to avoid Private Offences.</p>
            <p>It is no ſmall argument to me of the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God in ſetting his ſtamp and approbation upon the precept of Subjection; that to our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Contracts he has ſuperadded an immediate tye of Conſcience in the Revelation of his Will: That God,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44204:42"/>
who beſt knows our Hearts, the frowardneſs of our Wills, the violence of our Paſſions, the ſtubborneſs of our Affections, what Lovers of our ſelves we naturally are, what partial Judgers of our own Rights and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, has therefore thought good to incloſe that Law of Nature Self preſervation, allowing it unto us in no caſe to the breach or hazard of the publick Peace of the Commonwealth. And if I may not defend my ſelf againſt the injuries of my private Brother and Fellow Citizen, but as the Law and the Peace of the State permits, how ſhall I challenge that Liberty in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and tumultuous reſiſtance of the Civil Magiſtrate? God, who is a God of Order and not of Confuſion, has himſelf ſo diſpos'd and methodiz'd the Polities and earthly Governments of men, as that 'tis impoſſible (if we would Conſcienciouſly attend our duty) that Wars, and Fightings, and cutting of Throats ſhould in any wiſe be juſtifiable. If ſo, then Government is defective and in effect diſſolv'd; then is not Magiſtracy the Ordinance of God, but at the Will of the People, and alterable at their pleaſure, when ever they think fit to quarrel at the Princes conduct, or at his Miniſters pretended outrages and encroachments. For where every one may do what is right in his own eyes, that State which admits the Subject in any caſe whatever to call the Rulers to account, to puniſh or to dethrone them, or to make any violent changes in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, there is no Government at all among them, but Anarchy and Confuſion, and every evil work. But</p>
            <p>To draw to a Concluſion, theſe Diſcourſes (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs) adminiſter but cold Comfort to the greateſt part of men, who (like Beaſts) live by Senſe and not by Reaſon, are led by an exceſſive Love of themſelves,

You have the conſideration of the natural frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your earthly Governours to comfort and to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold you. Though <hi>they are Gods,</hi> bearing the image of God in the Political Government, yet <hi>are they but</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 82. 7.</note>meer moral <hi>men, whoſe breath is in their Noſtrils; they muſt die like men, and fall like Princes.</hi> Look, how dieth the greateſt Potentate? even as the meaneſt Subject. There will be no difference between you and them at the Great day, the day of Judgment. They muſt (then at leaſt whatever privilege they claim in this life) give an account at the Tribunal of God, where there will be no reſpect of perſons, where there Cruelty and Tyranny (if they are guilty of any) and all their Kingcraft and Myſteries of State will be diſclos'd, and muſt be anſwer'd. The dread and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of which laſt Aſſizes will in a great meaſure check their exorbitances, and put ſuch manicles on their hands, that ofttimes <hi>the things they would they</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:44204:43"/>
               <hi>cannot do; and what they would not, even that they do againſt their wills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet farther, you have the conſideration of the ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of many ill principled Subjects among you, who (though not to be juſtified yet) are as a bullwark to the peaceable and conſcientious. There is a ſhrew'd Proverb among us, Oppreſſion will make a Wiſe man mad, much more the Wicked and the Rebellious. In the utmoſt extremities, there will riſe up men (not ſtrictly conſcientious, but) of undaunted natural ſpirit and courage, that will not ſtick to break through all the honds of Duty and Obedience, and with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their Lives and Fortunes endeavour to redreſs intolerable Grievances. And thus their Sin through the righteous Judgment of God may prove the ſecurity. But why do I mention theſe things? I ſee no neceſſity of this Diſcourſe. I know not wherefore we ſhould entertain ſuch odd ſuſpicions of our Magiſtrates, as to ſupport our ſelves with the probability of their diſaſters. Let us be more juſt and charitable towards them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting of them as men of Honour and Honeſty as well as our ſelves; that know their duty, and will lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably diſcharge it out of a principle of Conſcience. They cannot be ignorant of this one thing, that the end of Government and the meaſure of their Power is the good of the People. There is likewiſe the Oath of God upon them, that they will Govern according to Law. And what other aſſurance would any man wiſh for? 'Tis more I am ſure than many among us will give for <hi>their</hi> peaceable demeanour. He that is not content herewith 'tis impoſſible to ſatisfie him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by delivering up the reigns of Government into his hand, and then the Subject can ſtill have no better ſecurity than an Oath. An Oath is the end of all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44204:44"/>
ſtrife among men, and 'tis the higheſt Aſſurance God has or can give us of the righteouſneſs of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Providence. He that thinks not this ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient is not fit to live in this world, unworthy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Society of men, and the benefit of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides, it is the Intereſt of Governours that the Subjects Rights and Properties be maintain'd, that they ſhould be ſecur'd and encourag'd in their Labours, and reap the fruit of their Induſtry and Improvements, the Riches of the People being the Glory, the Strength, and the Riches of the Prince; and therefore if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will not, yet at leaſt his Intereſt will incline him unto moderation in the exerciſe of Dominion. I ſhall yet farther add, that you have the Security of your Fellow Subjects, ſuch I mean as are wiſe and conſcientious, that will not be deſtructive inſtruments, nor actively aſſiſt in oppreſſing the people contrary to Law. As for others, Fear will in ſome meaſure check many of them, and the Law of the Land will curb them. The crys of the afflicted Subjects will at length reach the ears of the Prince, and neceſſity of State will prevail with him to deliver up his evil Counſellors as a ſacrifice to the peoples diſcontents. Yea (as the caſe now ſtands with us) the Kings Officers, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated by him being puniſhable by Law, as I take it, for their illegal proceedings, there is little ground to fear, tis hardly poſſible any barbarous or unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable miſchief ſhould ariſe in our Government; and the moſt that can in likelihood happen, will be much more eligible than the breach of the publick Peace, and the violent overthrow of the preſent Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Finally, my Brethren, give me leave to add; count me not a flatterer if I ſpeak it out of the reach of his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44204:44"/>
Sacred Ears, when I conſider the perſon of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Prince, the ſweetneſs of his Nature, our long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the mildneſs of his Government, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Peace, plenty and increaſe of Trade, which we have long enjoy'd under him: When I recollect how ſtrictly and impartially righteouſneſs and juſtice is executed among us, he ſeldom or never obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courſe of the Law; except it be in extending his mercy and pardon to unfortunate Criminals, which is the heighth and pride of his good nature; and wherein he may be ſaid truly to reſemble God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But otherwiſe let me ask you, whoſe Ox has he taken, whoſe Aſs has he ſeiz'd, who has he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded or Oppreſſed, whoſe Life, whoſe Property has he invaded, whoſe Liberty has he illegally or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably reſtrain'd in Priſon, or in Exile? When I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Charity in forgiving us, his Readineſs to oblige us, the freſh aſſurances we have of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Law; when I here of foreign Princes admiring his Wiſdom, and courting his Friendſhip, as much perhaps as <hi>Sheba</hi> did <hi>Solomons;</hi> when I ſee the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and afflicted Subjects of other Nations ſeeking and finding ſhelter under his wings; when I read thoſe but juſt thanks and commendations they return him, whilſt they admire the prudence and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Conduct, the protection and quietneſs we our ſelves receive from him: Yea, when in a Seditious Author, I met with this Teſtimony of his Royal Grace and goodneſs,—<hi>That he never made uſe of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Voice, or denied his Aſſent but to one publick Act only:</hi> And whereas one of the worſt of his Enemies has allow'd him this Character, <hi>That he is a Prince un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe diſpleaſure his adverſaries fall gently.</hi> In fine, ſince I cannot but behold and admire his Wiſdom in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44204:45"/>
the choice of the ſubordinate Magiſtrates, whoſe Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Learning and Integrity is conſpicuous amongſt us, I cannot forbear, not only out of duty to the Divine Ordinance, but in gratitude and thankfulneſs to God and the King, acknowledge our preſent happineſs and ſecurity: Not only put you in mind to be ſubject to Principalities and Powers, and to obey Magiſtrates; but alſo offer up my Prayers to God,—<hi>That he would grant the King a long Life and abundance of Years, at home Peace, and Victory abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Loyal Senate, and a faithful People, a quiet World, and a ſecure Reign: And in fine, that God would inſpire us all with ſuch a meaſure of his Grace, that by our patience, peaceableneſs and chearful ſubjection, our preſent happineſs may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill longer unto us under his Government, and his Succeſſours that ſhall come after him; that we and the Ages to come may lead quiet and peaceable Lives, in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>
