            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That lyke tryall as was bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the ſayde Elias, and all Baals prophetes, bi the offring of ſacrifice, may be now openly and only by the holy ſcriptures written, after the trew litterall ſence: betwene one ſuche of the elect in Chriſt &amp; the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of our markt miniſters: that lykewyſe al the multitude of them, nowe may confer their lernyngꝭ together: or ſeuerally

Wherfore if our marked men, hauyng much ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, had alſo the gyfte of the holyghoſt in them, as they haue not, it were not poſſible for any man to diſproue their doctrine and conuerſacion with the holy ſcriptures written, which wer

of the goſpell, but for the bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng of all thynges whiche he promyſed therein, dooyng all thynges alſo in ſpirit which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the eſtabliſhment therof. mat. xxviii. d. Whervuto the promyſe of euerlaſtyng lyfe is made, and not otherwiſe: for God doth abhor all vaine hope, Ieremy. ii. g. which is not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyſſhed in a perfecte faythe, wholly agreable vnto hys word Epheſians the  .iiii. chapiter. c. Wherfore if we ſhoulde beleue any mans opinion to be good &amp; godly doctrine, in any thynge more or leſſe then is written within the holi ſcriptures, or in any thing contrarye to the true literall ſence thereof, whereby ſhuld we know whoſe opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ought to beleue. For euery part
<pb facs="tcp:9635:38"/>
of the holy ſcripture ſpoken by the holigoſt. for our inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of lyke aucthoritie. and may no more be altered from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall ſence in one place then in an other. But I ſpeake not of the parables which chriſt ſpake to the hygh learned Scribes &amp; Phariſeys, the predeſeſſors of our marked men, to whom thei do ſuccede in lyke power of the Beaſt, beyng of a long tyme aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended oute of the bot homleſſe pit. Apoca, xiii. a. and. xvii. b. But I ſpeake of the plain decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which Chriſt made of al parables to his Diſciples: For he declared all thynges plainly vnto them. Mar. iiii. c. And ſo lykewiſe all other partes of the holy ſcriptures be euident and playne to all them whiche haue
<pb facs="tcp:9635:38"/>
the ſame gyſte of the holyghoſt, which the holy ſcriptures were ſpoken by. Ihon. xvii. c. d. Howe beit if any parte therof be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the true meanyng of the literall ſence, we are vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne what to beleue more of it, for becauſe that then diuerſe men might make diuerſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretacions, as thei haue doone in tymes paſt. And few of them agree one with another, &amp; yet euery man coloured his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the holy ſcriptures. And he that had moſt ſophiſtical con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueiaunce &amp; temporall power to maintain his opinion with all, was beſt beleued: So that our marked men hauyng the vpper hand, ſuppreſt the truth alway by terible impriſonmente and death: For they made the fyer
<pb facs="tcp:9635:39"/>
to defend them agaynſt al thoſe people which profeſſed the true religion of the goſpel of Chriſt. Wherefore whoſoeuer beleueth any part of their doctrine to be good &amp; godly in any thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g which is contrary to that that is writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten within the holy ſcriptures after the playne literall ſence thereof, is clearely deſtitute of al true belefe. For no man hath aucthoritie to alter the literall ſence of the holy ſcriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other manifeſt ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures written. For that was the inuention of the deuyll, and executed by our marked men, &amp; other ſuch his miniſters: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they deluded all people. For of the holy ſcriptures there is but oue true ſence whiche is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly &amp; plainly expreſſed in the
<pb facs="tcp:9635:39"/>
letter thereof, beyng compared together: ſo that ther is no part of it repugnant one agaynſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. But becauſe that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men can not do that which the ſcripture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in the letter, therfore they beleue not that the literal ſence is always true: For thei eonſider uot that there is a new creacion by God aboue nature, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery man whiche in Chriſt is a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. ii.

And that thereby they doo that which the letter of the holye Scripture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth. For they vnderſtande not that Article of their faythe, that the true catholyke people in Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:9635:40"/>
do the wyll of God by the power of the holy goſt. Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. iiii. c. And that onely by that lawe of the ſpirite of lyfe, Chriſt hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered vs from the lawe of ſyn &amp; death. Roma. viii a. Neither they perceyue not the deuiſion betwene the ſpirite &amp; the fleſh, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of Chriſt is not in theim. For it is not poſſible for any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to diſcerne the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that which he knoweth not of: Wherfore that was the moſt principalleſt parte of our markte me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s doctrine, to make the people to beleue that there was no ſuch ſpirite geuen vnto man wherby he ſhould remaine righteous alway in Chriſt, the Epiſtle of Ihon. iiii. a. Whiche is the moſt deuelyſh error that maye be, becauſe it breedeth a
<pb facs="tcp:9635:40"/>
a doubte in all them that be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected there with, whether the Holy Scripture be true or not, beyng written by men hauyng but the very ſelfe ſame Spirite of Chriſt that all other reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable people hath, whiche ſhall be euer laſtingly ſaued in chriſt. Act. ii. f. the firſt Corin. xii. b. Notwithſtandyng in outward miniſtracion, the Apoſtles had power to doo that whiche other membres of the ſame miſticall body of Chriſt can not doo: as in doyng of miracles, &amp; other thynges. Lyke as in a corporal bodye, euery membre hathe not one office, neither one membre can doo the offece of an other, neuertheles, euery liuely me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of a corporall bodye hath lyfe &amp; felyng in them. And euen ſo ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe
<pb facs="tcp:9635:41"/>
euery membre of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body of Chriſt hath one ſpirite &amp; one intelligence of the worde of God and one purpoſe of herte in all godlyneſſe, the fyrſt to the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the xii. chapiter d. Epheſians the  .iiii. a. c. Ezechiell. xi. d, aud. xxxvi. f. So that, aduiſedly &amp; willyngly they dooe nothyng agaynſt the wyll of god. the Epiſtle of Ihon the  .iii. chapiter. v. Therfore the holy Scriptures in the trewe literall ſence is ſufficiente for their outwarde inſtruction in all godly doctrine. For within the letter of the New Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t there is ſufficient inſtruction concernyng the true Religion of the goſpell, among all them which beleue it to be true in the literall ſence. And who ſo euer

dothe not ſo beleue it, beleueth nor knoweth nothynge that is good. Luke. xvi. g. i.

For what leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueliſh preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption is it to thinke the holy ſcripture vnſufficient or vnperfect in the literal ſence for all godly inſtruction, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a playne deniall of Chriſt. For Chriſt is included in the worde, and the word in Chriſt. Ihon, the fyrſt chap. a. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to thynke the worde inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, is to thynke Chriſt is inſufficient, &amp; alſo the holy goſt to be vnperfect, which wrought alwayes in them that wrote it. by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo it hath ben alwaies preſerned, &amp; ſhalbe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worldes

Which ſcripture doth alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly &amp; plainly declare vnto vs, that the Apoſtles lefte no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge vnwritten whiche was proffitable to oure faythe, but haue declared the whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell of God, beyng nedefull for vs to know. act. xx. d. e. g. neuertheles lyke as wee haue promyſes of mercy in Chriſt, ſo haue we war nyng by Chriſt. Math. xxiiii. Marke. xiii. Luke. xxi. that many ſhould come in his name ſaiyng: I am Chriſt: &amp; ſhoulde diſceiue many. &amp; cet. Wherfore note this, that Chriſt ment not that many ſhoulde name them ſelues Chriſt, as it wer by their proper names: but this worde Chriſt hath this ſignificacion, to be anoynted of GOD, or to
<pb facs="tcp:9635:42"/>
haue a godly power: For Ieſus was anoynted of god: and had alſo the godlye power in hym. Wherfore he is called Iheſus Chriſt, an only ſauyour anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, for the iuſtificacion of all his elect people from ſyn. Mat. i. So that all thoſe men, which hath taken vpon them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parte of his office in remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſynne, ſaiyng they haue power geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them ſo to do, hath in ſo ſaiyng ſaid thei were chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes theim ſelues, becauſe they take that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them which was appoynted by GOD onely for Chriſt to doo. Neuertheleſſe by the regeneracion of the ſpirite of Chriſt, all the electe people of God haue power to knowe &amp; to declare whoſe ſynnes GOD hath forgeuen in Chriſt, &amp; alſo
<pb facs="tcp:9635:43"/>
whoſe ſynnes he dothe retayne to iudgement. For the Spirite of Chriſt is the onely key of the Kyngdome of Heauen, whiche was promyſed to the faythe of ſaynt Peters confeſſion. Mat. xvi. c. For fayth is the gyfte of God &amp; maketh vs righteous. And the gyfte of the holy ghoſt which is the Spirite of Chriſt, maketh vs perfecte bothe in knowledge and power to dooe the wyll of God in ſpirite. But faythe of it ſelfe hathe neither perfecte knowledge of the holy Scriptures, neither power to doo that whiche the Scripture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth: for that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth onely by the gyfte of the holye ghoſt after fayth, ſometime im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, as we reade.

And doo vſe alſo to miniſter to theim in chyldhod, a certayne oyle or greaſe, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Confirmacion of their Baptyſme, makynge the ignorant people to beleue that that is the gyft of the holy goſt, lyke as Mahomet made the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ople to beleue that the holy goſt in the lykenes of a doue. taught hym what doctrine he ſhoulde teache the people. Howbeit, the deluſion of Mahomet ꝭ preeſtes now at this preſent tyme is not ſo muche to be merueyled at, as the deluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our markte men. becauſe Machometes preeſtes doo liue according to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, &amp; alſo th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

whiche bee written vnto them: but our marked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liue cleane contrary to the true profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the goſpell, and contrary to the example of Chriſt, &amp; of all his Apoſtles, &amp; alſo miniſtreth craf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty doctrine, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the holy Scriptures written. Wherfore the acceptyng of them as trew miniſters of the Goſpell, is not onely a declaracion of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in godly knowledge, but alſo a declaracion of blyndneſſe of naturall reaſon. For howe may reaſon conceyue truthe to be in them, in whome ſo muche falſhed is founde. Wherefore what worldly affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſo euer we haue to them, we ought only to be ruled by the worde of God written, vſyng them but lyke as natural me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do vſe the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres
<pb facs="tcp:9635:45"/>
of their naturall bodyes. For a natural man which hath rotten teethe in hys head, that dothe neuer reſt from paynfull ache, wyll ſeeke a remedy: but if he canne haue none, he wyll haue hys rotten teethe drawen out of his head, rather then to haue all his bodye continuallye diſquyeted. And euen ſo lykewyſe our Marked men are lyke vnto rotten teeth: for they can not miniſter the woorde of God as they ought to doo. And as for the ſpiritual ache, which al godli people haue bi them, we ſee playnly that the hyghe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers haue ſoughte as muche the reformacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them as may be, &amp; yet they be as craftye as euer they were, diſguiſyng themſelfe

with ſophiſticall hipocriſy, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new or olde, as faſt as euer thei did, &amp; the deuyl is as fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier with them as euer he was: Wherfore God ſend vs remedy of them ſhortly. Howbeit, moſt men be in lyke caſe with theim as women bee with their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rottes: for women vſe muche diligence to make theire Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rottes to ſpeake, &amp; yet with all their diligence. they canne not make them to talke ſo reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli as a reſonable creature can. And no more can no man make thoſe miniſters which be onely appoynted by me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to declare the true meanyng of the woorde of God, ſo playnly and truly as it ought to be, whatſoeuer be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed for them. For the true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandyng of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb facs="tcp:9635:46"/>
