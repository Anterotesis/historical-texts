            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore We enter upon the buſineſſe of the day, I muſt, in diſcarge of my duty, ſpeak freely to you of the laſt dayes work which lyes ſo heavy upon us, that if we finde not ſome way to free our ſelves of the ſcandall and diſhonour of that day, farewell the reputation of this Councell, and of this City. We ſent a Petition lately to His Majeſtie, by ſix worthy Members of this Court, if you will beleeve them, they received a very gracious entertainment from His Majeſtie; and if you will beleeve moſt wiſe men, they brought a very gracious Anſwer back from His Majeſtie, with directions by a Servant of His own, that the ſame ſhould be communicated to the whole Citie, from whom the Petition was preſumed to be ſent, a Circumſtance as gracious as the matter it ſelfe. See now how we have required him: His Meſſenger ſtaies tenne dayes at the leaſt before we can vouchſafe to ſpeak with him, whereas ours ſtayed not an houre for admiſſion to His Majeſtie, and but a day for an anſwer: upon the r<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ceipt of our Petition, His Majeſtie ſpake very graciouſly of the Citie, very affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately of the moſt conſiderable part of it; when his Anſwer is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95416:3"/>
read (an Anſwer I muſt tell you, worth another manner of debate) Strangers are admitted to make bitter invective Speeches againſt it, and the King that ſent it; Whileſt no honeſt Citizen, who have onely right to ſpeake here, durſt ſpeake his Conſcience for fear of having his Throat cut as he went home. Think (Gentlemen) what an encouragement we have given His Majeſtie to treat &amp; correſpond with us, whileſt he is thus uſed; I am farre from undervaluing both, or either Houſe of Parliament, I have been often a Member of the Houſe of Commons, and know well my duty to it; but though their Priviledges are infinitely grown and enlarged ſince that time, I hope they have not ſwallowed up all other mens; though they are the great Councell and Court of the Kingdom, yet there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Councells and Courts too, what do we elſe here? And though they have a great Liberty of Language within their own walls, I never heard that they might ſpeak what they liſt in other places. In my time when there was any occaſion to uſe the Citie, as often there was, the Lord Major, or Aldermen, or ſome truſted by them, were ſent for to attend either Houſe, but for Members of either or both Houſes to come hither, and be preſent at Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and govern here by Priviledge of Parliament, was never heard of till of late: you will ſay 'tis a great Honour to us, that thoſe worthies take the pains to come to us, when they might ſend for us, it may be an honour too great for us to beare, and truly, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it hath been ſo chargeable to us, that we ought not to be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of ſuch honour. Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> (who hath been a very coſtly O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator to us) told us, (and his ſpeech is ſince printed for our honour too, to ſhew how tame a People we are) that there were many things in that Anſwer of great aſperſion upon the proceedings of Parliament, and ſo forth. Truly I know no ſuch thing, if we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned for Peace, we were to expect His Majeſtie would tell us by what means that Peace came to be diſturbed, and then preſcribe us a means for our reparation. If any mans guilt hath made him thinke himſelf concerned in it, though he be not named, he is his own Accuſer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95416:3"/>
He told us that there was no occaſion given by any Tumults which might juſtly cauſe His Majeſties departure, and this he ſaid was the opinion of both Houſes, and his proof was, becauſe His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie came into the Citie without a Guard, and dined at the Sheriffes next day after his comming to the Houſe of Commons, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back again to <hi>White-hall,</hi> where he ſtayed ſome dayes, I am willing to beleeve both Houſes as farre as I am able, and if they had declared that it had been Lawfull to beat the King out of Town I muſt have ſate ſtill with wonder; but when they declare to us matter of fact, which is equally within our own knowledge, and wherein we cannot be deceived, they muſt pardon me if I differ from them. If they ſhould declare, that they have paid us all the Money they owe us, or that there is no Croſſe ſtanding in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> could we beleeve them? Why, Gentlemen, neither of theſe is better known to us, then that there were ſuch Tumults at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, as might very well make the King think Himſelf in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. We all well remember what excellent company flocked by <hi>White-hall</hi> every day, for a week before the King went to the Houſe of Commons, and for His comming to the <hi>Guild-hall</hi> the next day, when he did us ſo much honour, to vouchſafe us ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſatisfaction, and came without a Guard, to ſhew how much He truſted in our Duty and Affection. (I pray God the deceiving that truſt may never riſe in Judgement againſt this Citie,) we too well remember the rude carriage of many people to Him as He went to the Sheriffs to Dinner, which was not ſo much as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by any Officer; and we all know what paſſed the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, when an Alarum was given, that there was an attempt from <hi>White hall</hi> upon the Citie, and ſo all men put into ſuddain Arms, and if by the great induſtry and dexterity of Our good Lord Major, that Hubbub had not been appeaſed, God knows what might have followed, if you will beleeve ſome men, they will tell you the Deſign of thoſe who gave that Alarum, was no leſſe then to pull down <hi>White-hall.</hi> There is no queſtion but there was cauſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95416:4"/>
enough for His Majeſtie to remove from <hi>White-hall,</hi> and how qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly he ſtayed after at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and at <hi>Windſor,</hi> cannot be forgotten, not to ſpeak of that Army by Land and Water, which accompanied the Perſons Accuſed to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the next day after His Majeſties return, the danger of which was ſo great, that no honeſt man could have wiſhed the King had runne the hazard of it by ſtaying.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie ſeems to be ſenſible that the Government of this Citie is now ſubmitted to the Arbitrary Power of a few deſperate Perſons, to which the Gentleman gave us this teſtimony from both Houſes, that we had in moſt of the great occaſions, concerning the Government of the Citie, followed their direction; Troth Gentlemen, would they had furniſhed us with a better Anſwer. Have we our Charter by the Grace and Favour of the two Houſes, or by the Goodneſſe of the King? Have we thoſe Priviledges with Forraign Princes, by which many here have gotten ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, by the power of the Houſes, or by the Protection of the King? Why ſhould we then govern the City by the direction of both Houſes? I am not willing to ſpeak ſlightly of any Perſons got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into Authority, onely we may ſay, there be ſome amongſt us, we did not thinke two yeers ago to have met here, and yet we were wont to ſee an Alderman comming a dozen yeer off. I cannot tell what you mean by Arbitrary power, but I am ſure we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by nothing we were uſed to be governed by. I have been Lord Major my ſelf, in a pleaſanter time then this, and ſhould have ſome ſhare ſtill in the Government, before God, I have no more Authority in the Citie, then a Porter, not ſo much as an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermanbury</hi> Porter. If to be governed by People whoſe Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we know not, and by Rules which no body ever heard of, or can know, be a ſigne of Arbitrary Power, we have as much of it as heart can wiſh.</p>
            <p>To the Kings charge of our Contributing for the maintenance of the Army which had given Him Battell, we were told that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95416:4"/>
practices were made againſt the Parliament before they made any preparation for their defence. By practices I think they mean Feares and Jealouſies, for all the particulars mentioned by Him we know, and are underſtood by all the Boyes in the ſtreet; but we are ſure there were ten thouſand men raiſed and armed out of this Town, and the neighbour Counties, before the King had ſeven hundred. To the danger the Kings Perſon was in (at the thought whereof every honeſt heart trembles) the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man told us they were ſorry for it, I dare not tell you what I think their ſorrow was. But (Maſters) if you knew how much your Eſtates, and Being depends upon the life and ſafety of our good King, you would no ſooner apprehend Him in danger, then you would runne to His reſcue, as you would flye from the Plague and Beggery. But that reproach of maintaining the Kings Children here, I confeſſe made my heart riſe, I hope it did ſo to many here: Is our good King fallen ſo low, that His Children muſt be kept for Him, 'tis worth our enquiry who brought Him to that condition? We heare Him complain that all his Own Revenue is ſeized and taken from Him; Is not His <hi>Exchequer,</hi> Court of <hi>Wards, Mint</hi> here, His <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> too are worth ſomewhat, and are His Children kept upon Alms? How ſhall we and our Children proſper, if this be not remedied?</p>
            <p>They will by no means endure that His Majeſtie be obeyed in the apprehenſion of the Lord Major, and the other three Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for it is the ſenſe of both Houſes that this demand is againſt the Priviledge of Parliament, and moſt diſhonourable to the Citie; For the firſt I dare not ſpeake my minde, though I muſt confeſſe my ſelf not able to anſwer the Kings reaſons in many of His Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon that point; but for the ſecond, (under the favour of both Houſes) whether it be diſhonourable for the City, whether it be fit to be done or no, we are the beſt, indeed we are the onely Judges. I will take the liberty to ſpeake freely my Conſcience in this Caſe, as a friend to Juſtice, as a lover of theſe men, and as a Servant to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95416:5"/>
Citie, and as all theſe I proteſt to God, if I were now Lord Major, and the other three were my Father, and my Brothers, I would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the King in this point. Did His Majeſtie aske to have them put to death meerely upon His Accuſation, or have them ſent bound hand and foot to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where it might be in His power to proceed againſt them in an extraordinary way, it might ſeeme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable: but to apprehend them to keep them in ſafe cuſtody, that His Majeſtie may proceed againſt them according to the known Laws, under which they were born and bred, where if guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they muſt be left to the Juſtice of the law, and His Majeſtics mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if innocent, will receive an honourable acquittall, ſeems to me ſo juſt in the King to aske, and ſo neceſſary for us to yeeld to, that the denying it implies a doubt in us of the Innocence of thoſe whom we will not ſubmit to Juſtice. Here is a way to finde out the Kings Evill Counſellors. If theſe men do their part like men of good conſciences, ſubmit to the tryall of the Law, which is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Judge of Guilt and Innocence, and are found cleer from that heavy charge His Majeſtie accuſes them of, how gloriouſly will theſe men live hereafter, and the King cannot refuſe to deliver thoſe up who have wickedly conſpired the deſtruction of honeſt men; but if we ſhall onely cry out that the King is miſinformed, and dare not truſt our ſelves upon a tryall, we may preſerve our ſafety, but we ſhall looſe our reputation: Thus much for Juſtice, for the Gentlemens ſakes now: This way you ſee, a way to honour and ſafety too; if there be Innocence; but do you thinke after a moneths longer enduring the miſeries which are now upon us, men will not more importunately, and impatiently enquire after the cauſes of their ſufferings, if they ſhall finde that the denyall to give up four men (who it may be are not of any known merit too) to be tryed by the Law, being accuſed of High Treaſon, and conſpiring to take away the Kings Life, incenſed our gracious King againſt us, and kept Him from being among us, whereby our Trade de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes, and ſuch violences and outrages are every day committed,

How many Perſons of Honour and Reputation are now impriſoned in this Town, when particulars are ſo far from being proved againſt them, that they are not ſo much as ſuggeſted; was over any Charge ſo generall as to be a Malignant or Cavaller? yet you heare all ſuch impriſonments are againſt the Rules of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; my opinion is that for Juſtice ſake, for the Cities ſake, for their own ſakes, theſe four men ſhould quietly ſubmit themſelves to the tryall of the Law; if they refuſe, that they be delivered up to the hands of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> told us, there was no proof that my Lord Major, and the other Perſons named, were countenancers of <hi>Browniſts, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> and other Sectaries; where ſhould this proof be made? Do we not all know this to be true; are they not all ſo much coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, as there is no countenance left for any body elſe? Did not my Lord Major firſt enter upon his Office, with a ſpeech againſt the Booke of <hi>Common-Prayer?</hi> hath the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> ever been read before him? hath not Captain <hi>Venn</hi> ſaid that his Wife could make Prayers worth three of any in that Book Oh (Maſters) there have been times that he that ſhould ſpeake againſt the Book of <hi>Common Prayer</hi> in this Citie, ſhould not have been put to the

patience of a Legall Triall; we were wont to look upon it as the greateſt Treaſure, and Jewell of our Religion, and he that ſhould have told us he wiſhed well to our Religion, and yet would take away the Booke of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> would never have gotten cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. I have been in all the parts of Chriſtendom, and have converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Chriſtians in Turky, why, in all the Reformed Churches there is not any thing of more Reverence, then the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy,</hi> not our Royall Exchange, or the name of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſo famous. In <hi>Geneva</hi> it ſelf I have heard it extolled to the Skies: I have been 3. Moneths together by Sea, not a day without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it read twice. The honeſt Mariners then deſpiſed all the world but the King and the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> Book, he that ſhould have been ſuſpected to wiſh ill to either of them, would have made an ill Voyage. And let me tell you, they are ſhrewd Youths thoſe Seamen, if they once diſcern that the Perſon of the King is in danger, or the true Proteſtant profeſſed Religion, they will ſhew themſelves mad bodies, before you are a ware of it; I would not be a <hi>Browniſt</hi> or an <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> in their way for—But we are told of an Army of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who will root out our Religion: for my part, I am ſure I am not ſuſpected for any affection to <hi>Papiſts,</hi> yet I confeſſe at this time, I have not the leaſt feare of danger from them, and the truth is, this Bugbeare is grown leſſe terrible to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body. We know from the beginning of this Parliament, the continuall diſcovery of Plotts by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and what thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries have coſt us, and yet to this day not the leaſt probable charge objected againſt them. When the King was at <hi>York,</hi> no diſcourſe here, but of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> being there in multitudes, when 'tis well known, His Majeſtie took all poſſible care to prevent the reſort of any <hi>Papiſts</hi> to the Court, and I have been aſſured by very honeſt men, that in a Moneth there was ſcarce the face of one <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> there. When he firſt raiſed His Army, did he not by Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation forbid any to come to Him?—But hark you Gentlemen, where would you have theſe <hi>Papiſts</hi> be? can they live in the Ayre,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95416:6"/>
or in the Water? beyond-Sea you will not ſuffer them to paſſe; if they ſtay at their Houſes, they are Plundred, 'tis a good Juſtification for Plundring that they are <hi>Papiſts.</hi> Are they not the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ſhould they not flye to Him for Protection? Is there any Law that ſayes the <hi>Papiſts</hi> muſt not aſſiſt the King with Men, Arms, or Money, when He is in diſtreſſe, and when He conceives Himſelf to be in danger of His Life? Let us look about us, if this world hold, not onely all the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but all the Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> will finde it neceſſary to carry all they have to the King, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it in that bottome.</p>
            <p>But both Houſes have declared that there have been no plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring by the direction of Parliament. Here I thinke they would be willing to admit the King to be a part of the Parliament, to ſave their honour, otherwiſe if plundring ſignifies the comming with violence into ones houſe, and taking away his goods againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſure there hath been much plundring, even by the direction of the Houſes; but have they ever puniſhed plundring of the worſt ſort, if they have not directed it? will a Declaration of both Houſes repaire the fine Wane-ſcott, and the goodly Leads of honeſt <hi>George Binyons</hi> houſe? Let me tell you, the time hath been the loſſe of ſuch a Citizen would have been talked of in another way.—I wonder what kinde of Government is preparing for Us, when they will not allow that the Impriſonment of our Perſon is the taking away our Liberty, or the taking away the twentieth part of our Eſtates is the deſtruction of our property; and did you marke what a notable reaſon was given us for this; the ſame Law that doth enable them to raiſe Forces, doth likewiſe enable them to require Contributions; it doth indeed, yet one might be without the other; but I would theſe Gentlemen had choſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Auditory to have convinced with this Argument; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey people will be no more couzened by the Citie, when they heare what kinde of Oratory prevailes over us; we ſhall be ſhortly told when they have a minde to our houſes, that the ſame Law
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95416:7"/>
which gave them Authority to take away our Money, gave them likewiſe Power to do the other too.</p>
            <p>The King tells us, if we ſhall hereafter contribute any thing for the maintenance of the Army, which He ſayes is in Rebellion againſt him, (He pardon's what's paſt, marke that,) He will deny us the benefit of His Protection with Forraign Princes, which He will ſignify to His forraign Miniſters; what remedy have the Lords and Commons found for this now, ſufficient to do the buſineſſe? They declare That this is an exceſſe of rigour, and, injuſtice beyond example, and therefore they hope His Majeſtie will be induced by better Counſell to forbear the execution. A very ſoveraign Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but 'tis ten to one if we do not obey His Majeſtie in the Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he hath laid upon us, He will uſe this exceſſe of rigour. I know not how little you, that trade onely within the Kingdom, may think your ſelves concerned in this, but I ſay whoever underſtands the Trade abroad, and the benefit of being a Subject to the King of England, will not runne this hazard; for let him be aſſured in the inſtant the King diſclaimes him, he is ruined, and therefore you who have Eſtates abroad, looke to it.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I have troubled you very long, but in good faith, the manner and the matter of the laſt dayes work hath layen ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie upon my heart, that I ſhould have thought I had forfeited this Gown, and this Chain if I had been ſilent, and that I had betrayed the Liberty of that famous Citie, which I am ſworn to defend. One word I had forgotten to mention, the caution which was given us of ſuch Meſſengers as His Majeſtie ſhould ſend, that we ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, that they might be dealt with as Meſſengers of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; God forbid we ſhould live to ſee any Meſſengers ſent to us from our gracious King evilly entreated, I would be loath my ſelfe to out-live ſuch a diſhonour; if His Majeſtie ſhall vouchſafe us the Honour to ſend to us, let us uſe and defend His Servants, as Perſons ſent to us for our good; if it ſhall be otherwiſe Fire from Heaven will conſume this Citie. Let us not be wrought upon by faire words,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95416:7"/>
to contribute or lend more money for the maintenance of this Civil, Bloody diſſention, or bring deſolation and confuſion upon this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Citie for the ſupport of four Men, who if Innocent will be ſafe, but let us remember the happineſſe and flouriſhing Eſtate we enjoyed whileſt we yeelded obedience to our Royall Soveraign. Let us not upon the generall diſcourſe of Evill Counſellors, rebell againſt a Prince, upon whoſe Perſon malice, and Treaſon cannot lay the leaſt blemiſh, but muſt confeſſe His Religion, Juſtice, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be ſo tranſcendent, that if He were a Subject would render Him moſt amiable. Let us conſider that if He be oppreſſed, there can be no end of theſe troubles, but we and our children ſhall be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally weltring in a Sea of blood; whereas if His Enemies be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, the whole Kingdom will within a Moment be reſtored to all the Calme, Pleaſure, and Plenty of Peace. And therefore if we intend to enjoy what we have, and that the younger men ſhall grow up to the ſame eſtate we enjoy, if the memory of our forefather's, or the hope of our Poſterity can move any thing with us, let us lay hold on the Kings Mercy, and ſubmit to every Propoſition in His Anſwer.</p>
            <p>WHileſt the Alderman was ſpeaking this Speech, ſeverall great interruptions were made with hiſſing, and other ſuch noyſes, ſome crying, <hi>No more, No more,</hi> others as importunately <hi>Heare him, Heare him, Heare him;</hi> ſo that it was about an houre after he began to ſpeak, before he ended: when ever the clamor began to ſtop him, he ſate down, without ſhew of any diſturbance, and when that noyſe was conquered, he began again, ſaying what he ſaid laſt, and ſo proceeded; onely once when Alderman <hi>Bunce</hi> ſaid, he ſpoke againſt the Honourable Houſe of Commons, and that it was not to be endured, the Alderman replyed with a little ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he had as much liberty to ſpeake in that place, as any Memb<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

As ſoon as the Speech was done, and the great ſhout and hem ended (which ſome in the ſtreet apprehended to be a conſent to lend Money to the Parliament, and ranne to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> &amp; acquainted the Houſe of Commons with it, whereupon foure Members were appointed to draw up a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Thanks to the City) the Lord Major, trembling and ſcarce able to ſpeake, asked, what their reſolution was concerning aſſiſting the Parliament with Money, for the payment of their Army, &amp; reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his voice by degrees, offered them ſome reaſons, &amp; asked them whether they would loſe all their thanks for what they had done already; but the cry was ſo great, <hi>no Money, no Money, Peace, Peace,</hi> that he could not be heard. One that ſtood neer the Major anſwered, that he doubted not whoever could make it appeare he had deſerved thanks, might call for it, and have it, that the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not, upon loſing of ſome, but forfeiting of all, and whether the Citie would periſh, or quit foure Men, for whom they had no reaſon to care; The voice was ſo great, one crying, <hi>that they who ſet them to work ſhould defend them,</hi> another, <hi>that ſince theſe troubles none but Bankrupts and Knaves had proſpered,</hi> a third, <hi>that if they had common honeſty, they would rather runne away, then endeavour to ſave themſelves by bringing deſtruction upon the whole Citie.</hi> Then the Court roſe and every man departed, ſo great a Company going before, and following after Alderman <hi>Garroway</hi> to his houſe, that the Streets were as full as at my Lord Majors ſhew, ſome cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>Wher's Ven and his Mirmidons,</hi> others, <hi>when they ſhould meet,</hi> to which a generall ſhout anſwered <hi>Now, Now;</hi> one of good credit with them, wiſhed them to proceed with diſcretion, <hi>A Pox of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion (ſaid a Butcher,) we ſhall be undone with it, let us proceed as theſe People have taught; when we asked them what we ſhould have in the place of Biſhops, they told us Biſhops were naught we all knew, &amp; when they were gone we ſhould think of having ſomewhat that is better in their roome; let
