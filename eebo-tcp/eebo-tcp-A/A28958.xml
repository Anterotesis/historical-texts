            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Advertiſement.</head>
            <p>THe Later of the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Dialogues is but a part
of a Diſcourſe, conſiſting
of ſome Conferences, whereof, <hi>that</hi>
was neither the Firſt, nor the Laſt.
This 'twas thought fit the Reader
ſhould have notice of, that he may
the more eaſily gueſs upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it is, that ſome Clauſes in the
firſt Page, (and perhaps a few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Paſſages elſewhere) contain
ſomewhat that appears not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſame it would have done, if
there had been no need to make any
alteration at all in that Page. But
becauſe, tho there was a connection
between that Dialogue and the reſt
of the Papers from which 'tis diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered,
yet it's dependency
upon the others, is not ſo very
great, but that the Publiſher thought
the divulging of it might be
uſeful and ſeaſonable: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
finding that want of Leiſure,
<pb facs="tcp:30742:3"/>
and much Diffidence, made the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
unwilling to reviſe, and part
with the other Papers that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
this which now comes forth;
he prevail'd with him to ſuffer that
Dialogue to take its Fortune, which
the Publiſher hopes may be ſuch, as
may incourage the Author to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
what he has further medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated

               <p>Inſtead of doing that,
you will much promote them, if
you pleaſe to accompany me in
them: For the ſubject that buſied
my thoughts is both ſo abſtruſe and
ſo important, that it needs more

that He ſhould be a far better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderer

think my ſelf far leſs fit for that task

               <speaker>Eug.</speaker>

               <speaker>Pyrocl.</speaker>
               <p>And I, Gentlemen, to

when we came in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
               <p>I was then muſing upon a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30742:4"/>
Subject, that was newly propoſed
to me by our common Friend <hi>Arno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biut,</hi>
who would needs have my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>Whether,</hi> and if at all, <hi>how far,</hi>
we may employ our reaſonings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
things that are above our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as Chriſtians grant ſome my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Euge.</speaker>
               <p>If, by <hi>things above Reaſon,</hi>
be meant only thoſe, that are undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
by Reaſon without Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
I ſhould not heſitate to ſay,
that there may be divers things of
that kind: For the free Decrees of
God, and his determinations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Government of the
World, and the future ſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
(to name now no others) are
things which no humane Reaſon can
pry into, but muſt owe the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
diſcovery it makes of them,
to the Revelation of him, whoſe
purpoſes they are.</p>
               <p>But if, by <hi>things above Reaſon,</hi> be
meant ſuch, as though delivered in
words, free from darkneſs and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity,
are not to be conceived,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30742:5"/>
and comprehended by our Rational
Faculty, I ſhall freely confeſs, that
I ſcarce know what to ſay upon ſo

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pyrocl.</speaker>
               <p>For my part, Gentlemen,
I think it were very requiſite to be
ſure in the firſt place, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Diſcourſes is not Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical,
but that we can really know,
that there are things we cannot
comprehend, though they be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to us in expreſſions no leſs
clear than ſuch, as would ſuffice to
make other things intelligible to
us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
               <p>Your cautiouſneſs, <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
muſt not be rejected by <hi>me,</hi>
who when, before you came in, I
was putting my thoughts into ſome
order, judg'd it unfit to conſider,
either how one might know what
things were to be look'd on as above
Reaſon, how far we may diſcourſe
of them, or whether or no any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally
revealed Propoſitions,
ſuch as Divines call Articles of Faith,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30742:5"/>
ought to be reckoned among them,
till I ſhould have firſt ſeriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd,
whether in general we ought
to admit any ſuch Objects of our
Contemplation, as theſe, and the
like Queſtions ſuppoſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Euge.</speaker>
               <p>I hope then that this being
the firſt thing you purpoſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into, we may, without too
much boldneſs, deſire to know what
came into your mind about it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
               <p>If I had brought my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
to an iſſue upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
I ſhould with leſs reluctancy
acquaint you with them; but I
ſince I have yet made but an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
progreſs in my enquiry, inſtead
of delivering any poſitive opinion
upon ſo abſtruſe a ſubject, I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell you, that as far as I could yet
diſcern, it ſeemed to me that among
the Objects, our reaſon may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
there are <hi>ſome</hi> whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
we cannot comprehend, others
whoſe Attributes or Actions are
ſuch, as that we cannot underſtand
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30742:6"/>
how they ſhould belong to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
or elſe that we cannot conceive
how they ſhould conſiſt with ſome
acknowledged Truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Euge.</speaker>
               <p>So that if I apprehend you
right, you do not only admit ſome
things to be above Reaſon, but make
no leſs than three ſorts of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
               <p>If you will needs have two
of them to be coincident, I ſhall not
much contend, but I think the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you have named may, without
any great inconvenience, be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
For by things above Reaſon,
I here underſtand (not falſe or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
ones, but) ſuch, as though the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect
ſees ſufficient cauſe (whether
on the ſcore of Experience, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Teſtimony, or Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Demonſtration) to aſſent to;
yet it finds it ſelf reduc'd when 'tis
converſant about them, to be ſo with
a notable and peculiar diſadvantage:
And this diſadvantage does uſually
proceed <hi>either</hi> from the nature of
the thing propoſed, which is ſuch,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30742:6"/>
that we cannot ſufficiently compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it, <hi>or</hi> from our not being able
to conceive the manner of its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and operating; <hi>or</hi> from this,
that it involves ſome notion or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
that we ſee not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
with ſome other thing, that
we are perſwaded to be a truth. The
firſt of theſe three ſorts of things,
may, for brevity and diſtinction ſake
be called <hi>Incomprehenſible,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Inexplicable,</hi> and the third <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociable.</hi>
But for fear leſt the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
I have uſed in my expreſſions,
may have kept them from being ſo
clear, I ſhall ſomewhat more expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
reckon up the three ſorts of
things that ſeem to me above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>The firſt conſiſts of thoſe whoſe
Nature is not diſtinctly and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately
comprehenſible by us: To
which ſort perhaps we may refer all
thoſe intellectual Beings (if it be
granted that there are ſuch) as are
by nature of a higher order than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Souls. To which ſort ſome
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the Angels (at leaſt of the good
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30742:7"/>
ones) may probably belong; but
more than probably we may refer
to this Head, the Divine Author of
Nature, and of our Souls, <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God,</hi> whoſe perfections are ſo
boundleſs, and his Nature ſo very
ſingular, that 'tis no leſs weakneſs
than preſumption to imagine, that
ſuch finite Beings as our Souls,
can frame full and adequate <hi>Idea's</hi>
of them: We may indeed know by
the conſideration of his works, and
particularly thoſe parts of them that
we our ſelves are, both <hi>That he is,</hi>
and in a great meaſure <hi>What he is
not;</hi> but to underſtand throughly
<hi>What he is,</hi> is a task too great for
any but his own infinite Intellect:
And therefore I think we may truly
call this immenſe Object, in the
newly declared ſence, <hi>ſupra-Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual.</hi>

what is the ſecond ſort of Things
above Reaſon?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
               <p>It conſiſts of ſuch, as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30742:7"/>
though we cannot deny <hi>that they
are,</hi> yet we cannot clearly and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily
conceive, <hi>how they can
be</hi> ſuch as we acknowledge they are.
As how <hi>Matter</hi> can be <hi>infinitely,</hi> (or
which is all one, in our preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<hi>indefinitely) diviſible:</hi> And
how there ſhould be ſuch an <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurableneſs</hi>
betwixt the Side and
Diagonal of a Square, that no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
how ſmall ſoever, can ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatly
meaſure both the one and
the other.</p>
               <p>That Matter is endleſly diviſible,
is not only the aſſertion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
and the Schools, but generally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
by thoſe rigid Reaſoners,
Geometricians themſelves; and may
be farther confirm'd by the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Side and <hi>Diagonal</hi> of a
Square, whoſe incommenſurable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is believed upon no leſs firm a
proof, than a demonſtration of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid,</hi>
and was ſo known a truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Ancients, that <hi>Plato</hi> is
ſaid to have pronounced him rather
a Beaſt than a Man, that was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to it. And yet if continued
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30742:8"/>
quantity be not diviſible without
ſtop, how can we conceive but that
there may be found ſome determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
part of the ſide of a Square,
which being often enough repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
would exactly meaſure the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agonal
too. But though Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Demonſtrations aſſure us, that
theſe things are ſo, yet thoſe that
have ſtrained their Brains, have not
been able clearly to conceive how it
ſhould be poſſible, that a Line (for
inſtance) of not a quarter of an inch
long, ſhould be ſtill diviſible into
leſſer and leſſer portions, without
ever coming to an end of thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſions;
or how among the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
differing partitions into ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot
parts, that may be made of the
ſide of a Square, not one of thoſe
parts can be found exactly to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſo ſhort a Line as the Diagonal
may be.</p>

               <p>There is yet behind, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronius,</hi>
the <hi>third</hi> ſort of thoſe
things, which, according to you,
ſurpaſs our Reaſon.</p>

               <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhall name that too, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi>
as ſoon as I have premiſed
that ſome of the Reaſons that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me to refer ſome inſtances to
this head, do not ſo peculiarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to thoſe inſtances, but that they
may be applicable to others, which
'twas thought convenient to refer to
the ſecond or firſt of the foregoing
Heads: And this being once inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
I ſhall proceed to tell you,
that the <hi>third ſort</hi> of things that
ſeem to ſurpaſs our Reaſon, conſiſts
of thoſe, to which the Rules and
Axioms and Notions, whereby we
judge of the truth and falſhood of
ordinary, or other things, ſeem not
to agree.</p>
               <p>This third ſort being ſuch as are
incumbred with Difficulties or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
that cannot directly and
ſatisfactorily be removed by them
that acquieſce in the received Rules
of ſubordinate Sciences, and do rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
but at the common rate, ſuch
Objects of Contemplation as this
third ſort conſiſts of, having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
belonging to them, that ſeems
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30742:9"/>
not reconcilable with ſome very
manifeſt, or at leaſt acknowledged
Truths.</p>
               <p>This it may here ſuffice to make
out by a couple of Inſtances, the
one of a Moral, the other of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
Nature: And firſt, that
Man has a free will, in reference at
leaſt to civil matters, is the general
confeſſion of Mankind: All the
Laws that forbid and puniſh Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Adultery, Theft, and other
Crimes, being founded on a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
that men have a power to
forbear committing them, and the
ſenſe men have of their being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
of this power over their own
actions, is great enough to make
Malefactors acknowledg their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
to be juſt, being no leſs
condemned by their own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
than by their Judges.</p>
               <p>And yet (ſome <hi>Socinians,</hi> and
ſome few others excepted) the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of Mankind, whether Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
Jews, Mahometans, or
Heathens, aſcribe to God an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Preſcience of humane Actions,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30742:9"/>
which is ſuppoſed by the belief of
Prophecies, and the recourſe to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
by one or other of which
two ways the Embracers of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Religions newly mentioned,
have endeavoured and expected to
receive the informations of future
things, and ſuch as depend upon
the Actings of men. But how a
certain fore-knowledg can be had
of contingent things, and ſuch as
depend upon the free will of man,
is that which many great wits that
have ſolicitouſly tryed, have found
themſelves unable clearly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
nor is it much to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
that they ſhould be puzled
to conceive how an infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Being ſhould want Preſcience,
or that their will ſhould want that
liberty, whereof they feel in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the almoſt perpetual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
               <p>The other inſtance I promiſed
you, <hi>Euge.</hi> is afforded me by Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians:
For theſe (you know)
teach the diviſibility of Quantity
<hi>in infinitum</hi> or without ſtop, to be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30742:10"/>
Mathematically demonſtrable. Give
me leave then to propoſe to you a
ſtrait line of three foot long divided
into two parts, the one double to
the other. I ſuppoſe then, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their doctrine a line of
two foot is diviſible into infinite
parts, or it is not: If you ſay it is
not, you contradict the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Geometricians; if you
ſay that it is, then you muſt confeſs
either that the line of one foot is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
into as many parts as the line
of two foot, though the one be but
half the other, or elſe that the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
parts, into which the line of
one foot is granted to be diviſible,
is exceeded in number by the parts,
into which the line of two foot is
diviſible, and conſequently that the
line of two foot has a multitude of
parts greater than infinite. Which
Reaſonings may let us ſee that we
may be reduced <hi>either</hi> to reject In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
legitimately drawn from
manifeſt or granted Truths, <hi>or</hi> to
admit concluſions that appear ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd;
if we <hi>will</hi> have <hi>all</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30742:10"/>
Rules whereby we judge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things to be applicable to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finites.</p>
               <p>And now, Gentlemen, having
acquainted you with what ſorts of
things ſeem to be above Reaſon, I
muſt, to prevent miſtakes, deſire
you to take along with you this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement:
That though the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
and difficulty of ſo unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
a Subject, inclined me to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſomething towards the elucida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of it, by ſorting thoſe things
into three kinds; yet I ſhall not,
and need not in this Conference,
inſiſt on them ſeverally, or lay any
ſtreſs on this partition. For though I
have above intimated, that a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
may ſpeak of ſomewhat that
is <hi>ſupra-intellectual,</hi> or elſe contain
ſomewhat which we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how it may be true, or laſtly
teach us ſomewhat for a truth, that
we cannot reconcile with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, that we are convinced
is true; yet if but any one of theſe
have true Inſtances belonging to it,
<hi>That</hi> may ſuffice for my main pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30742:11"/>
in this place, where I need only
ſhew in general, <hi>that there may be
things that ſurpaſsour Reaſon,</hi> at leaſt
ſo far, that they are not to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of by the ſame meaſures and
rules, by which men are wont to
judge of ordinary things, for which
reaſon I ſhall often give them one
common name, calling them <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg'd
Things.</hi>

the Imperfections of our Reaſon, in

recourſe to the unfathomable Abyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Divine Nature, ſince for

               <p>Since <hi>Sophronius</hi> has not

               <p>Suppoſe a great Circle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30742:11"/>
into its three hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
degrees, and ſuppoſe that as
great a number as you pleaſe or
can conceive, of ſtrait lines, be
drawn from the ſeveral deſignable
parts of ſome one of theſe degrees,
to the Centre, 'tis manifeſt that the
degrees being equal, as many lines
may be drawn from any, and ſo
from every one of the others, as
from that degree which was pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon.</p>
               <p>Then ſuppoſe a Circular Arch,
equal to the aſſumed degree, to be
further bent into the circumference
of a little circle, having the ſame
Centre with a great one, it follows
from the nature of a Circle, and
has been geometrically demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the ſemi-diameters of a
Circle how many ſoever they be,
can no where touch one another
but in the Centre. Whence 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that all the lines that are
drawn from the circumference to
the Centre of the greater Circle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
muſt paſs by differing points of the
circumference of the ſmaller, (for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30742:12"/>
elſe they would touch one another
before they arrive at the Centre)
and conſequently that as many lines
ſoever as can even mentally be
drawn from the ſeveral points of
the circumference of the great Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to the common Centre of both
Circles, muſt all paſs through dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
points of the little Circle, and
thereby divide it into as many parts
(proportionably ſmaller) as the
greater Circle is divided into: So
that here the circumference of the
leſſer Circle preſents us with a
curve line, which was not poſſibly
diviſible into more parts than an
Arch of one degree, or the three
hundred and ſixtieth part of the
Circumference of the greater Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and yet without being length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
becomes diviſible into as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts as the whole circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the ſame greater Circle.
And though we ſhould ſuppoſe the
circumference of the internal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
not to exceed one inch, and that
of the exterior Circle to exceed the
circumference of the Terreſtrial
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30742:12"/>
Globe, or even of the Firmament
it ſelf, yet ſtill the demonſtration
would hold, and all the lines drawn
from this vaſt Circle, would find
diſtinct points in the leſſer, to paſs
through to their common Centre.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Timoth.</speaker>
               <p>Though I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to confirm what <hi>Sophronius</hi> has
been proving, by adding Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<hi>a priori;</hi> yet I ſhall venture
to ſay, that I think it very agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
both to the nature of God and
to that of man, that what he has
endeavoured to prove true ſhould
be ſo; for we men miſtake and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Humane Nature too much,
when we think our faculties of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
ſo unlimited, both in
point of capacity and of extent, and
ſo free and unprepoſſeſt, as many
Philoſophers ſeem to ſuppoſe: For,
whatever our ſelf-love may incline
us to imagine, we are really but
created and finite Beings (and that
probably of none of the higheſt or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ders
of intellectual Creatures) and
we come into the world, but ſuch,
as it pleaſed the Almighty and moſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30742:13"/>
free Author of our Nature to make
us. And from this dependency and
limitedneſs of our Natures, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
not only that we may be (for
I now diſpute not whether we are)
born with certain congenit Notions
and Impreſſions and Appetites or
Tendencies of Mind; but alſo that
the means or meaſures which are
furniſhed us to employ in the
ſearching or judging of Truth, are
but ſuch as are proportionable to
Gods deſigns in creating us, and
therefore may probably be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
not to be capable of reaching to
all kinds, or if you pleaſe of Truths,
<hi>many</hi> of which may be unneceſſary
for us to know here, and ſome may
be reſerved, partly to make us ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the imperfections of our
Natures, and partly to make us aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to that condition, wherein our
faculties ſhall be much enlarged and
heightned. It ſeems not therefore
unreaſonable to think, both that
God has made our faculties ſo limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that in our preſent mortal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
there ſhould be ſome Objects
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30742:13"/>
beyond the comprehenſion of our
Intellects (that is) that ſome of his
creatures ſhould not be able perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to underſtand ſome others, &amp; yet
that he has given us light enough
to perceive that we cannot attain
to a clear and full knowledge of
them.</p>

               <p>I think, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> that
I now underſtand what you mean
by <hi>Things above reaſon,</hi> or as you
(not unfitly) ſtiled them, <hi>priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
things:</hi> But I preſume you need
not be told, that to explain the ſence
of a Propoſition, and to make out
the truth of it, (unleſs in common
Notions, or things evident by their
own light) are always two things,
and oftentimes two very diſtant
ones.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
               <p>I need not ſcruple, <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
to grant the truth of what you
ſay, but I muſt not ſo eaſily admit
your application of it; for among
the examples, I have been propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
there are ſome at leaſt, that
do not only <hi>declare</hi> what I mean by
things above reaſon, but are inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30742:14"/>
and conſequently may be <hi>proofs</hi>
that ſuch things there are. And
to thoſe I could have added others,
if I had thought it unlikely, that
in the progreſs of our Conference,
there may be occaſions offered of
mentioning them more opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

if what I propoſed be well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I aſſign Reaſon its moſt noble

               <p>I ſhall then in the firſt

perſons, and divers of them
great Wits, who have perplexed
themſelves to reconcile, I ſay, not
the Grace of God, but even his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to the liberty of mans will,
even in bare moral actions: And I
have found partly by their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and by diſcourſe with ſome
of them, that the moſt towring and
ſubtle ſort of Speculators, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicians,
and Mathematicians,
perchance after much racking of
their brains, confeſs themſelves
quite baffled by the unconquerable
difficulties they met with, not only
in ſuch abſtruſe ſubjects, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, or of the humane Soul,
but in the nature of what belongs
in common to the moſt obvious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in the world, and even to the
leaſt portions of them: You will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30742:15"/>
gueſs that I have my eye on that
famous controverſie, Whether or
no a continued quantity (which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

made up of Indiviſibles. Of the
perplexing difficulties of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
I might give you divers
confeſſions, or complaints made by
a ſort of men too much accuſtomed
to bold aſſertions and ſubtle Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to be much diſpoſed to make
acknowledgments of that kind: But
I ſhall content my ſelf with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony

               <p>I have not the vanity to
think that the weakneſs of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ought to make another diffident

ſelf, what <hi>Sophronius</hi> has been ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cannot but be confirm'd by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
tryals, wherein having exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſmall abilities I had to clear
up to my ſelf ſome of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
about Infinites: I perceived to
my trouble, that my ſpeculations
ſatisfied me of nothing ſo much, as
the diſproportionateneſs of thoſe
abſtruſe ſubjects to my reaſon. But,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30742:16"/>
                  <hi>Sophronius,</hi> may it not be well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that though the Inſtances
you have given, have not been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
cleared by the light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
yet 'tis probable they may be
ſo hereafter, conſidering how great
progreſs is, from time to time, made
in the diſcoveries of Nature, in this
learned Age of ours.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
               <p>In anſwer to this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Eugenius,</hi> give me leave to tell
you firſt, that you allow my paſt
diſcourſe to hold good <hi>for ought yet
appears to the contrary:</hi> Whence it
will follow, that your Objection is
grounded upon a hope, or at moſt
a Conjecture about which I need
not therefore trouble my ſelf, till
ſome new diſcoveries about the
things in queſtion, engage me to a
new conſideration of them. But in
the mean while, give me leave to
repreſent to you in the ſecond place,
that though I am very willing to
believe, as well as I both deſire and
hope it, that this inquiſitive Age we
live in, will produce diſcoveries
that will explicate divers of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30742:17"/>
more hidden myſteries of Nature,
yet I expect that theſe diſcoveries
will chiefly concern thoſe things,
which either we are ignorant of
for want of a competent Hiſtory of
Nature, or we miſtake by reaſon
of erroneous Prepoſſeſſions, or for
want of freedom and attention in
our ſpeculations. But I have not
the like expectations as to all Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical
difficulties, (if I may ſo
call them) wherein neither matters
of Fact, nor the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
parts of Learning, are
wont much to avail. But however
it be, as to other abſtruſe Objects,
I am very apt to think, that there
are ſome things relating to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
and moſt Monadical Being
(if I may ſo ſpeak) that we call
<hi>God,</hi> which will ſtill remain incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible
even to Philoſophical
underſtandings. And I can ſcarce
allow my ſelf to hope to ſee thoſe
Obſtacles ſurmounted, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
not from any Perſonal infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
or evitable faults, but from
the limited nature of the Intellect:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30742:17"/>
And to theſe two conſiderations,
<hi>Eugenius,</hi> I ſhall in anſwer to your
queſtion, add this alſo: That as
mens inquiſitiveneſs may hereafter
extricate ſome of thoſe grand diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
that have hitherto perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Philoſophers; ſo it may poſſibly
lead them to diſcover new difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
more capable than the firſt, of
baffling humane underſtandings.
For even among the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we are already converſant,
there are divers which we think we
know, only becauſe we never with
due attention, tryed whether we
can frame ſuch <hi>Ideas</hi> of them, as
are clear and worthy for a rational
ſeeker and lover of truth to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce
in. This the great intricacy
that conſidering men find, in the
notions commonly receiv'd of ſpace,
time, motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of framing perſpicuous and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
apprehenſions even of
ſuch obvious things, may render
highly probable. We ſee alſo that
the Angle of Contact, the Doctrine
of <hi>Aſymptotes,</hi> and that of ſurd num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30742:18"/>
and incommenſurable Lines,
all which trouble not common Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptants
and Surveyors, (who
though they deal ſo much in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and lines, ſeldom take notice
of any of them) perplex the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Mathematicians, and ſome of
them ſo much, that they can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
demonſtrate, that ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
belong to them, than they
can conceive how they can do ſo:
All which may render it probable,
that mens growing curioſity is not
more likely to find the ſolutions of
ſome difficulties, than to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of other things, that may prove
more inſuperable than they.</p>

               <p>This conjecture of yours,
<hi>Sophronius,</hi> is not a little favoured
by the <hi>Rota Ariſtotelica;</hi> for though
the motion of a Cart-wheel is ſo
obvious and ſeems ſo plain a thing,
that the Carman himſelf never
looks upon it with wonder; yet
after <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had taken notice of

divers great Wits, not only
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30742:18"/>
Schoolmen, but Mathematicians,
and continues yet to do ſo, there
being ſome circumſtances in the
progreſſive motion and rotation of
the circumference of a Wheel, and
its Nave, or of two points aſſigned,
the one in the former, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the latter, that have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
too ſubtle (and even to modern)
Writers, ſo hard to be conceived
and reconciled to ſome plain and

have given over the ſolution of the
attending difficulties as deſperate,
which perchance, <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> would
not think ſtrange, if I had time to

               <p>I underſtand your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<hi>Eugenius,</hi> and ſhall endeavour
to comply with it, but the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and intricateneſs of the Subject
of our diſcourſe, obliges me to do
it by ſteps; and for fear we ſhould
want time for more neceſſary
things, I will not now ſtay to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30742:19"/>
whether all the things that
hitherto have appeared above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
be impenetrable to us, becauſe
of an eſſential diſability of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
proceeding from the
imperfection and limitedneſs of
their nature, or only becauſe of
ſome other impediment, ſuch as
may be eſpecially the condition of
the ſoul in this life, or the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
reſulting from its ſtate of union
with a groſs and mortal body.</p>
               <p>Forbearing then to diſcourſe how
this came into my mind, and what
thoughts I had upon it, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in my conſiderations; and to
clear the way for thoſe that are to
follow, I ſhall in the firſt place ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to you, that whatever be
thought of the faculty <hi>in abſtracto,</hi>
yet Reaſon operates according to
certain Notions or Ideas, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Axiomes and Propoſitions, by
which as by Prototypes or Models,
and Rules and Meaſures, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
things, and makes eſtimates
and judgments of them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
when we ſay that ſuch a thing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30742:20"/>
is conſonant to Reaſon, or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to it, we uſually mean that
it is either immediately or mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deducible from, or at leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with, or contradictory to
one or other of thoſe ſtandard No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Rules.</p>
               <p>And this being premis'd, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
in the next place, that if theſe
Rules and Notions be ſuch, as are
abſtracted only from finite things,
or are congruous but to them; they
may prove uſeleſs or deceitful to us,
when we go about to ſtretch them
beyond their meaſure, and apply
them to the infinite God, or to
things that involve an Infiniteneſs
either in multitude, magnitude, or
littleneſs.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate and confirm this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
give me leave to repreſent in
the third place, that in my opinion
all the things that we naturally do
know or can know, may be divided
into theſe two ſorts: The one ſuch as
we may know without a <hi>Medium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
and the other ſuch as we cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to, but by the intervention of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30742:20"/>
a <hi>Medium,</hi> or by a diſcurſive act.
To the firſt belong ſuch Notions as
are ſuppoſed to be <hi>connate,</hi> or if
you pleaſe <hi>innate,</hi> ſuch as that <hi>Two
contradictories cannot be both together
true.</hi> The whole is greater than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part of it; <hi>Every (entire) num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is either even or odd, &amp;c.</hi> And
alſo thoſe other Truths, that are
aſſented to upon their own account
without needing any <hi>medium</hi> to
prove them; becauſe that as ſoon
as, by perſpicuous terms, or fit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
they are clearly propoſed
to the underſtanding, they diſcover
themſelves to be true ſo manifeſtly
by their own light, that they need
not be aſſiſted by any intervening
Propoſition, to make the Intellect
acquieſce in them; of which kind
are ſome of <hi>Euclids Axioms,</hi> as
that, <hi>If to equal things equal things
be added, the totals will be equal;</hi> and
that <hi>two right lines cannot include a
ſpace.</hi> To the ſecond ſort of things
knowable by us, belong all that we
acquire the knowledge of by Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinations,
wherein by the help of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:30742:21"/>
intervening Propoſitions or <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums,</hi>
we deduce one thing from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
or conclude affirmatively
or negatively one thing of another.
This being ſuppoſed, and we being
conſcious to our ſelves, if it were
but upon the ſcore of our own infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and imperfections, that we
are not Authors of our own nature;
for ought we know it may be true,
and all the experience we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
had, leads us to think it is
true, that the meaſures ſuggeſted
to us either by ſenſations, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
of ſenſible obſervation, or the
other inſtruments of knowledge,
are ſuch as fully reach but to finite
things or Beings, and therefore are
not ſafely applicable to others. And
divers of thoſe very Principles that
we think very general, may be (if
I may ſo ſpeak) but gradual notions
of truth, and but limited and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective,
not abſolute and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.</p>
               <p>And here give me leave, as a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſideration, to take notice to
you, that though perfect Syllogiſm
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30742:21"/>
be counted the beſt and moſt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
forms that our Ratiocinations
can aſſume, yet even the laws of
theſe are grounded on the doctrine
of Proportions: For even between
things equal there may be a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(namely that of equality) upon
which ground I ſuppoſe it is, that
Mathematical Demonſtrations have
been publickly propoſed of the
grand Syllogiſtical Rules. And in
conſequence of this, I ſhall add that
Geometricians will tell you, that
there is no proportion betwixt a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
line and an infinite,<note place="margin">Rationem habere inter ſe quantita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes dicuntur quae poſſunt multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae, ſeſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo ſuperare.</note> becauſe the

as to exceed the latter, which ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Proportion, it ſhould be capable to

would make is to perſwade you,<note place="margin">Elem. V.</note>
that ſince the underſtanding ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
but by the Notions and Truths
'tis furniſhed with,<note place="margin">Euclidis.</note> and theſe are
its inſtruments by proportion to
which it takes meaſures, and makes
judgments of other things; theſe
Inſtruments may be too diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30742:22"/>
to ſome Objects to be ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
employed to determine divers
particulars about them: So the eye
being an inſtrument which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
employs to eſtimate
diſtances, we cannot by that ſafely
take the bredth of the Ocean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our ſight cannot reach far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to diſcover how far ſo vaſt
an object extends it ſelf. And <hi>not
only</hi> the common inſtruments of
Surveyors that would ſerve to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

(and therefore is by the Moderns

meaſure the diſtance of the fixed

to that of ſo vaſt a Sphere as the

               <p>'Tis ſcarce poſſible to find
very appoſite examples, to illuſtrate
things of a kind ſo abſtruſe and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teroclite
as thoſe may well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
that do ſurpaſs our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>But yet ſome aſſiſtance may be
borrowed from what we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in that other faculty of the
mind, which is moſt of kin to the
Intellect, I mean the <hi>Imagination:</hi>
For when, for inſtance, I think of
a Triangle or a Square, I find in my
fancy an intuitive <hi>Idea</hi> (if I may ſo
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30742:23"/>
call it) of thoſe figures that is a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
clear and diſtinct, as if a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of three ſides or four equal
ſides, and Angles were placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my eyes.</p>
               <p>But if I would fancy a <hi>myriagon,</hi>
or a figure conſiſting of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
equal ſides, my Imagination
is overpowered with ſo great a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of them, and frames but a
confuſed <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Polygon</hi> with a
very great many ſides: For if (to
ſpeak ſuitably to what the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> has well obſerved in
the like caſe) a man ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to frame <hi>Ideas</hi> of a <hi>Myriagon</hi>
or a <hi>Chiliagon,</hi> they would be both
ſo confuſed, that his Imagination
would not be able clearly to diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
them, though the one has
ten times as many ſides as the other.
So if you would imagine an Atome,
of which perhaps ten thouſand
would ſcarce make up the bulk of
one of the light particles of duſt,
that ſeem to play in the Sunbeams
when they are ſhot into a darkned
place, ſo extraordinary a littleneſs
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:30742:23"/>
not having fallen under any of our
Senſes, cannot truly be repreſented
in our imagination. So when we
ſpeak of Gods Primity (if I may ſo
call it) Omnipotence, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his infinite Attributes and
Perfections, we have ſome conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
of the things we ſpeak of,
but may very well diſcern them to
be but inadequate ones: And though
divers Propoſitions relating to
things above Reaſon, ſeem clear
enough to ordinary Wits, yet he
that ſhall with a competent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of attention, curioſity, and
skill, conſider and examine them;
ſhall find that either their parts are
inconſiſtent with one another, or
they involve contradictions to ſome
acknowledged or manifeſt Truths,
or they are veil'd over with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and incumbered with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
from whence we are not able
to reſcue them. Thus when the
ſide and Diagonal of a Square are
propoſed, we have clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<hi>Ideas</hi> of each of them apart,
and when they are compared, we
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30742:24"/>
may have a conception of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commenſurableneſs.
But yet this
negative notion, if it be throughly
conſidered, and far enough purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
clearly contains that of a ſtrait
lines being diviſible <hi>in infinitum;</hi>
and that diviſibility is incumbred
with ſo many difficulties, and is ſo
hard to be reconciled to ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
dictates of Reaſon, that (as
we have ſeen already) Philoſophers
and Geometricians that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of the truth, are to this day
labouring to extricate themſelves
out of thoſe perplexing intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>I will not trouble you with the
puzling, if not inſuperable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that incumber the doctrine of
<hi>Eternity,</hi> as 'tis wont to be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Schools of Divines and
Philoſophers, leſt you ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that theſe difficulties ſpring
rather from the bold aſſumptions
and groundleſs ſubtleties of the
Schoolmen, than from the nature
of the thing it ſelf: But I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſomewhat that cannot be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30742:24"/>
denyed, which is, that ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
or other, whether, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<hi>God,</hi> or as the Peripateticks
ſay, the <hi>World,</hi> or as the Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
contend, <hi>Matter,</hi> never had a
beginning, that is, has been for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
But when we ſpeak of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
<hi>à parte ante</hi> (as they call it)
we do not ſpeak of a thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have no conception at all, as
will appear to a conſidering perſon,
and yet this general notion we have
is ſuch, that when we come atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to examine it, by the ſame
ways by which we judge of almoſt
all other things, the Intellect is
non-plus'd: For we muſt conceive,
that the time efflux'd ſince <hi>Adam</hi>
(or any other man as remote from
us as he is ſaid to have been) began
to live, bears no more proportion
to the duration of God, or of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
than to thoſe few minutes I
have imployed about mentioning
this inſtance. Nay if we would be
Ariſtotelians, the ſame thing may
be ſaid as to thoſe men, that lived
many thouſand millions of years
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30742:25"/>
before the time we reckon that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
began to live in: For each of
theſe times being finite and meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
by a determinate number of
years, can bear no proportion to
that infinite number of years (or
ſomewhat that is equivalent) which
muſt be allowed to a duration that
never had a beginning. And as
there are ſome things whoſe nature
and conſequences poſe our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
ſo there are others, whereof
though we have a notion, yet the
<hi>modus operandi</hi> is beyond our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion;
I do not mean only the
<hi>true</hi> and certain <hi>modus operandi,</hi> but
even an <hi>intelligible</hi> one. As, though
divers learned men, eſpecially Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſians,
and that upon a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
account, aſſert, that God
created the world; yet how a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
could be made out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
(as they, and the generality
of Chriſtians confeſſedly hold) I
fear we cannot conceive. And
though all Philoſophers, very few
excepted, believe God to be the
<hi>Maker</hi> of the World (out of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:30742:25"/>
matter) yet how he could
make it but by locally moving the
parts of the Matter it was to conſiſt
of, and how an incorporeal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
can move a body, which it
may paſs through without reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
is that which I fear will be
found hardly explicable: For if it
be ſaid, that the Soul, being an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
ſubſtance, can never the
leſs move the Limbs of the humane
Body rightly diſpos'd, I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that it does not appear that
the rational Soul doth give any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the parts of the Body, but
only <hi>guide</hi> or <hi>regulate</hi> that which
ſhe finds in them already.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Timoth.</speaker>
               <p>May it not then be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
ſaid, that by making ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
of ſuch things that are
the proper Objects of our faculties,
and by making legitimate deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from ſuch obſervations, and
from our other knowledges whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
innate or acquired, we may
come to be certain, that ſome things
<hi>are,</hi> and ſo have general and dark
<hi>Ideas</hi> of them, when at the ſame
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:30742:26"/>
time we are at a loſs to conceive
<hi>how they can be</hi> ſuch, or how they
can operate and perform what they
do, ſuppoſing the Truth and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of ſome other things we are
convinced of. To be ſhort, nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
apprehenſions we may have of
ſome priviledged things, and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
but indiſtinct apprehenſions
we may have of others, and that
is enough to make us in ſome ſort
underſtand our ſelves, and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when we ſpeak of them,
though yet when we ſufficiently
conſider what we ſay, we may find
that our words are not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with clear, diſtinct, and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical
conceptions, of thoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe
and perplexing things we
ſpeak of. And ſince, as hath been
already ſhewn, we find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that we are unable ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
to comprehend things, that
by clear and legitimate conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
may be evinc'd to <hi>be,</hi> why
ſhould not this cogently argue, that
ſome of our conceptions may be of
things, to which ſomewhat belongs
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30742:26"/>
that tranſcends our Reaſon, and
ſurpaſſes our comprehenſion? And
if I would play the Logician with
<hi>Pyrocles,</hi> I would tell him that his
Objection deſtroys his Opinion:
For ſince he talks to us of what is
incomprehenſible, that term muſt
or muſt not be attended with ſome
ſuitable <hi>Idea:</hi> If it be not, let him
conſider, whether in his own Phraſe
he ſpeaks ſence and not like a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot;
but if it be, let him then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that one may have ſome kind
of <hi>Idea</hi> of a thing incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
But, <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> whether or
no you think I prevaricate in this,
you will not, I hope, ſuſpect me of
doing it, in adding that when na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Theology had taught men,
(as well Philoſophers as others) to
believe God to be an infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Being, we ought not to ſay that
they had no <hi>Idea</hi> of ſuch a Being,
becauſe they had not a <hi>clear and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate</hi>
one. And ſince <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
diſcourſes <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> and prolixly
enough, <hi>de infinito,</hi> and cites the
ancienter Philoſophers for having
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:30742:27"/>
done ſo before him, and ſince (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
his Commentators and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers)
<hi>Democritus, Epicurus,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> and other late
Philoſophers, maintain either that
the world is boundleſs, or that ſpace
(real or imaginary) is not <hi>finite</hi> in
<hi>extent,</hi> or that the world conſiſts of
Atoms <hi>infinite</hi> in <hi>number;</hi> I hope
you will not put ſuch an affront up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all theſe great perſons, as to
think they ſaid they knew not what,
when they diſcourſed <hi>de infinito,</hi> as
they muſt have done, if they ſpake
without <hi>Ideas</hi> of the things they
ſpake of, though it may be juſtly
ſuppoſed, that the Subject being
<hi>infinite,</hi> the <hi>Ideas</hi> they framed of
it, could not be <hi>comprehenſive</hi> and
accurate.</p>

               <p>So that according to you,
<hi>Sophronius,</hi> it may be ſaid, that by
reaſon we do not properly <hi>perceive
Things above Reaſon,</hi> but only <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that they are above Reaſon,</hi>
there being a dark and peculiar
kind of Impreſſion made upon the
underſtanding, while it ſets it ſelf
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:30742:27"/>
to contemplate ſuch confounding
Objects, by which peculiarity of
impreſſion, as by a diſtinct and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted
kind of internal ſenſation,
the underſtanding is brought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
this ſort of things (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
tranſcendent or <hi>priviledg'd</hi> ones
from others, and diſcern them to
be diſproportionate to the powers
with which it uſes throughly to
penetrate Subjects, that are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervious
to it. As when the Eye
looks into a deep Sea, though it
may pierce a little way into it, yet
when it would look deeper, it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
nothing but ſomewhat
which is dark and indiſtinct, which
affects the ſenſory ſo differingly
from what other more genuine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are wont to do, that by it we
eaſily diſcern, that our ſight fails
us in the way before it arrives at
the bottom, and conſequently that
there may be many things conceal'd
there, that our ſight is unable to
reach.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:30742:28"/>
after ſo long a debate, that you
have now ſaid as much as at preſent

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhall not, for my part,
croſs your Obſervation, <hi>Timotheus,</hi>
but inſtead of adding any new
proofs, ſhall only deſire you to
look back upon thoſe I have preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you already, and to let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind
you, that of the two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by which I attempted to ſhew
that there are ſome things above
Reaſon, the firſt and chiefeſt was
ſuggeſted by Experience, and the
other which was drawn from the
nature of things and of man, was
brought as 'twere, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> to
illuſtrate and confirm the former,
and give occaſion to ſome hints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
priviledg'd Subjects. And
therefore though I hope what has
been diſcours'd by theſe Gentlemen
and me, may be able to perſwade
<hi>Pyrocles,</hi> that the acknowledgment
that ſome things are above Reaſon
may fairly comply with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:30742:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of it, yet whatever he thinks
of the cogency of our diſcourſe, the
truth of the main concluſion may
be ſufficiently evinc'd by our firſt
Argument drawn from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
For if we really find, that
there are things which our Reaſon
cannot comprehend, then whether
the account theſe Gentlemen and I
have given, why our faculties are
inſufficient, for theſe things be
good or not; yet ſtill ſome true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
or other there muſt be of that
inſufficiency. And as we ſhould
very thankfully receive from <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
any better account than what
we have propounded, ſo if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
aſſign any better, I hope he will
joyn with us in looking upon this,
as very agreeable to our Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis;
ſince hereby ſome things muſt
appear to us ſo ſublime and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe,
that not only we find we are
not able to comprehend them, but
that we are unable to diſcern ſo
much as upon what account it is
that they cannot be comprehended
by us.</p>

now that God, who (as I ſaid) is
a moſt free Agent, may have given
the mind of Man ſuch a limited
nature, accompanied with ſuch a
meaſure of light, you will not I
preſume deny but the queſtion is,
you will tell me, whether he <hi>hath</hi>
done ſo? But I hope what has been
formerly diſcourſed by theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and me, has put that almoſt
quite out of queſtion. However,
I ſhall now invite you to obſerve
with me, that the Rational Soul
does not only paſs judgments about
things without her, but about her
ſelf, and what paſſes within her:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:30742:31"/>
She ſearches out and contemplates
her own ſpirituality and union with
the Body. The Intellect judges
wherein its own nature conſiſts,
and whether or no it ſelf be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
faculty from the Will; and
to come yet cloſer to the point, be
pleaſed to conſider, that Logick and
Metaphyſicks are the works of the
Humane Intellect, which by fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
thoſe diſciplines, manifeſts,
that it does not only judge of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinations,
but of the very Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Laws of Reaſoning, and
teaches what things are neceſſary
to the obtaining of an Evidence and
Certainty, and what kind of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums</hi>
they are from whence you
muſt not expect any demonſtrative
Arguments, concerning ſuch or
ſuch a ſubject. To theſe things it
is agreeable, that if we will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the bodily Eye with the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
which is the Eye of
the Mind, we muſt allow this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
that the Intellect is as well
a Looking-glaſs as a Senſory, ſince
it does not only ſee other things but
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:30742:32"/>
it ſelf too, and can diſcern its own
blemiſhes or bad conformation, or
whatever other infirmitiesit labours
under. Upon which conſideration,
we may juſtifie the boldneſs of our
excellent <hi>Verulam,</hi> who when he
ſets forth the four ſorts of Idols (as
he calls them) that miſlead the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of Philoſophy, makes one of
them to be <hi>Idola Tribûs,</hi> by which
he means thoſe Notions, that tho'
radicated in the very nature of
mankind, are yet apt to miſlead us,
which may confirm what I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before, that the Soul, when
duly excited, is furniſhed with a
light, that may enable her to judge
even of divers of thoſe original No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by which ſhe is wont to judge
of other things. To be ſhort, the
Soul upon tryal may find by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſence, that ſome things ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
her forces, as a blind man that
were ſet to lift up a rock would
quickly find it too unweildy to be
manag'd by him, and the utmoſt
exerciſe of his ſtrength would but
convince him of the inſufficiency
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30742:32"/>
of it, to ſurmount ſo great a weight
or reſiſtance; ſo that we do not
pretend that the Eye of the Mind
ſhould ſee Inviſibles, but only that
it ſhall diſcern the limits of that
Sphere of Activity, within which
Nature hath bounded it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
that ſome Objects are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate
to it. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf ſays, that
the eye ſees both light and darkneſs,
which expreſſion, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
odd, may be defended by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that though ſince darkneſs is
a Privation, not a Being, it cannot
properly be the object of ſight, yet
it may be perceived by means of the
Eye, by the very differing affection
which that Organ reſents, when it
is impreſt on by luminous or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
Objects, and when it is
made uſeleſs to us by darkneſs.</p>

               <p>What you have ſaid,
<hi>Sophronius,</hi> has in great part pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
one thing that might be ſaid
to ſtrengthen <hi>Pyrocles</hi> his objection,
namely, that <hi>whereas</hi> when we ſee
with our bodily eyes, there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:30742:33"/>
the outward Organ an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and rational faculty, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
by the help of the eye, that
which is not directly the object of
ſight in the Eye of the Mind, the
Intellect, there is but one faculty
to perceive and judge: For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to your notion, it may be well
anſwered, that the Intellect being
capable by its proper light, to judge
of it ſelf and its own acts as well as
of other things, there is no need of
two Principles, the one to perceive
and the other to judge, ſince one is
ſufficient for both thoſe purpoſes.</p>

               <p>When I have time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on all that I have heard alledg'd
amongſt you, Gentlemen, I ſhall
conſider how far your Arguments
ought to obtain my aſſent: But in
the mean while I muſt tell you, that
they will ſcarce have all the ſucceſs
I preſume you deſire, unleſs you
add ſomewhat to free me from what
yet ſticks with me of a ſcruple, that
is much of the nature of that which
I formerly propoſed, being this;
<hi>How we can juſtifie our preſuming to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30742:33"/>
diſcourſe at all of things tranſcending
Reaſon?</hi> For I cannot underſtand
how a man that admits your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
can intelligibly ſpeak (and
to ſpeak otherwiſe miſ-becomes a
rational creature) of what is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
or any thing that ſurpaſſes our
reaſon; ſince when we diſcourſe
of ſuch things, either our words
are, or are not accompanied with
clear and diſtinct <hi>Ideas</hi> or concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the things we ſpeak of: If
<hi>they be not,</hi> what do we other than
ſpeak nonſence, or (as hath been
already ſaid) like Parrots entertain
our Hearers with words, that we
our ſelves do not underſtand; and
if <hi>they be,</hi> then we do in effect <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend</hi>
thoſe things, which yet you
would have me think to be on ſome
account or other, <hi>Incomprehenſible.</hi>

               <p>I acknowledge this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
<hi>Pyrocles,</hi> to be a great one;
but yet I think it not ſo great as that
it ought to interdict us all diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of things above Reaſon: And
this would perhaps appear probable
enough, if, as your objection bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:30742:34"/>
much of what you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
alledg'd, ſo I may be allowed,
as well to repeat ſome things as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
others, in making anſwer to it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Timoth.</speaker>
               <p>I for my part ſhall not
only give you my conſent to do ſo,
but make it my requeſt that you
would do it, for when I look back
upon our conference, methinks I
plainly perceive that partly the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
of <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> and partly ſome
(I fear impertinent) interpoſitions
of mine, have kept your diſcourſe
from being ſo methodical as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
you would have made it, and
therefore to be reminded of ſome
of the chief points of your doctrine,
as well as to connect them with
thoſe you ſhall judge fit to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
or illuſtrate them, may much
conduce to make us both under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it more clearly, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

               <p>I am much of your mind,
<hi>Timotheus,</hi> but though my inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
have been far more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and much leſs pertinent than
yours, yet I am not troubled that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:30742:34"/>
the method of our conference has
been ſo much diſturb'd; becauſe I
think ſuch a free way of diſcourſing,
wherein emergent thoughts if they
be conſiderable, are permitted to
appear as they ariſe in the mind, is
more uſeful than a nice method in a
debate about an uncultivated and
highly important ſubject, in which
I think we ſhould aim at firſt rather
to inquire than to reſolve, and to
procure as many hints and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
as we can, in order to our
fuller information againſt our next
meeting, without ſuppreſſing any
that is true or uſeful, only becauſe
it agrees not ſo well with a regular
method, as it does with the deſign
of our conference.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
               <p>Without reflecting upon
either of thoſe Gentlemen that have
been pleaſed to accuſe themſelves,
I ſhall readily comply with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made by <hi>Timotheus,</hi> and after
having propoſed ſome diſtinctions
make application of them.</p>
               <p>And the better to clear this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in reference to <hi>Pyrocles</hi>'s objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:30742:35"/>
I ſhall firſt take the liberty to
make ſome diſtinctions of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or conceptions of the Mind,
and for brevity ſake give names to
thoſe I have now occaſion to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy.
I conſider then, that whether
the conceptions or <hi>Ideas</hi> we have of
things be ſimple or compounded,
they may be diſtinguiſhed into ſuch
as are particular or <hi>diſtinct,</hi> and
ſuch as are only general, dark, and
confus'd, or indiſtinct: So when a
Navigator to unknown Countries
firſt gets a ſight of Land, though he
may be ſatisfied that it is Land, yet
he has but a very dark and confus'd
picture of it made in his eye, and
cannot deſcry whether or no the
ſhore be rocky, or what Creeks or
Harbours (if any) it have in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
much leſs whether the Coaſt be
well inhabited, and if it be, what
kind of buildings it has; all which
he may plainly and diſtinctly ſee
upon his going aſhore. And this
mention of the Sea puts me in mind
to point at another diſtinction,
which is that of ſome things we
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30742:35"/>
have an <hi>adequate,</hi> of others, but an
<hi>inadequate</hi> conception; as if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Navigator I was ſpeaking
of, ſhould look towards the main
Sea, though he might ſee a good
way diſtinctly, yet at length it
would appear ſo darkly and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
to him, that at the verge of
the ſenſible Horizon, his ſight would
make him judge that the Sea and
Sky come together, and yet he
would conclude that the utmoſt
part of the Sea he could deſcry, was
but a part of the Ocean, which
may, for ought he knows, reach to a
vaſt extent beyond the viſible Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon.</p>
               <p>To our confuſed, and often alſo
to our inadequate conceptions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
many of thoſe that may be
called Negative, which we are
wont to imploy when we ſpeak of
Privations or Negations, as Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Ignorance, Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We
have a poſitive <hi>Idea</hi> of things that
are ſquare and round, and black and
white, and in ſhort of other things,
whoſe ſhapes and colours make

The other thing that I was to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
about the nature of the Mind
is, that 'tis ſo conſtituted, that its
faculty of drawing conſequences
from known truths, is of greater
extent than its power of framing
clear and diſtinct <hi>Idaeas</hi> of things;
ſo that by ſubtle or ſucceſſive infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
it may attain to a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
that ſome things <hi>are,</hi> of
whoſe nature and properties (or at
leaſt of ſome of them) it can frame
no clear and ſatisfactory concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And that men ſhould be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to infer propoſitions about
divers things, than to penetrate
their nature, needs the leſs be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at, <hi>both</hi> becauſe 'tis oftentimes
ſufficient for our uſes to know that
ſuch things are, though that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
be not accompanied with a
clear and diſtinct <hi>Idaea;</hi> and becauſe
oftentimes the Rules (ſuch as, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is produced muſt have a cauſe;</hi>
and, <hi>from Truth, nothing rightly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
but Truth)</hi> are clear and eaſie
that enable the Mind to infer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
about things, whoſe nature
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30742:39"/>
is very dark, and abſtruſe.</p>

               <speaker>Eug.</speaker>
               <p>I know, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> that
you have not laid down theſe preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary
diſtinctions and remarks
without deſigning to make uſe of
them, which the little time that
now remains to manage our confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in, calls upon you to proceed
to do.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
               <p>I was juſt going to ſay,
<hi>Eugenius,</hi> that after what I have
premiſed, I hope it may now be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to apply the newly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Notions to the three ſorts of
things that I formerly repreſented
as being in ſome ſence <hi>above reaſon.</hi>
For I conſider, that there are ſome
objects of ſo immenſe and peculiar
a nature, that (if I may ſo ſpeak)
by an eaſie view of the mind, that
is without any ſubtle and laborious
diſquiſition, the Soul diſcerns, and
as it were feels the Object to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate
to her powers: And
accordingly if ſhe thinks ſit to try,
ſhe quickly finds her ſelf unable to
frame conceptions of them fit to be
acquieſc'd in, and this ſort of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30742:39"/>
I do upon that account call in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable,
or (on ſome occaſions)
<hi>ſupra-intellectual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when by attentively conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the attributes and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of things, we ſometimes find
that a thing hath ſome property be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to it, or doth perform
ſomewhat, which by reflecting on
the beings and ways of working
that we know already, we cannot
diſcern to be reducible to them or
derivable from them, we then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this property or this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be <hi>inexplicable;</hi> that is, ſuch
as that it cannot ſo much as in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
way be intelligibly accounted
for, and this makes the ſecond ſort
of our things above Reaſon. But
this is not all, for the Rational Soul
that is already furniſhed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
or at leaſt primitive <hi>Idaeas</hi> and
Rules of true and falſe, when ſhe
comes to examine certain things
and make ſucceſſive inferences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, ſhe finds (ſometimes to
her wonder as well as trouble) that
ſhe cannot avoid admitting ſome
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:30742:40"/>
conſequences as true &amp; good which
ſhe is not able to reconcile to ſome
other manifeſt Truth or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Propoſition: And whereas
other Truths are ſo harmonious,
that there is no diſagreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
any two of them, the Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roclite
Truths I ſpeak of appear not
ſymmetrical with the reſt of the
body of Truths, and we ſee not
how we can at once embrace theſe
and the reſt, without admitting that
grand abſurdity which ſubverts the
very foundation of our reaſonings,
<hi>That Contradictories may both be true.</hi>
As in the controverſie about the
endleſs diviſibility of a ſtrait line,
ſince 'tis manifeſt that a line of three
foot for inſtance is thrice as long as
a line of one foot, ſo that the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
line is but the third part of the
longer, it would follow that a part
of a line may contain as many parts
as a whole, ſince each of them is
diviſible into infinite parts, which
ſeems repugnant to common ſence,
and to contradict one of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Notions in <hi>Euclid,</hi> whereon
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30742:40"/>
Geometry it ſelf is built. Upon
which account I have ventured to
call this third ſort of things above
Reaſon <hi>Aſymmetrical</hi> or <hi>Unſociable,</hi>
of which eminent inſtances are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
us by thoſe controverſies
(ſuch as that of the <hi>compoſitio conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nui)</hi>
wherein which ſide ſoever of
the queſtion you take, you will be
unable <hi>directly</hi> and truly to anſwer
the objections that may be urged
to ſhow that you contradict ſome
primitive or ſome other acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
truth.</p>
               <p>Theſe, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> are ſome of
the conſiderations by which I have
been induced to diſtinguiſh the
things that to me ſeem to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match
our Reaſon, into three kinds.
For of thoſe things I have ſtil'd <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable,</hi>
our <hi>Idaeas</hi> are but ſuch
as a moderate attention ſuffices to
make the mind ſenſible that ſhe
wants either light or extent enough
to have a clear and full comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of them: And thoſe things that
I have called <hi>Inexplicable,</hi> are thoſe
which we cannot perceive to de-
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:30742:41"/>
upon the <hi>Idaeas</hi> we are furniſhed
with, and to reſemble in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of working any of the Agents
whoſe nature we are acquainted
with: And laſtly, thoſe things
which I have named <hi>Unſociable,</hi> are
ſuch as have Notions belonging to
them, or have concluſions deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from them, that are (for ought
we can diſcern) <hi>either</hi> incongruous
to our primitive <hi>Idaeas, or</hi> when
they are driven home, inconſiſtent
with the manifeſt Rules we are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with, to judge of True and
Falſe.</p>

               <p>I preſume, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> that
by ſorting things above Reaſon into

               <p>We owe ſo much to
God, the moſt perfect of Beings,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:30742:41"/>
not only for other bleſſings, but for
thoſe very Intellects that enable us
to contemplate him, that I ſhall be
very glad to learn any thing that
may increaſe my wonder and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for an Object, to whom I can
never pay enough of either.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
               <p>You ſpeak like your ſelf,
<hi>Timotheus,</hi> and I wiſh I were as able
as I ought to be willing, to ſatisfie
your deſire: But ſince we are now
diſcourſing like Philoſophers, not
Divines, I ſhall proceed to ſpeak of
that gloriouſeſt of Objects, But as
his Nature or ſome of his Attributes
afford me inſtances to the purpoſe,
for which I preſum'd to mention
him. <hi>When</hi> God therefore made
the World out of nothing, or (if
<hi>Pyrocles</hi> will not admit the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
<hi>when</hi> he diſcerns the ſecreteſt
thoughts and intentions of the
Mind, <hi>when</hi> he unites an immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Spirit to a humane Body, and
maintains, perhaps for very many
years, that unparallel'd union with
all the wonderful conditions he has
annex'd to it; <hi>when,</hi> I ſay, he doth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:30742:42"/>
theſe and many other things, that I
muſt not now ſtay to mention, he
ſupplies us with inſtances of things
that are <hi>Inexplicable:</hi> For ſuch ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
are not reducible to any of
the ways of working known to us;
ſince our own Minds can but modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
<hi>themſelves</hi> by divers manners of
thinking; and as for things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us, all that one body can do to
another by acting on it, is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
local motion to it, and
thereby produce in it the natural
conſequences of ſuch motion; in
all which there is no action like
any of thoſe I juſt now aſcrib'd to
God. And if we conſider that the
praeſcience of thoſe future events
that we call contingent, being a
perfection, is not to be denyed to
God; who is by all acknowledged
the perfecteſt of Beings and that
yet the greateſt Wits that have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to reconcile this infallible
praecognition with the liberty of
mans will, have been reduced to
maintain ſome thing or other, that
thwarts ſome acknowledged truth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:30742:42"/>
or dictate of Reaſon: If we duly
conſider this (I ſay) it will afford
us an inſtance of truths, whoſe
conſiſtency and whoſe ſymmetry
with the body of other truths, our
Reaſon cannot diſcern, and which
therefore ought to be referred to
that ſort of things above Reaſon,
that I call <hi>Unſociable.</hi> And now I
come to the third ſort of theſe
things which is that I formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
firſt under the name of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible</hi>
or <hi>ſupra</hi>-intellectual:
which Title, whether or no it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to any other Object, (which
I will not now enquire) doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
belong to <hi>God,</hi> whoſe Nature
comprehending all perfections in
their utmoſt poſſible degrees, is not
like to be comprehenſible by our
minds, who altogether want <hi>divers</hi>
of thoſe perfections, and have but
moderate meaſures, (not to call
them ſhadows) of <hi>the reſt.</hi> We are
indeed born with, or at leaſt have
a power and divers occaſions to
frame an <hi>Idaea</hi> of a Being infinitely
perfect, and by this <hi>Idaea</hi> we may
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30742:43"/>
ſufficiently diſcriminate the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of it, God, from all other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
whatſoever. But then, when
we come to conſider attentively &amp;
minutely what is contained in the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pyrocles.</speaker>
               <p>I ſuſpected <hi>Sophron.</hi>
by the tenour of your Diſcourſe
that the laſt Queſtions theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
asked you, diverted you
from ſaying ſomewhat more than
you did by way of application of
your preceding Diſcourſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophron.</speaker>
               <p>I was then indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to make, as I now ſhall, this
uſe of what I had been ſaying;
that I readily acknowledge that
'tis an arrogance to talk of infinite
or of priviledg'd things, with the
ſame confidence, or to pretend to
do it with the ſame clearneſs,
wherewith knowing men may
ſpeak of things unqueſtionably
within the compaſs of our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect:
But that this need not
hinder us from ſpeaking, nor doth
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30742:44"/>
diſable us from ſpeaking rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of priviledg'd things themſelves.
For all the notions that are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
are not of the ſame ſort or
order; and if none were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
but thoſe that enable us to
comprehend the Object, that is,
which give us a clear and diſtinct
knowledge of all that it contains
or that belongs to it, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
that we have no good Notions
of priviledg'd things in particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but then I muſt add, that I fear
we have few or none even of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things that we think our ſelves
very knowing in. And when we
ſpeak of things as being <hi>above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
though we have no clear, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
and adequate Notion o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
them, yet we may have a general
confus'd and inadequate Notion of
them, which may ſuffice to make
us diſcriminate their reſpective Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from all elſe, and from one
another; as may be obſerv'd in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral,
<hi>Idaeas</hi> that are negatively
fram'd, ſuch as thoſe we have o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
inviſible, incomprehenſible, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:30742:44"/>
in others which I formerly call'd
<hi>Inferr'd;</hi> becauſe they accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the remote Inferences whereby
one truth is concluded from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
as when Geometricians infer
from ſome propoſitions in Euclid
that any ſtrait line may be divided
farther and farther without ſtop.
For of this and ſome other propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
about priviledg'd things, we
are not quite deſtitute of allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Notions; as may appear by
<hi>ſome</hi> of the admirably ingenious
Speculations of Mathematicians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Affections of <hi>ſurd Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
and about <hi>incommenſurable
Magnitudes;</hi> about ſome of which
we have no ſuch clear and ſymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical
Conceptions as we have of
many other things, that are of a
nearer and more intelligible order.
And on this occaſion I ſhall not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to acknowledge, that partly
by my own Experience, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Confeſſions of others,
and by their unſuccesful Attempts,
I am induc'd to think that God,
who is a moſt free Agent, having
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:30742:45"/>
been pleas'd to make Intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
may perhaps have made them
of differing Ranks, or Orders, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Men may not be of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal;
and that whether there be
ſuch Orders or no, he hath at leaſt
made us Men, of a limited nature
(in general) and of a bounded Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.
Congruouſly to this I think
alſo, that he hath furniſhed man
either with certain innate <hi>Ideas</hi> or
Models and Principles, or with a
Faculty or Power and Diſpoſition
eaſily to frame them, as it meets
with occaſions (which readily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur)
to excite them: But becauſe
that (as I lately noted) God intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the mind of Man but of a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Capacity, his Underſtanding
is ſo conſtituted that the inbred or
eaſily acquir'd <hi>Idaeas</hi> and primitive
Axioms wherewith it is furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and by Relation or Analogy
whereunto it judges of all other
Notions, and Propoſitions, do not
extend to all knowable Objects
whatſoever; but reach only to
ſuch as have a ſufficient Affinity,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:30742:45"/>
or bear ſome proportion to thoſe
Primary <hi>Idaeas</hi> and Rules of Truth,
which are ſufficient if duly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,
to help us to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though not of the perfect
knowledge of truth's of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Orders, yet to the Competent
Knowledge of as much truth as
God thought fit to allow our minds
in their preſent (and perchance
laps'd) Condition, or ſtate of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with their mortal Bodies.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
               <p>Your Opinion, <hi>Sophron.</hi>
if I apprehend it aright, contains
two very differing Aſſertions; one
that it is allowable to contemplate
and even to diſcourſe of things <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Reaſon,</hi> ſince we may have
ſome Conceptions of them, though
they be but very dim and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
and <hi>the other,</hi> that we ought
not to look upon, or ſpeak of ſuch
Objects as things that we <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,</hi>
or have even ſuch a meaſure
of knowledge of, as we have of
things that are not priviledg'd.
For of theſe we are not to ſpeak
but with a peculiar Wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:30742:46"/>
and modeſt Diffidence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophron.</speaker>
               <p>You have expreſs'd
my thoughts <hi>Eugen.</hi> ſince I Intend
not to injoyn ſilence, or diſſwade
Curioſity, but yet forbid preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in reference to priviledg'd
things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Timoth.</speaker>
               <p>And truly <hi>Sophron.</hi> I
ſee no Reaſon to repine at the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
which your late Diſcourſe
hath in imitation of the Author of
nature himſelf, aſſign'd to human
Knowledg. For the number of
priviledg'd things is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
in compariſon of the
multitude of other things, to which
our knowledge may be improv'd
to reach; and which it far more
concerns us to know well, than it
doth to reſolve puzling Queſtions
about things incomprehenſible;
there being within the compaſs of
thoſe truths, enough to employ,
and reward our Curioſity without
ſtraining and tiring our Reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Objects that tranſcend it. And
yet even about <hi>theſe,</hi> ſome diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
may be allow'd us, for an
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:30742:46"/>
object that on the account of ſome
of its properties may be a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
one; may have divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things belonging to it, that do
not ſurpaſs our Reaſon, and whoſe
knowledge may therefore be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
by the due employment of
it.</p>
               <p>Thus we uſefully ſtudy the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Bodies, which make up the
Object of the Excellent Science of
Natural Philoſophy; though the
true Notion of Body in general be
a thing ſo difficult to frame, that
the beſt of our Modern Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
can by no means agree about
it. Which I do not wonder at;
becauſe if we purſue the notion of
a Body to the uttermoſt; 'twill lead
us to the perplexing controverſie, <hi>De
compoſitione continui,</hi> and there you
will not deny, but that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
will be left in the dark.
Thus Surveyors, Carpenters, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects,
and many others know
divers <hi>Affections</hi> of the ſquare Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
that are of great uſe to them
in their reſpective Employments,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:30742:47"/>
though that <hi>property</hi> of the ſquare,
that <hi>its ſide and diagonal are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurable,</hi>
be unknown to moſt
of them; and if they were told
of it, and would proſecute the
Speculation, would involve them
in exceeding great and probably
inſuperable difficulties.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sophron.</speaker>
               <p>To confirm what you
have been telling us, <hi>Timoth.</hi> I
ſhall venture to add, that even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
priviledg'd things, our inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
if modeſtly and diſcreetly
manag'd, may not only be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
but ſometimes profitable. For
even of ſuch Subjects a ſtudious
ſearch may bring us to know more
than we did, though not ſo much
as we would, nor enough to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſc'd
in. So that ſuch enquiries
may probably teach us, to know
the Objects better, and our ſelves
better too; by giving us ſuch a
ſenſible diſcovery of the inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of our Underſtandings to
comprehend all ſorts of things, as
may be very uſeful, though not
pleaſing, and may richly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:30742:47"/>
us, for the pains that end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſo inſtructive a diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And let me add to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
inſtances that have been
mention'd, the nobleſt that can be
given; I mean the Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God himſelf. For he hath
ſo ordered all things, that 'tis ſcarce
poſſible for us, to be deſtitute of
an <hi>Idaea</hi> of him, which will at leaſt
repreſent him as an <hi>exiſtent Being,</hi>
and more <hi>perfect</hi> than any other
Being; and yet when we come
with ſufficient Application of mind
to pry into the wonderful Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of this moſt ſingular and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorable
Being, we are, as was
lately obſerv'd, ſure to find our
ſelves unable to comprehend ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
an Object. Which yet
ought not to diſcourage us from ſo
noble a Study, ſince we are allow'd
the great contentment and honour
to make further and further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
of the excellenteſt of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
by that very <hi>immenſity</hi> of his
perfections, that makes it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for us to reach to the bounds
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:30742:48"/>
of his Excellency, or rather to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that it has any bounds at all.</p>
               <p>But, Gentlemen, I perceive I
have been ſo tranſported by the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this vaſt and divine Subject,
in whoſe Contemplation 'tis ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
and ſo pleaſant to loſe ones
ſelf, that I have forgot the notice
<hi>Eugen.</hi> gave me, a pretty while
ſince, that the time allotted for our
preſent conference was then near
expiring. And therefore I ſhall
leave you to pick out of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
to which your interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
tempted (not to ſay oblig'd)
me, the Applications, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make more methodically
of the diſtinctions I laid down.
And I am the leſs troubled to be
hindred from propoſing to you my
thoughts about the way of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
priviledg'd things from
others, becauſe we have a dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Monitor, or a kind of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Criterium</hi> always at hand to
help us. For I think it may well
be ſaid, that the wiſe Author of
Nature has endued the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:30742:48"/>
with ſuch a quick, though
internal, Senſation (if I may ſo call
it) that when due attention is not
wanting, it can feelingly diſcern
between other Objects, and thoſe
that are diſproportionate to its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.
As even in Beaſts, the
eye is ſo fram'd (according to the
inſtitution of Nature) that if it be
obverted to the bright noon-day-Sun,
there needs no Monitor, but
the operation of the ſame Sun, to
make it wink; (and perhaps
water) and thereby diſcover it
ſelf to be dazled and overpowr'd
by the diſproportionate Object.</p>

               <p>I confeſs your Diſcourſes,
Gentlemen, have made an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Impreſſion upon me; but
whether that will amount to a
Conviction will ſcarce appear till
our next Conference. Only thus
much I ſhall tell you now, that it
would much facilitate our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Opinion, if you did not
contend for altogether ſo much;
but would be pleas'd to leave it
undertermin'd, whether Man's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual

                  <hi>Faculty it ſelf</hi> is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
by the help of any degree
of light, to diſcover and know
thoſe things, which you call above
Reaſon? and would content your
ſelves to ſay, That there are ſome
things belonging to theſe Subjects,
which we muſt confeſs we have
leſs clear and diſtinct Notions of,
than we have even of the difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of thoſe things, that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
not to ſurpaſs our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
And that if we will take upon
us, to determine poſitively and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
about theſe tranſcendent
things, we muſt employ ways of
Reaſoning, congruous to their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
natures.</p>

               <p>And in the mean while,
<hi>Pyrocles,</hi> I am glad to find by the
laſt part of what you juſt now ſaid,
that you ſeem to be no longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd
to admit ſome things, that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30742:49"/>
(at leaſt in our preſent ſtate) do
ſome way or other ſurpaſs our
Reaſon. For I think that inſtead
of <hi>exalting</hi> that faculty, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
and <hi>defraud</hi> it, if we do not
freely allow it, as much enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Truth as we are able to
procure it: And conſequently if
Geometry, or Revelation, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
aſſure us of divers things
of which we can know but <hi>That
they are,</hi> and <hi>what they do,</hi> not,
<hi>what they are,</hi> and <hi>how they act,</hi> we
muſt neither refuſe, nor neglect
the ſtudy of ſuch Truths, any more
than we would refuſe <hi>to look into</hi>
any other Objects, than thoſe that
we can <hi>look through;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to enrich the Intellect as much
as we are able, we muſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
not only thoſe Truths, that
we can <hi>comprehend,</hi> but thoſe alſo,
how ſublime ſoever, that we can
have any <hi>certain,</hi> though but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
imperfect <hi>Knowledge</hi> of, Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſince thoſe remote and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe

more <hi>noble</hi> as more <hi>dark</hi> than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

and thereby render an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect

               <p>I Was very glad, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
to learn this
morning of <hi>Sophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
ſome things,
whence 'twas eaſie to conclude,
that by the Diſcourſe you had with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30742:52"/>
him laſt night, he has made it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
for <hi>me</hi> to demand, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
for <hi>you</hi> to <hi>grant,</hi> nay to <hi>prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi>
me, a Diſpenſation of the Task
you impoſed on me at our laſt mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
For tho' he ſpake with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
that became him of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
and gave me, but a haſty
and imperfect Account of what
paſs'd between you; yet I think I

<hi>Pyrocles</hi> himſelf was at leaſt <hi>inclin'd,</hi>

we will not be rigid Exactors of

much of what were otherwiſe

that a rational Aſſent may be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon Proofs that reach not to
rigid Demonſtrations, it being
ſufficient that they are ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to deſerve a wiſe mans Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence
in them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if any things can be made out
to be reveal'd by God concerning
his own Nature, or Actions, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
we ought firmly to believe

them, becauſe that, of ſome of
thoſe things, as his Praeſcience,
Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We can have no <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

the management of a Point he

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30742:58"/>
now time ſolemnly to Argue; I
ſhall only tell you in general that I
ſee no neceſſity, That Intelligibility
to a <hi>humane Underſtanding,</hi> ſhould
be neceſſary to the Truth or Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of a thing; any more then
that Viſibility to a <hi>Humane</hi> Eye,
ſhould be neceſſary to the Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of an Atome, or of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcle
of Air, or of the <hi>Effluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um's</hi>

Exhalations of <hi>Ambergris,</hi>
and Musk from a perfumed Glove;
I might here obſerve, that even
by the ſame Sence ſome Creatures
may diſcern things that may not
be perceptible to others: as no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
or application of the Organ
(or the Noſe) will inable <hi>a man</hi> to
perceive the <hi>Effluvia</hi> expiring
from the ſtale Footſteps of a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and unſeen Hare or Dear, tho'
<hi>Hounds,</hi> and eſpecially Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds,
will have a vivid Precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſuch Odours, and by their
help, trace and perſue the flying
and unſeen Beaſt. This, I ſay, may
be obſerved in Favour of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30742:58"/>
Argument; but 'twill perhaps
be a more proper illuſtration to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent,
that the natural Incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Childs Intellect, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the abſtruſe Affections of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabola's,
Hyperbola's</hi> and the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurable
Lines of a Square,
hinders not thoſe Figures, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contained in <hi>rerum naturâ,</hi> or
their Affections from being <hi>true</hi>
and <hi>demonſtrable.</hi> And tho' we do
admit ſome priviledged things in
the Sence above declared, yet, (to
ſay ſomewhat to obviate <hi>Pyrocles</hi>'s
Fear) there is no neceſſity that
we ſhould be interdicted all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of thoſe ſublime Objects, in
which there are many things,
whereof, or of their Conſequences,
we muſt confeſs our ſelves igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
Thus elder Geometricians
knew very well what a Rectangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Triangle was, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it to be a Figure conſiſting
of three ſtrait Lines, two of which
comprize a right Angle; though
probably for a great while they did
not know ſo much as all its <hi>chief
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30742:59"/>
Properties</hi> or Affections: ſince for
ought appears, before <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>
(who offered a <hi>Heccatombe</hi> to the
Muſes in gratitude for the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very)
it was not known that the
Square of the <hi>Hypothenuſa</hi> is equal
to the Squares of both the other
Sides; and much more likely it is,
that they were not able to ſolve
thoſe Difficulties (that continue to
perplex even <hi>our</hi> Age) which attend
that endleſs diviſibility of Lines,
that is inferrible from that Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the two Squares to the ſingle
Square.</p>
                  <p>And beſides the inſcrutable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of God, ſome of his Works
are ſuch, that, notwithſtanding the
compleat Knowledge of them ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
our Forces; yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
ſo many things, as well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be known, as poſſible to be
attained by us, that they will allow
Exerciſe enough to the Wits of all
the Philoſophers in the World.
And beſides that, as I have been
ſaying, even about theſe priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Subjects themſelves, divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30742:59"/>
things may be diſcovered,
if they were altogether impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable
by our Underſtandings, yet
their Number is ſo ſmall, that they
would leave a large Scope for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Knowledge to diffuſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it ſelf. For 'tis not every
thing that is hard to be underſtood
or contrary to the common Rules
of Probability, that has a right to
paſs for a priviledged thing, for
ſo the Paradoxes about Srud
Quantities, of Iſoperimetal Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures;
duplicate and triplicate
Proportion, and divers other ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
Doctrines that are capable
of Mathematical Demonſtrations,
would be priviledged things. Nor
are all thoſe worthy of this Title
that are by many propoſed and
embraced as Philoſophical Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
for, ſuch are the Peripateticks
Subſtantial Forms, which really
are not priviledged things, but
Scholaſtic Chimeras. But tho' I
ſhall not preſume poſitively to ſet
down the diſcriminating Bounds
and Signes of priviledged things,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30742:60"/>
yet moſt if not all of them being
ſuch, as are either primary in their
kind, as God himſelf, and the things
whoſe Nature flows immediately
from him, or elſe things that if
thorowly inſpected, do neceſſarily
involve the conſideration of ſome
kind of <hi>Infinitum, or</hi> elſe are ſuch
that tho' in ſome main Queſtions
about them one ſide muſt be taken,
both ſides are encombred with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,
or ſcarce ſuperable Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties:
Thoſe I ſay being all (or
ſome of them) the uſual marks
that belong to priviledged things,
you will eaſily grant, that their
Number is not near ſo great as their
abſtruſeneſs; and that therefore
<hi>Pyrocles</hi> and his Philoſophical
Friends need not fear to want em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
for their Curioſity. And
for farther Anſwer to his Objection
I ſhall add that we muſt regulate
our <hi>Belief</hi> by our <hi>Perceptions,</hi> not
our <hi>Wiſhes,</hi> and muſt not conclude,
that becauſe 'twere deſirable for
us, that all things were penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to our humane Underſtandings,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30742:60"/>
there is really nothing that is <hi>not</hi>
ſo: and we can no more conclude
that we are as knowing as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
becauſe we wiſh we were
ſo, than that we are as immortal
as they, becauſe we would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
die. But as for thoſe few
things that have belonging to
them, Properties ſo extraordinary,
as to make it probable, even at
the firſt ſight, that their Nature
muſt be very abſtruſe and difficult
be fully diſcover'd by us, I hope
<hi>Pyrocles</hi> will allow, that things of
ſo Heteroclite a Nature may
challenge an exemption from
ſome of the rules imployed about
common things; And that really
ſuch Rules as I mean, and ſome
alſo of the vulgar Notions cannot
always be ſafely extended to ſuch
Subjects, I forbear to ſhew in this

ſuch abſtruſe things,

                  <p>I did ſo, and do ſo ſtill:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30742:62"/>
but there is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between believing a proof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
affirmation about things
which the affirmer does not know
to be true, and framing Negative
Concluſions againſt Opinions,
which, for ought we yet clearly
know, <hi>may</hi> be true: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my preſent advice is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with my former: for here
I counſel only, either a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Judgment, when there
appears no proof on either ſide
ſufficient to ſway the Intellect; or
ſuch a wary and unprejudic'd aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to opinions that are but faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
probable, that the mind may
be ready to receive, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
obſtinacy, or ſurpriſe, any
better argument that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the contrary of the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we favour'd before.</p>

to avoid the framing of Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
even about thoſe ſublime

can frame but conjectures, and
thoſe often very ſlight ones.</p>

                  <p>I confeſs an abſolute
ſuſpenſion of judgment is a very
uneaſie thing, nor do I ſtrictly
require you ſhould entertain no
conjectures; but only that we
ſhould conſider that we may be
eaſily miſtaken in them, and by
further information ſee cauſe to
lay them down, and perhaps ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
them for contrary ones:
my thoughts of this matter may
be perchance ſomewhat illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by ſuppoſing that we four
were walking in a High-way, and
diſcover'd as far off as our eyes
could reach, ſome erected and
moving body of human ſtature;
tho we ſhould by its ſhape and
walking ſafely enough conclude
that 'twere no other animal than
a man, yet what manner of
man he were, as old, or young,
handſome, or ugly; we ſhould
not be able to diſcern, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
could have no ſufficient
ground to determine. And as if
I ſhould affirm him to be a young
man or handſome, you may juſtly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30742:63"/>
cenſure me of raſhneſs; ſo if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I cannot prove my conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
you ſhould reſolutely deny
that he is a young man or hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
I ſhould think you guilty,
tho not of an equal, yet of a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable
unwarineſs, becauſe, for
ought you know to the contrary,
he may be what I gueſs'd him to
be. And tho we are naturally ſo
uneaſie under fluctuation of mind,
that for my part I confeſs (and
it may be you may be ſubject to
the ſame Infirmity) I ſhould
ſcarce forbear reſembling in my
thoughts the man we ſpeak of to
ſome body or other that I knew,
yet I ſhould juſtly think that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
to be very fallible, and
<hi>both</hi> expect that when I ſhould
come to have a nearer and clearer
view of him, I might ſee cauſe
to diſmiſs my firſt <hi>Idea</hi> for that
which this new and better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
would afford me, tho it
were quite differing from that I

ſhould repreſent him, that my
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30742:63"/>
forward thought perhaps reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to a young man of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with black curl'd hair,
and a ruddy complexion, to be
pale and wrinckled, with grey
hair curl'd like a pound of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.
The Application, I ſuppoſe,
I may ſpare.</p>
                  <p>But Gentlemen, I would not be
underſtood in the preceding Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
as if I were againſt all
framing of Negative Propoſitions
about privileg'd Things; my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
being but to diſſuade from
haſty ones: For ſometimes 'tis
much more eaſie and ſafe to deny
things, than to affirm them to
belong to a Subject that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
our Reaſon. And the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
may be of uſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in two caſes; <hi>one,</hi> when the
Negative we aſſert is grounded
not upon Axioms taken from the
uſual courſe of Nature, or upon
Propoſitions dubious, or remote
from the firſt Principles of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but upon either Catholick
and Metaphyſical Axioms, or elſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30742:64"/>
upon Truths manifeſtly flowing
from ſome clear, tho inadequate
notion we have of the nature of
the things we treat of. The <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Caſe is, when we have a
clear and ſufficient proof by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
or otherwiſe, of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Attributes of the things we
contemplate; for then we may
ſafely deny of that Subject any
other thing that is really inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with that poſitive Attribute.
Upon which account it is, that
tho we do not fully comprehend
what God is, yet knowing by
the clear Light of Nature (and
if we be Chriſtians) believing
it upon the account of Revelation,
that he is a Being Intelligent and
infinitely perfect, we may ſafely
deny againſt <hi>Epicurus, Vorſtius,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> that he is a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal

               <head>The Third Advice, or Rule.</head>
               <head type="sub">That a matter of Fact or other
Truth about Privileg'd Things
being prov'd by Arguments
competent in their kind, we ought
not to deny it meerly becauſe we
cannot explain, or perhaps ſo
much as conceive the Modus of
it.</head>
               <p>'Tis no very difficult Task to
juſtifie this Advice; but I may
do it the better, if you give me
leave to frame and premiſe a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
for want of which I
have obſerved a want of Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in ſeveral Diſcourſes, where
the term <hi>Modus</hi> has been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed:
for ſometimes we would
deny ſo much as a poſſibillity, that
one thing can belong to, or be
truly ſaid of another; as when
we ſay we underſtand not how
one Creature can create another;
or how there can be a Line that is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30742:65"/>
neither ſtraight, nor crooked; or
a finite (whole) number that is
neither even nor odd. But moſt
commonly we mean by our not
underſtanding the <hi>Modus</hi> of a
thing, that we do not clearly and
diſtinctly conceive after what
manner the Property or other
Attribute of a Subject belongs to
it, or performs its operations.
The firſt kind of <hi>Modus</hi> may, for
diſtinctions ſake, be called a
<hi>poſſible Modus;</hi> and the other,
an <hi>actual modus.</hi> Now in both
the foregoing Acceptions of the
term <hi>Modus,</hi> we may find Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
fit for our preſent purpoſe.
For we cannot imagine, <hi>How</hi> a
ſhort Line or other finite Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
can be endleſly diviſible, or
(on the contrary) how Infinite
Parts ſhould make but a Finite
Total: and yet Geometry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains
us to admit, <hi>That</hi> it is ſo.
But tho there be but few Inſtances
of this kind, yet of the other
ſort of our Neſcience of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
of things, there may be found
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30742:65"/>
more Inſtances than we could
wiſh there were; for even in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and corporeal things the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
diſputes of the acuteſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and the ingenuous Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the moſt judicious and
moderate, ſufficiently manifeſt,
that as yet we know not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of operating whereby ſeveral
Bodies perform what we well
know they bring to paſs. And
not to enter into thoſe nice and
tedious Diſputes of the cauſe of
the Coheſion of the parts of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the ſmalleſt, moſt principal,
and moſt primary Bodies, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
without going out of our
ſelves, the way whereby the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Soul can exerciſe any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over the humane body, and
the way whereby the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and the Will act upon
one another, have not yet been
intelligibly explain'd by any.
And the like I may ſay of the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the <hi>Memory,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in thoſe in whom that facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is eminent. For 'tis a thing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30742:66"/>
much more fit to be admired,
than eaſie to be conceived, how
in ſo narrow a compaſs as part of
a Human Brain, there ſhould be
ſo many thouſand diſtinct Cells or
Impreſſions as are requiſite to
harbour the Characters or Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of many Languages, each
of them conſiſting of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
differing Words, beſides the
Images or Models of ſo many
thouſand Faces, Schemes, Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and other ſenſible Objects,
and the Ideas of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Notions and Thoughts, and
the diſtinct Footſteps of almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
multitudes of other
things: and how all theſe ſhall in
ſo narrow a compaſs have ſuch
deep and laſting Impreſſions made
for them, and be oftentimes
lodged ſo exactly in the order
wherein they were at firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the memory (and that
perhaps many years before) that
upon a ſudden command of the
Will, or a ſlight caſual Hint, a
whole ſet of Words, Things and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30742:66"/>
Circumſtances will in a trice, as it
were, ſtart up and preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
even in the very <hi>Series,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and manner that ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
belong'd to them. And I
doubt not, but that beſides thoſe
abſtruſe things, about the <hi>Modus,</hi>
of which the more candid Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
have confeſſed their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
there would many others
have been taken notice of, if we
did but as ſeriouſly and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
inquire into the Nature of all
the things we are pleaſed to think
we know. And when I reflect on
the yet depending Diſputes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Philoſophers and Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians
about the nature of
<hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Local Motion,</hi> which
are things ſo obvious and familiar
to us, I ſhould, tho I had no other
Inducements, be inclin'd to think,
that we ſhould find difficulties e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in many other Subjects
wherein we do not now take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of any, if we particularly
ſtudyed their nature; and that
our acquieſcence in what we have
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30742:67"/>
learned about many things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not from our greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their nature, but from
our having exerciſed leſs curioſity
and attention in conſidering it.</p>
               <p>And if in things <hi>Corporeal,</hi> that
are the familiar objects of our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
we are often reduc'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
our Ignorance of the Modes
of their inexiſting or operating,
I hope it will not be denyed, that
to a Being wholly unapproachable
by our Senſes, natural Theology
may be allowed to aſcribe ſome
things whoſe <hi>Modus</hi> is not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by our underſtanding: As
the Divine Preſcience of <hi>future
Contingents;</hi> which as 'twere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,
to deny as to the truth of the
thing; ſo I fear 'tis impoſſible to
explicate as to the <hi>Modus</hi> of it.</p>

                  <p>If it were at this time
proper for me to meddle with
things of that kind, I ſhould not
much ſcruple to ſay in favour of
the Chriſtian Religion, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Tenents granted both by
Chriſtians, Jews, and Heathens,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30742:67"/>
as parts of <hi>natural</hi> Theology, to
me ſeem as difficult to be con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as divers of thoſe Myſteries
that for their unintelligibleſs are
fiercely oppoſed in <hi>Reveal'd</hi> Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.
I will not take upon me
to judge of others; but for my
part I confeſs, I do not much
better underſtand, how an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and a Will and Affections
are diſtinctly inexiſtent in God, in
ſuch ſort as they are wont to be
attributed to him, than how in
him there can be a Trinity; ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
not as ſome Schoolmen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate,
or rather darken it, but
as the Goſpel delivers it: I can as
little explain by any thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
how God, who is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
Subſtance, can move
Matter, as how he can create it:
nor would it at all ſatisfie me to
tell me, that a Rational Soul
moves a Human Body; for I do
not allow, that it gives any motion
to the Body, but only guides that
which other Agents have put the
parts of it into. And tho it did
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30742:68"/>
produce motion in the Body, my
ſcruple would yet remain; for
the <hi>Carteſians</hi> themſelves confeſs,
that the power the Soul has of ſo
much as <hi>determining</hi> the motion
of the Body belongs to it, not
upon any Phyſical Account, but
by the particular Appointment
and immediate Power of God,
who would have that Power one
of the Conditions or Properties
of the Union of the Soul and
Body. So that to me, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to have it explained how an
immaterial Subſtance can move
Matter, and conſequently, how
God can do it, it will be no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to ſay, that the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Soul can move the Body 'tis
joyned to, ſince that Power is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
merely to God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And the queſtion is, how
God himſelf can be conceived to
move matter.</p>

                  <p>I know not whether
upon the ſame Grounds which I
do not diſallow, I may not add,
that whereas by many 'tis looked
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30742:68"/>
upon as an inconceivable thing
that God ſhould ſee mens
Thoughts, to me it appears as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
intelligible how he can know
their outward Actions: For ſince
we have no way of diſcerning the
particular motions of Mens Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but by ſome of our Senſes,
eſpecially our ſight; and ſince
thoſe Senſations themſelves neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
require Organs duly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
that is, made up of divers
parts, fram'd and joyn'd after ſuch
a determinate manner, I ſee not
how we can explain the Percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of viſible Objects without an
Eye, or ſo much as any Corporeal
Organ, or Subſtance; eſpecially
ſince 'tis, and that very juſtly,
aſſerted, that the Deity is not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
to any portion of matter, as
the Human Soul is to the Human
Body. And to theſe Inſtances,
others to the ſame purpoſe might
be added, but that I think it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to mind you, that of thoſe it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
mention'd amongſt us, there
are ſome that I preſume you will
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:30742:69"/>
judg referable to that which I late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called a <hi>poſſible Modus;</hi> ſince it
ſeems, <hi>toto genere,</hi> as they ſpeak,
inexplicable, how the Attribute
inexiſts in the Subject, and after
what manner the Cauſe can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Effect aſcribed to it.</p>

                  <p>A full Anſwer to that
Queſtion would take up too much
of that little time that is allowed
us before it grow dark, to go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the Advices that yet remain
unſpoken of. But yet to comply
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30742:69"/>
with you as far as my haſte will
permit, I ſhall name two or three
kinds of poſitive proofs, that may
be employed on ſuch occaſions as
we ſpeak of. And <hi>firſt,</hi> if there
be an effect that we diſcern muſt
proceed from ſuch a Cauſe, or
Agent, we may conclude that
ſuch a Cauſe there is, tho we do
not particularly conceive how,
or by what operation 'tis able to
produce the acknowledg'd effect:
Thus, tho a man otherwiſe of a
good Judgment, being wholly a
ſtranger to the Mathematicks,
cannot conceive how a skillful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomer
can many years before
hand fore-tell Eclipſes to a day
and hour, and perhaps to a few
minutes; yet when the ſucceſs
does, as it often happens, verifie
ſuch Predictions, he will be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that the maker of them had
the skill to foreknow the things
foretold in them. And ſo the
generality of Learned Men among
us, who are not ſo much acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with that part of Navigation,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30742:70"/>
which ſome Moderns have by a
Greek Name called <hi>Limen-Eure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi>
or the Art of ſteering to
Harbours, cannot well conceive
how a Ship, that is, for inſtance,
in the vaſt Atlantick Ocean above
a thouſand miles from any ſhoar,
ſhould be ſo directed as to arrive
juſt at a little Harbor not Cannon-ſhot
over, which perhaps neither
the Pilot, nor any other in the
Ship ever ſaw. And yet as little
as we can diſtinctly conceive how
ſuch an Art of finding Ports can
be framed, we ſcruple not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
there is ſuch an one, becauſe
Navigators to the Eaſt and Weſt
<hi>Indies,</hi> could not without the
Guidance of ſuch an Art find the
remoteſt Ports they are bound
for.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond ſort there is of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
proofs conſiſting of thoſe
Conſequences that are clearly and
legitimately inferr'd from any
manifeſt acknowledg'd, or alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
demonſtrated Truth. To this
ſort belong divers Mathematical
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30742:70"/>
Propoſitions and Corollaries,
which tho being nakedly propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
they ſeem incredible to the
generality of Learned Men, and
ſometimes to Mathematicians
themſelves, are yet fully aſſented
to, becauſe they clearly follow
from either manifeſted or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
Truths. Thus many can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive how 'tis poſſible
there may be a million, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
of Circles, (or as many
more as you pleaſe) whoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferences
ſhall each of them
come nearer and nearer to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and to a ſtraight Line aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd,
and yet none of them
either touch, much leſs cut, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any other Circle, or that
Line but in one and the ſame
point. And yet this is one of the
odd Propoſitions that Geometers
have rightly deduc'd as Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
from the ſixteenth of <hi>Euclid</hi>'s
third Element. And tho we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
clearly conceive how two
Lines, that at their remoteſt ends
are but little diſtant from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30742:71"/>
ſhould perpetually incline
towards each other without ever
concurring; yet Geometricians,
that is, the rigideſt Reaſoners that
we know of, have been compell'd
admit this in the <hi>Linea Conchoides</hi>
of <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> to name no more.
But tho, (not to touch the ſame
ſtrings too often) I thought fit to
mention theſe Inſtances; yet
whether you judge them ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
or no, you will allow that
which may be taken from the
endleſs diviſibility of a Line: For
tho, if I miſremember not, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronius</hi>
told me, he took notice
to you how unable we are to have
a ſatisfactory apprehenſion, how
a ſhort line as well as a long, can
be divided into more and more
parts without any ſtop; yet Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians
generally admit this,
becauſe it may be clearly deduc'd
from ſome Geometrical Truths,
and particularly from the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurableneſs
of the Side and
Diagonal of a Square: And if
you will allow me to have once
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:30742:71"/>
more recourſe to Divine Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
I may add another acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
inſtance by repreſenting,
that Philoſophers have admitted
that, becauſe they judged it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to follow from the infinite
Perfections of God; tho, how
he can foreſee Contingency the
moſt judicious and modeſt of them
did not pretend their Reaſon was
able to conceive.</p>

of which this is indeed lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more than a Corollary. For
it being evident, that as a great
part of the Dictates of Reaſon
are Negative, ſo Negative Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
do uſually ſpring from
the repugnancy we judge that
ſome things have to ſome poſitive
Dictate of Reaſon; if thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Dictates contain but gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and limited Truths (to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

come to be unduly extended to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30742:72"/>
privileg'd Subjectss it may very

may be really true, that yet muſt
appear falſe, if it be judg'd of by
its congruity to one of thoſe limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

not only in Philoſophy, but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
(as well as reveal'd) Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
the uſual ground on which
we reject many things is, that we
judge them unintelligible. And
I cenſure not the practice in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,

miſlead us, when it is extended to
things that we may diſcern to

yet appears, ſome of the <hi>Modus</hi>'s

go out of our ſelves to find In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of both the parts of what
<hi>Arnobius</hi> was laſt ſaying, if we
admit, as I queſtion not but we
rationally may, this Tenet of the
generality of Philoſophers, both
ancient and modern, That the
Reaſonable Soul is an immaterial
Subſtance: For then; whereas
men think they have ſufficiently
enumerated the ways of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the motion of a Body,
by ſaying, that the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
muſt be made either in the
Line wherein the Impellent that
put it into motion made it move,
or in the Line wherein it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to move by the ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the reſiſting Body that it
met with in its way; the motions
of the animal Spirits, if not alſo
ſome other internal parts of the
Body, may, the Body being duly
diſpoſed, be determined by the
human Will; which is a way
quite differing from the other.
And how this Attribute, I mean
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:30742:74"/>
the power of determining the
motion of a Body, without any
power to impart motion to that
Body, ſhould belong to an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Creature, which has no
Corporeal Parts to reſiſt the free
paſſage of a Body, and thereby
change the Line of its Motion, is
not yet, nor perhaps ever will be
in this life, clearly conceived by
us men, tho there is no doubt,
but that he, who indowed the
Soul with this Attribute or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
perfectly underſtands, both
how it exiſts in the Soul, and
how the Soul by exerting it, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
on the Body.</p>

of Opinions that are found
contrary to thoſe Rules of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
at the framing of which the
things opin'd about were duly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into conſideration: But in
Caſes not thought on when ſuch
Rules were deviſed, we are not
always bound to ſubmit to be

an opinion unconformable to ſuch
a Rule, may be not to <hi>oppoſe</hi> a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine

that the Rule is expreſſed in

very unwilling, to allow any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion

                  <p>This Objection, <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles,</hi>
ſeems to me to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
rather upon an ambiguity of
Terms, than the true nature of
Things. For Reaſon is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
taken for a Set of Notions
and Propoſitions employ'd and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſc'd
in by this or that ſort of
Reaſoners, that are wont to have
names given them from this or
that particular Diſcipline, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy,
Chymiſtry, Opticks,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> of whoſe receiv'd Doctrines
they are ſuppoſed to be entirely
maintainers. But it is alſo with
at leaſt as much propriety, uſed
to ſignifie the rational faculty it
ſelf; furniſhed with the light that
accompanies it when it is rightly
diſpoſed and informed. In the
firſt of theſe two Senſes it ſeems
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:30742:76"/>
but reaſonable to allow, that ſome
things ought to have the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
to be exempted from being
judg'd by <hi>ſome</hi> of the ſame Rules
that are employ'd to judge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things by; for ſome of theſe
Rules were fram'd upon a ſlight
conſideration of common and
familiar things, either by the
vulgar, or by men that for want
of skill or application of mind
did not critically conſider the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
natures of things, and yet
preſum'd to ſettle Rules that other
mens inadvertence or lazineſs has
made them receive for certain
Dictates of Reaſon: whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
natures ſhould have been then
conſidered as well as thoſe: and
by reaſon of their not having
been ſo, the Rules I ſpeak of are
not always proper and ſafe, when
they are applyed to theſe over-looked
natures. Thus <hi>Succeſſive
Beings,</hi> as Time and Local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
do in ſome Caſes require to
be eſtimated by other meaſures
than <hi>Subſtances,</hi> whether materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:30742:77"/>
or incorporeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo alſo
the more nice Metaphyſicians, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
among the Moderns,
have thought themſelves obliged
to diſcourſe of <hi>Moduſes,</hi> Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Privations, Extrinſecal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
way from that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to Bodies and Spirits; tho
the unskilful (even among other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
learned men) have been
wont, and ſtill are apt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
all theſe Subjects; by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
to them indiſcriminately
the ſame Rules, or, as they think
them, Dictates of Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>But beſides what may be ſaid
of theſe long unregarded or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed
natures, there are
other entities that are more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and familiarly taken notice
of, wherein I may think one may
find inſtances more applyable to
my preſent purpoſe. For I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that tho all other actual
Beings are compounded (to ſpeak
in the language of the Schools) of
Eſſence and Exiſtence; yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30742:77"/>
to the notion of Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicians
as well as Divines, it
muſt be acknowledg'd, that the
ſimplicity of the Divine Nature
is ſuch as to exclude from God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
this kind of compoſition. And
indeed the notion we have of a
Being infinitely perfect, imports,
that, tho in no other Being, yet in
this, thoſe two are inſeparable;
for actual exiſtence being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
muſt needs belong to the
Nature of a Being infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
The generality of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
after <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> conceive
<hi>Place</hi> to be the immoveable and
immediately contiguous concave
Surface of the ambient Body, ſo
that 'tis a kind of Veſſel that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way contains the Body lodg'd
in it; but with this difference
that a Veſſel is a kind of move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
place, as when a Bottle of
Wine is carried from the Cellar
to the Table; but place is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
Veſſel, or a Veſſel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as immoveable: now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
with: <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30742:78"/>
generality of Philoſophers, the
plenitude of the world, it may be
truly ſaid, that all Plants, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
Minerals, Stars and other
Bodies are each of them in ſuch an
Ariſtotelian place as has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd;
whence it has been uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſaid by Philoſophers, that
what is in no place (I hope they
meant it only of Bodies) is not
at all; yet it appears not how the
outermoſt Heaven, whether that
be the Firmament, or no, I need
not here inquire, can be properly
ſaid to be in a place, ſince theſe
Philoſophers aſſerting the World
to be finite, muſt grant there is no
ambient body without it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it. And I ſhall add on this
occaſion, that if the outermoſt
Heaven ſhould be impell'd by the
irreſiſtible power of God in a
ſtraight line this way, or that way,
there ſhould enſue a motion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
change of place, for the
outermoſt Heaven was in none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and does not by its progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
come to be contain'd by a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:30742:78"/>
new ambient Body. And in this
caſe even according to thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Favourers of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> that
approve <hi>Des' Cartes</hi> his definition
of local motion (which indeed is
far more intelligible than <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s)
the world may be ſaid to
move without changing of place;
for it does not paſs from the
Neighbourhood of ſome Bodies
to that of others; ſince compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
all Bodies, and yet being
bounded, there is no body for it
to leave behind, nor any beyond
it for it to approach to; and tho
the Carteſians in their Hypotheſis
of the indefiniteſs of the World
do partly avoid the force of what
I have been ſaying; yet beſides
what may be rationally urg'd to
ſhew, that if the world be not
more than indefinite, it muſt be
really finite; I conſider that the
Carteſians, tho upon grounds of
their own, muſt allow what I was
obſerving, namely, that tho eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular body in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
is naturally capable of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:30742:79"/>
Motion. Yet the Univerſe it
ſelf is not; and tho every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
body in the world have
ſome determinate Figure; yet
the world it ſelf, being indefinite,
has not ſo.</p>
                  <p>Whereas <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
that have lived ſince his
time, have generally admitted
the diviſion eſtabliſh'd by him, of
all Entities, into Subſtance, and
Accident, and accommodated
their Rules to one of them, or
both: The Learned <hi>Gaſſendus</hi>
and his Followers, have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
a third ſort of things, as not
being either Subſtances, or Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents:
and theſe if you will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
you will I preſume, admit
too, that they may be privileg'd
from their Rules calculated for
other Natures. Of this kind of
things, the <hi>Gaſſendiſts</hi> make Place
or Space to be. For they will not
allow it to be a Subſtance, becauſe
it is neither body, nor ſpirit, but
only ſomewhat that has a capacity
to receive or contain bodies, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:30742:79"/>
would ſubſiſt, tho God ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate
all the Subſtances he has
created. And for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it is not to be called an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
ſince that neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a Subſtance to reſide in
(according to that received <hi>Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om)
Accidentis eſſe, eſt ineſſe,</hi>
whereas in caſe of the annihilation
of the world it ſelf, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
all Subſtances that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it, their place or ſpace would
ſtill remain, and be capable of
admitting a new world of the
ſame extent, if God ſhould be
pleaſed to create it; whence <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendus</hi>
wittily infers, that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are rather accidental in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of place, than ſpace in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Bodies. But without
ſtaying to examine this Paradox,
I ſhall venture to ſay in general,
that he who ſhall with an heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and unprejudiced eye, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
the ſeveral <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> or
Syſtems, maintain'd by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Sects of Philoſophers, may
find, that tho the Inſtances will
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:30742:80"/>
not be all of them the ſame; yet
there is none of theſe Syſtems in
which one may not obſerve ſome
thing or other, to which every
one of the Rules that reach to the
other Snbjects treated of in that
Philoſophy, cannot ſafely be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd.
And indeed the mind of
man being naturally far more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to know much, than to
take the pains requiſite to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
whether he does ſo or not,
is very prone to think that any
ſmall number of things that it has
not diſtinctly conſidered, muſt
be of the ſame nature and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the reſt that he judges
to be of the ſame kind. For by
thus attaining to the knowledge of
things, by way of Inference, the
mind gratifies at once both its
vanity, and its lazineſs; looking
upon theſe Concluſions, as marks
of the excellency of its rational
faculty, whilſt they rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a want of the due exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of it.</p>

                  <p>Your double obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>Pyrocles,</hi> I confeſs to be
weighty enough to deſerve a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate
anſwer, and to give you
the ſum of mine in few words, I
ſhall tell you, that in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſince there is no progreſs <hi>in
infinitum</hi> in the <hi>Criteria</hi> of truth,
and that our faculties are the beſt
inſtruments that God has given us
to diſcover, and to examine it by, I
think a clear light or evidence of
perception ſhining in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
affords us the greateſt
aſſurance we can have, (I mean
in a <hi>natural</hi> way) of the truth of
the judgments we paſs upon
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:30742:81"/>
things, whether they be other
things, or the vulgar rules of
reaſoning, or ſubjects that claim
a privilege from thoſe rules.</p>
                  <p>And here give me leave to
conſider, that it is not by <hi>inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
but by <hi>evidence,</hi> that we know,
that <hi>ex vero nil niſi verum ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
By which it appears, that
the <hi>innate light</hi> of the rational
faculty is more primary, than the
very <hi>Rules of Reaſoning,</hi> ſince by
that light we judge even of the
lately mention'd Axiom which is
it ſelf the grand principle of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinations
made by Inference.</p>

                  <p>This matter may be
perchance ſomewhat illuſtrated
by obſerving that, as the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is wont to be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as the eye of the mind; ſo
there is this Analogy between
them, that there are ſome things
that the eye may diſcern (and
does judge of) organically, if I
may ſo ſpeak, that is, by the help
of inſtruments: as when it judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of a Line to be ſtreight by the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30742:81"/>
applicasion of a Ruler to it, or
to be perpendicular by the help of
a Plumb-line, or a Circle to be
perfect by the help of a pair of
Compaſſes: But there are other
things which the eye does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
(and judge of) immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
and by intuition, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of Organs or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
as when by the bare evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the perception it knows
that this colour is red, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
blue, and that Snow is white,
not black, and a Char-coal black,
not white; and ſuch a Picture is
very like, or another unlike to
the face it was drawn to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
For thus there are ſome
things that the Intellect uſually
judges of in a kind of Organical
way, that is, by the help of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rules, or Hypotheſes, ſuch
as are a great part of the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems
and Concluſions in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
and Divinity. But there
are others which it knows with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of theſe Rules more
immediately, and as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitively
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:30742:82"/>
by evidence or percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
by which way we know ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
prime notions and <hi>Effata,</hi> or
Axioms Metaphyſical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as
that <hi>Contradictory Propoſitions
cannot both be true;</hi> that <hi>from
truth nothing but truth can legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
be deduc'd;</hi> that <hi>two things
that are each of them equal to a
third thing, are equal to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
that <hi>a whole number is either
even or odd.</hi> And 'tis alſo upon
this evidence of perception; that
we receive with an undoubted aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
many primitive Ideas and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſuch as thoſe of extended
Subſtance or Body, Diviſibility,
or Local Motion, a ſtreight Line,
a Circle, a right Angle, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things that it would be
here ſuperfluous to mention.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Arnobius.</speaker>
                  <p>I think the internal
Light that the Author of Nature
has ſet up in mans Intellect qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies
him, if he makes a right
uſe of it, not only to <hi>apply</hi> the
Inſtruments of Knowledge, but
alſo to <hi>frame,</hi> and to <hi>examine</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:30742:82"/>
them. For by the help of this
Light, the Underſtanding is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to look about, and both to
conſider apart, and compare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
the natures of all kinds
of things; without being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to employ in its Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
the Rules or Dictates of
any particular Science or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
being ſufficiently aſſiſted
by its own Light, and thoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Axioms and Notions that
are of a Catholick Nature, and
perpetual truth; and ſo of a
higher order, than the Dictates,
or Rules of any particular or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Science or Art. And by
theſe means the Underſtanding
may perceive the imperfection
and falſity of ſuch Rules or Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems,
as thoſe men that look no
higher, nor no further than their
own particular Science or Art,
embrace for certain and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable.
Thus when Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
obſerv'd that they could
frame a clear notion of a thing
without conſidering whether it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:30742:83"/>
were actually in being or not; or
even when they ſuppoſe that 'tis
not actually in being; as we can
frame a clear conception of a <hi>Roſe</hi>
in Winter, when there are none
to be found growing; and have a
clear notion of a <hi>Myriagon,</hi> tho
'tis very like there is no ſuch Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
really exiſtent in the world.
They have generally concluded,
that the eſſence of things is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
and ſeparable from their
exiſtence. And yet when we
conſider that God is a Being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
perfect, and that actual
exiſtence being a perfection, muſt
belong to <hi>Him;</hi> we may by the
ſame light of Reaſon that dictated
Eſſence &amp; Exiſtence to be two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
things in all other Beings,
diſcern that they muſt be inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in God; and conſequently
that the forementioned Rule, tho
more <hi>general</hi> than almoſt any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is not abſolutely <hi>univerſal:</hi>
but muſt be limited by the light
of Reaſon. And thus alſo Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
conſidering that not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30742:83"/>
only all ſorts of Bodies, but the
immaterial Souls of Men, (and
Angels themſelves, ſuppoſing
ſuch Beings) are all endowed
with Qualities which are Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
have included it in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
notion of a ſubſtance, to be
the ſubject of Accidents, or as
the Schoolmen ſpeak, <hi>ſubſtare Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentibus;</hi>
and accordingly <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia</hi>
is wont to be derived <hi>à


ſubſtando:</hi> But the infranchiſed
Intellect, finding in it ſelf a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an abſolutely perfect,
and therefore exiſtent Being; and
conſidering that to be the ſubject
of Accidents, is not a thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the higheſt perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
poſſible; it concludes, that in
God there are no Accidents. And
this Concluſion has been embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
as a part, not only of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
but of Natural Theology;
and maintain'd by divers Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
themſelves, upon Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical
and other meerly ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
grounds. In ſhort, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
light of the mind may enable
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30742:84"/>
a man, that will make a free and
induſtrious uſe of it, both to paſs
a right judgment of the extent
of thoſe very Dictates that are
commonly taken for Rules of
Reaſon, and to frame others on
purpoſe for priviledg'd things, ſo
far forth as they are ſo. But I
fear, Gentlemen, the fourth Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
I have ventured to offer you,
has by its tediouſneſs, made you
juſtly impatient of being detain'd
by it ſo long: and therefore I

all our Ratiocinations, than
that two Truths cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Arnob.</speaker>
                  <p>Tho I am far from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming,
that one Truth can
really contradict another truth;
yet I think that which is but a
gradual or limited truth, may in
ſome few caſes not be reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:30742:85"/>
by <hi>Us,</hi> to an abſolute and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
Truth. For, I think we
may (with <hi>Sophronius)</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
thoſe Propoſitions we call
true, into Axioms Metaphyſical,
or Univerſal, that hold in all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
without reſervation; and
Axioms collected or emergent;
by which I mean ſuch as reſult
from comparing together many
particulars that agree in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is common to them all.
And ſome of theſe, tho they be
ſo general, that in the uſual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of our Ratiocinations they
admit of no exceptions; yet may
not be abſolutely and unlimitedly
true; of which I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I formerly gave you an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
even in that Axiom which
(almoſt) all meerly Natural
Philoſophers have ſuppoſed and
built on, that, <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi>
which, tho at leaſt one of the
higheſt of gradual or collected
Truths, may yet be not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
true, ſince, for ought we
know, God that is acknowledged
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:30742:86"/>
to be a Being that is infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
may have, and may have
exerciſed, the power of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
And in ſuch Caſes as this,
not to be able to reconcile a truth
concerning a privileged thing
with a Propoſition that generally
paſſes for true (and in other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
is ſo indeed) will not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oblige us to reject either Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
as falſe, but ſometimes,
without deſtroying either, only
to give one of them a due limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and reſtrain it to thoſe ſorts
of things, on which 'twas at firſt
grounded, and to which 'twas,
becauſe of mans ignorance, or
inconſiderateneſs, that 'twas not
at firſt confin'd. And if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
vouch'd either for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
or for any other Religion,
be any of them granted to be true;
(as almoſt all mankind agrees in
believing in general, that there
have been true Miracles;) it
cannot well be deny'd but that
Phyſical Propoſitions are but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
and ſuch as I called Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30742:86"/>
Truths, being gathered
from the ſettled <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of
Nature, and are lyable to this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
or exception, that <hi>They
are true, where the irreſiſtible power
of God, or ſome other ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Agent is not interpos'd to alter
the courſe of Nature.</hi>

                  <speaker>Pyrocl.</speaker>
                  <p>But do you think, there
are no inconſiſtent Propoſitions
that you would call Truths,
wherein you cannot ſhew that one
of them is but a gradual or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent
Truth?</p>

                  <speaker>Arnob.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis one thing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
whether <hi>men</hi> have yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned,
or I am able to make
out, that one of the Propoſitions
you ſpeak of is but a limited truth;
and another, to inquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpeaking abſolutely and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally,
it may to any Intellect
appear to be no more than ſuch.
For firſt I conſider, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why we judge things to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant,
Being, that the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Ideas we have of them
ſeem to us inconſiſtent, if either
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30742:87"/>
of theſe notions be wrong fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
or be judged of by an unfit
Rule, we may think thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
to be contradictory that
really are not ſo; as, if you heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
mark it, you ſhall find, that
thoſe that are wont to employ
their imaginations about things
that are the proper Objects of the
Intellect, are apt to pronounce
things to be unconceivable, only
becauſe they find them unimagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
as if the Fancy and the
Intellect were Faculties of the
ſame extent: Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
ſome have ſo groſly err'd,
as to deny all immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and choſe rather ſo far
to degrade the Deity it ſelf, as to
impute to it a Corporeal Nature,
than to allow any thing to have a
Being that is not comprehenſible
by their Imagination, which
themſelves acknowledge to be but
a Corporeal Faculty. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this miſtake of things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant,
which ariſes from the
miſ application or miſ-manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30742:87"/>
of our diſcerning Faculties,
I conſider in the next place, that
there may be another that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the Imperfection and
Limitedneſs of our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which being unable to judge
of privileged things at the ſame
rate that it does of other Objects,
may ſometimes be unable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
that reconcileableneſs that
a more illuminated and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Faculty may diſcern. This
may be illuſtrated by what uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
happens at Sea, (for there
mens Proſpect is the moſt free)
when looking towards the Main,
the Sky and the Waters ſeem to
meet at the edge of the (ſenſible)
Horizon, tho indeed they are as
far diſtant as Heaven is from
Earth; and on the other ſide if
you skillfully mix together the
dry and fine powder ef Orpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that of Indico, you
will produce a green colour, as
is known to Painters, and the
eye takes notice but of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
mixture, in which it ſees
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:30742:88"/>
neither blew nor yellow: But if,
(as experience ſhews) you look
on this mixture with a very good
Microſcope, the emergent colour
will diſappear; and you will
plainly ſee inſtead of it, blew
and yellow grains of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
diſtinct from one another.
Which Inſtances may ſerve to
ſhew the imbecillity of our viſive
Faculty; and the later of them
may teach us, that a thing may
appear one and differing, as 'tis
looked upon by a more or leſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning
ſight. But an inſtance
more home to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
may be afforded by yellow
Diamonds, which becauſe of
their Colour, not only other
Men, but the generality of Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths
(in whoſe error I have
ſometimes ſhared) take to be
counterfeit Gems, or at beſt but
right Topazes, whereas very
skillful Lapidaries, will by ſure
ſigns diſcover and acknowledge
them to be true Diamonds, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
their ſeeming dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30742:88"/>
from unqueſtion'd ones,
and account them to be of the
ſame nature with that nobleſt kind
of Jewels. Whence we may learn
that a more skillful Judge may
diſcern an agreement in things
that almoſt all other men think
they ſee manifeſtly to be of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
natures.</p>

                  <p>Give me leave,
Gentlemen, to ſay on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that I have ſeveral times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that men judge ſome
things to be irreconcileable, not
only when they are both of them
repreſented to the underſtanding
in the form of Propoſitions; but
when one of them is but a notion,
or a current difinition. For di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of theſe notions do contain
in them a Propoſition, or are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to it; As when a Circle
is defin'd to be a Figure contain'd
in a Line, all whoſe parts are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
diſtant from the middle-moſt
Point or Center, this defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
contains an affirmation of
the eſſential property of a Circle;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:30742:89"/>
and by the generality of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians
is therefore diſcriminated
from that Conick Section which
they call an Ellipſis, tho that be
alſo a Figure terminated by one
curve Line.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe you are verſed in
Mathematicks, I ſhall on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſhew you by a Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Inſtance, that if a man have
not genuine and adequate noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the things he judges of, he
may confidently, and even upon
very probable grounds, judge
things to be inconſiſtent, that in
reality, are not ſo. For if an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Cultivater of Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Diſciplines ſhould hear one
man ſay, that ſuch a Figure is an
Ellipſis, and another affirm it to
be a Circle, he would think their
aſſertions to be inconſiſtent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his mind prepoſſeſſed with
an Ellipſis's, being a Conical Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
whoſe properties muſt
therefore (he ſuppoſes) be very
differing from thoſe of a Circle;
whereas ſuch wary Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:30742:89"/>
as the Learned Doctor
<hi>Wallis</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">See his Treatiſe <hi>de Sectioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Conicis.</hi>
                     </note> will tell him, that the
vulgar notions of Conick Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not adequate to the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
producible by them: For
when a right Cone is cut quite
through by an inclining Plane,
the figure produced by the Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
agrees well with the received
notion of an Ellipſis, in which
the Diameters are of unequal
length; yet if the Plane cut the
Cone parallel to the Baſis, that
Conick Section will be a true
Circle, having all its Diameters
equal.</p>
                  <p>'Tis indeed an uncommon and
unheeded account, but ſuch an
one upon which I have obſerved
not only Logicians, but Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
themſelves to err about
judging things reconcileable or
inconſiſtent; that if a man be
not ſufficiently acquainted with
the nature of any of the two
things under conſideration (and
much more if he be ignorant of,
or miſtaken about both) he may
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:30742:90"/>
think there is a contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
things, wherein a Superior
or more piercing Intellect may
diſcern a conſiſtency; for taking
it for granted, that he knows one
thing to be a truth, if ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing be affirm'd to be ſo,
which he has not underſtanding
or skill enough to ſee how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
to it, 'tis no wonder, that
how well ſoever this may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
he ſhould as little know
how to admit, as how to reject it.
This may be partly illuſtrated,
and partly prov'd by inſtances
drawn from the Mathematicks
themſelves: For a Novice in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick,
for example, finding
That, according to his Rules, there
is not one mean proportional
number between 4 and 32, will
ſcarce be able to reconcile that
Propoſition to this other, That
there are two mean proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
between the mentioned
numbers; For he may with great
appearance of Reaſon ask, how,
if there be not ſo much as one
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:30742:90"/>
mean proportional, there can be
two? Whereas thoſe that are
acquainted with the nature of
Ranks or Series of numbers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in Geometrical Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
will eaſily diſcern that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
thoſe two recited, both
the number 8, and the number
16; are mean proportionals.</p>

                  <p>To obey you, <hi>Timotheus,</hi> I
ſhall add, that if an old School-Philoſopher,
or a Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
not acquainted with the later
Diſcoveries made by Teleſcopes,
ſhould hear one man ſay, that the
Moon is the moſt enlightned,
when ſhe appears full to us, and
another affirm that ſhe is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
at the New Moon than
at the Full, he would readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
upon the ſuppoſition
(which he makes no doubt of)
that the Moon receives all her
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30742:91"/>
light immediately from the Sun,
that the affirmation of the later
(Aſtronomer) cannot be true;
which yet he would not conclude,
if he knew (what is diſcovered
by Teleſcopes) that the Moon is
as well inlightned by the Earth,
as the Earth by the Moon; upon
which ſcore, whereas at <hi>the Full</hi>
ſhe receives but thoſe Beams that
come to her directly, from the
Sun, at <hi>the Change</hi> ſhe receives
both <hi>them</hi> in that part of her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that is obverted to him, and
thoſe <hi>other</hi> Beams of his that are
reflected from the Terreſtrial
Globe to that part of the Moon
that is neareſt to us.</p>
                  <p>And to the foregoing Inſtance,
I ſhall add one more, that ſeems
appoſite enough to <hi>Arnobius</hi>'s
Purpoſe, and 'tis, that before
<hi>Pythagoras,</hi> not only the vulgar
of the Greeks, but their Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
and Mathematicians too,
obſerving oftentimes that a bright
Star preceded the Riſing Sun, and
that frequently alſo (on other
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30742:91"/>
days) after Sun-ſet, another Star
appear'd, that was none of the fix'd
ones; they confidently concluded
from the ſo diſtant times of Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition,
that the Sun was attended
by two differing Stars, to which
accordingly they gave two differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
names: But <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who
was a far better Aſtronomer (as
may be gueſſed, among other
things, by his maintaining in
thoſe early times the motion of
the earth about the Sun) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to diſabuſe them, and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it. Now if one that had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<hi>Venus</hi> only in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
ſhould have affirm'd, that
beſides the ſix known Planets,
there was but a ſeventh (namely
the <hi>Phoſphorus)</hi> which preceded
the Riſing Sun; and another,
(that had taken notice notice of
her only in the Evenings) ſhould
aſſert, that beſides the ſame ſix
known ones, the only ſeventh
was that called <hi>Heſperus,</hi> which
ſometimes appear'd after his Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
a By-ſtander would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30742:92"/>
have concluded, that their
Aſſertions were not reconcileable,
either to one another, or to the
truth; which (in his judgment)
was, that there muſt be no leſs
than eight viſible Planets; and
yet <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who had more
skill, and more piercing wit, did,
(as was lately noted) diſcern and
teach, that theſe two <hi>Phaenomena</hi>
were produc'd by one and the
ſame Planet <hi>Venus,</hi> determined
by its peculiar motion (about
the Sun) to ſhew it ſelf near our
Horizon, ſometimes before he
aſcends it, and ſometimes after
he had left it. Such inſtances as
theſe, tho offered but as illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
may perſwade us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too forward to reject every
propoſition, that we ſee not how
to reconcile to what we take for a
truth; provided the diſtruſted
propoſition be ſuch as we would
acquieſce in, if we could recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
it to that ſuppoſed Truth.</p>

                  <p>From this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<hi>Eugenius,</hi> and that of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:30742:92"/>
                     <hi>Arnobius,</hi> which preceded it, I
think one may gather, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to you two, when two
Propoſitions are laid down,
whereof one is made evident to
us by Experience, or by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
acting within its own Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
or Compaſs; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is ſufficiently proved by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mathematically demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or duly atteſted by Divine
Revelation, we ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
either of theſe propoſitions,
as no truth, meerly becauſe we
do not yet know how to reconcile
them: but we ſhould rather think,
that the collected Propoſition, is
but a gradual, or limited truth;
or elſe we ſhould conſider, that
we knowing but ſo imperfectly as
we do the particular natures of
privileg'd Subjects, for ought we
know a ſuperior Intellect may be
able to diſcern a friendly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between what is deliver'd
about that Subject, and the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
that ſeems repugnant to
it, tho we are not quick-ſighted
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:30742:93"/>
enough to perceive this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And this, how ſtrange
ſoever you may think it, <hi>Pyrocles,</hi>
may not only be countenanc'd by
ſuch things as <hi>Eug.</hi> lately ſaid, but
both you your ſelf, and almoſt all
mankind do <hi>de facto</hi> ſeem to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
it, in the caſe of the Divine
Preſcience of mans free Actions.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eugenius.</speaker>
                  <p>What you contend
for, Gentlemen, may perhaps
be thought the more receivable,
if one ſhould argue thus: Firſt
either the Propoſitions ſaid to be
repugnant, are both really true,
or they are not; If it be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they are not, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
is at an end: for there is
none at all to conceive a true
Propoſition, ſhould contradict a
falſe one. But, ſecondly, if both
the Propoſitions be ſuppoſed to be
true, it muſt be affirm'd, either
that they are reconcileable, or
that they are not; if it be ſaid,
they are not, then <hi>Pyrocles</hi> his
objection is out of doors; for it
cannot then be reaſonable to ſay,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:30742:93"/>
that the two Propoſitions, tho in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with one another, muſt
neceſſarily be one or other of
them inconſiſtent with the truth.
But this I preſume he will by no
means aſſert, and conſequently,
muſt ſay, that the Propoſitions
are reconcileable. Upon which
anſwer I ſhall demand, how that
can be, unleſs a ſuperior Intellect,
ſuch as unqueſtionably the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
is, can diſcover an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between Propoſitions
wherein we cannot diſcern it.
For our not being able to diſcern
it, is you know profeſſedly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in the caſe we diſcourſe of.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pyrocles.</speaker>
                  <p>But, <hi>Arnobius,</hi> will
not this Doctrine make us very
liable to have falſities impoſed on
us at the pleaſure of bold and
dictating men?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Arnob.</speaker>
                  <p>Not, if it be limited
to the ſubjects wherein alone I
would have it admitted; for if
neither of the things treated of
be a privileg'd one, but both in
the juriſdiction of ordinary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:30742:94"/>
I do not only <hi>conſent,</hi> but (in
my firſt Advice) <hi>require,</hi> that
the Propoſitions fram'd about
them be eſtimated according to
the common Dictates of Reaſon.
And even in caſes where one of
the Propoſitions is about a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg'd
thing, I do not at all think
fit, that it ſhould be received in
ſpite of its being repugnant to the
gradual truth delivered in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
unleſs it can by ſome other
Argument ſufficient in its kind be
proved to be true; and in that
caſe, that, what I plead for, ought
to be admitted, is implyed by the
ſuffrage of almoſt all mankind, in
that caſe, which was juſt now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
mentioned by <hi>Timotheus:</hi>
for tho men know not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the Liberty of mans will,
with the infallible knowledge that
God has of thoſe Actions that
flow from it, yet they have una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
judged it reaſonable
to believe both Free-will and
Preſcience; the former, becauſe
they felt it in themſelves; and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:30742:94"/>
the later, partly becauſe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
of things being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
a perfection, ought not
to be denyed to God, whom they
looked upon as a Being ſupreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perfect; and partly becauſe
ſome actions and events that they
all judg'd to flow from mens free-will,
were, as the generality of
men believ'd, foretold by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Oracles. But except in
ſuch caſes as I have been naming,
I am altogether of <hi>Pyrocles</hi>'s
mind, that ſince we have ſcarce
any way of diſcovering a Falſity,
but by its being repugnant to
ſomewhat that is true; to deny,
that in caſes within the juridicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ordinary Reaſon, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy
of a Propoſition to any
manifeſt truth, ought to ſway our
Judgments, were to deprive us
of the uſefulleſt <hi>Criterion</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate
between Falſhood and
Truth.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Timoth.</speaker>
                  <p>For my part, who
believe with many Philoſophers,
as well Heathen as Chriſtian, that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:30742:95"/>
humane Souls owe their origine
to God, and with almoſt all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
(for I know what the
<hi>Stoicks</hi> held) that as he is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Being, ſo he is a moſt free
Agent, I ſee not why, as he has
given to Corporeal Beings divers
Qualities, very differing in their
degrees of Nobleneſs; ſo he
might not give to the Intelligent
Productions of his Power and
Will, various degrees of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Capacities as well as a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitedneſs
of Nature. And as it
will not follow, that becauſe we
can ſee with our eyes very ſmall
Objects, and imagine ſuch as are
yet much ſmaller, either the eye,
or the imagination can ever reach
to ſo ſmall an Object as an Atome;
ſo it will not follow that becauſe
we are able to frame Conceptions
of immaterial Beings, we muſt
therefore be able to underſtand
the nature of God, and the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of all his Monadical At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes.
A little Boy may
have a clear notion of three, four,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:30742:95"/>
five, or other ſmaller numbers,
and yet may be unable to frame
good conceptions of Triangular
and other Polygon Numbers (as
ſome call them) and much more
of the abſtruſe affections of ſurd
Numbers, and the Roots of the
higher Algebraical Powers. To
diſcern particular Truths is one
thing, and to be able to diſcover
the Intercourſe and Harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
all Truths, is another
thing, and a far more difficult
one; as a Traveller may upon the
Engliſh Shoar know that he ſees
the Ocean, and upon the Coaſt
of <hi>Affrick</hi> be made to do the like,
and at the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> alſo he may
know that he ſees the Ocean; and
yet not know how thoſe ſo diſtant
Seas communicate with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
tho that may be manifeſt
enough to a Coſmographer.</p>

                  <p>What you ſay brings
into my mind, that I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

<hi>Truth,</hi> as differingly as they do
<hi>Time.</hi> For we men, as we enjoy
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:30742:96"/>
time but by parcels, and always
leave far the greateſt part of it
unreach'd to by us; ſo we know
but ſome particular Truths, and
are always ignorant of far more
than we attain to. Whereas
God, as his eternity reaches to
all the portions of time (or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
Durations) ſo his Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
gives him at one view a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the whole extent of
Truth: (As if a man could ſee
the whole River of <hi>Nilus</hi> with
all its turnings and windings from
its hidden Springs to its entrance
into the Sea.) Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he ſees all particular Truths,
not only <hi>diſtinct,</hi> but <hi>in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme,</hi>
and ſo ſees a Connexion
between thoſe that to us ſeem'd
the moſt diſtant ones.</p>

               <p>That this Advice may be the

ſuggeſt three things,
which I deſire may be afterwards
conſidered all together.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that clear poſitive proofs,
proportionate to the nature of
things, are genuine and proper
motives to induce the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to aſſent to a propoſition as
true; ſo that 'tis not always ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the evidence and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of an Aſſent, that the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
takes notice of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
that may be drawn from
it, or the difficulties wherewith
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:30742:97"/>
it may be incumbered. This is
plain in thoſe Aſſents which of all
others, at leaſt that are meerly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
are by knowing men
thougt to be the moſt undoubted
and the beſt grounded; I mean
the Aſſents that are given to the
Truth of Geometrical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations:
And yet, <hi>Euclid,</hi> for
inſtance, in all his Elements of
Geometry, in ſome of which
ſurpriſing Paradoxes are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
(as in the ſixteenth propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the third Book, and the
117th of the tenth Book, to
name no more) contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to demonſtrate his Aſſertions
in a Mathematical Way, and
does not, that I remember, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
or take notice of any one
Objection: and the Geometrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of our days think they may
ſafely receive his Propoſitions

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30742:97"/>
of that Sect in their writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Mathematicians, and all
Aſſertors of aſſured knowledge.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing I would offer
to your conſideration, is, that
the former part of our Diſcourſe
has manifeſted, that there are
ſome things which our humane
and imperfect underſtandings ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cannot, or at leaſt do not,
perfectly comprehend: and that
nevertheleſs men have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain'd
from preſuming to dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize
and frame Notions and
Rules about ſuch things, as if they
underſtood them very well.
Whence it muſt needs come to
paſs, that if they were miſtaken
(as in things ſo abſtruſe, 'tis very
like they often were) thoſe that
judge by the Rules they laid down,
muſt conceive the Propoſitions
oppoſite to their miſtakes, to be
liable to very great, if not inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Difficulties and Objections.</p>
               <p>And this ſecond Conſideration,
in conjunction with the firſt, will
make way for the third, as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30742:98"/>
production of them, which
is, That, <hi>as</hi> we need not wonder
that privileged things, which are
wont to be ſo ſublime as to have
been out of the view of thoſe
that fram'd the Rules whereby we
judge of other things, ſhould be
thought liable to great Objections
by them who judge of all things
only by thoſe Rules; <hi>ſo</hi> we ſhould
not require or expect more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

things, than that there are for it
ſuch ſufficient poſitive Reaſons, as

quantity, he urges nothing as
abſurd, but what is undeniably
repugnant to ſome Truth he had
already demonſtrated, or to
thoſe clear and undiſputed Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,
Axioms, or <hi>Poſtalata,</hi>
which he ſuppoſes to have been
already granted by thoſe he would
convince. But tho he thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
to prove that his Readers
cannot contradict him without
contradicting themſelves; yet we
find not that he was at all ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
to clear thoſe Difficulties that
ſo quick-ſighted a man could not
but know ſome of his Theorems
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30742:99"/>
to be attended with: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
himſelf to demonſtrate the
incommenſurableneſs of the Side
and Diagonal of a Square, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
troubling himſelf to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Difficulties that attend
the endleſs Diviſibility of a Line,
which would follow from what
he demonſtrated. But, <hi>Pyrocles,</hi>
to look back to the firſt part of
your Objection, tho what you
ſay will hold in ordinary Caſes,
yet ſuch peculiar ones, as we are
ſpeaking of, deſerve a particular
Conſideration. About ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileged
things there <hi>are,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſome others there <hi>may be</hi>
contradictory Opinions (taking
that term in a ſtrict ſenſe) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
Now as both of theſe
cannot be true, ſo one of them
muſt be ſo: as, tho it be hotly
diſputed whether Quantity be
endleſly diviſible, yet certainly it
either muſt, or muſt not be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
without end: And as was
formerly obſerved which ſide ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you take, the Inconveniencies
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:30742:99"/>
will be exceeding great, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
there will lye Objections
ſcarce to be <hi>directly</hi> anſwered.
And ſince one of the two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Opinions muſt be true, it will
not always be neceſſary, that an
opinion muſt be falſe, which is
incumbred with great difficulties,
or liable to puzzling Objections.
And therefore if the poſitive
proofs on one ſide be clear and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
tho there be perplexing
Difficulties objected by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the truth ought not for
their ſake to be rejected; becauſe
ſuch difficulties proceeding uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
either from notions that men
preſume to frame about things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
their reaches, or from Rules
that were not made for ſuch
points as are in diſpute, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
are not to be judged ſo
well founded, as is that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Principle in Reaſoning,
that <hi>from Truth, nothing but truth
can be legitimately inferr'd.</hi>

                  <speaker>Eugen.</speaker>
                  <p>I confeſs I have always
thought it reaſonable in ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:30742:100"/>
to compare, as well the <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
proofs</hi> of one opinion with
thoſe of the other, as thoſe <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
that are urg'd on either
ſide; and there make my eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
upon the whole matter;
tho with a peculiar regard to that
opinion that has a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in point of poſitive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
Becauſe, as <hi>Arnobius</hi>
obſerv'd, thoſe are the proper
Inducements to the Aſſent of the
Intellect: And then the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
may well enough be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
to proceed from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe
nature of privileg'd things,
and the over-great narrowneſs of
the Rules that men are wont to
judge of all things by. For we
may have a ſufficiently clear
proof <hi>that</hi> a thing is, whilſt we
have no ſatisfactory conception of
its <hi>manner</hi> of exiſting or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
our illative knowledge, if
you will allow me ſo to ſpeak, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
clearer, and extending fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than our intuitive or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
knowledge.</p>

                  <p>But even about things
that we cannot ſufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
we may in ſome caſes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
our Reaſon, in anſwering ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
that are thought not to be
<hi>at all</hi> anſwerable, becauſe they
are not <hi>directly</hi> ſo. For we may
ſometimes ſhew, by framing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
caſe a like Argument,
which, the Adverſary muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
does not conclude well, that
neither does the Argument that
contains his Objection conclude
aright.</p>
                  <p>This I could exemplifie (tho
that may ſeem no eaſie Task) but
that I fear I ſhould want time to
propoſe Examples, whoſe being
very paradoxical would make
them need much proof; which
you who I fear are quite tired al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
would want patience to
hear. Wherefore I ſhall rather
recommend to you one Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which I take to be of no
ſmall moment and uſe, when we
contemplate things of the nature
of thoſe we have been diſcourſing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:30742:101"/>
of: and it is this, that we muſt
not expect to be able, as to privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg'd
things, and the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that may be fram'd about
them, to reſolve all Difficulties,
and anſwer all Objections; ſince
we can never directly anſwer
thoſe, which require for their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
a perfect comprehenſion of
what is infinite: as a man cannot
well anſwer the Objections that
may be made againſt the <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
the Doctrine of Eclipſes,
that of the different <hi>Phaſes</hi> of the
Moon, and of the long days and
nights of ſome months apiece,
near the Poles, (not now to name
that more abſtruſe part of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
the Theory of the Planets)
unleſs he underſtand the nature of
the Sphere, and ſome other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Coſmography.</p>
