            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN all Ages, discerning and
serious Men, who knew best
to allow and distinguish things
and Persons, have made it their
great Complaint, That the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Generation did degenerat
<pb facs="tcp:103701:4"/>
from the former; And that
the Generality of Men were
too apt and ready to pursue
bad Courses: And some think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Persons now, are easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to believe, that, the Days
we live in, the World is not
much mended. This notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
no Time hath been
known (how dissolut soever)
wherein some worthy &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Men have not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who have studied to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
Natural and Moral En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duements,
and to pursue Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
preferring that way to base
<pb facs="tcp:103701:4"/>
Interest, and selfish Ends. And
it is well known, that even at
this Time, when many &amp; great
Duties are easily superceded,
there are here and there some
Persons who worthily act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Principles of Honour,
Conscience, and Vertue, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
all Discouragements. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom Your Lordship
(even in your Solitude) moves
and acts in a very high and
conspicuous Sphere, to that
Measure of lovely Vertue and
Splendor, that Your Friends
and Wellwishers admire, and
<pb facs="tcp:103701:5"/>
your Enemies (if You have
any) can find no matter of
Censure. If there were many
such in the Nation, it would
be no hard mater to retrieve &amp;
bring in Vogue again, these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equat
Qualities and Vertues,
which often have rendered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our Countrymen (en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
therewith) famous and
illustrious both at Home and
Abroad. In the mean Time
it is to be wish'd that each
man would labour to reform
Himself and his own Ways,
conforming them to these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb facs="tcp:103701:5"/>
Rules. And that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
at length would make
and advance a laudable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
indeed. But it is
to be feared, that this would
rather prove an abortive Wish,
than that it shall have its wisht
for Effect: albeit (to have it
so with the World) it should
be a part of our dayly Prayers,
and come in continually to
Our <hi>Letany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord!</p>
            <p>Whilst You are Enjoying
Your self, and are solaced

Conscience, in Your Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
making your self an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Vertue, and a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
of Honour and Goodness
to those who observe you and
your Actions. I humbly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
<hi>Your Lordship,</hi> not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to interrupt Your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
but to afford You a litle
divertisement for some of your
vacant and Recreating Minuts:
By Offering to <hi>Your Lordships</hi>
Perusal these following <hi>Sheets,</hi>
and Begging <hi>Your Patronage</hi>
thereto: And I judge I have
little Reason to despair of your
<pb facs="tcp:103701:6"/>
Favour and Acceptance, since
<hi>Your Lordship</hi> was Pleased to
shew a more than Ordinary
Affection and Kindness to the
Author my Father. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I hope this little Tract wil
give <hi>Your Lordship</hi> some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
and for others I am bold
to say, I hope well: for many
Persons of great <hi>Honour</hi> and
<hi>Judgement,</hi> have (since my
Father the <hi>Authour</hi>'s Death)
been sollicitous to get written
<hi>Copies</hi> from the <hi>Original,</hi> which
was indeed perfected by My
<hi>Father</hi> in his Own Time,
<pb facs="tcp:103701:7"/>
without any Design to make
it publick. But my <hi>Father</hi>'s
M. S. with all his <hi>Books</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
committed to a certain
Person he, without my Privity,
gave out <hi>Copies</hi> to <hi>Knowing</hi> &amp;
<hi>Inquisitive Persons,</hi> as of late
I came to understand, and now
these <hi>Copies</hi> abounding abroad,
and most (if not all) being
defective or incorrect, (to
Prevent my <hi>Father</hi>'s being
abused) I now send a True
<hi>Copy</hi> abroad unto the <hi>World,</hi>
and let it See the Light: And
go it must under <hi>your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
<pb facs="tcp:103701:7"/>

the Design will succeed
the better, and the <hi>Book</hi> will
be the more acceptable to
these who Love and Desire
the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of such <hi>curious
Maters:</hi> Nor shal I diffide its
<hi>Fate,</hi> being first wellcome to
Your Lordship, to whom I
hereby address the same, most
humbly and heartily, and not
in course, ingyring upon a

            <head>TO THE
READER</head>
            <p>IT is needless to show the many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
may be had from Travelling,
since all are convinced of it; and the
VVisest of Men in all <hi>Ages</hi> have thought
this the best way to improve themselves:
thus, as <hi>Homer,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Master, showes
us, <hi>Vlysses</hi> followed this Method.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Qui Domitor <hi>Trojae</hi> multorum providus Vrbes,</l>
               <l>Et Mores hominum inspexit; latumque per aeqour</l>
               <l>Dum sibi dumsocijs reditum parat, aspera multa</l>
               <l>Pertulit.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And such a one <hi>Homer</hi> drew his Son
<hi>Telemachus,</hi> whose adventures have of
late been Painted by an excellent Pen, with
all the advantages, requisit for the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a good Man and Excellent Prince.

Indeed, the World is a Theater, in which we
may see not only the different productions
of Nature, but also all the Arts &amp; Mysteries of
Government; and all the wayes of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Nature by Art; and every Climate
affords new <hi>Scenes</hi> for improving <hi>Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
Natural</hi> and <hi>Civil Historie, Medicine,
Commerce,</hi> and all the <hi>Mechanick</hi> Arts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Medicine</hi> certainly is much improved
this way, for thus <hi>Galen</hi> writes, he sailed
to <hi>Lemnos, Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Palestina</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> on
purpose to see foreign <hi>Plants,</hi> and rare
Ores and Mineralls.</p>
            <p>The following Letters give you some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
to this purpose, of these Countries in
<hi>Europe</hi> viz. <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi>
which for, Politeness &amp; Civility, for <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur</hi>
and Magnificence, &amp; for Arts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
and the Publick incouragements
of them, farr excelleth all the rest. The
Author of them, Sir <hi>Andrew Balfour,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Medicine,</hi> spent some fifteen Years
in his Travels, &amp; Residence in these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
He was a Man of an Excellent VVit,
and of a Ripe Judgement, and of a most
taking behaviour; He had improven him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

to the best advantage, with all the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taught in the most famous <hi>Vniversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of these Countries, had acquired their
Languages, and Conversed with the
most famous Man then alive. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Curiosity He had to learn every
thing that might enrich his mind with
knowledge, was in his youngest Years fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
with the Example and Instruction
of his eldest Brother, 30 Years elder than
himself, the Famous Sir <hi>James Balfour, Lyon
King at Arms,</hi> who had a Curious <hi>Bibli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otheck,</hi>
had Collected in his Cabinet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Curious Products of Nature and pieces
of Art, and took delight to cherish this ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Curiositie of his youngest Brother: With
this Disposition &amp; proficiencie in the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
then taught in his Native Country,
He begun his Travels, which, in so long a
Tract of time he employed that way, came
to Qualify him exceedingly for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

deservedly gained the Reputation of the best

settlement here He took the Resolution of
erecting a publick Garden for <hi>Plants,</hi> and
a Cabinet of Curiosities: He had begun
the last in his own Lodging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
how He might establish the other,
when He became acquainted with that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie

designed so much for the good &amp; Honour of

               <hi>As to these Letters of Sir</hi> Andrew Balfour
<hi>now published, I shall leave the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them to the Learned, who may
peruse them; yet this I must say,</hi> There are
many particularities in them relating to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
History, and the way of Safe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:103701:12"/>
Travelling, not to be met with in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Accounts of these Countries, and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
they are of Excelleut use for these
who study Natural History, and Physick,
where they may be informed where Plants, &amp;
other Subjects of them, are to be found in their
Native Places, and where they may see the
<hi>Cabinets</hi> of the Curious.</p>
            <p>Others will be hereby instructed in the
<hi>Manners, Orders,</hi> and <hi>Customes,</hi> of these
People; They will find likeways many Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Reflections, which are Pleasant to
read, and may give rise to higher Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
They will see what Varieties fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries of a different Soil &amp; Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of Air, do afford; severall of
which may be brought here, and may be
made usefull to this Country.</p>
            <p>What Sir <hi>Andrew</hi> delivereth here, is
what he observed, experienced, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himself, and none need question the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
in any Circumstance; He was
known to be a most candid and Ingenious
Gentleman, He gives his apprehension and
Judgment of the Reasons &amp; causes: which
was allways much valued by all which
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:103701:12"/>
kneDw him; being a Gentleman of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
VVit, and Judgment: He did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that they should be printed, and in
his lifetime he would never hear of it; and
such was his Modesty, he never shewed them
to any but his most intimate Friends, and
could not be perswaded to give a Copie
of them, but since his Death copies of them
have past from hand to hand, and all who
have seen them are very well pleased; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
at the earnest intreaty of his Friends,
his Son hath published them in the Stile
he found them writen; his design was to
render all easie &amp; intelligible to his Friend
he wrote them to; if the <hi>Phrase</hi> &amp; Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
seem in some places less ornate, &amp; not
so congruous as may be expected now, it
is to be remembred, they were writen thirty
Years ago, when he had been Fifteen
Years absent from his own Country, &amp; had
accustomed himself to speak foreign more
Language, than to Studie the Elegancie
of his own Native Tongue; &amp; this I think
should excuse him at the hands of the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
He Studied more things than words,
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:103701:13"/>
&amp; yet, as all know, He expressed himself most
handsomely upon all Occasions.</p>
            <p>It was fitt this should be Represented:
The rest is left to the impartiall Reader, who
will meet with so many Remarkable &amp; use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
things in the Letters, that there is no
doubt of his kind Acceptance of them. If
these meet with the encouragement hoped
for, 'tis like, the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Lovingstone</hi> his
observations in his Travels, in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
too, and a Voyage of another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman
of ours, through <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi>
writen in a pure Stile of Latine, may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
for the satisfaction of such as are
Curious of Travells,</p>

or seven miles out of the road to see <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge;</hi>
which I doe truly think worth
the while, in regard it is one of the two
famous Universities of <hi>England,</hi> where
if it please you, You may take Notice of
the number, structure, and order of the
Colledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but particularly of the
Libraries and Gardens; as also of the
Book-sellers Shops in the town-where
possibly you may meet with something
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103701:14"/>
that you shal not meet with any where els
in order to this it would be convenient
to have some letter of recomendation or
adress to some member of the University
whom you might be sure (upon this
account) to find very ready to serve you;
I am sorry that I cannot help you in this
particular, having never been in this
place my self; But I think if you address
your self to Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> (who wrote and
published the Catalogue of plants grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about <hi>Cambridge</hi>) upon the score
of seeing that place, and himself as a
Person so deserving especially in the
knowledge of plants, of which you are
also a verie great lover; I make no doubt
you shall find him as ready to oblidge
you there, as you use to be to any <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoso</hi>
here.</p>
            <p>At <hi>London</hi> I shall advise you to lodg in
or about <hi>Convent</hi>-garden, as a place most
commodious for your business. I thought
it necessar to accompany you only with
two leters of recommendation, the one to
Dr. <hi>Morisone,</hi> whom I think the best
<hi>Botanist</hi> in the world, and a most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103701:14"/>
and obliging friend; By his means
you will easily see all that is considerable
of Plants about <hi>London,</hi> and purchase
what seeds that place affoords. The other
is to Mr. <hi>Scott</hi> a Book-seller, dwelling in
<hi>Little-Britain</hi> by whose means you may
be furnished with any Book that may be
be had in <hi>London;</hi> and I think as reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
as else-where: notwithstanding you
will 'doe well to see other shops, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
Mr. <hi>Bees</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pulleyns,</hi>
both of them in <hi>Little-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the other beauties of the Court
and City I need not say much, being
you will easily be informed of them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place: I shall only hint at some of
the most considerable,</p>
            <p>And first, at <hi>Whythall</hi> be pleased to
take Notice of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anquetting-house;
you will find it of a stately fabrick, such
as the late King designed to have all the
Palace of; it was built by King <hi>James,</hi>
the historie of whose diefication you wil
find Painted on the roofe within, by the
noble artist <hi>Rubens,</hi> only you will find
the Figures too big, occasioned by the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103701:15"/>
Painters misinformation concerning the
Hight of the Room, which he was made
beleeve to be greater. The King's privy
Rooms are worth the seeing, because of
their excellent Ornaments of Hangings
and Pictures.</p>
            <p>2 The Palace of <hi>Westminster,</hi> in which
I find the great Hall only considerable
for its great breadth and artificiall roof.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Henry</hi> VII. Chappel and the tombs
in and near it.</p>
            <p>4. You will do well upon some Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
(if any happen during your abode
there) to see the King at Divine service,
in regard of the extraordinary state used
on such dayes, as also of the excellent
Musick; I would advise you likwise to see
the King dine on some such day.</p>
            <p>5. The Tower, in which be curious to
see the Mint Crown, Scepter, &amp; Treasury,
the Magazine of ancient arms <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the
new Arsenall built and furnished by the
present King, The wild Beasts.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Gresham</hi>-Colledge, where the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
is now kept; inquire there for
Dr. <hi>Pope</hi> that by his means you may see
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103701:15"/>
a verie fine collection of naturall rarities
kept in that Colledge. He will likewise
carry you to see the Royall society, if you
so desire.</p>
            <p>7. The King and Dukes play-houses.</p>
            <p>8. The Innes of Court, especially the
<hi>Temple, Lincolns</hi> Inn, and <hi>Gray</hi>'s Inn.</p>
            <p>9. The New Exchange, and not farr
from it, <hi>Sommerset</hi>-House.</p>
            <p>10. St. <hi>James</hi>'s-House and Park.</p>
            <p>11. If yow please to take a pair of Oares
the length of <hi>Greenwich,</hi> you will see the
Kings new House that is a building there,
and if you please to walk up to the Hill
above it, You will have a prospect up
and down the river, which the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of goodly ships, the pleasantness of
of the Countrey about, and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyman
<hi>John Barcly</hi>'s curious Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Commendation of it, render most

            <p>12. For the rest, I shall only put you
in mind, that about <hi>London</hi> there are such
places, as <hi>Wimbletone</hi> belonging now to

Rebellion possest by <hi>Lambert;</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellished
the Garden thereof with great

Park belonging to the Kings Majesty. I
shall likewise put You in mind that
<hi>Oxfoord</hi> is but fifty miles from <hi>London,</hi>
and that it is one of the most famous
Universities in the world, both for the
number and structure of the Colledges
and Halls, and for the multitude of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

The chief Colledges are <hi>Christs Church,

Colledg was founded by a <hi>Scots</hi> King's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of that name, The Schools is a stately

Librarie for Number of Books
beyond any that ever I saw: there is besides

when You resolve to goe thither Dr.
<hi>Moreson</hi> wil recommend You to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as will be carefull to shew you every
thing.</p>
            <p>From <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> the best way
is to goe by <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Calais,</hi> that you
may returne by <hi>Die<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you make account to returne by <hi>Flanders</hi>
in which case I advise you rather to goe
by <hi>Rye</hi> and <hi>Deip,</hi> because <hi>Rouen</hi> (which
otherwise will not fall to be in your
way) is a more considerable place and
better worth the seeing, than any thing
upon the way of <hi>Calais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For your accommodation from <hi>London</hi>
to <hi>Rye,</hi> you may either take post, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103701:18"/>
I shall only name some of them, for fear
of troubling you too much, and leave the
rest to your own observation.</p>
            <p>1. See <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> palace &amp; gardens;
<hi>Monsieur Marchant</hi> will be a fit Person,
because of his aquaintance there, to wait
upon you.</p>
            <p>2. The Kings garden, where be sure to
make a strong friendship with the Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and You may command what You
will of Plants or Seeds.</p>
            <p>3. The Kings Library, and especialy
there, the Books of Minature done by
<hi>Monsieur Robert,</hi> which I look upon as
the best curiosity of that kind in the
World.</p>
            <p>4. The Garden of <hi>Tuilliaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Monsieur <hi>Marchant</hi>'s own Garden;

<hi>Plants,</hi> not to be found elsewhere in
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. The <hi>Jesuites</hi> College, where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

it might be worth your while, in regard
you will hardly find the like Occasion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <p>It will be worth your while to see some
places about <hi>Paris,</hi> as particularlie,</p>

to the King; from thence four Leagues
further a little off the River, to</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Versaile,</hi> A House begun by the late
King, but finished by the present; It is
a most delicate fine place, but (as I think)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103701:19"/>
there will be a Necessity of procureing

it is a prettie little House built by Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Richlieu;</hi> The G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

come to</p>
            <p>5 St. <hi>Clou,</hi> A House belonging to the
present Duke of <hi>Orleans;</hi> From thence
on your way to <hi>Paris</hi> (which is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
3 Leagues) You pass thro' a wood
called <hi>Bois de</hi> Bologne; in which there
stands a House called <hi>Madrid,</hi> built by
<hi>Francis</hi> I. after His Return from <hi>Spain</hi>
where He had been Prisoner, to save his
promise of going back to <hi>Spain</hi> once a year.
In my time there was a Manufactorie for
weaving of Silk Stockings kept there.</p>
            <p>Having performed this Journey in one
or at the most two days, you may with
your conveniencie visit</p>
            <p>6 St. <hi>Denys,</hi> in the <hi>Abbey</hi> whereof there
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103701:20"/>
is a famous Treasurie kept. Remember
to take Nottice of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great's
Crown, in which there is a <hi>Rubie</hi> of the
Bigness of a Pidgeons Egg; A large <hi>Cup</hi> of
oriental <hi>Aggat,</hi> which they count much of;
One of the Nails that fixed our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s
Bodie to the Cross, sent to <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great by <hi>Constantine</hi> V. Emperour of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople;</hi>
One of the <hi>Potts,</hi> wherein
our Saviour changed the water into wine
at the Marriage of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee;</hi> The
Pucel of <hi>Orleans</hi> Sword, wherewith she
overcame the <hi>English;</hi> The Lantern that
was carried before <hi>Judas,</hi> when He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
our Saviour; and a thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things of great Value. See the <hi>Tombs</hi>
likewise: You will do well to go earlie
in the Morning that you may have time
to speak to the Religious Men, and take
their Hour of conveniencie for seing of
the Treasure; which being done, you will
have time enough to return to <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7 I know nothing better worth your
seing about <hi>Paris,</hi> than the <hi>Aqueduct</hi> at
<hi>Arcqueul</hi> about 2 leagues from the town,
it was built by <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Medices</hi> in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103701:20"/>
time of her Regencie, for bringing the
the water to her palace of <hi>Luxemborg.</hi>
Besides the Aqueduct, you will also see
there a verie fine Grotto with fine walks
and manie prettie Jetts of water; one after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
suffice for this Journey.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> in which there are
so manie things considerable: not only
in the House, furniture, and painting; but
also in the Gardens, Walks, <hi>Fish</hi>-ponds,
and water-works, that it will be less
trouble for you to observe them by seing,
than by a long narration; I shall only tell
you for the better improvement of your
Journey thither that you will doe well
first to go to</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Esson</hi> a House seven leagues from
<hi>Paris</hi> belonging to a private Gentleman,
where you will see very fine water works
and many other prettie conceats; from
thence you have 3 leagues</p>
            <p>10. To <hi>Durance,</hi> a privat House like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
but to which there belongs very
noble gardens and walkes, with delicat
Ponds and Jetts of water. It will not be
a miss to stay here all the night, being
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103701:21"/>
You will have 4 Leagues to <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi>
a great part of which is through the
Forrest, and therefore better to be gone
in the morning, when the day is before
Your hand, than in the evening when
night may surprize You.</p>
            <p>11. You may arrive so early in the
morning at <hi>Fountainbleau</hi> that You may
have time to see all before dinner, and
thereafter returne to <hi>Veau,</hi> a most stately
house and gardens correspondent to it,
built by Monsr. <hi>Fougues<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

disgrace it's fallen to the King: From
hence you may returne a short League
off your way to lodge at <hi>Melun;</hi> The
next morning You will have an easie
Journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> and time enough if you
please to see <hi>Vinceu,</hi> within two short
Leagues of <hi>Paris.</hi> It is a House belonging
to the King in the middle of a verie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Park: after you have seen the House
emember to see the Wild Beasts that are
kept not far from it. If You resolve upon
making any greater toure into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,
I shall advise You to provide a Book
called <hi>le voyage de France,</hi> of the latest

edition, which will give you a hint of
the most considerable things that are to
be seen in those Places you go to. I shall

I be happie to hear of Your safe arivall
at <hi>Paris,</hi> and then I would be content
to trouble you with an other sheet: in the

            <p>IT seems You are not yet resolved whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to spend the Winter in <hi>Paris</hi> or
in the Country, my opinion is that out
of <hi>Paris,</hi> there is litle thing either to be
seen or learned in all <hi>France;</hi> But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it is pertinent for a Traveler to see
some thing of the countrie as well as the
chief Town: I shall therefore advise you
to see those Places chieflie that I judge
most suitable to your inclinations, and
particularie in order to <hi>Botany,</hi> that is
<hi>Languedock</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> for altho' there
be manie other places of <hi>France</hi> verie
worthie the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eing, as particularlie the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103701:23"/>
               <hi>Loyre</hi> from <hi>Orleance</hi> downward to
<hi>Nantes,</hi> which for the fertilitie aud beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the countrey, the frequencie of good
Towns and gentle disposition and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
of the inhabitants, is called the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of <hi>France:</hi> yet you will find that Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
produces but a few things different
from <hi>Normandy</hi> or the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>France:</hi>
But if you should incline to see it, my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
is that you should not spend much
time in doing of it, and therefore if you
think fit you may make use of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Advice at your Discretion.</p>
            <p>I suppose You leave <hi>Paris</hi> about the
beginning of <hi>June</hi> (for I would not have
you loose the Month of <hi>May</hi> in the Kings
Garden, in regard most things will be
then, or a little before, in their Prime,
which now that the Garden of <hi>Blois</hi> is
no more in Condition, is undoubtedly
the best you are like to meet with) and
therefore, 1. you may go to <hi>Orleans</hi> by
the Messenger: it is but two Days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie;
Lodge <hi>Chez Monsr.</hi> Ogilbie, <hi>sur
l'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

A Day or two will serve you to see all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103701:23"/>
that is considerable in the place; It will be
worth your while to see a place some two
Leagues from the City, called the <hi>Source,</hi>
where in the midst of a fair green Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
you will see a Spring of Water so
plentifull, that it is navigable from its
Head, and powrs out a River called <hi>Loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rette.
2ly.</hi> From <hi>Orleans</hi> to <hi>Blois,</hi> they
count 15. Leagues, yet it is but a short
Days Journie: besides if you please, you
have the Commoditie of the River to go
by Boat; Be pleased to take Notice of a
place by the Way, some 4. Leagues from
<hi>Blois,</hi> called St. <hi>Die,</hi> where the best <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>
in that Countrie grows, and is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly
to be found. <hi>Blois</hi> of itself is no very
considerable Town, yet it is famous for
makeing of <hi>Watches,</hi> for the Civilitie of
the People, for the Sweetness of the Air,
and Puritie of the <hi>French</hi> Language. You
must stay there some Days till you have
seen the following Particulars; <hi>viz.</hi> in
one day you may get to <hi>Chambort,</hi> a house
belonging to the King, some three leagues
off, on the south side of the River, and
South-East from the Town; It is said to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103701:24"/>
have been built by King <hi>Francis</hi> I. and
is a very statelie House, though of
a far different Order of <hi>Architecture</hi>
than what is now used. From thence
you may go to <hi>Herbeau,</hi> 3. Leagues to
the southward of that, a privat house be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to a Gentleman that beares the
title thereof. It is a very pleasant seat hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very fine Gardens with an Orangery,
Fish-Ponds, Woods, Maille and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
belonging to it; from thence you
may go to <hi>Bean-Regard</hi> another privat
house, where amongst other prettie things
you will see a fine Gallerie well orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with the pictures of such persons
as have been illustrious for some age; from
thence you returne to <hi>Blois</hi> at night, &amp;
as you go and come you will have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to see that part of the forrest of
<hi>Blois</hi> that lyes to the South of the River
and town; as also a litle village called
St. <hi>Gervais,</hi> famous over all that countrey
for excellent Cream; being returned to
<hi>Blois,</hi> you may take notice of the Castle,
as also of the Garden which is now <hi>Seges
ubi Troja;</hi> the keeper of it is Dr. <hi>Brumer</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:103701:24"/>
my very good acquantance, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
one of the Herbarists to the late Duke
of <hi>Orleans,</hi> as were also Monsr. <hi>Morison</hi>
and Monsr. <hi>Marchand;</hi> upon any of whose
accounts or yet upon mine, I am confident
You will be very welcom to him; I believe
You may as yet see some Plants in the
Garden, from thence walk towards the
<hi>Capucins</hi> or the mount, and you will have
a delicat prospect both up &amp; down the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
from thence walk towards the <hi>Alleys</hi>
which you will possibly find to be the
finest in length and breadth, and being
well planted on either side, that you have
hitherto seen; You may chuse whither
You will see <hi>Vendosme</hi> or not, it being
a place not verie considerable except for
the Holy Tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, which is preserved in
the Cathedrall Church with much ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
and which people go to see out
of devotion; the toun is famous for make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Gloves which are accounted the
best of that countrey; upon the returne
from that place You may see the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of <hi>Orchaise,</hi> of old <hi>Horrcum Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
(for some where not far from thence
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103701:25"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> legion was said to be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered)
<hi>I</hi> take the fountain to be nothing
else but a rivulet or litle burn falling over
the Top of a soft Rock into which by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of time it hath cut in a considerable
way thro' the whole deepth of it, and
being grown together upon the Top, it
seems now to spring out of the Rock; over
against that, cross a meadow, you must
take notice of a Cave or Hole digged in
the side of a litle hill in which there is an
Aromatick kind of Earth, not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
as is believed to the <hi>Terra Sigillatae</hi>
of <hi>Lemnos;</hi> the common people call the
place <hi>La cave de la terre Sigille.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I must put you in mind that
in this same meadow I have very often
seen very large green <hi>Lizards,</hi> which
because it is a beautifull creature and not
found with us, I must intreat you where
ever you find of them to cause preserve
1 or 2, to add to my <hi>Tradescants.</hi> I know
not which will be the best way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
them, whither by skinning them,
or drying the flesh, but I suppose the best
way will be (especially if the skin be any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103701:25"/>
thing strong) to cause skin them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the head feet and taile, and then
stop the Skin with Flax. There are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
severall other Birds in <hi>France</hi> which
are not common with us, which I must
earnestly intreat you to do the same by,
as for example the <hi>Pie verte</hi> or Green
Pyet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> from <hi>Blois</hi> you go to <hi>Amboise</hi> in
half a day by water; the boat will give you
libertie to see the Castle; in the Chapell
whereof will be shown You hanging a
pair of Hornes, they say, of a Hart, the
largest and biggest (if they be true) that
ever was seen In the court of the Castle
there is likewise to be seen a Rib, and one
of the Back-Bones of the same <hi>Animal,</hi>
You are brought out of the Castle by a
Toure whose descent is so large and so
easie, being without Steps, that a Coach
may drive from the Bottome to the Top
thereof. From thence You go <hi>Tours</hi> all
Night, where</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> In my time the best Lodging was
<hi>A la</hi> St. <hi>Marthe;</hi> the place is commended
for the Sweetness of it's Situation, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103701:26"/>
delicacie of it's Fields and Gardens, and
many other Particulars. It will be worth
Your while to see the Manufactories of
Silk, especially the way of working Tisse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and Brocarts, which You will see
of diverse Colours and some of Gold and
Silver. The invention and way of making
Tabbies, which I forbear to descrive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
You will abundantly discover it by
sight. You must be at the pains to fetch
a walk out of town a litle way to see the
<hi>Maille,</hi> which in any time was the longest
and in the best order of any in <hi>France;</hi> and
at the same time, you may go the length of
the <hi>Minims Convent</hi> because the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituter
of their Order St. <hi>Francois de paul,</hi>
lyes Buried in the Church in a marble
<hi>Coffine,</hi> as will be shown You, which
People visit with great Veneration: if
you will be at the pains to pass the River
there is an ascent to the <hi>Capucins</hi> whence
you may discover the whole City, and
a great part of the Countrey about, which
for it's Beauty and Fertility is called the
<hi>Gardin</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> and certainly deserves
that Name better than any Place upon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103701:26"/>
the whole River of <hi>Loir.</hi> There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
not far from <hi>Tours,</hi> a Place which
they call <hi>la cave Gutiere,</hi> From the Top
of which there drops a Liquor which
Congeals into a substance almost as hard
as a stone not much unlike that you sent
me from <hi>Hamiltoun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> You may go from <hi>Tours</hi> to <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure</hi>
a town famous for it's Protestant
University, of which we have two very
honest countrey-men that are members,
Monsr. <hi>Doule</hi> and Monsr. <hi>Gray.</hi> You
may take the pains to see <hi>Nostre damo
d' Ardeliers</hi> a Place of great devotion; if
you please you may see the Treasurie
which is Rich, and as you go and come,
you may observe the great Trade of that
Suburbs, to be making of Beads or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets;
I beseech you forget not to bring us
some that are made of young Oranges:
If you please you may see the Castle. At
<hi>Saumure</hi> you must hire Horses to make
a litle tour of three days, and first you
must go to <hi>Doue,</hi> where there is to be
seen an ancient <hi>Amphitheatre</hi> cut out
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103701:27"/>
of a Rock, as it is said, by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
There are likewise verie many great quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of free stone and the Workmen often
find in cleaving of the stones, some litle
peices of a finer and harder substance by
farr than the rest, which from the shape
they have, They comonly call <hi>Langues
de Serpents.</hi> The little Boys for a small
matter will sell you abundance of them
which I pray forget not to buy, If not
for your own, at least for your friends
curiositie. From thence you must go to
<hi>Thouars,</hi> a most delicate House belonging
to the Duke of <hi>Tremoville,</hi> it is situat
upon a Rock, and the greatest part of
the office houses cut out of the Solid
Rock. The next Morning you go to
<hi>Waren,</hi> a verie prettie House but not much
worth the pains of seeing were it not in
Your way to <hi>Richlieu,</hi> where you are
to spend the rest of that day, That you
may have the more time to view the
Toun and House, which I think so well
worthie your seeing, That for it's sake
a Journey from <hi>Paris</hi> that length were
not ill bestowed. I shall say no more of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103701:27"/>
of it, that I may not deprive you of the
<hi>Gusto</hi> of being surprized with the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of it. Amongst other things be
pleased to take notice of two Marble sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
that stand over the Gate, at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
end of the inner Court, as also of a
peece of painting in the Chapell, that
was left by way of Legacie to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi>
by Monsieur <hi>de Mont Morency,</hi>
when he was Beheaded at <hi>Thoulouse.</hi>
There are two Books the one in 40. the
other in 80. containing the Figure of
the House, and parts thereof; they are
sold, as I take it, by the Porter, of whom
I intreat you to buy them for me.</p>
            <p>The third day you may Dine at <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun</hi>
where in my time there was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Woman, that had been formerly
Possessed. At the time of her cure which
they say was Miraculous there was found
Written on her hand <hi>JESVS MARIA
JOSEPH,</hi> which still remained inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.
If she be yet alive you May see
it. From thence you returne by <hi>Shinon,</hi>
where they say the famous <hi>Francis Rablais</hi>
had his first breeding in an old convent,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103701:28"/>
From thence you pass throw Most deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Meadows called the <hi>Valey</hi> of <hi>Shinon,</hi>
and in your way to <hi>Saumure</hi> some three
Leagues from the Town you may see a
Monasterie of Religious Women where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Lady <hi>Abbas</hi> in my time was the
Queen-Mothers Sister of Great <hi>Brittain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> You may hire horses to <hi>La Fleche,</hi>
where the only thing considerable is the
<hi>Jesuits</hi> Colledge. It is a most noble
Structure, and by far the best they have
in France. Take Particular notice of
their Church where the heart of <hi>Henry</hi>
the <hi>4th</hi> who gave them that House is
kept: The Bibliotheck: The Theatre-hall:
their Office houses, particularly the
Kitchen; the Bake-house, where one Man
and a Dog makes bread for all the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
every day: the Myln where the
Water that moves the Wheele doeth
likewise move a Pump that furnisheth
water to the whole Colledge. The best
lodging was <hi>Au quatre Vents.</hi> From hence
you must again take horse to <hi>Angiers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly</hi> It is a Town famous for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Laws, and hath likewise a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103701:28"/>
Faculty of Physick: See the great Church
called St. <hi>Maurice,</hi> and therein one of
those pots in which our <hi>Saviour</hi> convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the water into Wine at the Marriage
of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galile.</hi> See the <hi>Maill,</hi> and
at the end of it next the town the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims
Convent.</hi> You will find in their
Garden severall Kinds of <hi>Ilex;</hi> You will
likewise find in severall places of the
Countrey not far from the Town severall
sorts of <hi>Pinastres,</hi> as also a kind of Fruit
tree called <hi>Cormes,</hi> not mnch unlike our
Raun-tree, the Fruit whereof hangs in
Clusters like our <hi>Roddens:</hi> but of an
other colour, and bigness every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as big as a Plumb. A League or two
from the town towards the East, are the
<hi>Pierries</hi> or quarries, of blew Skleat
called <hi>Ardoise</hi> which serve the greatest
part of <hi>France:</hi> See the Castle, and in it
that famous crib where <hi>Rene</hi> King of
<hi>Sicilie</hi> and Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> imprisoned
his Queen out of Jealousie all the days
of her life. About half a League distant
from the town, doun the River stands
a Convent called <hi>Bamet,</hi> worthie of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103701:29"/>
there is likewise on the other side
of the River an old Abbacie called <hi>Les
Bons Hommes,</hi> near to which there is a
litle lake, which I suppose to have been
the place where the blew Sklate was dug
of old; you will find about the sides of
it, aboundance of <hi>Tribulus aquaticus,</hi> the
Fruit thereof is ripe in the Moneth of
<hi>August;</hi> they use to Boyll them and Sell
them as they do <hi>Chasnuts,</hi> from which
they differ not much in Tast or Quality,
but verie much in Figure, and therefore
be pleased to provide a Quantitie of them
for your self and Friends. You may
likewise dry the Plant, if you think fit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>8ly</hi> You May go If you please from
<hi>Angiers</hi> to <hi>Nantes</hi> either by Water or
by Land, in one day; It is a prettie town
and stands upon the <hi>Loir</hi> and the Sea
flowing up above the town gives Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
to Ships of a considerable Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to come up to the Town. It is here
that the greatest part of the Wines that
grow upon this River or near to it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Brandie made thereof,
which are carried out of <hi>France,</hi> are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103701:29"/>
You must return again to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi>
and from thence to <hi>Paris</hi> with the
Messenger. It is a Journey of five days,
and all that I know considerable in it, is
first, That when You come near to <hi>Mans</hi>
(which you will leave at a Leagues Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
upon the Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

find in aboundance a Kind of <hi>Cistus,</hi> not
mentioned by any that I know of, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Petrus Bellonius.</hi> Forget not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a Branch or two, which You may
Fold in your <hi>Portefoile,</hi> which for such
rancounters you'l do well to be stil Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
of, and You may cause make them
of what Bigness You please, and have
them furnished with <hi>Gray Paper</hi> within.
I did allways use to Carry one of a 40
Form, with good Tyers to it in a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi>
Bag (such as they use in <hi>France</hi>) ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Tore of my Saddle, so that if
it was My Fortune to Meet with any
thing by the Way worth the Gathering,
I could easily take it and preserve it with
out being in Danger to Loss my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.
<hi>2ly.</hi> The Town of <hi>Chartres;</hi> in
the great Church whereof (which is a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103701:30"/>
most stately Fabrick) K. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was
Sacred. It is a Place of great Devotion,
and there is kept in it amongst other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts,
one of our <hi>Ladys</hi> smocks. You wil meet
with several litle shops near to the <hi>church,</hi>
where the chief Trade is <hi>Beads,</hi> and as
they call them <hi>des Chemises de Chartres,</hi>
which Devout People Buy and append
to their Chaplets, and then get them to
Touch the Relicts, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom.</p>
            <p>You may furnish this Journey, and
have Time enough at <hi>Paris</hi> to Prepare
your Self for the Journey to <hi>Provence</hi>
and <hi>Languedock</hi> before the <hi>Dog-Days</hi> be
ended, at which Time it will be fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
your Journey. And <hi>1st.</hi> You may take
the Messenger to <hi>Lions;</hi> I think You must
Pay about twentie Crowns; for the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is of nine Days; There are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things considerable to be seen by the
way; only take Notice <hi>1st</hi> at <hi>Nevers</hi> of
the Glass-Works, and <hi>Faiance,</hi> or white
Lame-works, of which the best in <hi>France</hi>
are here. <hi>2ly.</hi> At <hi>Mouline</hi> (where you
will fall to Dine) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erred, You may see
a very stately Monument of Marble. The
Town is famous for the Manufactorie
of Knives and Scissers. You will not miss
to be troubled with a company of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who wait upon the arrivall of
Strangers, to show them quantities of
this kind o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ware in hopes to Sell some.
3ly. Take notice of the Well of <hi>Pouge,</hi>
the water is Alummous and boills up in
great quantity, of a whiteish colour, as
if there were meal mixed with it. 4ly. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane;</hi>
which is said to be the largest Bourg
in <hi>France:</hi> they call that Bourg which is
not incompassed with wall or ditch. The
<hi>Loir</hi> begins to be Portable here and cary
Boats, But it's source is many Leagues
higher. 5ly. <hi>Mont tarare;</hi> It is a very
great Hill, and here You will find a
change of the climate together with the
change of Plants, which I leave to Your
observation, and think it will be worth
Your while at night to make a note of
all those Plants that You meet with. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
arrived at <hi>Lions</hi> You must stay some
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103701:31"/>
time to see the place, which altho' in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of its situation amongst Hils and
Rivers, it be somewhat unwholsome, the
Air, being either too moist, or in Summer

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o hot; yet I look upon it as one of the
best and most important Towns in
<hi>France,</hi> both for the magnificknesse of the
Buildings, the great tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ique it hath with
almost all Places of the World, to which
the situation of it betwixt two Rivers,
the <hi>Soane</hi> and the <hi>Rhosne</hi> is no small
advantage; for by the <hi>Soane</hi> it hath
Communion not only with <hi>Burgundie,</hi>
but also with the <hi>Ocean;</hi> for <hi>Chalon</hi> which
stands upon the <hi>Soane,</hi> is but a days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from <hi>Auxere,</hi> which stands upon the

By the <hi>Rhosne,</hi> it hath communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Mediterranean Sea, and
consequently, with all the <hi>Levant.</hi> The
<hi>Soane</hi> in Latine <hi>Araris</hi> is a Pleasant and
very soft flowing River; the <hi>Rhosne</hi> is
<hi>Fluviorum Rapidissimus.</hi> The people
are very ingenious and dextrous in
the matter of traffick and business, they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103701:31"/>
are likeways courteous &amp; human, your
most convenient Lodging, will be <hi>Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trois-Rois:</hi>
It is a good House and nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
to the place where the Messenger of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
arrives. As also to the Post-House.
Remember to see the <hi>Maisone-de-Villo</hi>
which without exception is the most state<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>France:</hi> Take particular notice of
its Fabrick, Statues, Paintings, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Inscriptions, of which some are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
upon Brass, its Fountain's, courts,
&amp;c. 2. See the great Church of St. <hi>John,</hi>
and in it a most Stately and Curious
Clock, upon the upper part of which,
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mediately before the hour strike, the
blessed <hi>Virgine</hi> appears with the <hi>Angel</hi>
before her, as she uses to be represented
at the <hi>Annunciation,</hi> and within a little, a
Cock upon the top claps his Wings
and Crows, and then the hour strikes.
There is likeways considerable in it, a
Hand that points the minut of the hour
upon the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al, and altho' the parts of an
Oval line, be not equally distant from
the center yet the Hand which is
fixed in the center, doth alwayes reach
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103701:32"/>
that line and never exceed it, in the whole
compase it maketh. <hi>3ly.</hi> There is an Old
Monument about the midle of that <hi>Faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh,</hi>
by which the Messenger of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
enters they call it <hi>Tombeau-de-deux
Amants.</hi> It seems to be of <hi>Roman</hi> anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.
4ly, See the Bishops House &amp;
and Gardens, the great Place before it,
the Bridge over the <hi>Rhosne:</hi> And in
short consider the Avenues and Compass
of the Town.</p>
            <p>5ly. Forget not to take with you your
Catalogue of Books, for there are many
Booksellers in this Place, that have great
Magazins of Books, and have great traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
with all <hi>Germany, Swizerland</hi> and
<hi>Italy,</hi> and it is very like, you may come
by Books here that you missed of at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi>
For so it happened to my self.</p>
            <p>I must not omit in this place to tell
you that it will be expedient, to draw
your Money from <hi>Paris,</hi> to <hi>Lions,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Bill of Ex-change, or Letter of
credit, upon some honest, substantiall
Merchant, to whom yon must be sure to
yet good Recommendation: By his means
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103701:32"/>
you may return your Money, to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place as you shall have occasion,
and likeways be furnished with new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations
as you desire; &amp; this way
you may make your Money march from
place to place, without fear or danger;
and if you light upon honest Men the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
will cost you nothimg, unless it
be from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Lions;</hi> because of the
disrance and that will not be above half
a one <hi>per-Cent:</hi> Your Merchant at <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
will be a convenient Steple for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
your Letters, or any thing else,
that you please to send from any other
place, and to send it forward to <hi>Paris,</hi>
to be keept for you. By them you shall
give advice to receive it from the Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
or otherways to the Merchant, that
returnes your Money to <hi>Lions:</hi> But of
these things I have said enough, for I
doubt not that you are sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of them already.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Lions,</hi> you take Boat to <hi>Avigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
which is about fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tie Leagues: if the
River be not very low, which seldom
happeneth, you would go near to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103701:33"/>
it, in two days and a half, or three
at most.</p>
            <p>You have to take notice of, by the way
<hi>1st. Vienne,</hi> a little but ancient Town, five
Leagues from <hi>Lions.</hi> See the forges where
they make Sword-blades, the Haminers
are moved by a Wheell which the Water
turns, so that the Stroakes are both fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and equall. The Town hangs u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the side of a Hill toward the River.
2ly. some nine Leagues from <hi>Vienne,</hi>
there is an old Castle called <hi>Le Maisone
de Pillate,</hi> the place is no otherways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
than for having been the retreat
of <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> driven here, by, God
knows, what accident. 3ly. <hi>Valence,</hi> a
Pretie Town only considerable for its U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity.
4ly. <hi>Le Pont-Sanct-Esprite</hi>
seventeen Leagues lower than <hi>Valence,</hi>
the Town is not very considerable, but
only for the Bridge, from whence it takes
its name, and which at that place stands
upon the <hi>Rhosne;</hi> that which renders the
Bridge so considerable, is the breadth of
the River, and Impetuosity of the current;
for besides other small Rivers, both the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103701:33"/>
               <hi>Soane</hi> and the <hi>Isere,</hi> a little before You
come at <hi>Valence,</hi> and several others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that, loss themselves therein.</p>
            <p>When you come at <hi>Avignion,</hi> You
may lodge at <hi>Louxenbourg.</hi> The Town
and Country belongs to the <hi>Pope,</hi> whose
Legate resides in Quality of Governour.
It will be fitting to stay here some Days,
that You may the better take Notice of
the following Particulars. 1. The Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and Religious Houses. <hi>2ly.</hi> The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat's
Palace. <hi>3ly.</hi> The Situation, and
<hi>Avenues</hi> of the Town, together with the
Walls thereof, which are high and state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and it will be worth Your while to
go about them in regard of the Occasion
You will have to Herbarize, for here
you will find many Plants that did not
appear in any other part of your Journey.
<hi>4ly.</hi> The <hi>Jurie</hi> or <hi>Cantone</hi> of the Town
where the <hi>Jewes</hi> dwell, I advise You by
all means if You can stay of a <hi>Saturday</hi>
to see their <hi>Synagogue</hi> and manner of
Worship, and if you be Curious and
make Enquiry, You may possibly see a
<hi>Circumcision. 5ly.</hi> You may hire Horse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to <hi>Orange,</hi> which is but half a days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
up the River. The Town and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality
belongs to the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi>
It is an ancient, tho' little Town; It
was considerable in My time for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
which was very Strong, both by
Art, and by its natural Situation, which
was so high, that from thence one might
have discovered seven or eight Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
about, at least some part o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

extant some Monuments of antiquitie, <hi>viz</hi>
a Triumphal <hi>Arch</hi> a lttle without the
Town, and some ruins of a Theatre
within the Town, both of which shows
something of the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatness,
in Respect of Modern Times; The

the best way of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

seen these thing and Dyned, You return
to Your Lodging at <hi>Avignion</hi> the same
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103701:34"/>
day. The next day you take Horses for
<hi>Aix,</hi> which is about two days Journey
or two days and a half a most. If You
depart from <hi>Avignion</hi> early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
You will have time enough to see
<hi>Vauclus,</hi> which is three Leagues from
<hi>Avignion</hi> and then to go Dine at <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illion.</hi>
I look upon <hi>Vaucluse</hi> as one of the
most considrable things I have ever seen:
it is a fountain at the foot of a great
Rock very Large and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f immense deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which poures out so much Water
as to Move four or five Milnes about
half a Mile below. It is observed that
the Water Diminishes and increases ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the season of the Year. In rainy
Weather it abounds most, and Yet when
you consider the position of it, how
much it is elevated above the plain, and
what vast hills and Rocks are about it,
It is not conceaveable with what other
Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it should have any communion.
The River that comes from it tumbles
over so many stones and Craigs; that it
makes a noise like the <hi>Catarracks,</hi> and
having neer three quarters of a Mile to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103701:35"/>
fall, it becomes exceeding swift before it
arrive the Plain, and there divides it
self in two, and incloses a litle Meadow in
Form of an Isle, and then joyns again. The
Water is so Clear, finding nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Rocks to Defile it, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
its Swiftness, yet it hinders
not the grass to grow in it's bed. The Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is likewise recomended for excellent
Trouts and Crawfish and it is agreeable
to Reason they should be good that live
in so pure streams; When You come
the length of the Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

without which the way is not easie. As
You go up you will observe upon the
other side, in two other places, the Ruins
of two old Castles, the one standing
about a Musket shot higher than the
other, in the uppermost whereof did
sometimes live that Noble Philosopher,
and Poet <hi>Franciscus P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Monument that hath outlasted
her familie, in which her Memorie is like
to live as long as Wit and Learning
continues in reputation. You may also in
this place take notice of the Paper-Milns
and consider that so usefull art of make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Paper, and labour to informe your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
well of all the particulars that when
GOD shall be pleased to return you, you
may make it Practicable in your own
Countrey. I am sure we want not Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
rags in abundance which might be
preserved for this use, and not thrown
into the Dunghill's, were people put
once in the right way.</p>
            <p>From hence you go to Dine at <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illion;</hi>
in the rest of the Journey to <hi>Aix,</hi>
there is nothing considerable, only you
have a River to pass by boat called <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
Aix,</hi> is one of the most delicate
Towns in <hi>France,</hi> It's the Capitall City
of <hi>Provence</hi> and the seat of a Parliament.
The streets are large, especialy one great
street, the Buildings fair and stately,
The City well watered and the Air
very healthfull and Sweet.</p>
            <p>

From hence you go to <hi>Marseilles</hi> in
half a day, you may lodge at <hi>a l' Aigle</hi> or
<hi>al' teste noire.</hi> You must resolve to stay
two or three days at least, for the more

as provision for that day, the other may
cary a Basket with you emptie, being
thus accourted, you may Herbarize upon
the way to the Castle, and put a litle
quantitie of every Herb you find into
your emptie basket, the better to judge
of it at your return; as also of what
Seeds you find you may put up some
for your own and friends use, you may
returne by the way of the Sea, and so
Herbarize all thereabouts. It is a most
excellent place for Varietie of Plants, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the rest take particular notice of
the <hi>Tarto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sea side you may likewise take notice,
what Stones or shells, Mosses or any other
naturall curiosities you can observe, &amp;
if any be worth the preserving bring
them along with you. <hi>5ly</hi> I would
have you bestow half a day in a boat
upon the Sea without the Harbour, but
so as it be very calm, for then you will
easily se the botom of the Water, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
where it is not very deep, because
the Water hath no Motion of ebbing
or flowing, and so you may possibly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103701:37"/>
light upon curiosities worth the gathe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring,
for the taking up of which, you
must provide Creepers, which the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
know how to use. <hi>6ly.</hi> Take
notice of the situation Fabrick, and
Avenues of the Town, especially some
Shops upon the Shoare, where you will
find many curiosities, especially from the
<hi>Levant.</hi> I must recommend my self to
you here, but especially for a good hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Tree of red Corall; as also one of
those that are black, but are not true Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and what else you think fit; I
shall hold you good accompt, for all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses;
you may send them with your
own things to <hi>Lions,</hi> with Order to
your Friend there to send them to <hi>Paris,</hi>
to be received by your Factor and keept
for you. <hi>7ly.</hi> The Place is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for perfumes, sweet-Powders, <hi>Franchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane</hi>-Gloves,
&amp;c. But there is great cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both in the Prices and Quantities of
the things; therefore take heed to your
self, if you buy any of them: I did
formerly forget to tell you that <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
is famous for the same things, but
especially for Gloves; whereof the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactorie
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103701:38"/>
is very good; and Essences.
But now I return to <hi>Marsails</hi> where <hi>8ly.</hi>
Take occasion frequently to view the
Fish-market, where you will not miss
to see great variety of strange Fishes
well worth the observing, and for that
end I wish you to acquaint your self with
the <hi>Icones Piscium,</hi> together with their
description, by <hi>Petrus Bellonius,</hi> it
is in a Long 80. and not very thick, &amp;
therefore you may take it along with you
from <hi>Pari.</hi> If any of these Fishes which
are not common with us can be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or keept any way; as I doubt not
but you will find inventions to do it,
you will exceedingly oblidge us to
bring them along with you, or send
them as said is: Be pleased to enquire
<hi>ches les Espiciers</hi> for a kind of Seed
which they call <hi>Graine d' Avignion,</hi>
they sell it in great quantity to Dyers
who use it for Dying Yellow; it is the
<hi>Lycium Gallicum Dalechampij;</hi> It is a
Shrub not common here, nor yet in the
North of <hi>France,</hi> and therefore worth
the taking notice of; I would have
you bring us some quantity of the graine
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103701:38"/>
for a Show about an ounce or so: But
because I suspect, that which the Gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
sell is dryed; therefore I think it
will be more profitable to search at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignion,</hi>
where it grows plentifully, for
some that is better conditioned for your
own use. In your herborization at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saills</hi>

Place, in time of Plague, as also to divert

<hi>Frayole,</hi> which is some three dayes Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

east ward toward <hi>Neice;</hi> In this
Journey, besides the things of Pleasure
you will see in this higher <hi>Provence,</hi> you
will have the best herborization, almost
all the way, that you can possibly desire;
you must part from <hi>Marsaills</hi> early in
the morning, that you may have the
more time to herbarize by the way, &amp;
that you may arrive in good time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be Night at <hi>Saincte Beaume,</hi> a Place
of much Devotion, and the greatest So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
in the World. In the midle of
a vast and terrible Rock, there is a great
cave where St. <hi>Maria Magdalen</hi> did pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for many years before her Death:
it's now upon that consideration turned
into a Chapell, with some few Rooms
clacht up against the face of a Rock,
like a Bird cage upon the side of a Wall,
where some Religious Men (as I think
<hi>Jacobins</hi>) keep the Place, and serve the
cure in the Chapel every Day receiving
confessions, &amp; giving the Sacraments to
such as require them. There is a little
kind of a chainge-house close to it, that
provides Meat for Men and Horses, at
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103701:39"/>
their own expences, but you mnst lye
within the convent; in the morning you
must take a Guide to the Top of the
Craig, where there is an other Chapel
of Devotion just in that Place
where the Angels did use once a
Day, to carrie the <hi>Saincts,</hi> from the
cave to administer consolation to her.
As you go and come you may herbarize,
for the whole side of the Hill before you
come at the Rock, is a Wood: Upon
your Arrival at the convent it is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to give some little thing out of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which I think is bestowed in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the place. You will ordinarly
find without the Chapel Door, some few
little Merchants that sell Reads, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other things, Silk-Cords of the
just length and greatnes of the <hi>Saint,</hi>
all which People use to buy and carrie
in to the Chapel, there to touch the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the <hi>Sainct;</hi> which l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es just in
that Place, and in that Posture, that
she used to do pennance in; you will
likeways see within the Chapel a very
Large Well of good Water, which they
say did first spring there by miracle, for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103701:40"/>
use of the <hi>Sainct.</hi> From hence you take
Horses to <hi>Sainct Maximine,</hi> a little Town,
in the great Church whereof, amongst
other reliques, the Body of St. <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
Uncle to St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> &amp;
sometimes Bishop of <hi>Marsaills,</hi> is preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
If you please you may take this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of seeing it, and there dyne,
for it is a little out of your way to <hi>Brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole,</hi>
where you must lye the second
Night, and the Day following you Dine
at a Village called <hi>Luques,</hi> and then go
to lye ae <hi>Frayote,</hi> or <hi>Freust,</hi> which you
please to call it. Its a Town of <hi>Roman</hi>
antiquity, of which there are yet some
rests to be seen, as aqueducts, &amp;c. The
Town is not otherways considerable at
all; you will do well here, besides your
own Guide that goes along with you
to take another Man from the Town,
with an emptie Basket, to wait upon
you to the Hil, called <hi>Astral,</hi> about a
League from the Town, where you will
have one of the most pleasant Heboriza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the World: Amongst a great
variety of Shrubs, Plants, and Trees,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103701:40"/>
you will find a great Number of <hi>Arbutus,</hi>
loaden with Fruit, of a most Beautifull
aspect; yet, somewhat insipid to the
taste, It may safely be eaten, but doth
not much allure the taste. Several kind
of Spinous Shrubs, amongst which <hi>Acaeia
Secunda Dioscorides</hi> sive <hi>Aspalathus,</hi>
when you come upon the Top of the
Hil, upon the way to <hi>Neice,</hi> there is
an <hi>Inn,</hi> where you may make a Shift
for Dinner, and a little beyond it, upon
the North-side of the Hil, you will meet
with aboundance of Cork-Trees, <hi>Ilex,
Abics, Picca,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I must give you notice here, that in
this place, you are not, above two or
three hours ryding, from <hi>Cane,</hi> a Village,

but you must part by times in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that you may have the conveniencie
to see <hi>Pont de Gard,</hi> which is one of
the finest Peeces of Antiquity extant
in the World. It is a Part of that A
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103701:41"/>
Aqueduct, which the <hi>Romans</hi> built for
conveying a part of the water of the <hi>Rhosne</hi>
from the <hi>Pont</hi> St. <hi>Esprite</hi> to <hi>Nismes,</hi> &amp;
because at the Place where the Bridge
stands, the River <hi>Gard</hi> runs low be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two Hills, there was a necessity of
raising the Aqueduct so high as to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
the Tops of these Hils, therefore it
hath three Ranges of <hi>Arches,</hi> the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
are the biggest but fewest in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
they are likeways the broadest, for
besides that they support the second row
of <hi>Arches,</hi> they do likeways serve on
the other side for a Passage and Bridge for
foot, Horse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and coaches to the high-way:
The second supports the third, which are
not so high, but many more in number,
on the Top of all is the Aqueduct five
or six foot broad, and four or five foot
deep, it is compassed with great Flag
Stones on all sides, exceedingly well
cemented together, insomuch that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it be yet very intire, except it be
some few of the covering Stones that

            <p>At <hi>Nismes</hi> you must lodge <hi>Aux A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes;</hi>
you will see there a brave Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre
built by the <hi>Romans,</hi> in
greater integritie yet than any that ever
I saw in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Stones of which it
is built, as well as the <hi>Pont de Gard,</hi>
are of incredible Bigness, and altho' the
things themselves be somewhat ruined;
yet they show greater Statelynesse and
Magnificence than any modern Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
There are some other remaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of antiquitie about the Town which
will be showen you. From <hi>Nismes</hi>
you take Horses for <hi>Mompellier,</hi> which
is a Days Journey from it; You dine at
<hi>Lunel</hi> which is about mid-way, and
because I have nothing to say of this
Place, I shall intreat you to bring me
three or four ounces of the Seeds of
<hi>palliurus,</hi> for amongst other uses they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103701:43"/>
serve for, they are the best Bullets for
Cauters that can be, but it is for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
use I would have them.</p>
            <p>You will do well to stay some days
at <hi>Montpellier:</hi> You may lodge at the
<hi>white Horse,</hi> or otherways as you find
your accommodation. It is a delicat
sweet Town, the Streets well built, but
narrow, because of the heats which are
as great here as in any place of <hi>France,</hi>
nor is it strange it should be so, being
it is near upon the same latitude with
<hi>Rome.</hi> You will do well to see the
Physick Schools, there is some Curiosities
to be seen in them. <hi>2ly.</hi> The Physick-Garden;
in which you will find many
excellent Plants; by making a little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the Gardener, you
may command what Seeds he has.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> You will do well to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with some of the Students
or young Doctors of Physick, by whose
means and in whose company you may
see all the places about <hi>Monpelier</hi> that
are fit for Herbarizing, as particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Magelon,</hi> a little Island of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103701:43"/>
Sea, lying within Sight of
<hi>Monpellier.</hi> But by all means of the
World, you must be sure to make a
Journey ten or twelve Leagues from
<hi>Mompellier,</hi> to a Place amongst the
Hils, which for the great varity of Plants,
that is found in and about it, is called
<hi>Hortus Dei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may likeways find some variety
of Shells and productions of the Sea, to
<hi>Mompellier</hi> and the Shoar, or Coast,
which is near the Town.</p>
            <p>I must not omit to tell you, that if
you please to make a Collection of dry
Plants, this is a very fit Place for it,
both because of the heat which helps to
dry them, both soon and well; &amp; also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Garden &amp; Fields, that abound
with Plants, that are not common, &amp;
likeways, because of the good occasion
you have to send them in a Box, close
packt up, (as you have seen mine) to
<hi>Lions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In like manner, if you will make a
Collection of Seeds, the best will be
to keep them in their Seed-Vessels, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103701:44"/>
write upon every parcell, that you may
dispose of them afterwards according to
your pleasure.</p>
            <p>This I wish you to do in every Place,
that afterwards when it shall please God
to bring you safely to bring them home,
Tho' you should not be able to raise them
in this climat, yet you might have enough
to know them by. Do not forget the
Booksellers here, who may possibly
have some of the Books you look
for. I must desire one Favour of you
in this Place, that You would
be pleased to enquire after the <hi>Psilothrum</hi>
or Depilatory Ointment, which they
use in <hi>Rome</hi> in the Baths, and which
I was so Unluckie as not to mind when
I was upon the place. It you can find
the Receipt, cause make some small quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of it to try if it be Right, which
you will easily know by this, that being
rubbed upon any hairy place, within a
little space, when you come to wipe
it off, it takes the hair without burning
or scalding the Skin; but if it either burn
or discolour the Skin, it is not right. The
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103701:44"/>
place is afterward to be washed with
a little warm Water. I must likeways
intreat you to be at ths pains to cause
dry me a Viper or two, it will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to dry their Skins with the heads
at them, stopped with Flax, or Cotton:
but in no way must you medle with
them your self, because there is Danger,
but imploy one of those fellows that
brings them to the Apothecaries, who
for a small matter will do it. Some day
or other, you may be at the paines to see
<hi>Frontiniague</hi> famous for that generous
Moschat Wine, called by the name of the
place, you may Collation there, and
Harbarize as you go and come.</p>
            <p>When you are satisfied here, it will be fit
to set forward to <hi>Thoulouse.</hi> You will see by
the way, <hi>1st. Pesenas</hi> a Pretie Town, where
it may fall you to Dyne, <hi>Au tapis vert,</hi>
hard by the Town, there is a very fine
House, with excellent Gardens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Condie,</hi> it is
worthy of your seeing. <hi>2ly. Beziers;
3ly. Narbone,</hi> which is a very strong
and well fortified Town, near upon
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103701:45"/>
the borders of <hi>Catalonia.</hi> It hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Sea, by means of a little
River, that runs through the Town.
Be pleased to see the great Church,
and in it a Peece of excellent Painting,
representing the History of our Saviour's
raising <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Dead. Take
likeways notice of the Organes, the
great Pipes whereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stand by the
Pillar sides, at a great distance from the
Organ roome, and have the Wind
conveyed to them by a secret conduct;
which tho' it be no difficult thing, yet
it is not common.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Narbonne,</hi> you have six or seven
Leagues to <hi>Carcassone;</hi> They are two,
<hi>Ville</hi> and <hi>City;</hi> the City stands upon a
hight about half a Leagues distance
from the Town: It is twice encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
with Walls and Ditches, and is
very strong, as being upon the <hi>Frontiers</hi>
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Catalonia.</hi> The Town stands below
in the Plaine, and is much larger, better

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uilt, and better inhabited, &amp; Walled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with a more modern kind of Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
The Town is commended for
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103701:45"/>
Cloath-works, &amp; making of Combs: The
Tradesmen use to bring them to the Innes
as soon as they understand any Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be arrived; but your best will
be to go to their Houses, and see all, &amp;
try severals, for so you may best please
your self, and make the best bargain too.
There is of all Prices, insomuch that I
have seen ten Pistoles refused for one
single Comb, of Box-Wood. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it was of a vast bigness and most
curiously carved. You may have very
good ones for three, foure, or five Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres
a peece, as also some for 30, 40, &amp;
50 Solds. To be short, there is of all
kindes and prices, and I shall earnestly
intreat you, to bestow foure or five
Crowns, upon some of the midle sort,
that is next to the best, and some again
of the next degree to them for me, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the carving) to add to my
<hi>Tradescants.</hi> They must be packt up in
a little wooden Box, which the Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
know very well how to do.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Carcassone</hi> to <hi>Thoulouse,</hi> you
have twelve Leagues, viz. Foure to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103701:46"/>
               <hi>Vilpeinte,</hi> two to <hi>Castelna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> d' Arri,</hi> two
to <hi>Vignonnet</hi> and four to <hi>Thoulouse.</hi> The
Second Town (in the opinion of some)
in <hi>France,</hi> how justly, I leave to your
self, when you shall see it. The Town
indeed is very big, and well built, all
of Brick; But not very populous, I
think for the want of Trade, in regard
it lyes farr from the Sea. Amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, take notice of the following
particulars <hi>1st.</hi> The Town House, in the
Court whereof they Show you the
place where the Scaffold was erected,
that <hi>Monsr: de Momorancy</hi> was behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon, and some of his Blood yet
Sticking upon the Wall. <hi>2ly.</hi> The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
House, into which (if it be sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)
you must neither carry Sword,
nor Spurs, unless you make account
to pay a Forfaulter. <hi>3ly.</hi> The Bridge
over the River <hi>Garonne,</hi> which is very
stately, built of Brick, somewhat after
the Model of the new Bridge of <hi>Paris,</hi>
having a Foot walk raised on every side,
so that these that pass on foot, are not
troubled with Coaches, Cairts, &amp;c.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103701:46"/>
that pass in the midle. <hi>4ly.</hi> In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
(as I take it) of the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi>
there is a Peece of ground under a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
belonging to the Church, wherein
all Dead Bodies, that lye eight and
fourtie hours, are so dryed, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the consumption of any substantiall
part, that they become incorruptible
for ever thereafter. They will show
you in a Vault, hard by the Chapell,
some hundred of Bodies, standing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Walls intire and dryed, as I
have said, amongst the rest they show one
bodie of a Woman, called <hi>la Belle
Paule,</hi> Mistrels as it is said to some
King, whose name I do not remember:
But it is some hundreds of Years since
she died, and yet me thinks there is a
beautifull Proportion observable in her
Face. The rest of the curiosities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in Churches, religious-houses, &amp;c.
which I leave to your self.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Thoulouse</hi> to <hi>Montauban</hi> you
about halfe a Dayes Journey, it is
famous for the Protestant University;
It stands somewhat high and declines
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103701:47"/>
a little toward the Bridge, that stands
over the <hi>Tarne,</hi> which not far below
the Town, casts it self into the <hi>Garonne.</hi>
It hath many fine Fountains; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
one, which they call the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>one.</hi>
It hath good trafique, because of
the situation betwixt <hi>Thoulouse</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moge</hi>
and <hi>Paris,</hi> as also because of the
Commoditie of the River, to <hi>Bourdeaux:</hi>
the Town and Bridge are all built of
Brick. It was formerly very strong,
but because of its Rebellion is now Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled
of all Fortification.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Moutauban</hi> to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> you
may go by Water in a very short Time,
because the River is rapid; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
about is very fertile and Pleasant.
You will see by the Way, <hi>Agen,</hi> an
ancient City, where <hi>Iulius Scaliger</hi>
was Born: within 4 or 5 Leagues of
<hi>Bourdeaux</hi> stands <hi>Cadiliac,</hi> a most deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<hi>Castle,</hi> belonging some time to
the <hi>Duke d' Espernon;</hi> You must not
faill to see them.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> I did lodge <hi>au Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peau
rouge;</hi> but I have been told since,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103701:47"/>
that there are more commodious <hi>Inns</hi> in
Town, which You may easily be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
to. You will meet with severall
of our Countreymen in this Place;
But particularly, Sir <hi>David Inglish,</hi>
and <hi>Harie Iossy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> are of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
And therefore, I must desire
you to see them, &amp; permit this, to present
them my service. I must likeways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you, to be at the pains, to enquire
for a Doctor of Physick, of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
that lives here, whose name I
have forgotten; but you will know
him by this, that he hath written in
French Something against Doctor
<hi>Willes de Febribus:</hi> which I remember
Sir <hi>David Inglish,</hi> did once send me
to <hi>Paris.</hi> And therefore, he may Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
know the Man: The Reason I
desire You to speak with him, is, That
you may learn from himself, what he
hath Published, upon this or any other
Subject; and whatsoever they be, I
must intreat You earnestly, to buy them
for me; for I have a very great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
for the Mans Parts, tho' I know
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103701:48"/>
not his Person; and I had the evil
Luck to lend that Book, which Sir
<hi>David Inglish</hi> sent me, to a Doctor at
<hi>Paris,</hi> that did never render it me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
Remember to see in the Town,
<hi>1st. Piliers tutilarrs,</hi> which are the Ruins
of an Ancient <hi>Roman Temple. 2ly.</hi>
The Ruins of an Amphitheatre, without
the Town, of <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquity like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.
<hi>3ly.</hi> The <hi>Cheasteau Trompette,</hi>
in which there is a Garison keept by the
King. It was pulled down by the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
in the Time of their last Rebellion;
but since re-built much better and
stronger. <hi>4ly.</hi> The <hi>Port,</hi> which if you
happen to see in the Time of Vintage,
will be well furnished with Ships from
all Places, and it may be from <hi>Scotland.
5ly.</hi> That peece of Ground without
the Town, which they call <hi>Grave;</hi>
which brings forth the best Wine about
<hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and which for the most part
is sold within the Town, at as great a
Rate as ordinary <hi>French</hi> Wine gives
with us: And therefore being there is
no great quantity of it, and that it
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103701:48"/>
would not turn the Merchants to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
to send it here, you may easily
guesse how much <hi>Graves</hi> Wine We
Drink in <hi>Scotland,</hi> altho' Our People
are pleased to Flatter themselves, that
all their Clarets are such; The rest I
leave to others, to inform you of. I
must only tell you, You will meet with
as good Fruits here as in any place of
<hi>France, Des Treffices</hi> in Latine <hi>Tuberae
Terrae,</hi> they are found under the
Ground by the Hogs, who use to smell
them before they come at them, and by
the noise and gests they make, give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to their keeper, who presently puts
them by, and Digs the <hi>Trefice</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
They are in great esteeme, &amp; being
Boyled and pared, use to be eaten by
themselves with Pepper and Oyle, or
else cut down with other things <hi>en Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goust.</hi>
There are likeways here a kind of
small Birds but exceeding fatt, which
they call <hi>Ortolans,</hi> which are much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
for great Delicacies.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> you go to <hi>Rochelle.</hi>
In the way you pass by these Places; first
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103701:49"/>
               <hi>Blay, Ville et City,</hi> The City stands on
a Hight and Commands the River. It
was at this Place that of old the <hi>English</hi>
Ships were Obliged to liver their Canon,
which were permitted the <hi>Scots</hi> (as a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge)
to keep a Board; as they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to <hi>Bourdeaux. 2ly. Xaintes</hi> or <hi>Saintes,</hi>
the Capital Town of <hi>Xaintonge;</hi> It stands
upon the River <hi>Charante;</hi> here are some
Rests of <hi>Roman</hi> antiquity, as of an
Amphitheatre, &amp;c. But especially of an
Arch, upon the Bridge over the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante,</hi>
on which you will read this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.
<hi>Caesari nep: D. Iulij Pontifici
A.</hi> There is also an inscription, on the
reverse which I remember not. You
will see likeways here a Steeple, the
Stairs whereof that lead to the Top are
on the outside. <hi>3ly. Brouage;</hi> about
half a Days Journey from <hi>Saintes,</hi> a
little, but one of the most regularly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
Towns in all <hi>France,</hi> in which
there is a continuall Garison keept, as
a Guard for the Salt, of which vast quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities

every Year in this manner. They let

the Town, are little less than four

are shut, and none whatsoever can

You must be at the pains to see the Isle
of <hi>Re,</hi> about a League from the Town,
but not above a quarter of a League from
the Land. As you go from the <hi>Rochel,</hi> to
the place where you are to take Boat to
cross over, they will show you the Ruins
of that Digue, which <hi>Cardinal Richlieu</hi>
caused make by sinking of Barks, loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with Stones, to hinder all relief
for the Town by Sea, and it was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable,
that the very day after the Town
surrendered, the Digue was broke down
by Storm, which if it had done but
three days sooner, it may be justly que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
whether the Town had ever been
taken, especially seeing the <hi>English</hi> Fleet
was ryding before the Isle of <hi>Re.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Isle of <hi>Re,</hi> there is a <hi>Citadale,</hi>
near to which you will be put a Shore
upon the Island, but it is not usual to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Strangers to enter into it. At the
east end of the Island, there is a little
Town called St, <hi>Martines,</hi> in which
there are many <hi>Dutch</hi> Families, because
of the great trafique the Dutch hath with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103701:51"/>
this place, for Salt and white-Wines.
The Island is generally of a Sandie Soil,
and only made fertile by the Sea-<hi>Ware</hi>
which they throw upon it, and which
in my Opinion is the cause, that all the
Wines both of the Island and about the
<hi>Rochel</hi> tast brackish, especially when
they begin to be old. You will find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other Plants upon the Island a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
of <hi>Pancratium,</hi> except you
come in the latter Season of the Year,
when probably it may not be found.
You may returne at Night to the <hi>Rochelle,</hi>
from whence you have a Messenger to
<hi>Paris,</hi> upon the way to which there is
nothing that I need to trouble you with,
except <hi>Poictiers,</hi> that I have not seen my
self, and therefore can say nothing of;
From <hi>Poicteirs</hi> your way is to <hi>Amboise</hi>
midway betwixt <hi>Tours</hi> and <hi>Blois</hi> of
which before.</p>
            <p>I must advertise you here, that if you

from whence to <hi>Lions,</hi> and so to

you like best. For your better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in the Country, it will be fit
to carry a Map, or <hi>Carte</hi> of <hi>France</hi> along
with you, to look upon the situation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
place as you pass, for doing of which
a litle time will suffice once a day. Let it
be illuminat for the more easie discerning
the different counties and their boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
You will do well likewise to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
a Book with you in 80. called <hi>Le
Voyage de France,</hi> which will inform
you of many particulars, that either
were not at all seen and observed by me,
or else have escaped my Memory; and
indeed it is no great wonder if they
have, having been so lazie as not to
make any <hi>Memoire</hi> of them whilst they
were yet recent in my mind. And this
is one Reason of the tumultuarinesse and
disorder of this Letter, but I am well
pleased to think, that by the amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

I shall not have occasion to be

Advice for Travelling into
ITALY.</head>
            <head>Written to a Friend</head>
            <p>IT is much better to go into <hi>Italy</hi> in
the latter end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> than in
the <hi>Spring;</hi> Because the Change
of the Air is not so much from one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
to another in that Season, as in
the other; for the Mildness of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in <hi>Italy</hi> (especialy upon the <hi>South</hi> side
of the <hi>Appennine</hi>) doth not so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
from the Temperatness of <hi>Autumn</hi>
in <hi>France,</hi> as the Heat of <hi>Summer</hi> in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>
exceeds the Mildness of the <hi>Spring</hi> in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103701:54"/>
               <hi>France.</hi> It is certain, that if a Man
intend to stay but a half a Year, it is better
to begin the Journey in <hi>Autumn,</hi> and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
it in the <hi>Spring,</hi> than to begin in
the <hi>Spring,</hi> and finish it in <hi>Autumn,</hi>
and so be obnoxious to the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Heats of Summer. If one intend
to stay one or more Years, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
best to begin the Journey in
<hi>Autumn,</hi> because the Winter, being
much more clement than usually it falls
out with us, will be easily supported, &amp;
all the Heat that happens in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Summer, in regard it comes by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
will not so readily affect the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that hath been already inured to
the Air of the climate, for some Time
before.</p>
            <p>The most convenient way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Toure of <hi>Italy,</hi> (in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
is to go through <hi>Provence</hi> to <hi>Cane,</hi>
a small inconsiderable Town upon the
<hi>Frontiers</hi> of <hi>Provence,</hi> and there to
hire a Felluck to <hi>Genoua,</hi> and, if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get one at <hi>Cane,</hi> to go to <hi>Nize,</hi>
which is but six or seven Leagues fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103701:54"/>
where you will be sure to find one;
a Felluck is ordinarily of four Oares, and
hath this advantage that you go in it
<hi>Ter' a Terre,</hi> that is so near the land,
that in the case of any danger by Storm
or otherwise, you may easily run on
Shoar and escape it, and besides, land
as often as there is any Town or other
thing worthy the seeing, and likewayes
ly a Shoar every Night, at some good
Town or other. A Felluck will serve
to carrie half a dozen of persons with ease,
besides the Rowers: The Price is not
fixt but more or less as the Fellucks hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be more or fewer in number.
Ours cost us about 11 or 12 Crowns, in
regard there were but few at <hi>Cane,</hi> but
you may chance to get one for 8, or 9.
especially if ye be few in number and
not much Baggage; You may provide
every morning to take along with you,
Wine and what Victuals you please, the
rather because sometimes it will happen
that you will have no conveniency of
any Town about Mid-day, and therefore
must Dine aboard Your Fellucke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:103701:55"/>
The first thing You will meet with,
worthy the taking notice of, is <hi>Nize,</hi>
a City belonging to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
it lyes near to the Sea syde, at the very
foot of the <hi>Alps,</hi> and hath a very strong
Cittadale belonging thereto: some two
miles from thence stands <hi>Villa Franca,</hi>
one of the best Ports in <hi>Italy,</hi> it belongs
likewise to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and is
guarded with two Castles, one whereof
stands on the top of a Rock, upon which
growes in great aboundance the <hi>Ficus
Indica.</hi> Some three miles farther upon
the Coast stands the Town and Palace
of <hi>Monaco,</hi> or <hi>Morgues,</hi> It is a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie
by it self, and hath very litle
land belonging to it: The place is strong
standing upon a Rock, which is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible,
save at the side where the Palace
stands, and where it joynes with the
land, all the rest being compassed with
the Sea. In the Palace they use to show
1. The Princes Wairdrob, in which
there is good store of Silver plate, and
other Rich furniture, 2. Severall rooms
as Halls, Galleries, Chambers <hi>&amp;c.</hi> well
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103701:55"/>
furnished with Hangings, Cabinets, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. A little Garden upon
the top of the Rock, behind the Palace,
made up of earth brought thither on
purpose. At the foot of the Hill near
the Town there are store of <hi>Carobe</hi>
Trees, or <hi>Siliqua Dulcis, Bauhini</hi> in <hi>Pinace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must not omit to tell You that you
must be sure at your first leaving of <hi>France</hi>
in the last Town that You happen to be
in, whither it be <hi>Cane</hi> or any other, to
get a Certificate of your health and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from the Plague, as also of the
freedom of that Town. There are persons
appointed in every place for giving of
such Bills, or <hi>Patents de Sainte,</hi> as they
call them. Their Subscriptions are
known to the next Townes about, where
you are to go, so that it is not easie to
counterfit, and besides it were very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to doe so; They are very scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in this matter upon all the Coast of
<hi>Liguria,</hi> for fear of contagion; So that
when you arrive at any Town, before
you go a shore, you must send one of your
Boat-men, with your Certification to be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103701:56"/>
shown to such as are appointed for those
matters in that Place, who immediately
upon the Sight of the Bill permit you,
<hi>la Practica,</hi> that is Libertie to stay in
the Town as long as you please, and
do what you will. When you part
from that, You must take a new Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificat
to the next Place, and so of the
Rest untill you come at <hi>Ligorn,</hi> where
this niceness will end.</p>
            <p>You must carrie with you no Secret
Weapon, as Dagger, Pocket Pistols,
or the like: And this is general all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Italy,</hi> except only in the Kingdom
of <hi>Naples,</hi> and States of <hi>Venice</hi> and
<hi>Milan,</hi> where it is permitted to wear
Daggers. At most Towns in <hi>Italy,</hi> You
will be oblidged to leave yonr Hulster-Pistols,
and sometimes your Sword
with the Guard at the Gate you enter
in by: And then they will ask you, by
what Gate you are to go out, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
Your Arms will wait for you,
which they will know to be yours, by the
delivery of a Nick-stick given You as
you enter, and which for that purpose,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103701:56"/>
You must carefully keep. In most
Places, Strangers are permitted to weare
their Swords. Your Cloak-Bag like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
will be visited at every Town, to
to see that there be no Customable
Goods in it, and if there be any Books,
you must give up a List of them to the
Visitor, or Inquisitor appointed for
that end, and he will Signe it with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to let them pass, Providing, there
be no Prohibited Book amongst them,
For if there were any such, it would be
Dangerons; yet there are wayes enough
to convey Books, or any other thing
of whatsoever Nature, or Quality, from
any Sea-port, without any Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
which you will easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
after your being a while in
the Country.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Monaco</hi> you will easily reach
<hi>Oneglia,</hi> which is at about twelve Miles
distance, and about 5 Miles further
<hi>Albenga,</hi> from thence you have seven
Miles to <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>li,</hi> &amp; ten more to <hi>Savona,</hi> from
whence there rests five Miles to <hi>Genoua,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Coast, of <hi>Liguria,</hi> from <hi>Nize</hi> to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103701:57"/>
               <hi>Genoua,</hi> &amp; some days Journey beyond
<hi>Genoua</hi> towards <hi>Ligorn,</hi> is nothing but
rude <hi>Alps,</hi> for the most part infertile and
unhabitable, except towards the Bottom
near the Sea, where there are little
Smal Valleys here and there, both deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and Fruitfull. For the rest it is
wonderfull to see with what industry &amp;
trouble, they have been able to place
little smal Villages, as it were in the
Clefts of the Hills, and Plant Olive
Trees, where one would think nothing
but crows could venture to Big. All
this Tract is extreamly hot, especially
in Summer, being directly opposit to
the South, and altogether guarded from
the North, So that the reflection of the
Sun beames, makes a Heat almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Genoua la Superba,</hi> so called from the
sumptuousness of its Buildings, and
so they use to give other epithets to
other Towns, as <hi>Roma la Sane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
Fiorenza la Bella, Bolognia la Grassa,
Padua la Dotta, Venetia la Rieta,</hi> &amp;c. It is
said that <hi>Genoua</hi> has <hi>Montagnie senza legno,
Mare senze pesce, Donne senza Vergonia,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103701:57"/>
&amp; Gente senza sede.</hi> It is a Republick &amp;
the Government administred by a Senate.
It is a City of great Trade and very
Rich, and it is said they account usury no
great Sin: It being their Maxim, that <hi>Cento

                  </gap>io.</hi> You may take
notice in the Place; First, of the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Town, and so you may Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barize
towards the West-side. <hi>2ly.</hi>
The Senate House, <hi>3ly.</hi> The Churches,
and particularly that of St. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi>
which is the Cathedrall, a Stately Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
Crusted with Marble. <hi>4ly.</hi> That
famous Street, called <hi>la Strada Nova,</hi>
which is composed of so many Palaces,
most of them of Marble: you must by
all means endeavour to see the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Palaces. Within you will find
them most delicatly Adorned with all
sorts of fine Things, as Statues, Paintings,
&amp;c. You must also see their Gardens,
where besides severall sorts of Flowers,
Shrubs, and Trees, you will likeways
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103701:58"/>
find delicat Fountains, Fish-ponds, and
Grotto's; as particularly in the Palace of
the <hi>Principe d'Oria;</hi> I would likeways
have you see the Palace of <hi>Signior Baldi,</hi>
and some other Houses of Pleasure espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
towards the Sea-port, where they
stand at the foot of the Hill over look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another as they mount in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in form of a Theatre, and all of
them having a full view of the Sea-port,
which is very spacious and very deep;
but in my Opinion, not so very well
guarded from stormes. That which I
find most considerable in it is, the <hi>Mole,</hi>
which secures the entrie thereof, it being
the best and strongest and in the deepest
Water I ever saw. At the east end of
the port there is a litle Promontory called
<hi>Capo de Fara,</hi> upon which stands a High
Turret, which they call <hi>la Lanternâ,</hi>
from the Top whereof they use to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all Vessells at Sea at a considerable
distance. <hi>5ly.</hi> Forget not to visit the
Book-Sellers, but in Regard this is a
generall Remark not to be omited, in
every Town where there any, I shall
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103701:58"/>
say no more of it here, but shall put You
in mind of it now and then.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Genoua</hi> You must again provide
Your self of a Felluck to <hi>Ligorn,</hi> which
you will find readier and at an easier rate,
because of the more frequent Traffick and
intercourse, than from <hi>Cane</hi> or <hi>Nize,</hi> you
will pass by <hi>Porta Fino, Leresi, Viare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>
&amp;c. and you wil not find many things
considerable more than I have already
noted on the Coasts of <hi>Liguria</hi> betwixt
<hi>Genoua</hi> and <hi>Nize,</hi> except that when ye
pass <hi>Leresi</hi> a litle, you begin to discover a
large plain, part of which belongs to
the state of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and therein are the
Quarries that furnish all <hi>Italy</hi> with the
best Marble, and the rest is the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of <hi>Massa;</hi> For the better seeing of
which if you please you may go from
<hi>Genoua</hi> by Horse to <hi>Ligorne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tuscany</hi> begins about <hi>Viaregia,</hi> the
greatest part whereof is under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of the Great Duke of <hi>Tuscany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ligorn</hi> is no antient, but yet a very
Handsom and well built City, by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>
the first, Great DUKE of
<hi>Tuscany,</hi> of whom you will see a most
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103701:59"/>
stately Statue or rather Colosse, with
slaves Chain'd at his Feet, on each
side kneeling; a litle without the Gate as
you go to the Sea-Port. The Town is
regularly fortified, they say, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
who was banished out of <hi>England</hi> in the
Reign of Queen <hi>Eli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>abeth,</hi> and well
receaved and much esteemed by the then
Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> for his excellent parts
and Qualifications. The Duke for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragment
of Trade hath granted great
Immunities to Merchants of all Nations
whatsomever, which is the great cause
that the Town flourishes so much in
Trade, and is so well Peopled: Severall
Nations have established great Factories
here, but especialy the <hi>English</hi> and
<hi>Hollanders</hi> who have made this place,
as it were the staple of all their commerce
into the <hi>Levant.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> also have a
very great freedome here and are not
distinguished by any particular Mark,
as in other places, from other Merchants,
but live Honourably in a particular
Street of the Town, built by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103701:59"/>
yet not sequestrated from
the rest of the Town by any Wall
or Gate, as they use to be in all other
places, where I have seen them. The
<hi>English</hi> Merchants live very splendidly,
and are very hospitable and courteous,
especially, to their Countrymen, that
Travell that way, under which name
they comprehend all that are Subject to
our King: The Jews <hi>Synagogue</hi> here
is the best in <hi>Italy;</hi> and therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
your seeing. They observe our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnday,</hi>
so that if You please to stay,
You may see their form of Worship.
You must take particular notice of the
<hi>Sea-Port,</hi> which is undoubtedly the most
secure and finest in all <hi>Italy,</hi> in which
You will see the great Dukes <hi>Gallies,</hi>
which he kee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s for a Guard, to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
against the <hi>Turks</hi> men of War. It
is worth the while to see a <hi>Gallie</hi> put out
to Sea, or, as she comes in, for so one
may see the Discipline of the Slaves
to whom the <hi>Bosson</hi> delivers the word
of Command by the noise of a Whisle,
the diversitie whereof they are as well
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103701:60"/>
acquainted with, as Horse-men with a
Trumper, or foot with a Drum. If
You be diligent You may meet with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
curiosities, some naturall, some of
Art, especially from the <hi>Levant,</hi> and
all at reasonable Rates: and for the more
commodious doing of this, it will be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to make acquaintance with severall
Merchants, especially <hi>English,</hi> who will
either inform You themselves, where
such things are to be found, or else ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
You to such Persons in the Town,
as may best hap to do it. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
necessary for You to have such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and amongst them some
one confident for returning You Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from <hi>England,</hi> or at least for retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
You, what Money You have not
present Use for, to <hi>Florence,</hi> as also for
keping correspondence with; that by this
means, You may send any thing you
please to Your confident at <hi>London.</hi> And
because this advice may be usefull in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Places; I shall be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
in it here for all. I suppose then
You were to send any little Ball for
Trunk from <hi>Ligorne</hi> to <hi>London;</hi> Your
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103701:60"/>
way would be first to pass it at the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
house, where, I think Books, and

            <p>I Have been the more particular in these
things, because altho' they may seem
to be triffles, to those that are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in such matters, yet a small mistake,
may be the occasion of a great Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
I shall now return to put You
in mind of some other particulars, and
1. That in this Place, Oisters are a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great Delicat, there being but one
person that has Priviledge to sell them,
for which he payes a considerable Sum
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103701:63"/>
to the great Duke; I know not well
from whence they are brought, but I
am sure it is from a considerable
Distance: They are keept in the Town-Ditch,
on the East side of the Town,
which is full of salt water, because it hath
communion with the Sea; the keeper
hath a little House hard by, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the number Bargained for, takes
them alive &amp; very fat out of the Ditch, &amp;
sells them at the Rate of a Pistole the
Hundred. They are many times put
into the Ditch little, and keept untill
they be big enough, they taste very well,
and are by far the best in <hi>Italy.</hi> 2. To
the East-ward of the Town, about a
Mile or little more, there is an Hill called
<hi>Monte Nero,</hi> upon which there is good
harbarizing. You will do well to take
a Horse and a Guide with you to the
Place. From <hi>Ligorn</hi> you have 15
Miles of Smooth and Plain way to</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pisa.</hi> It is an Ancient City, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a common-wealth by it self, and
then both Rich and populous: But since
it was Reduced under the command of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103701:63"/>
the great Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> it is neither
of the two; the far greater part of the
Inhabitants, after the Town was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
chusing rather to abandon their
Native Country, than their Liberty, or
at least preferring a voluntar Subjection
abroad, to a necessitated Slavery at home.
The City is large and Beautifull, divided,
as it were in two by the River <hi>Arno,</hi> and
again conjoyned by a beautifull Bridge,
of white Marble. The Air of this Place,
in Winter, is judged to be more Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
than that at <hi>Florence,</hi> &amp; therefore the
great Duke uses to pass the Winter here.
There are many things considerable in
this Town; as, <hi>1st.</hi> The great Church,
which is a Stately Fabrick, and well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
within, as also the <hi>Batistaria</hi>
whereof the Doores, as also of the great
Church, are all covered with Massive
Brass, cast into delicat Figures. <hi>2ly.</hi> The
crooked Steeple, which leanes to one side
very far from the perpendicular; some
people alledge it was purposely so built,
but I am more apt to beleeve that the
ground hath miss-given on the one side
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103701:64"/>
by little and little, or rather insensibly,
which may be some part of the Reason,
why it hath hung together so long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
falling, to which the excellencie of
the Cement and Workman-ship hath
contributed very much; my opinion, to
one that narrowly observes, will not
appear to be unreasonable, for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
is of so many Rows of small Pillars
going round about, and the lower-most
Row, on that side that it leanes to, is
more than half hid in the ground, where
as those of the other are wholy to be
seen; which I suppose could not have
happened otherways, than as I have said.
<hi>3ly.</hi> The Buriall Place, which is the
most stately I ever saw, being a long
quadrangle, well walled and galleried
about, in the midle whereof are very
many Monuments of great antiquity, of
many of the ancient noble Families of
<hi>Pisa.</hi> They are most of them of white
Marble in shape like a Coffine, wherein
the Body of the Dead persons was laid:
Some of them are carved in one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
and some of them in another, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103701:64"/>
some of them into excellent Figures. <hi>4ly</hi>
The Dukes Palace. <hi>5ly.</hi> The Physical
Garden, together with the Rarities that
are keept in a Gallery belonging to the
Garden, where you will see a very great
Collection of Natural Curiosities. The
Garden uses to have very rare exotick
Plants; but in regard you can have no
access to it, except by the recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Physitian, that is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
of <hi>Botany</hi> for the time, therefore I
think it will be worth your while to
make your address to him, for a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
first, to see the Garden and Gallery;
secondly, to get from the Gardener or
himself, the Seeds, of such as you have a
mind to, and a Peece of the Plant for
drying, if you think fitting; you must
not be negligent here, for this is one of
the best Gardens in <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
preferable to that of <hi>Padua,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for exotick Plants. The Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for the whole Estate of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> is
keep'd here, and if you please you may
see the Schooles for all Professions, and
particularly that for the Lawes, where
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103701:65"/>
the most renowned <hi>Bartholus</hi> did teach.
Amongst the Booksellers you may find
something to accommodat you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is an University Town, and I
shall tell you here, because I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to have it done as yet, that,
generally speaking, all sort of Books in
<hi>Italy,</hi> are cheaper than in any other
place where I have been. I pray You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to get a Couple of the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
of the Garden there, of the last
Edition.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Pisa,</hi> You have but a small half
days Journey, of very pleasant Way, to
<hi>Luca,</hi> which is a Delicat little Town,
a Republick by it self, and having but
a very small Territory belonging to it;
it is well and regularly fortified with a
dry Ditch, which is keept very cleane
and in good Order, and allways Green:
the Republick is governed by a Prince
or Chief Magistrat, whom they choose
of their own Town, and change him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
two Month: So soon as any one
is chosen, he must leave his own House
and Friends, and retire himself to the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103701:65"/>
Publick Palace, where he is assisted by
some other of the Nobles, &amp; cannot come
out untill his Government be finished.</p>
            <p>The Humour of the people is Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and very Civil, and contrary to the
Custome of all <hi>Italy,</hi> Men and Women
converse freely amongst themselves or
with Strangers. They use Balls &amp; Dance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
much after the <hi>French</hi> Fashion;
The Religious people use to distill Spirits
and Essences, whereof you may provide
what Quantitie you please, both good,
and good cheap, I wish you might help
a Friend to some of Orange-Flowers
and Myrtles; The religious Women
likeways use to make very prettie Things,
and particularly I remember they use
to sell Stomagers of quilted Silk, which
most people use to wear in the
Winter-time, of one Fashion or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Luca,</hi> if you please, you may
go to <hi>Pisloia,</hi> and so to <hi>Florence,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways
returne to <hi>Pisa,</hi> and from
thence, either by Coach or Horse, to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene.</hi>
If the Weather be not too hot, it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103701:66"/>
is better to go on Horse-back, in regard
of the prospect of the Countrie, which
cannot be had in a Coach. <hi>Florence</hi> is
a new Town, but one of the most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
in all <hi>Italy,</hi> and therefore called

places, over which stands four fair
Bridges. The City is Counted at least
six miles in Compass; The Beautie of it
consistes in the Stateliness of the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
the great number of Palaces, the
neateness and cleannesse of the Streets,
occasioned by the largeness and smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the Stones, with which it is paved;
the many large Places, Fountains, Statues,
Churches, Towers, Convents &amp; Gardens;
Of all which it hath very many of the
best in <hi>Italy.</hi> There is scarce any thing
in this City; which is not very well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to be taken notice of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.
1. The Dukes two Palaces, the

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103701:66"/>
as yet; The Garden belonging thereto is
very well furnished, with Rare Plants
and Flowers; of which the Catalogue
is Printed, of which I desire You to
bring alongs a Couple of Copies. It
will not be a miss to make Acquaintance
with the Gardener; for, so you will get
what Seeds you please. The old Palace
stands in the great Place of the City, in
the midle of which Place there is a Stately
Colossus of Brass, of <hi>Cosmus</hi> great Duke
of <hi>Florence</hi> a Horse back, by the Model
whereof that of <hi>Henry</hi> the great upon
the new Bridge of <hi>Paris</hi> was made.
Near to the Entrie into the Palace there
are severall other Noble Statues of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
within the Palace it self is that so
much famed, over the World, Gallerie,
which is composed of many Roomes,
containing great Varietie of the choisest
Curiosities; as Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ues, Busta's, Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relieues,
Paintings, Drawings, Prints,
Cabinets, Jewels, Cameo's, Intaillia's,
with all sorts of <hi>Anticailles,</hi> with an
infinite number of Master-peeces of lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times. Amongst other things, there
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103701:67"/>
is a Chamber or two full of all sorts of
Armes, amongst which those of <hi>Charles</hi>
the Great and <hi>Roland,</hi> with severall
Swords of <hi>Henry</hi> the great, also a great
Number of Cymiters, some whereof have
their Scabbards set with Rubies, Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds,
and other precious Stones. There
is an ancient Buckler with a Medusa's
Head, Painted by <hi>Michael Angelo bona
rota.</hi> I remember to have observed some
ancient Casaques, whose weight I am
confident no Head could sustain, unless
so adjusted to the rest of the Armour,
and that to the Sadle, that the Horse
must have carried all. You must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to get a Writen Inventure of
the severall Curiosities in the Gallerie,
for without that it is not possible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
every particular; Within this
Palace, the great Duke uses to keep the
most excellent Artisans he can meet with,
of all Trades, to whom he gives consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Salaries and Priviledges, whom
you will do well to see, but especially
the Stone-Cutters, of whose Art I intreat
you to take particular notice, and what
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103701:67"/>
Instruments they use, and learne at least
as much of it as may serve to polish
Stones. Amongst other Curiosities of
this Trade, You may see a New way of
Mosaick Work, wherein the figure is
compleated most delicatly, both as to
the parts and Colours thereof, by the
Natural Colours of the severall peeces
of Stones assembled together; and which
is strange, all the lights and shadows re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
in Painting is herein observed;
So that they can imitate Nature allmost
as fully this way as in Painting it self.
This way differs from the old Mosaick,
in that the particular Peeces that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it, are of different Figures accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the colours require; for example,
a Cherrie because it is all of one Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
therefore it may be represented by
a Red stone of a round Figure in one
Peece, but the Stalk of it must be of an
other different figure: But in the old
way, all the peeces were Quadrangular,
whatsoever might be the colour or thing
to be represented, and of this kind of
Mosaick you will see a most excellent
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103701:68"/>
Peece in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel
treading upon the <hi>Devil.</hi> In this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
likeways, the great Duke keeps a
Chymical Laboratorie, called <hi>la Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deria,</hi>
wherein are made very many
notable preparations with great Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness,
especially Spirits and Essences,
which may be bought here at reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Rates, and without fear of being
cheated, as to the goodnes of the things,
<hi>2ly.</hi> Severall Churches and Convents,
particularly the <hi>Dome</hi> the out-side
whereof is the most beautifull in <hi>Europe,</hi>
being all crusted with Black. White
and Red Marble, fit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in regular figures. The Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is Paved with black and white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and Richly adorned with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
and Altars; The Cupola is very
Large and Fine insomuch that the Golden
Ball upon the Top of it, which is able to
contain a great many Persons, does not
appear from the Ground to be bigger
than a good Foot-Bal; Near to the <hi>Dome</hi>
stands <hi>Jota</hi>'s Towre, one of the most
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103701:68"/>
admirable Peeces of Architecture, in the
World; being a square Steeple, without
any spite on the Top of it, all crusted
with black, white and red Marble, in
most regular figures from the top to the
bottom; near to it stands the round
Chapel of St. <hi>John</hi> delicately payed
with Marble, and adorned with statues,
with a Rich Vase adorned with precious
Stones, wherein the Children are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised.
The Doors of the Chapel are of

in this Chapel is the Sepulchre

and it is said at his own desire,
that he might lye within the View of
<hi>Jota</hi>'s Towre, which he did so much
admire in his lifetime; Upon his Tome
there are three most delicate Statues, the
one represents Painting; the second, Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
the third Architecture: in which
three Arts, he was so great a Master.
St. <hi>Laurence</hi> Church was magnificently
built by <hi>Cosmo de Medicis,</hi> whose Scpul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre
is to be seen there. There is that
famous Chapel, which the Dukes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
Labour to Finish. It is the
most Glorious thing extant in the World,
there being already bestowed upon the
Workman-ship thereof above eight
Millions of Gold, and I beleeve a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
deal more will not perfect it.
It is not very large, but built round; it
is all Mosaik, both the Floore, roofe and
sides; and the least considerable Stones
that compose it, are Jasper, Porphir, Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baster,
Lapis Lazuli &amp;c. there are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
nests in the Wall about, where the
statues of the Dukes are to stand as they
lived and succeeded to the another. The
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103701:69"/>
Great Altar is not yet set up, because of
peoples being still at work in the Chapel,
nor is it yet altogether finished, but yet
there is so much done, that to look upon
it, one should hardly think there were any
thing wanting. It is keept in the Dukes
Wardrobe in the Old Palace, of which
I forgot to speake formerly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tell You now that it is one part of
the old Palace which You must not faile
to see, there being in it a vast Treasure
of Silver and Gold Plate, with many
other Precious things. The Altar is keept
in a little Room by it self, I shall not
under-take to descrive it particularly, but
only desire You to consider well every
part of it, the Richness of the Materials
and excellencie of the Workemanship,
the <hi>Mosaicks,</hi> and the <hi>Christall</hi> Pillars,
and I believe You will easily excuse my
holding by the general, and omitting to
speak of particulars: I do truely think
that the beauties and excellencies of this
Chapel and Altar, are so great and so
many, that they Deserve a Particular
Book to make them known to the world,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103701:70"/>
and it may be there is some such work
intended, or alreadie extant, which if it
be I am confident You will take care to
have it.</p>
            <p>I must give You notice in this Place,
that You will doe well to Treat with
some of those men that Work about the
Chapel, or else with some of those stone-cutters
in the Gallery for some small
Peeces of all the species of stones; let them
be of such a Bigness as may easily serve
to know them by. I make no doubt but
You may get them at a Reasonable Rate.
But I must earnestly intreat You to mind
those two Species of stones which are
found in Quarries not farr from <hi>Florence,</hi>
whereof the one Naturally represents
Townes and Landscapes, the other is
some what Whiter, and has Trees and
Forrests Represented on it, by little Black
Draughts; I remember to have shown you
a small Peice of each sort, but now I would
have, two or three larger Peeces of both
the sorts, of about a span-Length, and of
the best Marked, for I intend to put them
in frames, as a Cheif ornament of my
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103701:70"/>
Tradescants. I shall hold You compt for
the price. 3. The Place where the wild
Beasts are keept. It is a long square Peece
of ground Walled about, and galleried
on the Top for Spectators; under the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries
are litle cells that open to the Place,
in each of which there is keept a severall
Wild Beast, such as <hi>Lyons, Tygers, Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards,
Woolfs, Beares,</hi> &amp;c. These have
their keeper that waits upon them, and
Feeds them, and when the great Duke
commands, they are brought out, one or
more, as he Pleases, and bated with
Dogs, or otherwise set to fight with one
another, Upon such occasions strangers
are Permitted to see. 4. The Book-sellers;
of which there are prettie store
here and those well furnished too. You
cannot miss of a <hi>Casalpinus de Plantis</hi>
or two, for it was Printed in this Place.
If You can get his appendix <hi>ad libros de
Plantis,</hi> You will oblidge me to bring it
with You; it was Printed by it self at
<hi>Rome.</hi> You may possibly meet with
other good Books, for it is ordinar when
Learned men die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Book-Sellers to buy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103701:71"/>
their Books. I must likeways put You
in mind to buy a Printed Paper for me,
that was Published at <hi>Florence,</hi> called
<hi>Testis examinatus;</hi> it containes two or
three figures of the <hi>Testicles</hi> with a short
Description thereof, in one single leaf.</p>
            <p>There is one Dr. <hi>Kirton</hi> Dr. of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi>
He is a very civill and obligeing
Gentleman; If he be yet alive he will be
Your Interpreter: and if You need not
that, he will help You to expede the rest
of Your affairs; in short, both his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
and his company are to be esteemed;
He is an <hi>English</hi> Man born, low in stature
and prettie ancient.</p>
            <p>You must not faill in this Place to
take notice, of the variety of Fruits, &amp;
Wines; as the Red <hi>Florence</hi> Wine, which
is counted the best for ordinar Drinking,
being stomachical and without Sweetnes.
The White <hi>Florence</hi> Wine, which is
Sweet; <hi>Verdea,</hi> which is delicious small
Sweet white Wine; <hi>Monte Pulciano,</hi>
White and Red, both very good Wines,
so called from the Place they grow upon,
and many more such.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:103701:71"/>
If You happen to be here in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
time, especially when the Grapes are
Ripe, You will find in the Markets great
Varietie of Fowles and small Birds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I intreat You to take notice, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of those kinds, that are not common
with us, and try to get their Skins,
which may be easily done, when the bird
hath not been long Dead; the rump must
be left at it for preserving of the Taile;
The Head, Wings and Feet must be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
left, and only tbe body taken out, &amp;
so the Skin filled with Flax or Cotton.
This I intreat You to remember to doe
wheresoever You shall happen to be in
the Summer time, and if any such occasion
Present it self to You in Winter, not to
ommit it.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Florence</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> You have 140.
Miles; there are severall wayes of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling,
<hi>viz.</hi> by Coach, by <hi>Procaccio</hi> or
Messenger with whom you agree for so
much; as is usuall in <hi>France:</hi> and by
the <hi>Viturin,</hi> that is, by hyring of Horse
at a certain Rate, &amp; Paying for Your own
entertainment at every part as you pass.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103701:72"/>
If you be acquainted with the customes
of the Countrey, and have Language
enough to make Your self understood,
this last way is the best, because you will
be sure to fare better, and cost you no
more, than you would otherwise Pay to
the Messenger, who will be sure to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the worst chear for you, that he
may make the better for himself: in short,
it is best to be Master of your own Purse,
and not live at the discretion of Your
Conductor. I have forgot hitherto to
tell you that there is some Incommoditie
for Travellers upon the Road, as to their
Bedding, their Cloaths espiecially, the
Sheets being for the most part very nasty,
and it is but now and then that either
money or fair words can procure a Pair
of clean Sheets. The best remedy I know
is not to put off ones Cloaths, and to wrap
ones self, especialy the Head, in their
Cloak, that the face and Hands may
not touch any unclean thing; in short
a litle Patience will do it, and you will
be sure to be better accomodated in good
Towns.</p>

There are not many considerable things
to be seen upon this Road; <hi>Siena</hi> was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
by itself, but was reduced by the
Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> and by his Son
<hi>Philip</hi> Gifted to the Great Duke of <hi>Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany,</hi>
under whose Power it still Remains.
The Town is of a good bigness, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for it's Situation, and the purity
of the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue. The <hi>Dome</hi> or great
Church is a statly Fabrick; it is Paved with
Marble, but especialy the Quire, upon
which is most Curiously Graven the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of <hi>Abraham</hi> Sacrificeing his Son, and
History of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and for the
better Preservation of them they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Matts. There is likewise an
entrie from the Church to the Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theck
of <hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> who was born in
this Town. He was once Legat from the
<hi>Pope</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and afterwards Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<hi>Pope</hi> himself, and took the name of
<hi>Pius Secundus.</hi> He was a Man of great
Learning. The late <hi>Pope Alexander</hi> VII.
was Native of this Place, of the Family
of <hi>Chigi;</hi> his Statue is to be seen in the
great Church. The greatest Part of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103701:73"/>
and the Towre belonging to it are of
Black and White Marble without. In
the Church of St. <hi>Dominic,</hi> amongst
other Relicts, is preserved the Head of St.
<hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Siena.</hi> The Tovvne is
well watered with many fine Fountains.
The great place is made with a kind of
Descent Theatre ways, so that from the
middle of the Place You may see
all that walk in it. <hi>Montefiascone</hi> is
famous for a most Delicious Kind of
<hi>Muscatello</hi> Wine, which You must be sure
to Tast. The Messenger uses to Dine
without the Town, but you will be sure
to fare better and get better Wine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
There goes a storie that a <hi>German</hi>
killed himself in this Place with Drinking
excessivly of this <hi>Muscat.</hi> As you goe
from thence to <hi>Viterbo</hi> you will find a
kind of <hi>Aspalathus,</hi> which I take to be
<hi>Acacia altera Angularae.</hi> It growes as high
as our Broom, and is plentifull enough, so
that you will easily discover it.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Viterbo,</hi> all that distance to <hi>Rome</hi>
is called the <hi>Campania</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which
it is thought most dangerous to sleep in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103701:74"/>
the Summer time, therefore if you fortune
to travel it in Summer, whither to <hi>Rome</hi>
or from it (the same is under stood of
40. Miles distance round about <hi>Rome</hi>)
you must be sure not to sleep in the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania,</hi>
which you may easily avoid by
Travelling in the night. when you arrive
at <hi>Rome</hi> you must give up your name
at the Port; your Countrey, the Place

any trouble. You will doe well to
Lodge in a Pension for the first week, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
you have made some acquaintance, by
means whereof you may be fullie infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
where to light upon a convenient
<hi>Camera locanda:</hi> There was two <hi>French</hi>
Pensions, and one <hi>English</hi> in my time.
The first of the <hi>French</hi> was <hi>Al monte d'oro.</hi>
The second was <hi>nella strada del Populo</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:103701:74"/>
The English pension was in the same <hi>stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da
del Populo, alla villa di Londra:</hi> we had
severall Countrey men living in the
Town in my time, as particularly <hi>signior
Roberto Pendrick,</hi> a worthie old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and most obligeing to his Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey
men, he was my particular good friend;
and I make no doubt but you will find
him so, for I hear he is still alive, and
I wish he may be long so. He lives in a
House of his own upon the <hi>Triuita di
monte.</hi> There is an other called <hi>Signior don
Gulielmo Lesly,</hi> He is Chaplain to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Carlo Barberino</hi> and lives <hi>nella Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaria.</hi>
I dare be confident to give you
this man for one of the most faithfull
Friends in the World, and one in whose
goodness, prudence, Kindness, and good
Conduct you may trust ten Thousand
Lives: to be short you will find I am not
mistaken, when I call him <hi>deliciae huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
generis,</hi> for in all my lifetime I never
knew another like him, make it their
whole work and study to find opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to oblige every Countrey-man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his condition: The p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103701:75"/>
them, with Food and Rayment and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
else they may stand in need of, and
all other men with continual offices of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility.
By his means you will get to see
many of these things I shall recommend to
you hereafter. If I Know of your going to
<hi>Italy</hi> in time, I shall have a Letter there
before you. Your best convenience for
Lodging and Diet will be <hi>a Camera Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canda.</hi>
You may take it in that place of
the town that suits best with your occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
you will pay for it by the month,
less or more according to the goodness of
the Chamber and furniture thereof. As
for your diet it will be drest in the House,
and you must tell at night what you In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to eat next day, that they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
it for you: As for the prices you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be easily Cheated, because as to that,
most things are Regulated, And in the
quantitie it is not possible you should be
overreached because all things are sold
by weight. There are severall Kinds of
Bread used in this City, but that which
is called <hi>Papaline</hi> is undoubtedly the best.
There are likewise many sorts of Wines,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103701:75"/>
some of them <hi>Galliardi</hi> or strong, as <hi>Greco,
Muscatello di Saragosa, Lagrima</hi> &amp;c.
others are <hi>Legieri,</hi> or small, and they are
many; the best for common use is <hi>Albano,</hi>
which You may drink pure: and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
that there are but few places in
<hi>Italy</hi> where Water may be Drunk safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and because one may be mistaken in
the choise, the best remedy is to Drink
none at all. There are great variety of fruits
according to the Seasons of the year, I shal
only desire you to be cautious, and not
to eat too much or too often of any, but
especialy, of <hi>Melons, Cucumbers,</hi> and the
<hi>Malanzane,</hi> or <hi>mala insana,</hi> which are a
Kind of <hi>Solanum Pomiferum.</hi> There are
good store and Many Kinds of Fishes,
especialy Sea Fish, whereof the best are,
<hi>Sols, il Pisce Capone</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Tunino</hi> is
a great Fish as big as our <hi>Salmond,</hi> and
Red like it, but harder and dryer a great
deale, the bellie of it is verie fatt and they
use to Salt and sell it in the Taverns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sliced in small peeces upon a Trencher;
Fresh <hi>Sturgeon</hi> is very common; <hi>Lobsters</hi>
are much harder and worse to disgest
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103701:76"/>
than ours: as for fleshes, <hi>Bufalo</hi> is only
eaten by the Poorer sort of people; Beif
which they call <hi>Vacina</hi> is good; <hi>Vitella
campo reccia,</hi> or Hudron is good, but
above all the <hi>Vitella mongana</hi> or sucking
Veal. Lamb is worth nothing, nor Mutton
either, which they call <hi>Castrato,</hi> and
serves only to make Broath for Sick Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
Kids are good. In the Winter-time
there is is abundance of <hi>Sangliers</hi> or wild
Boars, as also <hi>Porcepics.</hi> The Snow in that
season, driving them from the Hills to the
Valleys, where they are Killed by the
Hunters. There is likeways great Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Fowl. There is none so common as
Quailes, at two seasons of the year, that
is, the Spring when they come into <hi>Italy,</hi>
and the latter end of <hi>Autumn,</hi> at which
time they are much fatter and better
when they go from it. It is said that they
draw together to the Coast side, and
there wait for the rest of their number
a whole Moneth, and then at last, their
<hi>Caravan</hi> being complete, they flee away
nearer the Sunn in a great cloud. The
<hi>Pigione Sotto hanca</hi> are the biggest and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103701:76"/>
fattest, and best for eating in the world:
they are good in all seasons of the year.
About the time of Vintage there are great
Variety of small Birds, all very fatt &amp;
good, and at easie Rates, amongst which
the <hi>Ortolani,</hi> and <hi>Beccafiche</hi> are most
esteemed.</p>
            <p>As for the things to be seen here, they
are so many, and so considerable, that
it would require a large Volume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
them, and there are abundance
of such Books extant, to which I referr
you, and especially to one in 80. called
<hi>L' Antichita di Roma di Andrea Fulvio:</hi>
but you must not fail to get an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quario,</hi>
who for a certain Summ of two
or three Crowns will show you all the
particular Antiquities and considerable
places of the Town, and as for the fuller
information of them your Book will
serve you: I shall only hint at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
worthie to be taken notice of; 1.
The Court; that is, the Pope, Cardinals,
Prelates, Monsigniorie &amp;c. There are
some great Holy days, when the Pope
Celebrats Mass in person; it will be sit to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103701:77"/>
wait upon some of these occasions, for
then you will see the Grandeur of the
Court and the forme of a Cavalcata,
together with the Popes ordinary Guards.
2. The Churches. 3. The Palaces; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
those of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> together with
the Bibliotheck and Gardens of <hi>Belvidere,</hi>
in which amongst other things take par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
notice of the statue of <hi>Ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aon</hi> with
the Serpents wreathed about him; There
is an other Garden also belonging to the
<hi>Vatican,</hi> in which there are many exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Plants, it was planted by the Popes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
by <hi>Tobias Aldinus</hi> and is Keept still
in reasonable good order; amongst other
things you will find the <hi>Cameripses,</hi> or
<hi>Camedactylus,</hi> of the bigness of a Low
Tree and carrying Fruit; there is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a <hi>Grotta</hi> or water work, and very
fine Fountains of water, about which
grows plentifully the <hi>Capillus veneris
Major</hi> or <hi>Ramosus.</hi> and <hi>Arum Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
Mathioli, sive Colocasia,</hi> which is a
plant carying no stalk, flowr nor fruit
in <hi>Italy</hi> (I know not what it does in its
native Soyle) but only broad Leaves
very large and round.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:103701:77"/>
The Palace of <hi>Farnese;</hi> and in it that
Gallery whereof the Painting in <hi>Fresco</hi>
by <hi>Aniball Caraccio</hi> is so famous, and
the <hi>Tauro</hi> which is kept in a little House

is the noblest piece of Art extant in <hi>Rome</hi>
altho it be very antient, as being one of
those named by <hi>Pliny,</hi> to have been in
his time in <hi>Foro Trajani;</hi> yet it is not
only intire, but as beautifull as if it had
never been moved out of the place it

            <p>The Palace of <hi>Principe Pamphilio;</hi>
it stands in the <hi>Piazza Navona,</hi> where
you may take notice of that Glorious

whereupon the top of a little artificial

Marble Statues, representing the foure
great Rivers of the World, and each of
them pouring out of a Vale placed under

            <p>The Popes Palace of <hi>Monte Cavallo,</hi>
and the Gardens thereof. 4. The <hi>Villa</hi>'s:
as first that of <hi>Borghese,</hi> which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the walls: there is a particular Book
to be sold by the House keeper, that
sufficiently descrives it and all the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of it, to which I Refer you. <hi>2ly.</hi>
the <hi>villa</hi> or <hi>Palazzo medici,</hi> belonging
to the great Duke of <hi>Tuscany.</hi> It stands
upon the <hi>monte Trinita,</hi> the Hall is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with a great many Pillars stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103701:78"/>
about the Walls, of most delicat
Marbles, and the Originalls of a great
many <hi>Illustres</hi> and <hi>virtuosi.</hi> In one of
the Chambers there is a most beautifull
statue of <hi>Venus,</hi> of <hi>Grecian</hi> Antiquitie.
In the Garden there is a Noble statue of
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> the Ruins whereof were repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Michaell Angelo bona rota,</hi> and
many other statues <hi>Base Releiv</hi>'s and
<hi>Vases,</hi> which for Brevities sake I must
omit, and refer you to the particular
Books that treat of those things, But
most of all to your own diligence in
viewing them and keeping a punctuall
Register of all that you see, and so I
shall only name some of the <hi>Villa</hi>'s
that remain, and are most considerable.
As the <hi>Villa Montalto;</hi> The <hi>Villa Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visi,</hi>
where amongst other Admirable
things the statue of the dying <hi>Gladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator</hi>
is excellent. The <hi>Villa Farnesi;</hi> The
<hi>Villa Pamphilio,</hi> which is a pretie way
without the walls, and the rest which
I leave to your sight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> The Castle of <hi>St. Angelo,</hi> which
formerly was the Burial Place of <hi>Hadrian</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:103701:79"/>
the Emperor. 6. The Hospitalls; Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
that of St. <hi>Spirito,</hi> which is a
most magnificent Structure, and well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in all things. They will show you
amongst other remarkable things, the
Place where the Children of such a Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
are permitted to be put in, without
any further inquirie made after them,
or who brought them. By this means
the Life of many a Child hath
ben saved, which otherways would
have been taken away to prevent the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of the Parents. They are no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
put in, but Nurses are got for them:
If they be Boyes, when they come to a
convenient Age they are put to Trades,
according ro their several Inclinations
and Capacities. But if they be Girles,
then when they come to the Years of
discretion, if they incline not to a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Life, every one of them is provided
with so much Portion to Marry her
with, out of the common revenue of the
House; And then upon a certain Day
appointed for that purpose; all <hi>Zitelle</hi> or
maids come in Procession, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103701:79"/>
with their Faces Vail'd, and the Men
that come there upon such Days, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to choose a Wife, (for all of them
have a like Portions) pitch upon such as
please them best, and present them a Nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay,
after which, she is sequestred from
the rest, &amp; the Marriage Solemniz'd, after
the Man has given Information of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and sufficient Caution that he shall
provide a Lively-hood for her. There is
a very fine little Garden that belongs to
the Hospital lying just upon the <hi>Tyber.</hi>
It uses to be well furnished with Plants,
and I have seen the <hi>Dictamnus Creticus</hi>
in flowre there. <hi>7ly.</hi> The Convents; as
particularly the <hi>French Minims</hi> upon the
<hi>Monte Trinita.</hi> In the upper Gallerie of
their Cloyster there is a Dyall, where the
Sun beams, entering by a small round
hole, Point the Hours. It was made by
<hi>Marsennus</hi> that famous Mathematician,
a Father of their Countrie and Order.
They have likeways, in a particular part
of their Garden some rare Plants, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus

In my time there was a <hi>French</hi> Father
there called <hi>Padre Barilieri</hi> Secretarie to
the General for his Nation; He was a
great Virtuoso, and exceedingly well
versed in the whole Historie of Nature;
He had a very Curious Collection of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Naturall Things, and was about to
have Published a Large Book in <hi>Folio,</hi>
wherein he had designed a Natural Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
with a great many cutts, which he
showed me. If the Book be Published,
I should be very glad to see it; if he be
alive, it will be worth your while to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his acquaintance. He hath also a
Garden well stored with Plants at St.

            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Colledge; where there is

as also a Garden.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>8ly.</hi> The Capitol; the middle of the
Place before it, is the Statue of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> a Horse-back in
Brass; It was brought thither from the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103701:80"/>
Place before St. <hi>John de Lateran,</hi> and is
thought one of the best Modells in the
World. At the Top of the Staires, as you
enter into the place are two Horses, one on
every side held by a Slave in Marble.
They were brought thither from the
Ruines of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Theatre. There is
also in the same Place two Trophies of
<hi>Marius;</hi> there is also <hi>Columna milliaris,</hi>
with a Brass-ball on the Top of it; there
used to be such a one at every miles end,
upon the common Roads; &amp; from thence
came their Fashion of counting the miles
<hi>per Lapides,</hi> as <hi>primo ab urbe Lapide</hi>
was a mile from the Town &amp;c. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol,
as it now is, consists of three Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
all of Excellent <hi>Architecture,</hi> and
beautified, both within and without
with Painting, Statues, and other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of antiquitie; the particular
Relation whereof I referr to the Books
that are written thereof, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to one called <hi>Roma antica &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derna,</hi>
&amp; to the particular demonstration
of the <hi>Antiquario,</hi> for I find it will be
utterly impossible to discourse of every

particular, unless I should resolve to
compile a Volumn.</p>
            <p>The rest of the Monuments, and rests
or rather ruins of Antiquitie, I shall pass
over, and only name a few of them; as
for example, first, the Walls of the City,
which were built by <hi>Bellisarius</hi> Captain
of the Guards to <hi>Justinian</hi> the Emperour.
The breaches have been repaired by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>Popes.</hi> The Ports for the most part are
the same they were anciently, only the
<hi>Porta del populo</hi> was made a great deal
more stately, at the first Entrie of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> into <hi>Rome.</hi>
There is a long courten of the Wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Porta del populo</hi> and <hi>Villa Borghese,</hi>
under which it seems the Ground has
misgiven, so that the Wall bendeth, &amp;
is therefore called <hi>Muro torto.</hi> Near to
this place also, is the Burial Place <hi>delle
Cortegiane,</hi> there being no Christian
Burial or Holy Ground allowed to such
persones. There is good Herbarizing
about the walls, especially on the out-side,
and particularly you will find a Plant
there which is not common else where, at

Secondly.</hi> The old Temples;
whereof there are so many that it would
be tedious to describe them all, I shall only
name some, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Pantheon</hi> now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Madonna della rotunda;</hi> It was built
by <hi>Marcus Agrippa,</hi> Son-in law to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus
Caesar,</hi> in Honour of all the Gods.
It had the Fortune to escape almost totaly,
the ruine, and fury, which the Goths &amp;
Vandals brought upon the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi>
and magnificence thereof. I admire
the Roofe of it, being so large and so flat
without any Pillar, to support it, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
it be a Vault, it hath no nevil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
to bind it in the middle, but in place
thereof a round hole so wide that it
lights the whole Roome abundantly, nor
is there any other Window in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick.
The next thing I admire in it is
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103701:82"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Doore-Cheeks and couple which is
all of one Peece of white Marble. The
Door opens in two leaves, very wide &amp;
very high, they were covered with <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi>
Brass, as was also the whole Roofe,
until the time of <hi>Vrban</hi> VIII. who
took it off, and covered it with Lead
as it now is, and made thereof the
great Altar of St. <hi>Peters,</hi> and some pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Ordinance, that are keept in the
Castel St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> as will testifie a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
inscription at the side of the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon

Upon this occasion was that
<hi>Pasquinad; Quod non fecerunt Barbari,

<hi>Portico</hi> before the Gate, of a great many
large tall Pillars of Egyptian black and
white speckled Marble; the descent into
the <hi>Portico</hi> from the Street is of ten or
twelve steps, but it is said, before the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of the City, that there was as great an
ascent to it; whence it may be gathered,
what an universal &amp; great devastation of
buildings must there have been to fill up
so great a deepth. And indeed it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103701:82"/>
that when they have any occasion
to dig, it is long before they come, in
most places, to the <hi>terra Virgine,</hi> that is,
which hath not formerly been broke u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon:
and when they are digging into old
ruins, for <hi>Anticails</hi> (as they are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
doing in severall places) they
leave off when they come to the <hi>Terra
Virgine.</hi> Before the <hi>Portico</hi> there is a
large coffine, with it's cover and suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Porphyre which they commonly
call <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s <hi>Tombe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near to the entrie of the Camp of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cino,</hi>
at the bottom of the back stairs that
lead to the Capitol, there is a Chapel under
ground, which was formerly the Prison
of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when they
suffered for the Holy name of <hi>JESVS.</hi>
It was then called <hi>Tullianum,</hi> according
to that of <hi>Cicero; est locus in carcere quod
Tullianum appellatur.</hi> The Temple of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>
is hard by, which in ancient times
was the <hi>Aerarium publicum,</hi> in which the
Publick Treasury was keept.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Amphitheatres;</hi> most part
of which are Ruined, especially that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103701:83"/>
which was built by <hi>Titus,</hi> now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>alled the
<hi>Coliseo;</hi> by the part thereof that is stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you may abundantly Judge of the
Magnificence of the whole, when it was
extant. There is good Herborizing within

            <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Aqueducts;</hi> of which
the most part are ancient: when they
come near to the City, they are convey'd
under ground to several Fountains in the
City, and some of them so deep, that it
is Prodigious by what art they could
have Peirc't so deep, as for example, the
<hi>Aqua Virgine,</hi> which is the sweetest and
best for use in all <hi>Rome,</hi> is conducted
so deep thro' the <hi>Monte Trinita,</hi> That
in the <hi>French Minims</hi> Garden there is
a descent of six or seven score steps to
come at it. Amongst all the Fountains in
<hi>Rome</hi> the most beautifull are in the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azza
Navona,</hi> in the <hi>Piazza</hi> St. <hi>Pietro,</hi>
the <hi>Tre Fountane, &amp;c,</hi>

               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:103701:83"/>
               <hi>5ly</hi> The <hi>Thermae,</hi> or Baths; as the
<hi>Thermae Diocletianae</hi> built by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Diocletian.</hi> It is said that ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Christians were imployed about
this work, and all cruely Massacred when
they had finished it. It is now a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of <hi>Carthusians,</hi> in whose common
Garden I remember to have seen the
Myrtus <hi>Buxifoliis.</hi> The ruins of <hi>Thermae

amongst these Ruins that kynd of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillary,

and no where else that I Remember of.</p>
            <p>Sixthly the two Columns of <hi>Antoninus,</hi>
and <hi>Tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

St. <hi>Peter</hi> stands upon the Top of one,
and that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon the other:
<hi>Trajan</hi> was so well beloved of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that to make a place, which in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of him they called <hi>forum Trajani,</hi>
in the midle of which this Column stands,
they levelled a great Hill, of the precise
hight of the Column it self. Both the
Columns are of white Marble, and all
the out side Historified in base relieue,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103701:84"/>
in a spirall line beginning at the bottom
and ending at the top. That of <hi>Trajan</hi>

There is a great Book in <hi>Folio</hi> of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn,
wherein all the figures are cutt in

St. <hi>Maria Majore,</hi> which was one of the
Pillars of the <hi>Templum Pacis,</hi> brought

the <hi>Mons Testaceus,</hi> which is nothing but
a heap of broken earthen Pots and bricks;

all along as you go upon the one Hand
and the other, as thick as they can stand
one by another, are holes or nests where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
were placed the bodies of the Dead,
one by one, upright upon their feet, and
so the nests Plastered over. The Bodies

There are severall things about <hi>Rome</hi>
worthie the taking notice of, as 1. <hi>Ponte
mola</hi> a Bridge standing upon the <hi>Teve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re;</hi>
in Latine <hi>Anio,</hi> some two miles from
the Town, before it joynes with the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
You go to it by the Port <hi>del Populo.</hi>
It is considerable for it's Antiquity. It
was at this Bridge that <hi>Constantine</hi> the
great vanquished <hi>Maxentius</hi> the Tyrant:
There having appeared to him before
the Battle, in the Firmament, a red Cross
with these words <hi>in hoc Signo vinces.</hi> the
story is Painted in <hi>fresco</hi> in the Palace
of the <hi>vatican</hi> by a great Master, where
You may see it and You will seldome
miss Painters in the Roome a Copying
of it. 2. The City of <hi>Tivali,</hi> in Latin
<hi>Tibur;</hi> by the way You will pass a little
River, The Sulphureous and noysome
smell whereof You will perceive at a
Miles distance; it is of a whitish Colour
as if Meall were mingled with it; there
is a white slymie Sulphureous substance
adhering to the sydes and bottom of it,
which is soft whilest it is under Water,
but being once dryed becomes very hard,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103701:86"/>
they use to make counterfeit comfits, <hi>&amp;</hi>
which they call comfits of <hi>Tivoli</hi> and
use to Cheat People with them for sports
sake. The River runs into the <hi>Tiverone</hi>
and spoils the Water thereof, and in my
Opinion, does much harme the Water
of the <hi>Tyber</hi> it self, because the <hi>Tiverone</hi>
joyns with it before it come at the City
of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Town is verie ancient,
having several marks of great Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as <hi>Sybilla</hi>'s Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> close by the
Town the River <hi>Teveron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a great hight over a Rock makes that
famous <hi>Cascata</hi> so much talked of. It
makes a horrid noise and continues fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and working for a good way below
the fall, and hath made a Million of
meanders and strange figures in the Rock
where it falls. A little below the fall there
is a Bridge over it of a considerable hight
above the Water, where if You stand
a while you will perceive a dew able to
wet you, which arises from the fall of the
Water after the River is fallen. Several
parts of it are conveyed by aqueducts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Town for severall uses; as namely
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103701:87"/>
one part for the Brass works, where You
may observe, that the Waeer blowes the
fire, not by moving the Bellowes (which
is common) but by affording the Wind;
an other part of it is carried to the <hi>Villa
d' Este</hi> where there is a curious Palace
and most curious Gardens with all sorts
of Ingenious Water Works and other
ornaments, as statues <hi>&amp;c,</hi> belonging to
Gardens. Amongst other things there
are several Artificial Birds, that sing their
natural Notes by the help of the Water.
There is an Organ that plays sweetly, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
only by the Water, which also fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
it Wind. The <hi>Girandola</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
where the water rises in a gross
Body very High, and the ayr being Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially
mixed therewith, makes a noice
that exactly imitats Thunder. <hi>Tivoli</hi> is
some eighteen or twentie Miles distant
from <hi>Rome</hi> You may easily go from <hi>Rome</hi>

returne the same day to <hi>Rome,</hi> unless
You please rather to goe to <hi>Frescati,</hi>
which is a most delicious litle Toun about

upon the side of a Hill, from whence
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103701:87"/>
in clear weather You may easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Rome.</hi> The Place is beautifi'd with
many delicat <hi>Villa</hi>'s about it, amongst
which the most considerable are, first, the
<hi>Belvidere</hi> belonging now to the <hi>Principe
Pamphilio,</hi> the water works whereof are
esteemed the best in <hi>Italy:</hi> There is a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taur
that Winds a Horne by the help of
the Water, with that Loudness, that
it can be heard at six or seven Miles dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
There is a low Room which they call
the <hi>Apollo,</hi> at the end of which <hi>Apollo</hi> sits
upon the Top of an artificial <hi>Parnassus.</hi>
with the nine Muses about him, he with
his Harp, and they with their severall
Instruments of Musick, which play by
the help of the Water, which is convoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under ground and is not seen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Room. About the middle of the
Room there is a little hole, out of which
the Wind (occasioned by the motion of
the Water underneath) comeing furth,
hath so much strength as to support a
wooden Ball, of the bigness of a Tennes
ball, at half a ell's distance and more
from the floor, without ever letting it fall
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103701:88"/>

from <hi>Frescati</hi> are the Ruins of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>'s
<hi>Tusculanum,</hi> and <hi>Lucullo</hi>'s country

that one <hi>Chariot</hi> may easily pass another.
The Emperour <hi>Trajan</hi> did renew it, and
continue the Pavement even to <hi>Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici,</hi>
drying the marishes, plaining the
Hills, and filling up the Valleyes. By
this way Anciently did pass the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of the Triumphs; whence it
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103701:92"/>
was called <hi>Regina viarum:</hi> whence that
of <hi>Papinius;</hi>

            <p>Appia cunctarum fertur Regina viarum.</p>
            <p>Altho' this way be Ruined in many
places, yet it is wonderfull to see, in how
great perfection a great deal of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues.
Without doubt it has been a
matter of vast Expense to make a way of
that Length, and Breadth so well paved,
with Quadrangular Stones, that even
to this Day (altho' it be of common &amp;
frequent Passage) continueth as intire
as if it were newly done. Upon both
sides of this way, as far as <hi>Capua,</hi> there
are a great many Ancient Sepulchres;
many whereof are altogether ruined,
and some almost intire, as yet; in one of
these Sepulchres, in the Reign of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
VI. (as <hi>Volateranus</hi> tells) the
Body of a Delicat young VVoman, was
found altogether intire in a Marble Chist.
She was of incomparable beautie hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her long Flaxen Hair drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon her Head with a Circle of
Gold. The Body did almost swim in a
mervellous kind of Liquor and had a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103701:93"/>
burning Lamp at the Feet thereof, which
the Air, coming in at the opening of
the Sepulchre, did instantly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish.
The Body (as did appear by the
Letters graven upon the place) had lyen
there thirteen Hundred Years. Some
have been of Opinion that it was the
Body of <hi>Tulliola,</hi> the dearly Beloved
Daughter of <hi>Cicero.</hi> It was presented in
its integrity to the Conservators of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and for some Days keept in the Capitol
as a singular curiosity; but <hi>Pope Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
coming to understand it, caused it
to be thrown into the <hi>Tyber.</hi>

            <p>I must not omit to tell you, that there
is some incommoditie in this Journey
both as to Dyeting and Lodging; and
sometimes there is perill from the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti;
But he that will gather Roses, must
not be affraid to prick his Fingers: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that danger is but sometimes, and
you may probably find the way clear,
especially, if the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> be a stirring
Active Man, as it often happens: For
then the Banditi will hardly dare to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103701:93"/>
come so far down from the Hills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Naples</hi> was Anciently called <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nope,</hi>

Drowned her self for Grief, that She

But it being Ruined, there came
so great a Pestilence upon <hi>Cuma,</hi> as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away Multitudes, and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
the Oracle about the cause of this
Mortality; it was answered that this fate
had come upon them for the Ruine of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenope;</hi>
and that if they ever hop'd to be
free from this disease, they should first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
it, whence with all diligence they
went about the Restauration thereof, and
called it <hi>Neapolis,</hi> that is to say the new
City. The sweetness of the Air, &amp; delicacy
of the Country about is so great, that
many Emperours and <hi>Roman Senators</hi>
being wearied with the Wars, and
weightiness of Government, did repair
to this place, that they might live plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
&amp; Peaceably, &amp; give themselves to
the Study of Letters; amongst which were
<hi>Virgil, T. Livius, Horatius, Claudianus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp; a great many more: At this very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it is no less frequented by the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Gentrie of the whole Kingdom,
who for the most part have their own
Palaces and pass the greatest part of the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103701:94"/>
Year here; so that for Nobility and
Gentry there are few Cities in the World
more considerable than this. I think it
is for this Reason, that it is commonly
called <hi>Napoli la Gentile:</hi> Nor is it to
be passed by, that it gives name to a
Kingdom; which is not very Ordinary.</p>
            <p>The City is big and sumptuously built
from the Sea to these pleasant Hills a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it. It is very well fortified with
strong Walls &amp; Castles, especially since
the dayes of <hi>Charles</hi> V. who built the
Castle of St. <hi>Elme</hi> and called it <hi>la Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
that is, Bridle; intending to make
it so, to the mutinous Humour of that
people, and it may be alluding to the
<hi>Armes</hi> of the City, which is an unbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Horse; the exact emblem of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition
of that people, as witness the
innumerable Tumults and revolts both of
old and late Years made by them. I
confess there is no small occasion given
them by the severe domination of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
over them; and it is strange
that having so many brave and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourous
Men amongst them, they
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103701:95"/>
should more readily agree to submit
their necks to the Yoak of a Stranger,
than to the sweet Scepter of a Native of
their own number and Nation. It is
thought the great emulation, (which the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> as wisely, as industriously keep
up to the hight) amongst the Princes,
who are but too numerous for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Kingdom, is the great cause
of their unhappiness.</p>

was built by <hi>Charles</hi> the first, Brother to
St. <hi>Lewes,</hi> but it was <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>
that fortified it so well. It is of a
quadrangular figure, Built of polished
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103701:96"/>
Stone as hard as Marble; it hath foure
great Bastions, and five Towres, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with strong ramparts, and deep
Ditches, which the Sea water filleth: It
is ordinarly keept by a Garison of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> Consisting of 500. There is a
great Magazin of all kinds of Armes &amp;
Engines for War keept within it. In the
middle of it stands the Governours Palace,
capable to Lodge a King. It is excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furnished with Hangings of silk and
gold, many excellent Statues and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.
Amongst other fine things there is
a Cabinet furnished with all sorts of
curiosities. The Castle of St. <hi>Elm</hi> stands
upon the top of a Rock, commanding
all about it; It's Garison consists of 250.
<hi>Spainards.</hi> It was built by King <hi>Robert</hi>

farr better fortified with great
Bastions by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V. who
called it <hi>La Brillia di Napoli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Castle <hi>Capuano</hi> (so called from it's
situation which is near to the Port of
<hi>Capuano</hi>) is rather a Palace than a Fortress
where the Magistrats of the City,

and Officers of justice keep their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>

the Viceroy; That of the Prince of <hi>Salern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
which the Jesuits now possess, are very
considerable. The Palace of the Duke of
<hi>Gravina</hi> is most <hi>superb.</hi> That of the <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi</hi>
is adorned with abundance of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
statues of Marble and Brass. There
be many other worthie to be seen: as also
the beautifull Garden of <hi>Don Garcia di

Water works, statues <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>7. The Publick Places, the streets, &amp;
the avenues of the Town.</p>
            <p>8. The Suburbs; which are seven in

the Bay; it was sometimes the House
of pleasure of <hi>Sanazarius</hi> that famous
Poet, who gave it to the Religious men

City.</p>
            <p>It will be worth the while also to take a
view of the Book-sellers Shops, there being
many good Books Printed here which
hardly or not all can be found with us;
as for example, the works of <hi>Baptista
Porta,</hi> whereof the Impressions at <hi>Naples</hi>
were both the first and fairest, and the
Cutts for the most part Tailledouce.
The works of <hi>Fabius Columna,</hi> which
are almost out of Print, and especially
his <hi>Phytobasanos.</hi> It may likewise happen
that there are some new peeces emitted
which will never come to our hands
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103701:98"/>
for at least, not tell after a great while. It
is likely too that You may meet with
many other Books, that in other places
You had sought in vain for: there are
many learned and Curious men in this
City, and they are as mortall here as
elsewhere, and as ordinary a thing it is
to sell their Books.</p>
            <p>You will likewise meet with a great
many curiosities of all sorts, espccially
from the <hi>Levant:</hi> some naturall; as
stones, shells, Animalls, or parts of
them, fruits <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others artificiall; some
of Leather, as Purses, Letter-cases, cups,
and a great many things of that kind,
usualy brought from <hi>Allepo</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople:</hi>
Some of Silk either alone,
or mingled with gold and silver; as Sashes,
Girdles, Cravats, Night-Caps, wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats,
stockings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Outlandish Armes,
as Cimetres, Poyniards, Bows and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
with severall sorts of fire Armes.
Medalls antient and modern: Intalio'<hi>s</hi>
Chameo'<hi>s &amp;c.</hi> But in these You must
take some heed, that You mistake not
the modern for antique.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:103701:98"/>
Having well viewed and considered
the City and all things in it. It will be
necessary to see those things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
about it. And first the Hill <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silipus,</hi>
famous for it's Gardens and Houses
of Pleasure, for it's Fruits and Wines,
especially the <hi>greco di Posilipo.</hi> But that
which is most Admirable in this Hill is
the Passage cut quite thro' it. By <hi>Cocceius</hi>

it is certain he must have been a man of
great Riches that durst undertake so
great a work, at his oun expence. It is
called <hi>la Grotta di Posilipo,</hi> and is very
near a mile in length, cutt thro' the Rock.
As for the breadth of it, one Coach may
pass another with ease. And for the
Hight, I believe a man on Horseback will
hardly touch the Roof of it with a Lance;
At the two ends it is some what higher
than in the middle, I think of purpose
that the light might enter the farther.
When You enter at the one end You
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103701:99"/>
will very hardly perceive the light in the
other end, but as You advance it begins
to appear by little and little. In the Just
middle of it, on that side which is next the
Sea, there is a little Chapell, where a
Lamp is keept continually burning, but
it is more out of Devotion than for any
light it gives: betwixt the Chapell and the
end, as it were about the middle on every
side of the Chapell there is a hole cutt
thro' the Hill which serveth for a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
but it gives little light. It is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dusty, especeially if there be many
Horses Ryding together altho' it be paven
with stone, because there comes no Rain
to wash it, and none takes pains to make
it clean. Those that goe from <hi>Naples</hi> to
<hi>Pozzuolo</hi> if they hear any Horses Coaches
or Carts coming toward them, least they
should stop the way, or unawares Justle
one another, they use to cry aloud <hi>dal
mare,</hi> which when the others hear, they
cry in like manner <hi>dal monte</hi> and so
those that goe from <hi>Naples</hi> take that side
of the <hi>Grotto,</hi> which is next the Sea
and these that go to it take the side
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103701:99"/>
next the Hill; and so avoid all incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.
At the mouth of the <hi>Grotto,</hi> upon
the top thereof is the famous Sepulchre of
<hi>Virgil.</hi> There is little remaning of it now
except a few Ruins of an old Brick wall
in the middle whereof anciently there
did stand nine small Pillars, which su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained

            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:103701:100"/>
There are many other excellent Statues,
Base Relieves, and Pictures within this
Church well worthie the seeing.</p>
            <p>When you go to <hi>Pozzuolo,</hi> you must
take a Guide with you to show
you all the considerable Places. It
will be a good dayes Journey because
You have many Things to see
and consider, and therefore you must
part early in the Morning from <hi>Naples.</hi>
The first thing you will meet with upon
the Way, (but you turne out of the
common way) is the <hi>Lago di Agnano</hi> at
the side of which are the Natural stoves
of St. <hi>German,</hi> which are certain little
roomes, where the hot and Sulphureous
Vapors entering from the Ground quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provoke sweating, and is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in severall diseases.</p>
            <p>At a little distance from thence, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the side of the Lake is the <hi>Grotto de
I Cani.</hi> It is a little hole dug out of
the side of a Brae where two or three
Persons scarcely can stand. The Floore
of it is ordinarily wet and dirtie, out of
which there riseth a Poisonous Vapour,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103701:100"/>
in form of Smoak, but it ascendeth not
above a Foot from the Ground. They
use to trie it with Torches and Dogs,
which you must carrie from <hi>Naples</hi> with
you, for you will not find them upon
the Place. As for the Torches, the guide
lights two, and then reaches one of
them to the Smoak, which instantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishes,
as if it were blown out by
the force of Powder: Then he lights
it at the other, and so renews the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as oft as you please, keeping al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
one lighted, untill your Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
be satisfied; as for the Dogs he
holds their Nose into the Vapour, and
instantly they begin to fetch their Breath
thick, and in a very little space are quite
suffocated. If ye let them ly long, they
will never recover, but if ye take them
immediately when they are fallen down
and throw them into the Lake, they will
by little and little returne to live again.
I guesse this Vapour to be so much like
the Damps, that are sometimes found
in our Coal-pitts, only, with us, they
are soon dissipated, but here this lasteth
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103701:101"/>
continuallie, and (which is yet more
strange) in an open Air; but it may
be the openness of the Air is the Reason
why the Vapour ascendeth no higher.
I remember one of our Dogs did recover
without being thrown into the Lake,
which makes me believe, that it is not
any peculiar Vertue in the water (as is
commonly said) that restoreth them to
life, but only the freedom of the Air,
with the help whereof Nature reinforceth
it self, the life being yet not quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
which is cleared by this, that if
they lye any considerable time in the
cave, neither Air nor water will recover
them. It is very True that, That which
was thrown in the Lake recovered much
sooner, and better: whereas the other
remained paralytick, and impotent to
move his hinder quarters: (tho' he could
Sit upon his foremost Leggs and bark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
for almost two houres thereafter. It
seems there is something in this Vapour
or Damp that coagulats or fixes the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that they cannot move or circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat
in the Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:103701:101"/>
From hence you take the Way to
<hi>Pazzuolo,</hi> near to which you will meet
with a Place called <hi>la Solfatara,</hi> it is a large
plaine, Oval in Figure, representing a The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre,
it is above 1200 Foot in length and
1000 in breadth, it is compassed about with
white &amp; high Hills, from which in many
Places, arise Clouds of smoak, of a Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
smell, rolling up into the Air impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
with great crackling. Some of these
spiracles are very small, so that it is a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
to see the Smoake ascend, by a direct
line of the bigness of cane, and sometimes
smaller by much. About these spiracles
you will see Quantitie of the Flowres of
Brimstone sublimed; but I suspect the
internal use of them, because of the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of other minerals wherewith they
may be infected: But for external uses, I
am not so doubtfull, as also of the Spirit
which by the help of convenient Glasses
might be gathered in aboundance from
these spiracles. When you consider the
plaine you will wonder to hear it sound
under your Horse-feet, as you were Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
over a large Floore, which is caused
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103701:102"/>
by the Vacuitie underneath. All the
Hills about abound in veines of Allum
whereof some is scissile; nitre, Sulphur, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
&amp; Salt Armoniac. The Vitriol is of a
Delicat blew Colour and much finer
than that which is commonly called <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Vitriol.</hi>
It will be worth your while
to take particular notice of these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
how they are extracted out of
their mines, what differences there are of
every Species, how they are mixed with
one another sometimes, by what Art they
are purified, and with what Instruments,
and to what use they are put. I would
have you take a Parcel of every sort and
bring along with you, which you may
box up at <hi>Naples</hi> with Cotton, and send
before you to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having done these things, you come
to <hi>Pozzuolo;</hi> in Latine <hi>Puteoli.</hi> The City
is now much Ruined; but was Stately
and Rich of Old. <hi>Cicero</hi> writing to <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi>
saith <hi>quid potui non videre cum per
Emporeum puteolanum iter facerem;</hi> which
is Chieflly to be understood of that part
of the Town, which stood upon the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103701:102"/>
Shoare where the Arti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ans, and chiefly
the Goldsmiths, had their Shops, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there remaines little now except the
Ruins, and Vestiges: And yet beneath
the Church <hi>di Giesu Maria,</hi> possessed by
the Dominicans, when the Wind dryves
out the Sea, they do find sometimes
severall Precious Stones, some cutt, some
uncutt; and if you be Curious to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
you will find People that make a
Trade to sell such things amongst other
Anticails. I remember there came seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of these Persons to our Lodging-House,
with Medals, <hi>Intaglio's, Lucerne
Antiche</hi> &amp;c. But I found many of them
to be cheats, and but moderne, brought
thither from <hi>Naples</hi> and other Places, of
purpose to cheat Strangers, who are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly
more Curious than knowing of
these things; As for Medals, were they
never so Ancient, they are little worth
unless they be well preserved, and the
Characters and impressions easie to be
discerned. And for Intaglio's unless the
Figure be good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and well done, and the
Stone entire and unbroken, they are not
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103701:103"/>
worth much. The great Church now
dedicated to St. <hi>Proclus</hi> was anciently
dedicated to <hi>Octavianus Augustus.</hi> It is
a Sumptuous Fabrick of great square
Marble Stones; serving for the whole
thickness of the Wall, with great and
high <hi>Corinthian</hi> Pillar's, and other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Ornaments of Architecture.</p>
            <p>Here are also be seen many Ruins of great
antiquitie, amongst which she Gardens
of <hi>Cicero</hi> famous for his Academy,
where he wrote his <hi>Quaestiones Academi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae.</hi>
But this City, in diverse ages has
suffered so much by the tumults of Wars,
as also by the eruptions of fire and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
that it is wonderfull there should
yet remain any vestiges of Antiquitie.
The Soil about it is most fertile and
fruitfull, and nature produceth here
many Plants of it's oun accord, which
in other places are kept in Gardens, not
without care: among others I remember
to have seen the <hi>Ricinus</hi> or <hi>Palma Christi</hi>
not only growing wild but out-living
that Winter, and continuing fresh green
and strong in the month of <hi>March;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103701:103"/>
it be an <hi>Annual</hi> Plant with us, that
can hardly be raised upon a hot bed.</p>
            <p>You may have your Horse at <hi>Pozzuolo,</hi>
and hyre a boat to cross the Bay for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the following things, And 1. hard
by the City the remains of that <hi>Superb
mole,</hi> which having been ruined by storme
was afterwards Restored by the Emperour
<hi>Antoninus:</hi> But at present all that Remains
is 12. or 13. great Pillars built of Brick
and stones of vast bigness. They appear so
many towrs, over which there are yet
remaining, but half Ruined, some Arches.
This fashion of Moles seem to be the
best, because the Pillars and Arches are
sufficient to break the water and secure
the Ships within, and by letting part of
the water enter betwixt the Pillars les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens
it's violence, so that the Pillars suffer
not half so much, as if they were one
continued wall. The Emperour <hi>Caligulae</hi>
built a bridge of boats from <hi>Pozzuolo to
Baii</hi> upon which he went in Triumph
first on Horsback and then in Chariot,
but it was of small continuance and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
only to be the subject of discourse in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103701:104"/>
future ages. Having passed these Pillars.
Yov put ashore hard by the <hi>Lacus Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crinus</hi>
which as some said was so called
<hi>a Lucro</hi> from the profit which it yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the <hi>Romans</hi> by the great abundance
of excellent Fish especialie <hi>Oysters,</hi> which
were esteemed before any other in <hi>Italy:</hi>
Whence <hi>Martial</hi> to express the Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of a certain Person.</p>
            <p>Ostrea tu sumis stagno saturata Lucrino.</p>
            <p>But there is little water in it now, it
being almost dryed up by that most Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
eruption of the <hi>Solfatara</hi> which
happned in the Year 1538. the 29. of
<hi>September</hi> two hours after Sun set, the
whole countrey about having been
troubled for two Years before with
Earthquakes: At which time there burst
out in one night so great a quantitie
of fire, Stones, Pumecks, and ashes, that
near to the <hi>monte Barbaro</hi> formerly called
<hi>mons Gaurus</hi> it made another Hill, near
three miles in compass, and almost as
high as the <hi>monte Barbaro.</hi> The south part
of it looks to the Sea, the north reaches
to the <hi>Lacus Avernus,</hi> &amp; on the East it is
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103701:104"/>
joined with the foot of <hi>Monte Barbaro.</hi> It
is called <hi>monte Nuovo.</hi> These ashes did not
only make this Hill, but covered like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a great part of the Country about,
Killing both beasts and Trees, and ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Vintage for that Year. The Sea
in the mean time retired above 200 paces,
leaving abundance of Fish upon the dry
sands, and many Wells of fresh Water,
which sprung here and there.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Lacus Avernus</hi> is about half a
miles distance from the <hi>Lago lucrino.</hi> It
is compassd about with small Hills which
they say were formerly covered with
Trees, that did over shaddow the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and make it look black, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
did hinder the Sulphureous Vap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
that did arise from the water to
dissipat, so that the Air being infected
with these vapours became so noysome
especially to Fowls, that they could not
live in it, and hence came the Name
<hi>Avernus.</hi> At present there is little
or no Wood about it, nor is the Air
any thing more noysome there, than in
other places about, and I have seen Fowles
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103701:105"/>
haunting about it and swimming in it.
It is said to be very deep &amp; for that reason
without Fish but I am not certain hereof.</p>
            <p>3. Upon the west side of the Lake,
cutt into the Hill is the <hi>Antrum Sybillae</hi>
commonly called <hi>Grotta della Sybilla,</hi> but
not truly, for the true Cave of <hi>Sybill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

been a common passage from <hi>Avernus</hi>
to <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ia,</hi> but is now stopt at the one
end by the falling down of the Hill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.
The passage is large and High, but
altogether dark, and therefore You must
be guided by Torch light. When You
are got a good way in, upon the one
side there is a little narrow passage of
about three or fourscore foot in length,
that leads into a handsome large Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which altho' it be now much ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
appears to have been Richly adorned,
the Roof of it being Painted with Gold
and Blew, and the Walls with curious
figures of divers colours and the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
consisting of many small peeces
like unto <hi>Mosaick.</hi> It is a vulgar errour
that this was <hi>Sybilla</hi>'s Chamber, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103701:105"/>
that the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> where she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
her Responses, was hard by upon
the Right Hand as you enter to the Lake;
But it is not so, for the Ruins of that
Place appeare not to have been any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at all, But rather a Superb Bathing
House, such as that of <hi>Baia,</hi> for it has
the same order of Windows, &amp; Spiracles
for conducting of the Vapours. But to
returne to the <hi>Grotto,</hi> upon the left hand,
as You enter into this Chamber, there is
another Passage, some what higher and
larger than the first, about 40. foot in
length cut out into the Hill, which leads
into another Chamber, from which there
is a narrow passage, which leads into
another Chamber, and severall other
little passages and Roomes which <hi>I</hi> doe
not distinctly remember, only this much
that in one of them, there is as it were a
little Pool of Warm Water. In this
Room the heat is so great, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to continue any time in it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
excessive Sweating, which makes me
to believe, that these Rooms were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for no other use than Bathing and
Sweating.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:103701:106"/>
4. The Remains or Ruins; and first
<hi>Bagno di Cicerone. 2ly. Bagno di Tritoli;
quasi Frittoli, q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Entrie to it is large and high. Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
the ground it is cold, but if you stand
upright You must needs Sweat for Heat,
and the farther one goes in, the greater
the Heat is. At the bottom of the Rock
within Sea-mark, and even where the
Sea covers it, the Sand is so Hot that
one cannot lift a handfull of it.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Baia;</hi> So called from <hi>Baius,</hi> the
Companion of <hi>Vlysses,</hi> who was Buried
there. It was a most delicat City, but
now altogither Ruined, and in the place
of it there is a Castle lately Built with a
a Garison of 30. Souldiers for Securing
the Port, which is verie safe for Gallies,
but not deep enough for Ships. The
whole Bay, or <hi>Sinus</hi> of <hi>Baia,</hi> is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
Pleasant; all that Tract betwixt
<hi>Avernus</hi> and the <hi>Mons Misenus</hi> being
full of the Remains of great and Noble
structures. Many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
took great pleasure in this place, &amp;
and spared no cost for the beautifying of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103701:106"/>
it. <hi>Horace,</hi> who was no ill Judge, gives
this Testimony of it,
<q>Nullus in Orbe locus Baiis praelucet
amoenis.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As You go forward from <hi>Baia,</hi> You will
still be finding something worthie the
Remarking; as, 1. The House of <hi>Agrippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
Nero</hi>'s Mother, who was put to Death
here by her Sons Command. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
said to be her Sepulchre, but it is
not true. There is yet to be seen the
Plaister of the Roof and walls in severall
Curious figures, but they are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
by the smoak of the Torches which
strangers from all parts so frequently
carry down with them. 2. That delicat
Pleasant Field called the <hi>Eligium,</hi> so
much renowned by <hi>Virgil</hi> in the <hi>6th.</hi>
Book of the <hi>Aeneids.</hi> All the Noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that lived here abouts, or did other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
attend upon the Court, which did
often happen to be here, likewise those
that for their Health's sake came to the
Bath's, used to walk in this place for their
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103701:107"/>
Recreation and Converse. I am easily
inclined to believe that considering it's
Situation, Prospect, and the Order that
it was keept in, when so many great
Persons frequented it, It could not chuse
but have been the most delicious Place
in the whole World, and no wonder
that it Prompted <hi>Virgil</hi> to Borrow both
it's name and his Conceit in expressing
and describing the Place of the Blessed
Soules Departed. I saw it in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Moneth of <hi>March,</hi> and then
the Heat was considerable, and the
Place not only green but covered with
<hi>Anemonies</hi> and other Flowers. Hard by
this, is the <hi>Piscina Miraebilis:</hi> it is a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
for keeping of fresh Water, of a
vast Bigness, the Roof whereof is support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by 48. great Pillars on everie side.
The whole inside of it is Crusted over
with a kind of Plaster as hard as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which whither it was so made by
Art, or by the Continuance of the
Water in it, I know not, but I think it
probable that both have contributed to
it. <hi>Boccace</hi> in his Book of Rivers, believs
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103701:107"/>
it to have been built by <hi>Agrippa,</hi> for
preserving of fresh Water, for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
of the Navie which used to stay
at <hi>Misenum.</hi> The Water was brought to
it by aquedu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts from <hi>Serino.</hi> 3. <hi>Mons
Misenus</hi> or the <hi>Promontorium Misenum,</hi>
so called from <hi>Misenus, Aeneas</hi>'s Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter,
who was Buried here. It is of a
Reasonable Hight, and without doubt
the prospect from it is Noble; but I
did not ascend it, by reason of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that would not stay for me.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Centum Cellae;</hi> which are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Fabrick built of Brick with great
Art under ground, it seems they have
been Cisterns for Conserving of Water.
In short, all this peece of ground is full
of ancient Ruins, and it is not easie to
Guesse, what every one of them in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
hath been.</p>
            <p>Having vieued all these things, you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
go straight to <hi>Cuma,</hi> or else you
leave it for another Day, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to <hi>Pozzulo,</hi> by the same Boat that
waited upon you from it, and so returne
by Horse, by the lower but plainer and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103701:108"/>
more pleasant Way, to <hi>Naples,</hi> from
from whence the next Day you may go
to <hi>Cuma,</hi> in Latine <hi>Cumae;</hi> a City built
upon the Top of a Hill six Miles from
<hi>Naples;</hi> upon the highest Top of this
Hill stood the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> built by
<hi>Dedalus,</hi> when he fled from the wrath of
King <hi>Minos.</hi> It was in this Temple that
<hi>Sybilla Cumea</hi> did pronounce the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles

            <p>There are many other Ancient Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins
worthie the taking notice of,

The next Day you may take Horse
again and a Guide with you from the
Town, to see the burning Hill, about 8
Miles distant from the Town; It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Latine <hi>Vesuvius,</hi> and in Italian
<hi>Monte di soma,</hi> from the great Plentie
of all things wherewith it aboundeth.
the Hill it self is of a very Large Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
and about the middle divided in
two Tops, of which one is much abated
of its length by the burning. Before
the first eruption of the Fire, it was
much higher than the other, but now it
is by much the lower. It is not easily
accessible both in regard of its steepness,
and the great Quantitie of Ashes that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it every where, by Reason whereof,
the ascent becomes slippery and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
In the ascending, you may take
nottice of many several Channels, some
larger and deeper, some narrower
and shallower made by the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of burning Sulphur and other
Mineral Substances, which Boyled
out at the Top in the last great eruption
it made, which torrents were carried se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103701:109"/>
Miles into the Gulf or bay of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>

the Fishes in the middle of the deep. You
may likeways take notice of the various
Mineral Substances, &amp; Stones burn'd to
<hi>Pumick,</hi> which are scattered over the
whole Hill. When you come at the Top
you will see the great Gulf made by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
eruptions, which is suposed to be six
Miles in compasse about the Brimmes, so
that it makes a very large plain Field at
the Bottom, that in deepness from the
brimm is not above a hundred Yards,
it is all covered with Ashes, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
green in it, except it be some few
Tufts, of I cannot tell what, not being
able to Judge of them at that distance.
The descent to the Bottom at some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
seems to be easie enough, but we
could find none so hardie as to venture
to show us the way, altho' some of our
Guides had undertaken it before, and to
speak truth, it is no great discretion to
venture so far down upon a Ground,
which probably is not able to support
one, being nothing in appearance but a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103701:109"/>
Field of Ashes of uncertain deepthness. You
will see in a Hundred diverse Places,
Spiracles, some greater, some smaller,
out of which the Smoak rises impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
as it were shott out of a Gun, and
with a continual Crackling, like that of
Thunder at a distance, or the quenching
of Fire. When you have satisfied your
Curiositie of seeing all, you must return
the same Day, and take your Horse where
you left him, about the middle of the Hill;
and so returne to <hi>Naples.</hi> It is usuall
for Strangers to light at a Village a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
midway to the City, to Taste of
these excellent Wines, that grow upon
the fertile places of the Hill, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
of <hi>Lachryma Christi,</hi> otherways
called <hi>Lagrima di Soma,</hi> which is a gross
bodied Red Wine, strong and sweet to
the taste, and very pleasant.</p>
            <p>In the suburbs of the Town, as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
you may see the Kings Stables,
where the choisest Horses of the Kingdom
are menaged and keept for the Kings use.</p>

the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> the extream
heat makes Travel very unseasonable.
But if in the case of necessity, such as
Pestilence, or War, you should be forced
to undertake the Journey, you must order
it so as to Travel most in the Night, and
Rest in the heat of the Day, and be sure
not to Sleep till you have passed the

            <p>
               <hi>Loretto</hi> it self is a little Town not very
Ancient, built upon the Top of a Hill,
not above 3 or 4 Miles from the <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick</hi>
Sea, it is fortified reasonably well:
the most considerable thing in it, is the
Church, in the Quire whereof stands the
<hi>Casa S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ncta,</hi> brought thither from <hi>Judeae</hi>
Miraculously by <hi>Angels,</hi> as is beleeved.
This is the House in which the blessed
Virgin is said to have been Born. The
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103701:112"/>
out-side of it is walled about with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
cut into excellent Figures, but yet
so as the Walls touch not the Holy
House. The inside hath continually
Lamps burning in it, some of Gold, some
of Silver. There is in it a Picture of our
Saviour and the Virgin, which they say
were painted by St. <hi>Luke.</hi> The Image
of the Virgin, which stands upon the
Altar, hath a Garment upon it all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Pearles, &amp; upon the Head a
Crown of Gold, enriched with Jewells;
upon the Top whereof there is a Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the bigness of an Egg. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
shown within the House a little
Dish, out of which our Saviour is said to
have Eat his Meat whilst he was yet a Babe.
People commonly bring their Beads, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
&amp; other peeces of Devotion to be put
in this Dish, &amp; to touch the other relicts.
The <hi>Sacristia</hi> is well worthy the seeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Jewels, and other Rich pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
and Ornaments belonging to the
House, which are keept there, and have
been given and offered continualy, by
allmost all Princes and great Persons in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103701:113"/>
Christendom. The Cellar is likeways
worthie the seeing, being exceedingly
Large and full of Wines. Amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
they ordinarly shew one great Tun
out of which they draw 3 or 4 sorts of
Wine, some red, some white. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Pilgrims, and other Persons, that
out of Devotion resort to this Place, from
all the parts of Christendom, is allmost
infinit, insomuch that every Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be a holy Day and the whole
Year but one continued Feast. So soon
as the Gates are opened in the morning,
they begin to enter as it were in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.
I believe there are but few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
in the Town, except a few
Trades-men of all sorts, for the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
of Strangers, the greatest
part are Merchants, that sell nothing but
Beads and peeces of Devotion, such as
Medals of Silver, Gold, Brass, Christal
&amp;c. Books of Devotion, and such like.
There is good Accommodation in the
Town, at a reasonable Rate. The City
is Commanded by a Governour, who
hath his Palace near to the Church.

               <hi>Rimini,</hi> in Latine <hi>Ariminum;</hi> is like to

in it, built by the <hi>Mala-testi</hi> antient
Lords of the Place. There is a Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Arch erected in Honour of <hi>Augustus,</hi>
yet extant, and the Ruines of a great
Theatre. But the most considerable thing
of all is the Bridge, Built of great square
Marble stones, of twentie foot in length
and 15. in breadth, with five Arches.
The Bridge Joynes the <hi>Via Flaminia</hi> and
the <hi>Via Emilia</hi> together. It is said to have
been Built by <hi>Tiberius Caesar.</hi> In the

            <p>
               <hi>Bolognia;</hi> is the second Town of the
Ecclesiastick State, sweetly situated in a
large Plain, near to some Hills at the one
side. The City is near two Miles in
length and one in breadth, and about 5
Miles in Compass. The Inhabitants are
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103701:116"/>
not esteemed to be under 80 Thousand in
number, amongst which it is thought
there are two Thousand Gentlemen,
whereof many have the Titles of Count
and Marques. There is a famous U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity
&amp; many fine Colledges worthie
to be seen: As also many fine Churches &amp;
Religious Houses. The Archdean of the
Cathedral of St. <hi>Peters,</hi> has the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of making Doctors, above others.
In the Church of <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> may be
seen the intire Body of St. <hi>Katharine</hi> of
<hi>Vigri,</hi> a Religious Woman of the Order
of St. <hi>Clare,</hi> that Died at <hi>Bolognia,</hi> in
the Year 1463. She sits in a Chair, with
a Religious Habit. The Skin of her
Face seems to be bent and streacht, her
Eyes open, her Hands and Feet bare:
In one Hand She holds a Crucifix, the
other is placed upon a Pillow. They
use in the presence of a great deal of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
to paire her Nails every Month,
and to cut her Hair once a Year, after
they are grown. In the <hi>Iacobins</hi> Church
is keept the Head of St. <hi>Dominick</hi> in a
Rich Tabernacle, and his Body in a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103701:117"/>
Tomb of white Marble cut in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
figures of <hi>Base relieve;</hi> In the
<hi>Choire</hi> may be seen the Histories of the
New and Old Testament, with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Artifice represented in mosaick of
of Wood. There is also to be seen here,
a rare Peece of Painting, of the Innocents
made by <hi>Guido Reni;</hi> all the parts of
this Convent are worthie the taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, the Cloisters, the <hi>Dormitories</hi>
of above 150 Religious, the Refictory
Painted by great Masters, the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
Shop, and the Bibliotheck, and
the Cellar which is extraordinarly Big.</p>
            <p>There be many fine Palaces worthie
the seeing, and very well Ornamented
within, but especially the <hi>Popes</hi> own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
where the Legat resides, and in it
you must take particular care to see <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovandi's</hi>
Studie, and Collection of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosities,
which are keept in this Palace,
and commonly intrusted to the Legats
Physitian. There is likeways to be seen
in the Back Court <hi>Aldrovandi's</hi> Garden,
in which there are some Curious Plants.
In the Study you will see a great Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103701:117"/>
in water Colours, but without any
description, as also a whole press full of
Manuscripts, written all with his own
Hand.</p>
            <p>There are severall Towres in the
Town, but especially that of <hi>Degli Pisanel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi>
which is one of the highest I remember
to have ever seen; it stands about the
middle of the Town, and near by it
there is an other which is not finished,
and the reason they give for it is very
apparent, that the Builders mistook the
perpendicular; when one stands near to
it, it is so very crooked that it appears
to be just a falling. I had the Curiositie
to go as high in the other Towre as I
could, and rather because I thought I
might more easily discover the situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Town, it's avenues, and the
Country about, but I had much Reason
to repent me: The ladders for the most
part being old and rotten, so that I was in
continuall apprehension of falling, and
one slip would have done my turne as
well as a hundred. I shall advise you
rather to take the paines to see a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103701:118"/>
a little without the Town, toward
the Hills, called St. <hi>Michaele in Bosco,</hi>
from whence you will have a most De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
Prospect of the Town and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
about. The Town appears in the form
of a Ship, and the Towre <hi>Deglipisanelli,</hi>
may be the maine Mast of it. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
is one of the most Glorious in <hi>Italy;</hi>
the Religious are of the Order <hi>di Monte
Olivetto,</hi> there are many other
things in the Town worthie the taking
notice of, which for brevities sake
I omit.</p>
            <p>You must not forget to see the Silk-Work,
which is a most Curious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance;
it is three or four Storie high,
in the Highest Storie there are Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Pirns of Silk, which are all moved
by the generall Motion that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
gives to some Wheeles below,
&amp; there they receive the first Twist; in the
Storie next to that, they receive the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
&amp; in the lowermost Storie the last:
which brings it to that form of raw
Silk that we commonly see sold.</p>
            <p>This Place above all others in <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:103701:118"/>
or in the World, is famous for excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Soap-Balls, of which you will do
well to provide your self abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
they will keep in their perfection
above 20 Years: You may have them
of severall Sizes, bigger or lesser as
you please. It is likeways famous for
Sassadges, which are the best cetain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in tke World: I have seen of them
of 5 Crownes the Peece.</p>
            <p>There is good Herbarising towards
the Hills, if your leisure can permit
you; you may take a Guide along
with you. Upon these Hills, you will
likeways find that famous Stone called
<hi>Lapis phosphorus Bononiensis,</hi> of which <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus

                  </gap>s</hi> hath written a particular
Book. It is very hard and Flintie like,
but more glistering; when it is calcined
48 hours in a reverberatory Fire &amp; then
set to cooll: If you expose it a little to
the light and free Air, and on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
bring it to the dark, it shines for a
little while as if it were a Red burning
Coale, but there is a kind of efflorescence
like Rust or greenish Dust that growes u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103701:119"/>
the Top of it, whilst it is a Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neing,
which is most effectuall for the
shining, and which if it by lost by any
Accident, the rest will not be much
worth, and for saving of this they use or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly
to fix the Stone in Wax in the
bottom of a Box, &amp; so sell them to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
but this way does not secure them,
to my certain Experience. The best way
is to bring the Stone uncalcined and
prepare it at home. I would have you
to see an Apothecarie, who is a great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoso
especiallie in Plants. He is
called <hi>Jacomo Zanoni speciale da san
Biaggio custode de simplici in Bolog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi>
I believe he has Published something
of Plants by this time, for he shewed
me a Number of Brass cutts, which were
allreadie Graven, and told me the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had as soon as he could get the
rest perfected, to cause print them. If
they may be had, I intreat you to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
me one of them; you will do well to
see his Garden, which is very Curious. And
the best way to ingage all such Men as
he is, is to have allways a Parcell of rare
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:103701:119"/>
Seeds with you, and to give them some,
by which means you will find them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to give you whatever they can spare,
in like manner.</p>
            <p>I shall advise you to Visit the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers
Shops, concerning which I must
give you this generall advice, for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out <hi>Botanick</hi> Books, that you take
paines to look them all over your self;
for many times the Book-sellers do not
know their names. You will find here
<hi>Panacea ex herbis quae a Sanctis denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantur</hi>

<hi>Bononiae</hi> 1657. But above all I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you to buy me <hi>Aldrovandus</hi>'s works,
which ate 13 or 14 Tomes in <hi>Folio;</hi> you
may buy them in Sheets, and have them
packt up in your own things for <hi>Venice,</hi>
where you will not fail to meet with
frequent Occasions of sending them for
<hi>London.</hi> I believe they will not cost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
18 or 20 Crowns. and if they do
I shall be readie to allow it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:103701:120"/>
It will not be a miss here, if you think
fit, to go by Land to <hi>Modena, Parma</hi>
and <hi>Piatzena</hi> and returne by the River
<hi>Po</hi> to <hi>Ferrara:</hi> But because I had not the
Fortune to see them my self, I shall not
say any thing of them, but returne to
<hi>Ferrara,</hi> which is not above half a Days
Journie, or thereabouts, from <hi>Bolognia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferrara,</hi> is situated in a large Plain about
half a mile distance from the <hi>Po.</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Ecclesiastick State, and is
governed by the <hi>Popes</hi> Legate. The
Streets, Houses and Places, are very
handsome &amp; fine, as also the Churches &amp;
Religious Houses. In the Monasterie of
S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> you may see the Sepulchre &amp;
Epitaph of the famous Poet <hi>Ariosto.</hi> It
hath a verie strong and well contrived
<hi>Cittadale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence you go to <hi>Venice</hi> by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that is in an open Boat, by a <hi>Canale</hi>
near to the side of the <hi>Po,</hi> where ye im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barke
in a bigger Vessel, which goes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
twice a Week to <hi>Venice.</hi> If the
Wind be favourable, you will easily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
the Voyage in 10 or 12 houres
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103701:120"/>
time, but if otherways, you may be longer,
and therefore you will do well to make
Provision of Victuals, to take along with
you. When you Arrive at <hi>Venice,</hi> it
will be needfull to Lodge in a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Place of the Town, and for that end,
you will do well to provide your self of
a Recommendation to the English Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul;
from <hi>Rome</hi> or from <hi>Bolognia. Giles
Jones</hi> was Consul in my time, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
Lodgers himself, he was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
honest Man, and did faithfullie send
my things to <hi>London,</hi> according to the
address I gave him. When you are set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in a Lodging, It will be time to
take a View of the Town, for the doing
of which and considering it well, 3 or
4 Weeks is little enough. Nothing in
Nature can appear more prodigious than
to see a Vast big Town seated in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Sea; everie House whereof at
one side or another is touched by the
Water, and the nearest Land being 4 or
5 Miles distance. It was built at first u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the little Island of <hi>Rialto</hi> in the Year
421, perhaps later by the Inhabitants of the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103701:121"/>
firm Land that were chaced from their
own homes by <hi>Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Huns,</hi> &amp;
forced to make choice of this place for
their safety; since that time they have built
upon 70 or 71 Isles more, which are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together by upwards of 450 Bridges.
The Town is about 8 Miles in compass.
There are but few Streets built on both
sides, except some open places. The
most part of the Streets have a Canale
or Ditch in the middle, by which the
Gondols pass, which is a great commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie,
for there is scarce a House in the
Town, but one may be carried this way,
either close to it or within a few steps of
it. The Canals are different in breadth,
some more some less large, the narrowest
is broad enough for one Gondole to go
by another; It is remarkable, that the
Water Ebbs and Flowes here 4 or 5 foot,
which is not observed in the <hi>Adriatick</hi>
farther down towards <hi>Naples,</hi> nor in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Port of the <hi>Mediterranian</hi> Sea;
The Gondals are believed to be above
fourteen or fifteen thousand in Number;
they are small tight Boats much cleaner &amp;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:103701:121"/>
finer than Oares upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> having a
prettie Tilt over the seat where the Passin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
sit, &amp; will be able to accommodat 5
or 6 Persons: It is usual for Gentlemen
or Persons of Qualitie to have their own
Gondols, and those Richer than the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary;
some are rowed by one, some by
two, and it is somewhat extraordinary
that the Rower does not sit within the Boat,
but stands upon one side of it, and lookes
the same way that he rows. At the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of any Corner, after they come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
such a distance of it, they are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to cry, to give notice to the Gondols
on the otherside whom they cannot see,
and he that cryes first hath this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that he turnes close by the corner,
and the others are obliged to give him
way and take it larger: And I assure you
it is no small wonder to me that there
being so many corners to tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, and so
continuall and frequent intercourse of
Gondols going some the one way, and
some the other; and in the dark as well
in the Day: there should be so few Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
of running one another down, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciallie,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:103701:122"/>
considering with what swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thay go. The largest Canale, called
<hi>Canale grande,</hi> is about 13 or 14 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
paces in length; &amp; fourtie in breadth,
and divides the Town as it were in two.
The Bridge of the <hi>Rivo alto,</hi> or as it
is commonlie pronounced <hi>Rialto,</hi> is one
of the most magnificent Structures in the
Citie: it consists but of one <hi>Arch,</hi> &amp; yet
is said to have cost above 250 thousand
Duckets; at the one end of the Bridge,
there are three large Streets divided by 2
rowes of Houses, which are so many
Merchant shops. This serves for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
where the Merchants meet about
Noon to do their affairs.</p>
            <p>There are so manie things considerable
in this Place that it is difficult to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
them in this short Narration, and
therefore I shall onlie name a few of them,
and leaue the rest to your particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie,
which will not be hard for you
to make, when you are upon the place.
Be pleased then first to take notice among
the Churches of that of St <hi>Mark,</hi> which

It is paved with Porphire, Serpentine &amp;c.

a great number of Pearles and other
Jewels of price; The Roof of the Church
consists of 5 <hi>Cupula's</hi> covered with lead;
It hath 5 Doors of Brass, and over the

four Delicat Horses, equal in bigness to
the Natural, of Brass Guilded, which at

in all <hi>Venice,</hi> for here you may
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103701:124"/>
see People of many Nations with
different Habits. At that end of that
place which lookes to the Sea, there
stands two Marble Pillars, each of them
of them one Peece, of a great hight and
bigness, at a reasonable Distance one
from another. Upon the Top of the one
is placed a flying Lion guilded, which
is the Armes of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the
Symbole of St <hi>Mark;</hi> Upon the Top of
the other the Statue of St <hi>Theodore</hi> gilded.
Betwixt these Pillars, Justice is usuallie
done upon Male-factors. About the
middle of the place stands 3 verie Tall
Poles like unto Ships Masts, whereupon
the Standards of the Republick are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splaied
at great Solemnities. On that side of
the place, which is opposit to the Dukes
Palace, stands the <hi>Mint-House,</hi> a verie
goodlie Fabrick, composed of Stone and
Iron, without any Wood at all. <hi>5ly.</hi> The
<hi>Arsenal,</hi> which is the largest and best
Furnished in the World; it is strongly
Walled about, and the Sea drawn about
it likeways. There are fifteen or sixteen
hundred Men constantly at Work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:103701:124"/>
Old Men, who are not able to
work, but intertained for instructing
the younger. Here are keept all sort of
<hi>Amunitions</hi> of War both for Sea &amp; Land,
in vast Quantities, and in that good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that I have heard some confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

the</hi> Arsenal, <hi>that were able to build
a</hi> Gally, <hi>and reik her out compleatly in one

a great deal of sharpness in the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and readiness of the Materials.</p>
            <p>There are severall lesser Islands at some
distance from the Town, worthie to be
seen, and particularlie, 1. <hi>Murain</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a Mile Northward from the City.
It is well built and many good Houses in
it; It is in this Island, that all those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Crystall Glasses so much talked of,
and so much sought after throughout
the World, are made. It is observed
here, that the Glass-works succeed
much better on the one side of the Street
than on the other. They have likeways
a great Art of whitneing Wax, which is
observed to succeed better in this Island
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:103701:125"/>
than any other place in or about the City.
There are abundance of Oysters likeways
in this Island; they ordinarly keep them
in Baskets near the Shoare, to have them
in readiness when they are called for,
but in my opinion they are neither so
pleasant, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the <hi>Order</hi> of St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> with a most
Stately and Glorious Church, together
with a Garden and fair Walks, which

Place.</p>
            <p>Altho' a Traveller cannot be alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sure of his times, there being so many
Contingencies that may force him either
to Arive too soon or too late; yet it were
to be wished that a Man might happen
to be at <hi>Venice</hi> in the time of <hi>Carnoval,</hi>
because of the <hi>Opera</hi>'s and fine shows
that are to be seen, and the Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
Musick at that time. In the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
time the great Divertisement is to go
in Gondole upon the great Canale, where
towards the Evening, one may see Five,
or six hundred Gondols touring up and
down, full of Ladies and Gentlemen, &amp;
severalls of them with Musick, both Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

the greatest <hi>Gusto's</hi> imaginable.</p>

to sell in the place of St. <hi>Mark,</hi>
and sometime within the Court of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and in many other corners through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the City. You may meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Curiosities of <hi>Glass,</hi> that are both use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and delightfull. It will be worth
your while to Visit the Book-sellers Shops,
for besides many Curious Books, that
you may light upon here, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of <hi>Botany;</hi> you may likeways find

After I had told him the respect I had for

by his Brother; I am confident were they
Published, they would make a bigger Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume

in Order and prayed him to keep them

Inhabitants of <hi>Venice</hi> use to resort in the
<hi>Summer-Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The River runs not all of a Levell, &amp;
therefore there are three or four <hi>Locks</hi>
or <hi>Sluces,</hi> by means whereof, at severall
places the <hi>River</hi> is made portable; which
otherways it would not be. There is such
an other <hi>Lock</hi> upon the <hi>Canale</hi> of <hi>Briar,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Padua,</hi> in Latine <hi>Pattavium.</hi> Is a very
Ancient and Large Town; famous over
the World, for its <hi>Vniversity;</hi> whence it
is called <hi>Padua la dotta.</hi> There are many
things considerable in the Town fit to be
seen and take notice of. As 1. The
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:103701:127"/>
Churches as namely that of S. <hi>Sophia,</hi> that
of <hi>Justino,</hi> which is all Pavemented with
white &amp; red Marble; there is an <hi>Abbacy</hi>
joyning to it of the <hi>Order</hi> of St. <hi>Benedict;</hi>
the Reformation of which Order did begin
first here. It was Anciently the Temple
of <hi>Concord.</hi> The place before the Church
is very large &amp; spacious. They say ten
Thousand Men might be drawn up within
it. The Church of St. <hi>Antonia de Lisbon,</hi> is
notably designed, and hath many Rich
things belonging to it; many Relique's,
but amongst others the most considerable
is the Body of St. <hi>Antonia,</hi> commonly
called of <hi>Padua,</hi> because he Died and was

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erred here. There is great a Devotion
payed to this <hi>Sainct,</hi> and a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
dayly to the place, as well of the
Inhabitants of the Town, as of <hi>Pilgrims</hi>
that come from other places. They use to
kiss the <hi>Marble-Stone</hi> that covers his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre;
and they say it smels of Musk.
<hi>2ly.</hi> The palace of Justice, which is most
stately. The Stairs are all of <hi>Marble</hi> cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Lead</hi> without the support of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Pillar. The great <hi>Hall</hi> is 256 foot in
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:103701:128"/>
length, and 86 foot in breadth, and very
well painted, and at the end of it, that
Statue of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> whose Tomb is
likeways to be seen in the Town. <hi>3ly.</hi>
The Schooles, which is a very stately
Fabrick, being a 4 square court, where
you will see a great many of the Statues or
<hi>Busta</hi>'s, Names &amp; Arms of so many Consuls,
that have been of the several Nations that
compose the <hi>Vniversity;</hi> the <hi>Scholars</hi> here
have large <hi>Priviledges,</hi> and many times
abuse them, and become very insolent,
insomuch that they have been sometimes
known to threaten the <hi>Podesta</hi> himself
or Governour of the Town; they have,
likeways a beastly custome of carrieing
Arms in the Night, insomuch that it is
never safe to be abroad after it hegins to
be Dark, for many are this way unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pity
Murthered without any Offence given
or taken, but only by wantoness, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Wickedness of the Scholars. <hi>4ly.</hi>
The Physical Garden, which is exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fine, not so much for the number as
rareness of the <hi>Plants.</hi> You may easily
make your addrefs to the Professor that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103701:128"/>
keeps the Garden who in my time was
the <hi>Excellentissimus Signeur Tore,</hi> but the
Gardener will be sufficient to do your
turn, for in giving him a small peece of
Mony, you will command both <hi>Seeds,
Plants,</hi> and all that he hath. We have
a very worthie Gentleman of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
called Doctor <hi>Cadenhead;</hi> in my time
he was Publick Professor of <hi>Logick nel Bo,</hi>
which is the Publick <hi>Schooles.</hi> He is a
most courteous and obliging Gentleman,
and will be ready to do you all the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness's
Imaginable. <hi>5ly.</hi> You may see the
Hospitals for sick Folk, and many other
things, which for Brevities sake I omit,
only I intreat you be at the paines to
Visit the Book-sellers Shops; and if there
be any new thing in Physick, since the
62 or 63 Year of God, I intreat you to

Herborsing upon them. It will be worth
your while, likeways to see <hi>Abbano,</hi> a
Village 3. or 4 Miles distant from <hi>Padua;</hi>
famous for its Natural Baths. At the end
of the Village there is a little rising or
<hi>know;</hi> upon the Top of which there
are a great many Springs of hot Water,
some where of are scalding hot. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is convoyed by little Conduits to
several Houses about, where Baths are
keept for sick People, but the greater
part of it is convoyed the other way by a
trough, where, at the distance of a Musket
shot, it moves a Milne. The water it
self is whitish, having a white slimy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in it, which it deposes every where,
where it runs, and which in process of
time becomes as hard as a Stone; in so
much that the Miln-Wheel, and all the
Wood that is toucht by it, becomes cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
as it were with <hi>Marble;</hi> and if it
be not broken of timeously, it stops the

to <hi>Bergamo</hi> you have a dayes Journey:

It is a little inconsiderable Town. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
we had a Letter of Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
from the Duke of <hi>Norfolks Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-Domo</hi>
at <hi>Padua,</hi> to a Gentleman in
this place, who was exceedingly Civil to
us &amp; sent us a Present of excellent Wine, &amp;
(which was of farr greater importance to
us) gave us the assurance of the peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Countrey &amp; security of Travell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which sometimes is not without the
danger of being robbed; it being near the
Frontiers of the state of <hi>Millan:</hi> &amp; in such
cases, it is usual for Rogues, when they
have done a Mischief to pape into the
next state, where the Laws of the other
State cannot reach them. The project
of our recommendation, was to have
been conducted by this Gentleman on our
way; if there had been any such need.
He willingly profered it, but we, upon
the assurance he gave us did as willingly
deny to accept it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:103701:132"/>
               <hi>Bergamo</hi> is situated upon the side of a Hil,
Fortifie with 9 <hi>Bastions</hi> besides the <hi>Castle,</hi>
which is extreamly strong. There is, as
I take it, in the <hi>Dominicans</hi> a Rare <hi>Bibli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otheque,</hi>
Collected by the great expense of
<hi>Alexander Martinengo,</hi> You will do well
here to exchange all your <hi>Venetian</hi> Money
into <hi>Spanish</hi> Money, &amp; such as will pass into
the State of <hi>Millan.</hi> You have a Days
Journey from hence to <hi>Millan,</hi> and must
Dine at a Place called <hi>Villa nova:</hi> as soon
as ye have Dined, you pass the River
<hi>Tesin:</hi> And then enter the State of
<hi>Millan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As you enter the State of <hi>Millan,</hi> you
will find some Searchers or wayters of
the Custom-House, to whom you must
give some small thing to let your Baggage
pass, or else you may be troubled with
them.</p>
            <p>The State of <hi>Millan,</hi> altho' but small
in extent, is yet one of the pleasantest &amp;
Fertilest places in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Country
is very Plain. The High-ways for the
most part very large and straight, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Hedges,</hi> on every side,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:103701:133"/>
and having Canales of water, for the most
part, on every side; and Travellers have
this Advantage also to meet with better
<hi>Inns</hi> and better accommodation here than
on any other Road in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
are not given to mutiny and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
as those of <hi>Naples,</hi> but willingly
submit to their Prince. It is said that
the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> Governs the Kingdom
of <hi>Sicilie</hi> with mildness: <hi>Naples</hi> with
subtilitie and the Dutchie of <hi>Millan</hi> with
Authoritie. They say likeways that the
inferior Governours of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> only but
Gentlie: Those of <hi>Naples</hi> eat lustilie, but
that in <hi>Millan</hi> they devoure. I have
observed throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> that the
greatest part of the <hi>Inn-keepers</hi> and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verners</hi>
even in <hi>Rome</hi> it self are <hi>Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese:</hi>
as also that the greatest part of the
Masons that serve all <hi>Italy,</hi> are of this
Countrie: and it is a verie great Mark
both of their love to their Countrie and
loyaltie to their Prince, that when they
are not able to get so much by staying at
home, as to entertain their Wives and
Children, and pay Publick Burdens, they
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:103701:133"/>
are contented to live abroad most part
of their lives, and returne that home
which they Gaine abroad; for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
carrie their Wives with them, nor
Children till they be able to Gaine for
themselves: Onlie it may be they make
them a Visit sometimes. The Citie of
<hi>Millan,</hi> which is Capital of the Dutchie,
is one of the stateliest in <hi>Italy:</hi> it is near
ten Miles in compass, but a considerable
part of it, especiallie toward the Walls,
is Gardens. The Streets are large &amp; hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
Many statelie Churches and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces:
But I shall Mark them a little more
particularly as I have done in other
Towns: And 1. to begin with the
Churches, It is said there are above 230
in the Citie and Suburbs, whereof 96
are parochial: 40 Convents of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Men, and 50 of Religious Women.
The Cathedral Church called <hi>il Domo,</hi> is
one of the greatest and most Glorious in
<hi>Italy</hi> except St. <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> It is
intirely built of white <hi>Marble</hi> within &amp;
without, but that which is to be pitied is,
that the design is <hi>Gothick;</hi> it is not yet
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:103701:134"/>
quite finished; but they are still at work,
and you may guess when they are like
to come to an end, they haveing been
up wards of 200 Years at work allreadie.
There are above 600 <hi>Marble</hi> statues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Walls, everie one of which
cost at least 1000 Crowns, amongst which
the statue of <hi>Adam</hi> and St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>
are much esteemed, especiallie the latter
which is thought to be one of the best in
<hi>Europe.</hi> The Pend of the Church is
supported by 160 white <hi>Marble</hi> Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
each of them of that bigness,
that scarcelie can three Men fathom them.
It is believed that they stand not under
10000 Crowns a peece. All the rest of
the parts of the Church are correspondent
in Magnificenee, only it appears to me
to be somewhat darker than need were.
Amongst many other things that are
considerable in this Church is the Body
of St. <hi>Charles Boromeus</hi> in a Chappel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Ground. It hath a Lamp burning
before it, and you look down through
an Iron Tirles from the Church to see it.
You may see the Head and Feet, but the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:103701:134"/>
rest of the Bodie is covered with his pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall
Habit. There is a rich Treasure
belonging to the Church, where you
will see, amongst other things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Silver
statue of the same St. <hi>Charles</hi> in his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical
Habit, with many precious Stones
of great Value upon the Myter thereof.
It was presented by the Jewellers and
Goldsmiths of <hi>Millan.</hi> In the Church of
St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> you may see a Pillar in the
middle of the Church, upon which stands
the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> that <hi>Moses</hi> elevated
in the Wilderness. You may likeways
see two statelie Tombs, one of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Luis,</hi> and the other of <hi>Pepin</hi> King
of <hi>Italy,</hi> both Sons of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great.
Here also you may see the Chapel where
St. <hi>Augustine</hi> was Baptized. In the
Church of St. <hi>Satyre,</hi> upon the great Altar
there is a Picture of the blessed Virgin
with the Babe <hi>Jesus</hi> in her Armes, of
which they tell a wonderfull Story, that
it being placed upon the Church-Yard-Wall,
a certain Gamester called <hi>Massario
Vigonzonio,</hi> being mad to have lost his
Money, struck the little <hi>Jesus</hi> with a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:103701:135"/>
whereupon immediately there
gusht out abundance of Blood, after which
it was placed upon the great Altar
where it is yet to be seen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The Palaces; amongst the rest
that of the Governour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> The Hospitals; which are said
to entertain above 9000 poor People all
the Year long, at the expence of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick.
That which is called the great
Hospital, entertaines alone more than
4000, and so it may, for it has three
Score ten Thousand Crowns of Yearlie
revenue. The <hi>Lazaretto</hi> is a kind of
Hospital without the Walls, It is a large
Square court about a Mile in Compass,
not unlike the form of the <hi>Carthusians</hi>
Houses; that are divided into so many
little appartments. The chief Design
&amp; use of it, is in the time of the Plague:
at other times it stands emptie, only some
few persons that have the keeping of it,
remaine there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> The places in the Town; chiefly

a great Variety of Musical Instruments.
Most part of the Booksellers live near to
the Exchange, but their Magasins are
in severall other places of the Town; you
must be carefull to see them all. You
will undoubtedly find some to please, on
which perhaps you will not readily fall
else where.</p>
            <p>You will meet with many Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in this place, especiallie of <hi>Cristal,</hi>
brought hither from the Alps, and a
Thousand Conceits, most delicatly
wrought of Straw. I have heard of
peeces of <hi>Cristal,</hi> with severall shapes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
within them naturally, as of
Trees, Flees, &amp;c. others with a drop of
water within them, that one might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

It has a Water Miln within it
for Grinding of Corn, which is moved by
the running Water that fills the Ditches.</p>
            <p>At a Miles distance from the Town,
there is a Privat Gentlemans House,
where the <hi>Echo</hi> is so excellent that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats
above 40 times, which you may try,
ether by speaking Loud or otherways with
a Trumpet; but the surest way is with
Pistol Shot, for then you may distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly

            <p>The <hi>Carthusians</hi> have a stately Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery

wihin five Miles of <hi>Pavia,</hi> which hath
500000 Crowns of Yearly revenue;
The Monks use to entertain Strangers
for one Night. The Church is of a

               </gap>ire Men to carrie you down on the
other side of the Hill, because it is a great
deal too far to walk, and the way that
the Horse goes, is farr about, because of
the steepness of the Hill. And yet <hi>I</hi>
mnst tell you that the Hill is three times
steeper and less accessible on the <hi>Italian</hi>
side than on the <hi>French</hi> side. As you
mount the Hill, at first you will find the
soyle somewhat fertile at least wayes for
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:103701:139"/>
pasturage and abundance of Wood; but
when you are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot higher you will find
nothing but Rocks, &amp; Shrubs, here &amp; there;
there is a little beck in the face of the
Hill, where there stands a few Houses, or
rather corbie nests; a habitation which
some People have chosen for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
they may make by Accommodating
Strangers that pass that way, for they
are all Victualing-Houses, and (as I take
it) a Smith or two. When you pass
this and continue still to <hi>Mount,</hi> you
will be about the middle Region of the
Air, and it's a hundred to one; but you
may see <hi>Clouds</hi> enough beneath you, &amp;
it may be the Rain falling from them;
and then you will begin to find it cold
what ever time of the Year it be, and the
the higher you go it will still<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>older, till you come to the very highest
pitch you are to go, and there you will
meet with a little House, in which one
can scarce stand upright, where, if you
have leisure, you will get some Bread &amp;
Drink to buy; they usually have white
Hares and white Partridges to sell, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:103701:139"/>
as usuall it is for Strangers to buy them
for curiosities sake, &amp; have them dressed
at their next Lodging. From this you
have a Plain of above half a mile in
length, which for the most part is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted
with Snow, except in the heat of
Summer and then it will be green in
some places that are most exposed to the
Sunn. The great Pike of the Hill, which
yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> leave upon the right hand as you
enter the plain, is above two miles high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and perpetualie covered with deep
Snow. About the middle of the plain
stands the ruin of a great House, which
<hi>Madam Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al</hi> began to build, but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she finished it or not, I cannot tell;
however I am sure nothing but <hi>omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie</hi>
could make a House resist the Rage
of so much Wind and Storm, as
that Place is Subject to. When you
come to the end of the plain, there is an
other little Victualling House, but it was
Desolate, when I pass'd. You quite your
moulets at the entrie into the Plain, and
take your own Horses, and here you
quite them again, and leave your Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
to wait upon them to the bottom
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:103701:140"/>
of the Hill, the best way he can, and
permit your self to be carried by two
men which came along with you (for
according to the number of the Companie
there comes two for one from the <hi>Italian</hi>
side, as I hinted at before) It is a kind of
Barrow, with a litle Seat, &amp; a back at it, with
two little handles to hold by, &amp; a foot
board for streaching your limbs before
you, tyed at both ends with a peece of
small Rope, that they set <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ou upon; &amp; then
carrie you the nearest way down the Hill,
which you would think steep enough for
<hi>Goats</hi> to climb. They go at the Rate of an
Ordinary Horse trot, &amp; as they go will
trist the stones to step upon, which lye
confusedly here and there, as exactly as
if they were a paire of stairs and yet they
will not fall once in 500 times, and if
they should it would be a fall without
any great Perill. But indeed the danger
on the <hi>Italian</hi> side is much greater;
there being great Precipices on the one
hand, where into, if one should fall it
were impossible to escape, insomuch that
I have often wondred how any Body durst
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:103701:140"/>
adventure to climb upon a Beasts back:
and yet is admirable to see with it what
dexteritie these poor Moulets pick out their
way, where scarce any man could crawle
all four, &amp; how sure footed they are. But
I must returne to the <hi>French</hi> side, where
you may pay off your porters when they
have brought you to your Lodging at
a little Village near to the foot of the
Hill. The ordinarie rate is a Crown a Head
that is, half a Crown to every Porter.</p>
            <p>I have told you the way of passing the
<hi>Mount Cene</hi> at such Seasons, of the Year,
as there is little or no Snow: But in the
Winter time when the Snows are fallen
the Passage is much more uneasie &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe,
especiallie if they be newly fallen,
and the paths not trod; for then it is
not only impossible to go without 2 or 3
Guides, that in case one should drop
throw the Snow there may be more hands
to let fall a Rope and bring him up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
for sometimes that will happen, as
when a Courier is necessitat to pass up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
important affairs, &amp; any of the Guides
chance to mistake a step, he will some
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:103701:141"/>
times slip down 100 fathom or two.
But this is not the greatest Danger nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for in the <hi>French</hi> side, from the foot
of the Hills, you have a whole dayes Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and more through a narrow Valley
with a small River in the middle of it,
which, at the foot of the Mount <hi>Cene,</hi> one
may easilie step over, but it grows still big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
as it advances throw the Valley; being
increased by the water that pours from
everie cleft of the Hills and Rocks, which
are on everie side of the Valley, of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
height, and most precipitious:
The current of the River falling some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to be on one side of the Valley, and
sometimes on the other, for the most
part casts the highway on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
side; So that verie often you
will chance to pass under horrible Rocks
that hang over the high way, and when
the Snow is new fallen and they loaden
with it, the least noise in the World
would bring down a whole Mountain
of Snow, So that if a Passinger were so
caught, you might look upon him as bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
till the following Spring.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:103701:141"/>
But I shall advise you to choose a fitter
Season, and then you will have the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Herborising, for the lower parts
of the Hills are all covered with Trees &amp;
many sorts of Plants, that do not grow
Naturalie in an other Soil. I confess
my Fortune, as to this, was ill; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I past the <hi>Monte Cene,</hi> we had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
deluge of Rain, till I came the length
of <hi>Chamberrie.</hi> But I must not here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forget
to acquaint you with an other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
that had almost escaped me, in
time of Snow: and it is this. When
you come to the <hi>French</hi> side (supposing
the Snow to be frozen and able to bear
above;) there is a singular way of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the Hill, which they call <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masser,
ou se faict Ramasse.</hi> That is to
have a little hurdle of Wood, upon which
the Passingers is placed, with a little bit
of Boord behind it, upon which the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
stands that Guides the way, and so
you come hurling down together, at a
greater rate than the swiftest Horse in the
World is able to go.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:103701:142"/>
I do not remember to have remarked
any thing worthie the troubling you
with, upon the way from <hi>Mont Cene</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
you come the length of <hi>Momilian,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

which is an impetuous torrent on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
A little beyond the <hi>Drac,</hi> there
is a wonderfull Curiositie to be seen; that
is, a Fountain that burneth constantly.
The Fields about the Town are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fertile, and carrie good Wine, but
the neighbouring Hills are so high, that
you may see Snow all the dayes of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
upon their Tops. The Manufacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of Gloves and dressing of Skins of all
sorts is much commended in this City.</p>
            <p>But the most considerable thing in all this
Country to be seen is the great <hi>Charter-House,</hi>
so called because the General of
the <hi>Order</hi> is obliged to Reside here. It
is a statelie Monasterie, but stands in the
wildest place that ever my feet trod
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:103701:143"/>
upon. The Reason they give for choos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this place is, because St. <hi>Bruno,</hi> the
first <hi>Instituter</hi> of their <hi>Order,</hi> did pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
here; It stands very near the <hi>Mount
Chelmount,</hi> being three Miles distant from
<hi>Granoble</hi> by a continual ascent. These
three leagues will take you eight or nine
good Hours riding, for in many places it
is not safe to ride, and you must be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to walk a foot. About the mid-way
there stands a little inconsiderable Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
of 4 or 5 Houses, where it wil be
fit to repose a little; you will get Bread
and Wine, and it's fourtie to one but
you may meet with some good peece of
<hi>sanglier,</hi> which abounds upon the Hill;
being it is for the most part covered with
Trees. When you come within a Mile
of the House, you meet with a great Port
and a Porter to wait upon it, who I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
shuts it in the Night time. Within
the Port there is a Bridge over a great Cleft,
within, which runs a little Rivolet; there
is no possibilitie of entering any where
on that side, but by this Port, from which
you ascend still to the Monasterie, but,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:103701:143"/>
the way is easie, and all within the top<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of the Hills covered with <hi>Oakes, Beeches,</hi>
and <hi>Firr-Trees;</hi> within half a Mile of
the Monasterie or some less, stands their
Stables, Garnels and other Office-Houses,
which indeed are statelie and well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
for there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have lay-brothers
of all Trades that serve to their purpose,
and to this place it is that your Horses
are sent back from the Monasterie to be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eept till your going away, and if by
chance any of your own or Horse-Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
had been broken by the way, or
your Horses lost a Shooe, they will be all
repaired next Morning without your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
it. They have good store of Hay,
and have made severall Closes near to the
Monasterie, (which stands on that side
of the Hill that hangs to the Southwest,
and consequently has most of the Sun
for making of Hay,) having felled down
all the Wood that grew upon them.
When you Arrive at the Monasterie, you
alight from your Horses and then the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
desires you to stay untill he call the
Prefect, who presently comes and informs
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103701:144"/>
himself of your Names, Qualities, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and the Occasion of your coming
(for most part come out of Devotion, and
they be but few Strangers that come for
Curiositie, but however all are welcome,)
which being done he craves you Patience
to acquaint the General, but he very
soon returnes to conduct you to your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partement,
only you must leave your
Swords and Pistols with the Porter at the
Gate. The Monasterie is verie large, and
they have a different apartment for most
Nations. We were carried into one
that was very convenient, being a large
Room wanscoted about with Firr-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ords;
and for Fireing, every Log of Wood
they put on, is like the End of a Ships-Mast.
Our Beds for the most part were
at the sides of the Room within the Wal,
all boorded abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> like a Ships Cabbin;
and for Courtens having two folding
leaves, which you may shut or leave open
at pleasure. Upon our first Arrival into
this Room, we were presented with a
Collation of very good Wine, Bread,
Butter and Cheese; and then a Guide
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:103701:144"/>
given us to conduct us up the Hill, yet
half a Mile further, to see St. <hi>Bruno</hi>'s
Chapel, that stands in the place where
he did his Pennance for many Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as they will more particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you, &amp; as you returne they will let
you see another Chapel Dedicated to our
Lady. By that time you are returned to
the Monasterie it will be time to Supp,
and then according to your number you
will be treated with more or fewer Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes.
We were only six in Companie,
and we had above 30 Dish of Meat, but
there was not above three or four Varieties,
except in the way of dressing; &amp; for that
they are admirable. I believe we had at
least a Dussen of different dishes of Eggs,
all prepared in different maners; the rest
were a few Fishes and <hi>Fritato</hi>'s, for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they never eat Flesh themselves, it
cannot be exspected they should give it
to any other Body within their Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie.
The next Morning the Prefect
conducts you thorow the House, shewes
you the different Apartments, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularlie
to us was shown that of the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:103701:145"/>
               <hi>English</hi> Nation, which they used to Assigne
for them in former times, but now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their defection from the Faith,
they have given it to the <hi>German</hi> Nation.
They show you painted about the Walls
the severall Torments &amp; Deaths inflicted
upon those of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Order</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in the
time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. &amp; Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
They let you see the Church, the <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
the <hi>Refectory,</hi> the Religious <hi>Cells,</hi> the
<hi>Kitchen,</hi> (which is the best I have seen
in <hi>France</hi> after that of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> at <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

and lastly the <hi>Cellers,</hi> which are
well enough furnished, but nothing so
well as those at <hi>Naples</hi> of the same <hi>Order.</hi>
If any Gentleman be desirous to see the
General, and speake with him, it will be
granted him, and he will find him very
Civil. All this being done you Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,
the Prefect waits upon you to the
Gate, where your Horses attend you, and
your Arms are delivered you, &amp; so leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little Drink-Money to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(about a Crown a Head for Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,)
you take leave and returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to <hi>Granoble.</hi> I must only add that
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:103701:145"/>
all this Hill over there is excellent
Herbarizing.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Granoble</hi> to <hi>Lions,</hi> you have a
Matter of 15 leagues, in which there is
little considerable.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Chamberrie</hi> to <hi>Lions</hi> there is 16
leagues, but nothing considerable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the way; save only that within 2 Miles
of <hi>Chamberrie</hi> you have only the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belette</hi>
to pass, which is a very steep and
high Mountain in several parts precipici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
especiallie on the <hi>Savoy</hi> side, yet you
mount that side on your own Horses, and
must carrie along with you from <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrie</hi>
Porters to carrie you down the
Hill, on the <hi>French</hi> side. I think you will
pay but half a Crown for your two
Porters, and you will find them as dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
in their Trade, as those of <hi>Mount
Ceni's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some that have a mind to see <hi>Geneva</hi>
pass the <hi>Alps,</hi> either by the <hi>Mount Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi>
or the Mount St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and so
from <hi>Geneva</hi> either go straight to <hi>Lio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which is a Matter of 26 Leagues, or else
from <hi>Geneva</hi> go to <hi>Chamberrie,</hi> which is
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:103701:146"/>
12 Leagues, and from thence to <hi>Montme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
the <hi>Grand Charterhouse,</hi> and so pass
by <hi>Granoble</hi> to <hi>Lions.</hi> This is all that
occurs to my Memorie at present, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Journey.</p>
            <p>In truth I am very sensible that it might
have been much more accurat, had I
been so diligent as to write of it in the
time I made the Journey, when all things
were fresh in my Memorie. But that
occasion being lost; <hi>I</hi> had no more left
me, but to Recol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ect my Thoughts as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
as I could to satisfie your desire, &amp; the
rather because I am hopefull, it will provoke
you to make a more diligent Inquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all things, and to set them down
Orderly, without trusting your Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
This <hi>I</hi> conjure you to do; and
assure your self, it is one of the greatest
things <hi>I</hi> will expect from you at your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
<hi>I</hi> confess, <hi>I</hi> have been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
prolix in my narration, but, if you
consider the vastness and Fertilitie of the
Subject, you will find few Towns in <hi>Italy,</hi>
of which there might not have been more
said than I have said of them all; &amp; this you
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:103701:146"/>
will easily find to be true if you please to
make a Collection of those Books that are
writen of the Antiquities, and Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
of each of them: For there is scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
any Town in <hi>Italy,</hi> where, you may
not find such Books. However such as
it is I offer it you, and wish it were
better for your sake, for whole service it
was only undertaken; aud if it prove
acceptable and usefull to you, I have
my designe. I shall o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Necessitie of an Extraordinarie atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

Duties of my Profession, which I was Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged

            <p>Postscript.</p>
            <list>
               <head>A List of those Things, which I desire
The Laird of LEVINGSTONE to
procure for me in Italy.</head>
               <item>
                  <p>1. All the new Books of <hi>Physick, Botany,</hi>
and that any way relate to the Historie
of Nature, that have been printed since
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:103701:147"/>
the 64. and of Old Books, <hi>Aldrovandi's</hi>
works at <hi>Bolognia,</hi> together with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he can meet with, that was contained
in the first List I gave him when
he parted from hence, as also at <hi>Rome</hi> I
desire him to buy me a Book in <hi>Taildouce,</hi>
containing all the Antiquities, <hi>Palaces
Statues, Churches, Villa's, Fountains, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids</hi>
&amp;c. in <hi>Rome.</hi> I would have it
of the best, largest and finest Impression;
and if you cannot get them so in one
Book, I would have you take them in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Fashions as you can best find them:
You may inquire <hi>appresso Giacomo di Rossi
a la Pace in Roma.</hi> Also <hi>Caroli Avantij,
Paraleipomena Botanica,</hi> if it be to be
had, for I never saw it, onlie he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
it in his <hi>Notes</hi> in <hi>Caenam Baptiste
Fiera</hi> 4. <hi>Patav</hi> 1649.</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p>2. At <hi>Florence</hi> I desire that you would
remember to procure me a small Parcel of
all the Varieties of Stones you can come by.
The readie way will be to inquire for them
at the Stone Cutters in the great Dukes
Chapel at St. <hi>Laurence</hi> Church, or else
at the Work-men that work in Stone for
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:103701:147"/>
Cabinets at the Dukes Gallerie. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, of these two kinds of Stone that
are most comon at <hi>Florence;</hi> whereof the
one Represents Trees, and Forrests; the
other, Towns and Villages: I would have
of each two or three large handsome
choise Peeces, fitt to be put in Frames. I
would likeways have of those peeces of <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal</hi>
that are extraordinarie for Colour,
or otherwayes that have any Substance,
contained within them; as water, &amp;c. you
may possibly find such, either at <hi>Florence</hi>
or <hi>Millan,</hi> or it may be <hi>Venice</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
where. There is likeways a Stone cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Lapis Fungiferus;</hi> It is a Stone that
being placed in the Ground produces large
Mushroms; I had one of them given me
at <hi>Rome,</hi> but unhappily lost it at <hi>London.</hi>
To the best of my Memorie, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
found about <hi>Praenestae,</hi> commonly
called <hi>Palestrina.</hi> Some honest Virtuoso, &amp;
particularlie <hi>Padre Barilieri alla Minerva
in Roma,</hi> will tell you where they may be
got; I have likeways heard that they
were in many places of the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples.</hi>

3. I humbly desire likeways some parcel
of <hi>Antieails,</hi> some<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>three or 4 of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiche
Lucerne</hi> of the best fashioned and best
preserved. In my time there was 2 or 3
in the <hi>Piazza navona,</hi> that sold such things,
and particularly an Old Man, whose
Name I have forgot, that had whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets
full of <hi>Intalio</hi>'s and <hi>Medales.</hi> I
desire likeways some <hi>Intalio</hi>'s that be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Antique:</hi> the excellencie of the Impression,
and the deepness of it commends them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciallie
if they be well preserved, &amp; neither
the Stone nor impression spoiled. I would
likeways have some <hi>Brass-Medals</hi> of the <hi>1st.</hi>
or second <hi>Magnitude,</hi> that be well preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
There are many things that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<hi>Medals</hi> to be good, particularly, 1.
to be Antique and not Counterfeit. 2. To
be well preserved, <hi>3ly.</hi> to have a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse;
&amp; it is to be observed, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of reverses make different Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
altho' they be of the same Emperour,
or Consul, and of the same <hi>Magnitude,</hi> and
it is likeways to be observed that those Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
who Reigned longest had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Varietie of Medals; As for Reverses, the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:103701:148"/>
best are such as are least common; as for
example <hi>a Charriot, a Triumphal Arch, a Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie
of Warr, a Man or a Womans Head
for the Reverse, two Faces on one side, a
Galey, the Instruments of Sacrifice, an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre,
a Mousolium, an Elephant, a
Lion, a Dolphin,</hi> and many more such that
I cannot remember of; as also a Reverse
charged with many Figures, can never be
ill, nor one that relates any known Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie,
as one that I have of <hi>Titus Vespasian</hi>
with a Palm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>Tree, a Slave sitting at the
foot of it, with this Word, <hi>Judea capta</hi>
for the Reverse thereof. But <hi>I</hi> doubt mine
is only a Copie, and not truly Antique. <hi>I</hi>
would likeways have a few <hi>Chamaeo</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
they be not dear; that which
commends them is to have the Figures
well done, and to be well preserved. The
Pretiousnes of the Stone doth likeways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
much to their Value. In all there,
that is, <hi>Medales, Intaglias, Chameo</hi>'s, <hi>I</hi>
would be content that ye did bestow 4 or
5 Pistolls for me, which tho' <hi>I</hi> confess it
be a very small Summ; yet you may chance
to make a better purchase for it at <hi>Rome</hi>
                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:103701:149"/>
than any where else for a farr bigger.
Lastly, to conclude this Article, <hi>I</hi> would
fain have some of the Ancient Glass, which
through time looks now as it were Opal;
Nothing will commend it so much as to
find an intire vase or <hi>Phiol,</hi> for example a
<hi>Lachrimatory,</hi> such as the Ancients used to
cape their own or their Friends Tears in.</p>

Expensive, you will not allways meet with
the Oportunity, of having them so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
therefore it will be sufficient, if the
Skins (being carefully taken of, and stuffed
with <hi>Flax,</hi> or <hi>Cotten</hi>) be so preserved: But
for the smaller sort of <hi>Insects,</hi> their whole
Bodies will easily preserve; the Guts being
