            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat <hi>Truth</hi> is the <hi>Daughter</hi> of <hi>time</hi> hath been ſaid of old, and is made manifeſt by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie daies experience. What hath been <hi>contrived</hi> and tranſacted heretofore in <hi>Cloſets,</hi> come's now to bee publiſhed by the Actors themſelvs to the view of the world. It hath been long believed by thoſe who took the boldneſs to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thoſe Acts of darkneſs (and by thoſe things that did appear, and were in motion, to judg the things unſeen, and the Principles of thoſe proceedings) that there was a verie good underſtanding between the late <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh Aſſaſsines.</hi> And though at firſt they were to bear the <hi>Odium</hi> of their horrid and ever to bee deteſted <hi>Murthers,</hi> and endeavor of the exſtirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Name and Intereſt there: And for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe were direfully devoted to deſtruction, and marked out and diſtinguiſhed for it by Proclamation; of which yet a ſpecial care was taken, by the late <hi>Tyrants</hi> expreſs Order, that onely fourtie Copies, and no more, ſhould bee printed, and none of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out, without his like ſpecial Order, leſt too manie ſhould know hee had called them Enemies, whom hee intended to make uſe of, as of his good Catholick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for ſpecial ſervice; when the work, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on between them, had once been finiſhed there. And accordingly ſoon after they had acted their <hi>Butcherie,</hi> and made that miſerable deſtruction of the poor unarmed Engliſh, whom the rare government and policie of that place, managed by the <hi>Baſha's</hi> of his Tyrannie, had kept unarmed; (for their better ſecuritie no doubt among inveterate Enemies) And that ſufficient forces were ſent hence by the Parlament of <hi>England</hi> to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57528:5"/>
chaſtize with a juſt retribution thoſe bloodie Murtherers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were like to receiv another reward for their good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to his ſacred Majeſtie, then they had agreed for, and bee like enough to give eye for eye, tooth for tooth, and life for life, They were then preſently taken into his Protection, and a Ceſſation made with them, that they might bee reſerved for the future ſevice they were deſigned unto, namely the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> of <hi>Scotland:</hi> To which ſervice ſom of them were diſpatched, ſo ſoon as by the drawing over of thoſe apoſtatizing <hi>Engliſh</hi> who beeing ſent thither by the Parlament, to whom by ſpecial Act the managing of that War was committed, for reducing that Kingdom to the obedience of this, the reſt of theſe good <hi>Iriſh</hi> could be left in a condition of ſecuritie againſt thoſe few <hi>Engliſh</hi> that remained faithful to their Truſt and Intereſt. And how fairly they attempted, and how neerly effected that conqueſt under the leading of <hi>Montroſs</hi> joined with his Northern and Weſtern Mountaineers, is very well known: when, after ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bloodie skirmiſhes beyond the <hi>Forth,</hi> at laſt, by the total rout of all their forces at <hi>Kilſyth,</hi> there was no place of ſafetie left for any perſons of qualitie that were Covenanteers, but they were forced to ſeek it in <hi>England.</hi> But all this is now diſſembled and muſt bee forgotten; And their good ſouls beeing now as full of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Candor,</hi> as they were once of <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Murther,</hi> are extremely afflicted with a pang of Ingenuitie, to think there ſhould bee ſome <hi>ill-affected Members,</hi> (they ſay not of what bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) <hi>that ſhould goe about to ſow ſedition and diſcord,</hi> they mean ſure (for their Declaration is not guiltie of proper expreſsion everie where) to beget ſome miſ-underſtanding between them who have but one <hi>End,</hi> Namely, the <hi>Scots-Kings</hi> ſacred Majeſties <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;</hi> And they think it a <hi>foul Calumnie,</hi> that they ſhould bee ſaid to have any <hi>particular ends</hi> or <hi>private aim,</hi> but onely are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſingle intention to the preſervation of the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Wee ſhould not much diſpute what they affirm, if they would tell us what this <hi>Intereſt</hi> is, whether the <hi>true</hi> Intereſt of the late King, or an <hi>aſſumed</hi> one; for of the <hi>preſent</hi> Intereſts, Wee ſhall ſay nothing. The <hi>true</hi> one all rationall men, that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with affairs of State, can judg as well as hee could, or as they can; and do believe that it was not for that Intereſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57528:5"/>
that ſo many people of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation were Murthered and deſtroied, and that the Popiſh Religion ſhould bee onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted there. But 'tis very probable the Intereſt that <hi>Tyrant</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded was a perfectly-<hi>Arbitrarie</hi> and <hi>Deſpotical</hi> rule, which hee could finde none, but they, ſo baſe as to bee ſubſervient to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. The reward of their ſervice ſhould therefore bee to ſettle the Popiſh Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to tolerate the practice of that worſhip in <hi>England.</hi> And to com certainly to the End, <hi>viz. Tyrannie,</hi> hee would balk no way; War, Murther, Poperie, all acceptable, all lawfull; onely the neareſt was beſt, and ruled his election.</p>
                  <p>But that they ſhould bee ſuch true and loyal Subjects, as they thus publickly pretend, is a little hard to beleev; Wee muſt therefore examine upon what grounds they became ſo; Old quarrels and inveterate feu'ds are not uſually exſtinct, but upon verie evident advantages and ſignal obligations. 'Tis well known, when King <hi>James</hi> had a deſign to make a <hi>nova Scotia</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> hee was not verie daintie of oppreſsing the Iriſh, to make way to gratifie his unbluſhing begging Nation; whoſe deep ſenſ of their beggerie made them inſenſible of what ever they received; and the obverſation of the dreadful and hated Images of their former ſtate of life kept them in continual fear, that nothing could bee ſufficient to aſſure them they ſhould not again bee as they were: And therefore with a wilde <hi>profuſenes,</hi> which onely the <hi>Scots</hi> call <hi>liberalitie,</hi> hee introduced multitudes of them into the Province of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> into thoſe lands which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> then beleeved they might have deſerved as well, if an Act of grace had reſtored them to the poſseſſion of that which 'twas their ill hap, their <hi>Ancestor's</hi> former <hi>Rebellion</hi> had forfeited. And indeed, by reaſon of his known weakneſs and impotencie in giving, that whole Province was alreadie <hi>poſseſſed</hi> in their <hi>hopes,</hi> and a deſign was laid in time to <hi>have in realitie,</hi> by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome or other to forfeit alſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations there; and accordingly they began with that belonging to <hi>London,</hi> that the ſtrong Town of <hi>Derrie,</hi> and alſo that of <hi>Coleraine</hi> coming into the diſpoſe of the Royal bountie, beſtowed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of an unknown virtue, might alſo bee made <hi>Scottiſh,</hi> for the better ſecuritie of all the reſt: during all the time the <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57528:6"/>
were full of Complaints, and there was no ſuch affection in them to the Royal Intereſt, which was then to enrich his own fleſh and bloud with the donations and diſtributions of the large Patrimonie of their Predeceſſors. And after the late Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant came to rule, while his covetouſneſs was yet chiefly in his eie, the whole Province of <hi>Connaght</hi> muſt bee planted for ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, That is, it muſt bee taken from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> (now becom alſo <hi>Iriſh)</hi> upon the account of ſom forſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by former Rebellions, and in order thereto a ſurvey was made of the whole Province, and there wanted nothing but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution. But upon the coming hither of the Commiſſioners from the Parlament of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the year whereof the moſt part were Papiſts, and who by the Queens mediation were received with ſpecial favor, that whole buſineſs was laid aſide, and there was no more ſpeech of the Plantation of <hi>Connaght;</hi> but after manie ſecret conferences with the Popiſh part of thoſe Commiſsioners, with the effect whereof their fellows were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acquainted, they were received into the Tyrants ſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, and went home with great ſatisfaction of him. And it muſt bee beleeved that it was ſom ſpecial ſervice they were to do, for which hee would give a whole Province, which hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie accounted his own. And the firſt apparent Act of their gratitude for giving over the proſecution of that plantation, and receiving them into ſuch ſpecial intimacie was their Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Aſſaſsination</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to exſtirpate all Monuments not onely of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name, but of every thing of civilitie, that was brought thither by them; and yet, after this, the ſame favors continued to them by that King, and all endeavors uſed by him, to keep them from juſt puniſhment for their perpetrated nameleſs, matchleſs wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; in Compariſon whereof, the <hi>Sicilian Veſpers,</hi> the <hi>Pariſian Nuptials,</hi> and <hi>the Mattens</hi> of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> have loſt much of their fame, and muſt give place in all thoughts of abhorrencie to the infernal actions of theſe Monſters. And the grants after made them in favor of <hi>Poperie</hi> by <hi>Ormond</hi> in his firſt Treatie with them, and thoſe additional ſecret ones by <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> which his own Inſtructions take notice of, as ſuch as were not fit for him publickly to grant by <hi>Ormond,</hi> his Lieutenant, as hee called him,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57528:6"/>
or as the condition of his affairs then ſtood openly to own all theſe things (which to open largely, were the ſubject of a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, and can bee here but touched) do evidence beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction that the <hi>Intereſt,</hi> to which thoſe loyall ſouls do with ſo great candor and integritie adhere, is the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of <hi>Poperie,</hi> as agreed to bee made ſubſervient to the ultimate Roiall Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of abſolute Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>And yet theſe poor Scots muſt bee bored through the noſe with a bulruſh, and made believ that this Intereſt and their Kirk-Intereſt are verie reconciliable in that <hi>Communi tertio</hi> of the King's ſacred Majeſtie. And that they might well enough agree, if it were not for <hi>Ill-affected Members</hi> that would cauſ ſom miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding between them. They would make them believ that at the breaking out of the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> (which they will needs call a War) they had no quarrel againſt the Scottiſh Nation, but 'twas brought on and occaſioned by this partie working diviſion. Indeed 'tis true that for a few of the firſt daies after the beginning of that horrid Butcherie, they did forbear the Scotch Nation, knowing their good natures ſuch, as they would bee content to ſit ſtill, and ſee the Engliſh deſtroied, ſo they might eſcape, there would bee the more room for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of their Nation; And it would bee much more eaſie to deal with one Nation then with both. And alſo for that they knew the Scots had then in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſom formed forces ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that might in few hours have been tranſported, beeing once at the water's ſide, that might have much diſtracted their proceeding, till they had made ſom good progreſs in their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable work. But when they had deſtroied the moſt of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, ſave thoſe in ſtrong Towns, and found that the Scots were onely upon Treatie for ſending of forces, which were not like to arrive ſo ſoon but that they might without danger deal alſo with them, They then let Them, as well as the Engliſh, taſte of their humanitie, as to all their <hi>gudes</hi> and <hi>gear.</hi> And that they did not ſo generally fall upon their lives is not to bee imputed to their <hi>Mercie,</hi> becauſ they knew they ſhould die often, or bee long a dying (and feel themſelvs to bee ſo) by beeing compelled to return into <hi>Scoland,</hi> believing that tranſmigration to bee worſ then that into the other world.

And our envie ſhall never carrie us (againſt ſo evident demonſtration, as their natural diſpoſition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant manner of life hold's out in all their converſ, both among themſelvs and towards others) to denie that they bee deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from a ſtem of ſom hours greater antiquitie, unleſs anie could believ (notwithſtanding their bodies) that they are the Children of that Father, who according to the opinion of ſom good Antiquaries, was creäted before this viſible world. <hi>Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>Scum</hi> are fit flowers for their invective; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Abortion</hi> (for the <hi>Scum</hi> wee ſhal not touch, beeing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly their own) there hath been ſtrength enough to chaſtize them, through the aſſiſtance of God, to whom the crie of blood is aſſcended, and from whoſe moſt juſt and irreſiſtable hand more judgments then one purſue's both them and the whole familie that they pretend to advance. They ſeem to bee ſorrie the <hi>Scots</hi> have no ſtrong holds in their hands in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> but that they are deprived thereof by the ſubtiltie of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Indeed when they began to unite with them by the ſetting on of their Prieſts at <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> under that ridiculous ſtalking horſ of the <hi>King's Intereſt,</hi> it was time to unkennel that vermin. And hee ſhould bee verie credulous that could believ that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would have left them in perpetual quiet poſſeſſion; eſpecially if they ſhall but conſider how <hi>George Monroe,</hi> who had contracted a better underſtood agreement with them, and came with his forces from among them, uſed the reſt of the <hi>Scot's</hi> partie. But this is too much for opening of their eies who will bee blinde; let them go together till they fall together under the ruines which they pretend to ſupport.</p>
                  <p>But their next peng of good nature is verie remarkable, by

the violent working whereof they cannot chooſ but wondrous tenderly take it ſadly to heart, and are full of fear, that ere long <hi>none of the Scottiſh either Gentrie or Commonaltie will bee ſuffered to inhabit in that Province, bordering upon their native Kingdom of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Poor <hi>Scots!</hi> can yee ſwallow theſe Gudgeons? do yee think the <hi>Iriſh</hi> do ſo perfectly love your companie for <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> ſake? or for what other good qualitie is it that they would never yet take notice of, that yee are becom ſo dear to them? Is there never an one remaining of all their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients <hi>Clan's</hi> or <hi>Septs,</hi> that can derive a title to the land in that Province? They were wont to keep their pedigree well enough without an <hi>Herault's-office;</hi> And took a courſ their families might not bee extinct for want of <hi>Progenie,</hi> which were never uſed to bee differenced among them by that nice diſtinction of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Legitimate</hi> children: 'tis hard to bee believed but ſom of their ſpawn would at one time or other pretend a Title, and (notwithſtanding this ſame new <hi>dearneſs</hi> upon your Kings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) had rather have your room, than your companie there; and that they will make you believ too, had they none elſ to fear or defend themſelvs againſt, but the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>

This Declaration of theirs having taken off that mask, And taken away from them the pretence of urging their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for a moderation of puniſhment, or impetration of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, they having barefaced owned another Intereſt, the fate of which they muſt now bee content to ſuffer; which if it prove happie, it is more than it hath been hitherto. And it is not like to thrive much the better for their aſſiſtance, upon whom their black guilt of ſo much innocent blood is like to draw an heavie vengeance from the juſt hand of that God who hath given it for a Law to theſe times, when hee had reſted from puniſhing the cruelties of the firſt, <hi>That hee that ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood bee ſhed.</hi> And 'tis neither their pretences can blinde his All-ſeeing Eyes, nor any of their combinations or conjunctions avoid the powerful executions of his irrefiſtible Arm, by the mightie goings out whereof hee will abate every <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie</hi> that think's to exalt it ſelf againſt the providential diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of his infinite wiſdom carrying on his work, his <hi>ſtrange work</hi> in this laſt period, verging towards the end, and conſummation of all things.</p>

SIR! I muſt not bring you preſently upon the field to view the corps; Rarities are not to bee preſented to the exſpectation in the bud, but full blown: and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Canaan</hi> was more welcom and beautiful for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral March the <hi>Iſraêlites</hi> made thorow the Wilderneſs: and truly that ſoliditie of Conduct, and dexteritie in arreſting alladvantages that preceded the Battel, weigh-equal in my ſcales with the Victorie it ſelf. For my L. Preſident of <hi>Connaught</hi> was match'd with a perſon of as ſignal abilities as this Kingdom afforded, the Biſhop of <hi>Chogher,</hi> a man of a deep judgment, quick apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, indefatigable ſpirit, readie execution; and then qualified with as handſom a compacted Armie to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate his deſigns, as I have ſeen in this Kingdom. Hee was the Iriſh <hi>Adam;</hi> for they ſtood and fell in him.</p>
                        <p>It was the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> that my Lord Preſident ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz'd the forces quartered in the <hi>Laggan,</hi> having ſent Orders to Colonel <hi>Venables</hi> to do the like with thoſe quartered in the <hi>Claneboys,</hi> appointing their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rendezvouz about <hi>Charlemont</hi> with all ſpeed. The Enemie with no leſs vigilance draweth to an head about <hi>Monaglan,</hi> ſeeking to make good ſom quarter about <hi>Charlemont,</hi> whereby to diſappoint the Conjunction of our forces. My L. Preſident reſolv's to advance upon the Biſhop, &amp; to cruſh his Armie before it grew to ſinewey. But what my Lord intended to have don by retale, God ordered for whole-ſale.</p>
                        <p>In this inſtant of time my Lord underſtand's that a Partie of the Biſhops had ſurprized the Caſtle and Fort of <hi>Toom,</hi> which commanded the paſſage, where <hi>Lough Neauf</hi> run's into the <hi>Banna,</hi> and that they had paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a partie of Horſ and Foot into the Countrie of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim.</hi> This was a ſad check; it gain'd time to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57528:10"/>
and divided our forces: for <hi>Venables</hi> was ordered back, to take it in: My Lord in the <hi>interim</hi> marcheth all by the <hi>Lough</hi> ſide on <hi>Tyrone,</hi> both to prey their <hi>Kire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aughts</hi> which lay in thoſe great <hi>faſtnages</hi> of <hi>Glankankan</hi> which were guarded with ſom five troops of horſ, and Colonel <hi>Phil. Mac Touls</hi> Regiment, <hi>Turlough Mac Art Oges</hi> Regiment, and General Major <hi>O Lanes</hi> Regiment: as alſo to ingage thoſe Regiments ſo, as they might not infeſt <hi>Venables</hi> at <hi>Toom:</hi> and accordingly my Lord did fetch two or three preys from them, which gave much refreſhment to his men, skirmiſh't and kill'd diverſ of thoſe Regiments, and return's again to <hi>Draganon,</hi> to let the Biſhop ſee hee would not quit him his ground, though ſingle. <hi>Toom</hi> yield's to <hi>Venables,</hi> after it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood a ſtrong Batterie, and a Mortar-piece upon quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and beeing reintrencht, could not have been gain'd without loſs of Foot, of which my Lord ſtood moſt in need of. The Biſhop's Armie by this time grew round and thick, and my Lord was forced to retire towards <hi>Omagh</hi> for ſom proviſions, which hee had ſent up thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſupplie his forces withal: ſo the Biſhop advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth about <hi>Charlemont:</hi> and now it is an hard game to bring my Lord and <hi>Veuables</hi> together.</p>
                        <p>The Biſhop was too hard a match for anie one of them, although my Lord Preſident with the <hi>Lag gan</hi> forces, and his Brother. <hi>Audly Coots</hi> Regiment of Hors kept the field againſt him, held him up, and dailie with his horſ rode to ſeek advantage upon him; but could neither finde, nor force anie; his quarters were too ſtrong: my Lord perceiving the Biſhop would not quit that ground, out of which there was no forcing of him, (it was the ſame ground that <hi>Owen Mac Art</hi> encamped in, when the General Major <hi>Monroe,</hi> and wee lay about
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57528:11"/>
him with 10000 men, and hee march't away in ſpight of us) and that his proviſions grew low, and his men diſcouraged, that no overture of ſervice could bee made, he retired into the Countrie. Now the Biſhop advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth and keepeth the Mountain-way from <hi>Charlemount</hi> to <hi>Dungeven</hi> (the places the ordinarie Map wil ſhew you) by which means ſtill Venabls &amp; my Lord are disjoyned; My Lord Preſident not able on that ground to ſerv with his horſ, ſent Orders to all the Countrie to put over their goods &amp; remove themſelvs on this ſide <hi>Lough-foyle,</hi> by which means the Biſhops Armie was ſtreightned for Victuals, and the Corn being in the ground the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie ſuffered but little. <hi>Dungeven</hi> only was taken in by ſtorm, and defended gallantly by Lieutenant Col. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaël Beresford,</hi> to the laſt man: Ballicaſtle was as poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron-like delivered: and <hi>Limavaddy</hi> Caſtle, belonging to Major <hi>Philips,</hi> was only attempted by menacing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Major <hi>Philips</hi> having reſolutely burnt all his out houſes, or anie thing that might advantage the Enemies covert-approach. My Lord Preſident encamped on the other ſide of the River of <hi>Strabane</hi> and <hi>Neauf</hi> at 28 miles diſtance from <hi>Dungeven,</hi> twice or thrice beat up his Guards: but the Biſhops Armie was all encamped upon a ſhaking bogg. My Lord Preſident had, upon his retiring from the <hi>Omagh,</hi> commanded Major King with three Troops of horſ to <hi>Eleskillin,</hi> and Major <hi>Read</hi> with 300 foot both to Garriſon the place, and to make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion by falling into their Quarters, and to cut of their Convoyes of Victuals, and the dailie recruits the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop exſpected; which was performed by Major <hi>King,</hi> with much diligence.</p>
                        <p>The maſter-point was all this while how to work a conjunction of the <hi>Claneboye's</hi> forces: for my Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57528:11"/>
if it could bee effected, immediately to put it to a day: and the Biſhop knew not well how to enter the Countrie, or at leaſt feared it, my Lord ſo ordering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that nothing could bee got without fighting, and that upon diſadvantage, my Lord being now upon the Defenſive. There is a paſſage cloſe under <hi>Lifford</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Clanlee,</hi> fordable over <hi>Lough foyle,</hi> though verie much diſuſed. The Biſhop over this intended to fall in behinde my Lord, and ſo to ſhut him out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. This that the Biſhop thought his maſter-piece, my Lord Preſident made uſe of to his deſtruction; for my Lord diſſembled the knowledg of it: and my Lord under pretence that the Souldierie did ſtraggle into the Countrie-houſes, beeing ſo neer, adviſ'd them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire behind <hi>Breag-dough,</hi> another ſtrong paſs behinde this <hi>Chanlee</hi> 3 miles, and made himſelf readie, that aſſoon as the Biſhop ſhould enter <hi>Clanlee-paſs</hi> with his Armie, hee would riſe, and make good <hi>Breag-dough;</hi> ſo that the Biſhop ſhould finde nothing but trouble; and that now <hi>Venables</hi> men being readie at <hi>Colerain,</hi> ſhould march to <hi>Derry,</hi> and ſo ferry over. This was ſo handſomly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, that when my Lords forces ſaw the Enemie at <hi>Clanlee-</hi>foard, they thought the Countrie loſt, when it was the firſt ſtep to his ſafety. The Biſhop, to carrie his intention the cloſer, marched up paſt <hi>Clanlee</hi> to <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane,</hi> as if hee would force his paſſage upon my Lord that way. My Lord ſend's parties over the River, skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſheth, beat's his Horſ to their Foot: ſo the Biſhop retire's as if hee would encamp above <hi>Clanlee,</hi> and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little halt, ruſheth into the <hi>Lough</hi> with Horſ and Foot: at the ſame inſtant my Lord Preſident riſeth, and marcheth to <hi>Breagh-dough,</hi> for which paſs the Iriſh ſtrove hard: My Lord diſpatcheth away to <hi>Colerain</hi> for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57528:12"/>
                           <hi>Claneboys</hi> men to advance to <hi>Derry,</hi> and that hee would engage the Enemie ſo, that he ſhould not return to ſtop them. The Biſhop was verie angrie to bee thus deluded; drawe's all his horſ and foot into Battalia, as if hee would give battell, faceth my Lord Preſident. My Lord drew up his, who had onlie his own Regiment of Horſ, and four Troops of Col. <hi>Rich. Coots</hi> (his other being with major <hi>King)</hi> and about 300. Countrie horſ commanded by Colonel <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> and about a 1000 foot of his own Regiment, and his brother Colonel <hi>Thomas Coots</hi> Regiment, they continued 9 or 10 hours pickering: my Lord Preſident had no reaſon to fight, for hee was ſure to have the acceſſion of <hi>Venables</hi> forces ſpeedily; So the Biſhop towards evening began to draw off his Armie towards the Paſſ: my Lord well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the Biſhop (finding that hee had no ways ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantag'd himſelf) might draw over to prevent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture with <hi>Venables,</hi> fell to a diſpute with the Biſhop in horſ-logick, charging him home with 4 Troops of horſ, which the Iriſh verie gallantly recieved: in it Captain <hi>Tailor</hi> of our ſide was kil'd in the midſt of their Pikes, Capt. <hi>Carchart</hi> ſhot very dangerouſly, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 8 Troopers: the Enemie loſt about 60 men, and diverſ ſorely wounded. The hot charges from ſo ſmall a partie, and in bad ground, made the Iriſh march the mountaineſt ground they could find to Litterkenny, my Lord coaſting by them, and keeping the Countrie under his protection By this time <hi>Venables</hi> foot being about a 1000 are com to <hi>Derry,</hi> my Lord and they are joyn'd, &amp; they advance upon the enemie now at <hi>Litter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny.</hi> My Lord underſtanding that the Biſhop had ſent off a partie into <hi>Kilmacrenan</hi> to take in <hi>Dee,</hi> &amp; to fetch in proviſion, thought it not fit to let the opportunitie ſlipof
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57528:12"/>
fighting him; ſo upon the 21 <hi>June</hi> at <hi>Schear follis</hi> two miles above <hi>Litterkenny,</hi> they both imbattail'd; the Iriſh were about 4000 foot and 400 horſ, my Lord Preſident about 2000 foot and 800. horſe; the Iriſh were in groſs Battalia's my Lord drew up his in ſmal ones handſomly, diſpoſ'd to ſuccour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The forlorns incounter fiercely on both ſides, till at laſt all hands were ingag'd at puſh of Pike, and clubbing of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; the Gronnd was ſuch that my Lords horſ, nor the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could encounter each other, or my Lords horſ charge their foot; but the ſmalneſs of my Lords diviſions, were eaſilie rallied, moved nimblie, whilſt the Enemies groſs of infantrie fought themſelvs into a rout, and at laſt into a flight: but what horſ my Lord order'd for a reſcue, followed the execution, which was as noble a one, &amp; victorious as ever was in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. They loſt all their Arms and proviſions of the field. They have loſt all their Officers and all their men. My Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent hath made a Liſt which I have ſent you, but Sir, 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to know it, for the execution hath been 33 miles from the place hee fought in; for Major <hi>King</hi> being at <hi>Elleskellin</hi> with thoſe Iriſh, fell on by my Lord Preſidents orders ſent to him, upon the defeat betwixt that and the <hi>Omagh;</hi> and hath ſlain manie hundreds, and after my Lord had compleated his Liſt, Major <hi>King</hi> took the Biſhop on the 25 of this moneth and 200 horſ, and ſcatter'd and kil'd all the reſt, who eſcaped the execution of the field: it's poſſible that a fortnight hence wee may know the Officers; But I, who have ſpoken with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected people am certain, that they can not learn of a 100 men eſcapid, and ſom 3 or 4 Officers, whereof Sir <hi>Philem Oneale,</hi> and <hi>Alex. Mac-donnell</hi> (the Earl of <hi>Antrims</hi> brother are two: my Lord Preſident loſt one Captain about ſeven men, Col. <hi>Fennicks</hi> ſhot, Major <hi>Hary Gore</hi> ſhot, Captain <hi>Gore</hi> and Enſign <hi>Gere</hi> hurt with Pikes; and ſom common Souldiers hurt at puſh of Pike.</p>
                        <p>The holds of <hi>Bellicaſtle,</hi> and <hi>Dungeven,</hi> and <hi>Lifford</hi> which they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57528:13"/>
had fortified, they have quitted. Thus God hath wrought a great deliverance, firſt to us in theſe parts, who, certainly if my Lord had miſcarried, had been al put to the ſword; and next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole Kingdom, this beeing the Armado the <hi>Iriſh</hi> relied upon. It was not onely the greateſt ſtrength of Foot this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ireland</hi> had, but that Foot likewiſe whoſe merit they eſteemed much.</p>
                        <p>Theſe were the firſt that began the Rebellion, that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and theſe are they (praiſed bee God) that have ended it. My Lord Preſident is immediately for the field, though theſe ten weeks hee hath been in conſtant action, and I am ſure put to as hard ſtreights to preſerv the Province of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> as ever anie one hath been; and truly an ordinarie ſpirit would have faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the work. His experience is beſt able to repreſent his own wants, though they are palpable enough; no man ever ſerved maſters upon a cheaper rate; and had not the forces under him a cleer apprehenſion of his ſelf-racking to ſupplie them, the affairs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by my dial, would have gon back manie degrees. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, though I have tired you, you would bee content to read another volume to the ſame tune: a ſharp and well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied proſecution end's this work this Sommer, in humane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. How much my Lord Preſident hath contributed to it within this half year, obteining two Victories, in the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>George Monroe,</hi> in which hee ſpoil'd all the horſ of <hi>Connaught</hi> and <hi>Ulſter,</hi> beſides the ſlaughter hee made of the foot; and in this clean one, which left no gleanings but ſuch as Major <hi>King</hi> gathered up, envie it ſelf muſt confeſs. I ſhall onely add my obſervation, The inſtabilitie of my Lord Preſident's friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with this <hi>Ulſter</hi> Armie, for about this time twelv-moneth the heads of this Armie were at my Lord Preſident's table and now their heads are upon the gates and market-place of <hi>Derrie,</hi> a dear ordinarie and great <hi>intereſt</hi> for the forbearance. It ſeem's my Lord know's how to borrow crutches, and then burn them. Sr, I will reſt in exſpectation of a line from you.</p>
