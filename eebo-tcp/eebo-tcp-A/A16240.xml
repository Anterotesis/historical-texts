         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶To the right Honorable and his singular good Lord, the Lord Lumley, <hi>Edward Fenton</hi> wisheth a happy life, with much encrease of honor and continuaunce of the same.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He most ancient and famous Philosophers (right honourable) albeit they neuer had any certain knowledge of God, yet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by hir instinct of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, delt so beneficially with them, that beholding the wonderful power of God in all his creatures, they dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse that there was one who hadde made these things, and with all had a speciall care ouer them: Besides this, after the dissolution of this life, they aimed very neare at the immortalitie of the soule: who in the ende being ouercome with the depth of so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine a Mysterie, as a matter not to be measured by mannes reason, were constrained to leaue of to be curious in the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie after suche questions, and fell to the studie of such things as they thought would serue best to stay their appetite from the attempting of any vncomelinesse, and stirre their minds to the attaining of most commendable vertues. Wherin as they haue left behinde them so great store of necessary precepts, as we can not (so long as we direct our doings by their good discipline) but of necessitie we must tread the path that leades to perfecte happinesse. So besides this (as men reputing it a shame to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in any thing that by trauaile they might attaine vnto) they haue founde out to their great praise and our singular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
<pb facs="tcp:5864:3"/>
and pleasure, the secrete and hidden reason of many things, which nature hath kept vnknowne from vs (as it should seeme of set purpose) to the end we might the rather finde our selues occupied in the search and knowledge of the same. And like as some of them by reason they are ordinary and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, the cause thereof being also naturall, together with the familiaritie and acquaintaunce we haue with them, and that they happen as it were of custome, doe moue vs the lesse or nothing at all to haue them in admiration when they chaunce or happen: Euen so on the contrary part there are other effectes of nature, which when we beholde, they do the more amaze vs, bicause we be not able to comprehend the causes and reasons thereof, but imagine straight way that nature is abused, or at least hath lost hir rule who in dede is alway one and vniforme, and cannot be but one cause working diuersly, according to the diuersitie of hir sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. Touching things supernaturall or aboue nature, we are to think they are not so cald in respect of nature, as though she had made ought by chaunce, wherof she was not able to yeld a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but rather hauing regard to vs, whose weake vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding cannot conceiue hir secrete meanes in working. And therefore we must thinke they haue their proceeding from God or some diuine inspiration, either directly or indirectly, immediatly or by a meane, seing that God oftentimes both to warne vs of his iustice and to punish our offences, layeth his hand and rod vpon vs in diuers sortes, as when we feele the raging whirlewindes and tempests by sea, the terrible earthquakes by land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full flames of lightning, and crackes of thunder in the aire, and all these things without vs. But to come nigher vnto our selues when we feele any distemperature in our bodies, wherupon doe grow some greuous diseases: All which albeit they haue their being and motion by naturall meanes, yet seeme they the rather prodigious bicause they be rare and happen but seldome. But those things which are called supernaturall bicause the reason is hidden from vs, they come by the permission or speciall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, as when we be troubled with wicked spirites

Wherof as I shall not nede to speake either particularly or in general, so seeing that besides the reasons and aucthorities which are gathered together in this slender volume, the writers of Histories in bothe kindes haue giuen out sufficient matter touching an absolute resolution that way, which as I hope may suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Others so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned and glued the one to the other, that by no Art of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were to be seperated.

These things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very liuely apprehended by the Prophet <hi>Oseas</hi> in his .ix.

I will giue them an ouer time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly birth, and their pappes shall be drie, and their roote withered, so that they shall be barren: but if they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to engender, I will then destroy the fruit of their body. The like is confirmed by the Prophet <hi>Esdras</hi> the .v.

people, vnder a forme of diuers beastes &amp; other creatures, yet it is affirmed both by sacred &amp; prophane authority, that the soueraigne and omnipotent God hath giuen him more scoape and libertie of rage against his people, in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than in all the worlde besides, wherof the first was in the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> (a place very famous by report of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories) where he kept his schole &amp; open shop of villanous crueltie, for the space of 1000. or 1200. yeares, drawing the people not only to fall downe &amp; worship him, but also (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his bloudy disposition) he toke vpon him to giue answer to their demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, with constraint for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most part, that afore he performed resolution of their questions, they should honour &amp; perfume his house with incense and quick sacrifice of men, maydes, &amp; sometimes the fathers became murderers of their simple and innocent children, such was the blindnesse of the people, and such the sleight of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile serpent to enchaunt and charme their vnderstanding: wherwith notwithstanding not satisfied, he kept a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon storehouse of filthy gaine &amp; rauenous couetousnesse, &amp; that vnder the pretence of religion, in such sorte, that the most parte of Kings &amp; Monarches of the earth came to worship him in that place, enriching his temple with infinite trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and giftes of precious value, besides a number of stately Images formed of massiue Golde, the same so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging his territorie, that of a little caue or hollow vault, wherin he kept residence at the beginning, within a small time he raised it vp to a huge &amp; proud Citie, wherein he so traffiqued and practised his abhominable trade with Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes and straungers that came from farre, setting such price of the pelfe wherwith he abused the simplicitie of the people, that (as <hi>Diodorus</hi> writeth) there was found at that time of his treasure aboue ten thousand talentes, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (according to the order of our accompt) to six Millions of golde. And now touching the description of the scite or situation of the place where this monstrous enimie to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:5864:8"/>
the life of man, performed his oracles, it was a desert and traggie mountaine planted in <hi>Grecia,</hi> vpon the breache or tip of a high and hard Rocke (out of the which issued a sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur or strong breath) wherupon was hong on high a colde spirite or figure wauering as the winde, and the mouth of this infernal cell did bestride certaine graund paunches or big belied priests, cowring one close by an other, as though they would hatch yong frie like them selues, who recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the aire or breath of the wind, and participating with the spirite and power of the diuell, became as men enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and without sense, braying out answere to the people vpon their demaundes. Thys also gaue further cause of wonder, touching the place, that he was so carefully gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by diuels, that no mortal man durst assaile eyther him or his treasure amassed from so many partes of the world, the same mouing cause of feare to Princes of the greatest power, and also to the mightie conquerour <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who notwithstanding being vpon his conquest of <hi>Greece,</hi> follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing his couetous inclination to enrich himselfe with the spoile of <hi>Sathan,</hi> attempted to pill his Temple, which as he was striuing to bring to passe, that parte of the Rocke where <hi>Sathan</hi> sate in his throne, vpon a sodaine ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and fell downe vpon his souldiers, the Elamente be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to open and cast forth flames of fire, with such terrible threates of thunder and lightning, that those which were vpon the mountayne fel downe, some schortched to death by the vehemencie of the fire, and some torne in pieces by other violence, that (as <hi>Trogus</hi> affirmeth) that assault was the bane of .iiij. thousand of his souldiers, which hapned not only to him, for that the Frenchmen vndertaking the like enterprise vnder the conducte of <hi>Brenus,</hi> who vowing to skale the mountaine and sacke the temple of <hi>Delphos</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was resisted with a horrible quaking of the earth, which so sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and disordered the hil, that the greatest parte fel vpon his armie, and smotheryng who so euer was founde either

vpon or vnder it, whervpon folowed such terrible motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the Elament, with storms, tempests, wind &amp; haile mixed with sulphure and fume of fatal fire, that the most part of the armie was consumed, &amp; <hi>Brenus</hi> himself so sore wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, that what with the anguish of his hurt, &amp; impacience of his repulse, he sacrifised himselfe vpon the point of his sword. The other special place where <hi>Sathan</hi> kepes hys maiestie, vsurping vpon the people with a reuerence as to a God, is yet in being in <hi>Calycut,</hi> one of the most riche and famous cities of the <hi>Indyans,</hi> but after a more strange and hydeous fashion than in the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> for that there he was rather masqued than séene openly, where now (ielous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the honor of his creator) he is séene and worshipped vnder the most terrible and mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strous forme that euer we sée him drawne and painted in any place. And here he hath so surely seeled the eies of this miserable people of <hi>Calycut,</hi> that although they acknowledge God, yet do they worship and reuerence the Diuel with Sacrifice, incense, perfume and erection of Images, as if he were one of the Deitie in déede. And albeit all that Prouince, which is of great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite, together with their Kings &amp; Rulers of the same, are resolued of the vnitie of one God, maker of heauen &amp; erth, with other Elamentes and the whole World besides, yet <hi>Sathan</hi> the father and first founder of all vntruthes, hath so preuayled amongst them with such suttle and sinister per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions, that they beleue that God being weary to debate the causes and controuersies happening among men, hath committed vnto him the charge of iudgement vpon earth, the same inducing this pore and ignoraunt people to think that God hath sent downe that spirit of torment with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to do iustice and reason to euery cause and question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them: they cal him by the name of <hi>Deumo,</hi> whose portraite the King kepes with gret deuotion in his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as a sanctuarie or holy relike, placed in a stately chaire with a Crowne vpon his head after the forme of a Méetre,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:5864:9"/>

And yet is not this all: for their priests which they call <hi>Bramynes,</hi> haue expresse charge to wash this Idol with swéete water and odoriferous balmes: and then vpon the sounde of a bell to fall prostrate, and doe sacrifice: neither doth the King eate any meate which is not offered afore by iiij. of those Priests to the mouth of the Idoll, wherewyth not satisfied with this ambicious abuse and vsurpation of reuerence in the Oratorie of the King, is content (in more derogation of the honor of God) to suffer them to buylde him a stately Temple in the middest of an Ilande, formed after the auncient maner, with .ij. rowes of Pillers, like to <hi>S.

The signes and wonders by which the Lorde foretolde of the destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their City, be those which followe, written by <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> in the .vij. booke of the Warres of the Iewes, and by <hi>Eusebe</hi> in his historie Ecclesiasticall. The first message which was sente them from heauen, was a Comet or bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Starre, in the fashion of a sword, which continued the space of a yeare, casting &amp; houering his beames ouer their Citie. The seconde chaunced the .xviij. day of April, euen when the people were assembled to solemnize the feaste of the <hi>Azimes,</hi> at what time was séene so great a light about the Altare of the Temple, at the ninth houre of the night, that it séemed to them as if it had bene plaine day, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued so cleare the space of halfe an houre.

of those things might be made more manifest, and painted in their true coloures, it is needefull before we passe any further, to declare the causes wherevpon they procéede and are borne. It is moste certaine, that these monstrous creatures, for the most part do procéede of the iudgement, iustice, chastisement and curse of God, which suffreth that the fathers and mothers bring forth these ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations, as a horrour of their sinne, sufferyng them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to run headlong, as do brute beastes without guide to the puddle or sinke of their filthie appetites, hauing no respecte or regarde to the age, place, tyme or other lawes ordeined of Nature, wherein <hi>S.

These be the matters that <hi>Osee</hi> crieth out of in his .ix. chapter, saying: These abhominable doyngs, according to their loues, euen when they haue nourssed theyr children, I will destroy, in suche sort that they shall neuer become men, yea I will plague the wombe where they tooke their beginning, the brests that gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sucke, and drie vp the very root, that it bring forth no more fruit: and if they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And although this monstrous fruite be very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a witnesse of the incontinencie &amp; sinne of the parents:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:5864:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet it is not alwayes true, nor hapneth in one place: for there be many fathers and mothers chaste and continent, whiche bring forth their children defectiue, as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth in his .ix. chapter, of a poore man whiche was blinde from his natiuitie, who hauing receyued his sighte by the mercifull goodnesse and grace of Iesus Christe, was asked of his disciples, whether his owne synne, or his parents, were the cause that he was borne blinde. But Christ wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng to declare to them, that they oughte not to accuse the parentes for the defaultes of their children, aunswered, that it was neither the sinne of hym, his father or mother, but to the ende to shewe in him the wonderfull and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous workes of God. The auncient Philosophers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others, which haue serched the secrets of Nature, haue declared other greate causes of this wonderfull and monstrous childbearing, which <hi>Aristotle, Hypocrates, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedocles, Galene,</hi> and <hi>Plinie,</hi> haue referred to an ardent and obstinate imagination, which the Woman hath, whylest she conceiues the childe, whiche hath such power ouer the fruite, that the beames and Charrecters, continue vpon the rocke of the infante, wherevpon they finde an infinite number of examples to proue the same, woorthy of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the which albeit may séeme but iestes or fables, if the authoritie and truth of those which write them, were not their sufficient warrant. And for a further certaintie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Damascenus</hi> a graue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> author doth assure this to be true, that being present with <hi>Charles,</hi> the .iiij. Emperoure and king of <hi>Boeme,</hi> there was broughte to him a maide, rough and couered with haire like a beare, the which the mother had brought forth in so hideous and deformed a shape, by hauing too much regarde to the picture of <hi>S.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually during hir conception at hir beddes féete. By the like meanes <hi>Hippocrates</hi> saued a princesse accused of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, for that she was deliuered of a childe blacke lyke an
<pb facs="tcp:5864:20"/>
               <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> hir husbande being of a faire and white comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, which by the persuasion of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> was absolued and pardoned, for that the childe was like vnto a <hi>Moore,</hi> accustomably tied at hir bed. Reade of this in <hi>Genesis</hi> vpon <hi>S. Hieroms</hi> questions, without musing or being curious to bring in the testimonies of Philosophers &amp; other doctors, verifying the same by the authoritie of <hi>Moyses</hi> the greate prophete and secretarie of GOD in the thirtith Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where he plainely sheweth, howe <hi>Iacob</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued <hi>Laban</hi> his father in lawe, and therby enriched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with his cattayle, hauing pilled a rodde, and put the beastes to drinke, to the ende the Goates and Shéepe, beholding the diuersitie of the colours of this rodde, might bring forth their litle ones, marked with sundry seuerall markes. Besides these causes spoken of before of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Monsters, the beste learned in the secretes of Nature, haue yet assigned vs others: for <hi>Empedocleus</hi> and <hi>Dephilus</hi> do attribute the same to come of the superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance or defaulte and corruption of the seede and wombe, wherof they preferre diuers similies by the disposition of sundry mettals and other things, which melts and yeldes with the heate of fyre or sunne, for if the matter or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which a man goes about to melt, be not wel boiled, purified and confected, or the moulde be not well cast, the image or effect of such worke will appeare imperfect, hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deformed. The Astrologians (as <hi>Alcabitius</hi>) haue referred these monsters to the influe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the starres, iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that if the Moone be in certaine degrées and coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when the woman conceyueth, hir frute shalbe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous. Euen so <hi>Iulius Maternus</hi> writeth, &amp; after him very learnedly the lawyer <hi>Alciates,</hi> vpon the title and significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these wordes and matters, that sometimes these monsters be engendred of the corruption and filthie vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorie meates, as burning coales, mannes flesh, and other like things that women desire after they haue conceyued,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:5864:20"/>
the which is very contagious and hurtfull to their fruite: whereof we haue a notable example in <hi>Leuinius Lemnius</hi> in his first boke of the hidden Secrets of Nature, in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Matrone of <hi>Belges</hi> great with childe of two infants, who lusting to eate the flesh of a faire boy, whome she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held at vnwares, and fearing he wold refuse hir demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, being pressed without measure of that vnruly appetite, fel vpon him, tearing the fleshe of his hand with hir téeth, and deuoured the same sodainly: Al which the infant abode in respect to satisfie hir longing. And as she returned to play the like parte againe, the childe grieuing at hir crueltie, withstode hir. Wherof being ashamed and full of despite, after she had liued certain days in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual melancolie, she broughte forth two twinnes, the one aliue, and the other dead. Wherupon the physitions called together, to argue vpon the cause of this childe bearing, founde that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of the seconde morsel of the boyes flesh was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion therof. Behold in effect the causes moste frequented, touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bringing forth of monsters, gathered according to the opinion of the best lerned authors, both <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Latins.</hi> Resting yet ouer &amp; aboue al those kind of artificial monsters, who be most familiar to these vacabunds &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certen people, traueling through al prouinces, with diuers abuses and deceiptful legerdemains, wherwith they abuse the simplicity of the people, in getting their money. These masked pilgrims, or rather absolute hypocrites, studying nothing but the philosophie of <hi>Sathan,</hi> as soone as their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be borne, &amp; whilest their sinewes &amp; bones be tender &amp; flexible, with smal force, wil not stick to breke their arms, crush their legs, &amp; puffe vp their belly with some artificial pouder, defacing their noses with other parts of the face: &amp; somtime pecking out their eyes, &amp; al to make them appere monstrous, wherof besides the familiar examples of oure miserable time, there was great experience in <hi>Asia,</hi> in the time of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> as apereth in his booke, <hi>de aere &amp; locis.</hi>

thereunto like the trumpe of an Elephant, all hys backe shagge hairde like a dogge, and in place where other men be accustomed to haue brests, he had two heads of an Ape, hauing aboue his nauell marked the eies of a cat, and ioyned to his knee and armes foure heades of a dog, with a grenning and fierce countenance: the palmes of his féete and handes were like to those of an ape: and amongst the rest, he had a taile turning vp so hie, that the height therof was half an elle: who after he had liued foure houres died, saying only: Watch, the Lorde commeth. And although this creature were monstrous, yet haue not sundry lerned authors failed to decke him with their pennes, as <hi>Gaspa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Pucerus</hi> in his bookes of <hi>Teratoscopia,</hi> of <hi>Hieronymus Cardanus,</hi> of <hi>Munsterus,</hi> and amongst all the rest very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently written of in the Latin tongue by <hi>Gasparus Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius.</hi> But albeit <hi>Egidius Facius,</hi> hauyng made mention of this monster in his booke <hi>de Cometa,</hi> sayth that he can not be persuaded, that a creature so horrible and monstrous shoulde be begotten of a humaine creature, but rather of some wicked spirite.

the most parte of the beastes of the earth were by them brought forth and engendred. Wherefore <hi>Lactantius Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> a graue author, whom <hi>S.

<pb facs="tcp:5864:24"/>
of beasts, beleuing that by the perturbations of their séede, they haue brought forth a great nomber of monsters and wonders, confessing very well: (such as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> hath not denied) that these diuels transforming them selues ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie often into the shapes of men and women, maye vse the works of nature, and haue to do with women &amp; men, for to entice &amp; stirre them to the filthie lust of the flesh, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by that meanes to beguile and deceiue them, as the auncients heretofore haue not only proued, but it is also experimented at this daie, in diuers prouinces and places, that diuels by transforming them into the shapes as afore is rehearsed, haue to do with diuers persons: whereof <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes Ruffus</hi> in his bookes <hi>De conceptu &amp; generatione homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> testifieth, that in his time there was a wicked sprite had to do by nighte with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon woman, being transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into the likenesse of a man, wherupon she becam im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly with child, which when she perceiued, she fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so strange a kinde of disease, that hir intrailes fell from hir bellie, which could not be holpe or made sounde by any deuice of phisicke. He writes an other like vnto this of the seruaunt of a butcher, who being extremelie plunged in the vaine cogitations of filthie and wicked luste, and therby astonnished, he sawe incontinent before his eyes a diuell in the shape or figure of a faire woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with whom he had to do, &amp; immediatly his priuie part &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers were in such sorte inflamed, that he iudged there was burning within his body a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual fier, whereof as I haue brought forth these two examples, so could I iustifie the same with diuers others, written not only by Philosophers, but also by the Ecclesiasticall writers, who confesse that diuels by the permission of God, or rather for a punishment of our sinnes, myghte so abuse both men and women: but to saie, that any such coniunction coulde engendre any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as we haue aforesaid, that is not onely false, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:5864:24"/>
repugnant and contrarie to our lawe.</p>
            <p>And as concerning the Prophet <hi>Marlin,</hi> and manye other like examples, whose natiuitie hath abused very manie, stedfastly beleuing that he was begotten of a diuell, we confesse therein as we haue done before, that his mother mighte haue the companie of a diuel, but that she could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendre is no lesse vnlikely than impossible, albeit it maye be presumed and beleued that she was with child, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the authorities of diuerse histories, approuing therein chieflie the legerdemaine and subtiltie of the diuell, to whom they allowe a certain possibilitie with the assistance of his Charmes to make the bellie swell, troubling and corrupting the humors of the bodie, which women taste in the time of childe bearing, and at the instant of deliuerie he maye so enchaunte the eyes of the wyues and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny assistant, hauing also a strange childe stollen from some other place, to exchaunge for the creature newe borne, that the simple mother may also be persuaded that such concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and generation procéeded of the diuell: whereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the confirmation of antiquities, we haue a familiar example remaining yet within memorie and viewe, in a yong Damsell of <hi>Constance</hi> called <hi>Magdaleine,</hi> in seruice with one of the richest magistrates of the towne, who, reporting to all men in common, that the diuell one night had lyen with hir and gotten hir with childe, was by and by put in prison by the officers, to sée an effecte and ende of hir bigge bellie, the painefull houre whereof being come, after she was pinched with euerye pang, which doe happen to women in that torment, and the women in expectation to receiue the frutes of nature, hir wombe opened, and yelded into the handes of the Midwife cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine yron nailes, thicke tronchions, or endes of knotted staues, glasse, bone lockes of haire, hardes of flaxe, hemp &amp; stones, with other trumperie of lothsom &amp; hideous regard,

wherof the diuel by his coniuration and other hellish arte, had made an assembly in that place, to abuse the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of suche as are apte to repose certaintie in suche vaine and deceitfull charmes: all which is aduouched by <hi>Licostenes Amberlachius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iacob.

And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeare 1530. in <hi>Hollande, Flaunders,</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> the sea so swelled, that it brake not only bulwarks and rampiers, but also vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently caried away both cities and villages togither with the creatures in them: &amp; bisides made all the hauen tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes no lesse nauigable, than the open and main sea: which not only chaunced in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> but also the same yeare the riuer of <hi>Tyber</hi> so flowed in <hi>Rome,</hi> that it mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted aboue the highest towres and estages of the citie, and withal not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breaking down the bridges, but endamaging theyr goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, as gold, siluer, corne, wine, cloth of silke, flowre, oyles woull, and other riches, to the value of thrée millions of golde, bisides the losse of thrée thousande persons, as well men as women and litle childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which were therby smoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and drouned.

haue not made proofe of one more strange sithens the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall floud of <hi>Noe,</hi> than this which chaunced in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> in the yeare of grace .1230. For euen as when they thought them selues most happie, and were banketting, drinkyng, and giuing them selues ouer to all kindes of pleasure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde all the lande, nigh to the sea of <hi>Phrygia</hi> and <hi>Halde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich,</hi> were in one moment so couered with water, and the sea so peopled with men and beastes, crying with pitifull vehemencie, that it séemed by them, that God had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his vowe made to <hi>Noe,</hi> wherein he promised neuer to destroy mankinde by water againe. Albeit the rage was so cruell that men were forced to climbe trées like birdes, others ramped vpon the mountaines, the mothers caste their children vpon the grounde, to the ende they myghte with more spéede flée and shunne the furie of the element. And to be short, the desolation was suche, that there was not only an infinite multitude of men, women, children, and beasts drowned: but that whiche was more to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, the corruption which sprang of the putrified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, after the waters were retired to their olde chanel, so infected the aire with a sodain plague, that the rest which were saued from drownyng, were destroyed by the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable infection therof, in suche sort that the Prouince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned almoste deserte and inhabitable.

And for the most part these flames haue bene diuers times séene of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (with great wonder &amp; terrour to them) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly about the Sepulchers and Churchyardes, and other fat &amp; moyste places, which was engendred of the fertilitie and moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the deade bodies, who were there buried: for men amongest all other creatures, be of a very subtile and fat substance, as is plainly shewed by that which is discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in our time of the Sepulcher of <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> which, although it were made of white Marble both massie &amp; heauie, yet notwithstanding, the fatnesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie pierced &amp; distilled through the said Sepulcher, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the bottome of the pillours thereof.

the fire vtterlye ruinous and consumed, and in the time of <hi>Titus Caesar,</hi> it caste forth such plentie of fire, that it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned twoo Cities, and the smoke thereof rose so thick and high, that it had welnigh darkened the Sunne, making the dayes like to the night, and all the fields therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts were so full of cinders, that they seemed in heighte equall with the trées. Wherein <hi>Plinie</hi> (who raigned in the time of <hi>Vespasian</hi> the Emperour) desiring to knowe the cause of the continual burning of this mountaine, wente to sée it, and approching too neare the same, was at the sight thereof so astonished, that he was immediatly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised with the flame, and his bodye thereby committed to ashes, as you maye beholde in the pourtraite before: &amp; that which is yet fresh in memorie, in the yeare 1538. where it began againe to make so great an irruption, that it fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red al the people bordering vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. We can in like maner bring in amongst these wonderful mountayns, the mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> otherwise called the mount <hi>Gibell,</hi> in <hi>Sicile,</hi> whereof <hi>S.

Euen so that light of the sulphure fell from the height of the sayde mountain to the lowest part therof, the which by a certaine coldenesse coulde not be so wel gouerned, but that running here and there, it burned not only fields, stones, forrestes, but also two villages, and all that it encountred, and the fyre being at this time extinguished, the grounde by that meanes brings forth muche good fruite, and withal is become fertile.</p>

So much is the deceit of the diuel in this world, that men thinking to do sacrifice to their Gods, to deliuer their countrie from captiuitie, make their soules a willing sacrifice to the diuel. Wherwith en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding these earthquakes, it resteth now to shew y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> causes of their beginning. <hi>Aristotle, Plinie,</hi> and generally all those who haue treated of the motion of the earth, attribute the causes of that euil fortune to the vapours and exhalations which be inclosed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intrailles of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, by whose force
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5864:41"/>
searching to euente and to come forth, the earth is moued and stirred, which is of power in some places to dissunder strong walles and buyldyngs, and make them fall into the earth: and in some place it leaueth a hollowe hole or caue, like to that in <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof we made mention: someti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes these fires issue before any assault or warning giuen, where diuers tymes at the very same instant, may bée hearde an horrible sounde and murmure, like to the mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings or clamors of men, accordyng to the quantitie of the matter which is shaken, or the forume of the caue by the which the vapour passeth, leauyng sometimes a caue which sheweth the thyng swallowed: and sometimes the earth is made so firme sodainly, that they can finde no token therof, and at other times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth whole villages, swallowyng somtimes the most part of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.

Amongest the most riche &amp; precious treasures which the earth bred in hir intrailles, or caste vp for the vse of man, the Diamont deserues moste estimation, who besides his violent clearenesse which of it selfe hath power to dimme our eyes as if it were the sodaine flashe of a thunder, is of a hardnesse so infringible, that it resistes not only the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or stroke of other mettall, but it is also inuincible againste fire or flame. <hi>Plinie</hi> in his last booke of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall histories writes, that in his time, the Diamo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was not founde but in the Courtes of Princes, and that very rarely: but nowe nature, which since his age is become more bountifull, doth yelde vs such plentie of it, that there is not so meane a marchaunt mans wife at this day, whose fingers are not decked with that Iewell. <hi>Ezechiel</hi> and <hi>Zacharie,</hi> twoo of the moste famous Prophetes in the Churche of GOD, haue gyuen greate honour to this stone, and not without cause, for besides his common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties to withstande venom, poyson, charmes, dreames,

You may discerne the true &amp; perfect from the false &amp; corrupte, by the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the eye, lime, substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; touch: by the view, bycause the clerenesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true stone is more shining, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; of greater contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the eye,
<pb facs="tcp:5864:49"/>
and not so dym or dull by the light of the candle, as that which is formed of artificial matter, the same in deed being the beste meane to trye a perfect stone. They are also knowen by their lyme, being of force to resiste the liuelye temper, so that, that hardnesse cannot be counterfeited by any artificiall imitation. The thirde iudgement of stones is by their substance &amp; touche, bicause they be more lighte and cold than those that be imperfect: which is a direct ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience amongest the <hi>Indians,</hi> who being the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Lapidaries</hi> of the worlde, do proue them by the touch of the tong, buying such for the best as they finde moste cold. There be also certaine precious stones founde in the bellies of beastes, which <hi>Georgius Agricola</hi> witnesseth by a stone called <hi>Alectorius,</hi> founde in the intralles of olde ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, whereof also <hi>Plinie</hi> makes mention, speaking of the conqueste of <hi>Milo Crotoniatos.</hi> In an other cuntrie of the <hi>Indians</hi> is founde a stone in the heades of olde and greate toades, which they call <hi>Borax</hi> or <hi>Stelon,</hi> which <hi>Brasauolus</hi> approueth, is most commonly founde in the head of a hee toade, and yet is of opinion that it is rather a boane than a stone, which some affirme to be of power to repulse poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and that it is a moste soueraigne medecine for the stone. There is a certaine stone founde within the gall of an oxe, and the same in ordinarie practise of phisike at this daye in <hi>Turkie:</hi> some such be founde in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> but not so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon. There is a late writer of phisike who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that not long since there was a stone founde in the bladder of a mans gall, infected with leprosie: which I maye boldly affirme with the like, for that I saw in <hi>Paris,</hi> an Anotomie of a mans bodie, dead vppon the disease of the stone, which had in his bladder a stone as bigge as a pigeons egge. There be stones ingendred in the heades of fishes, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> writes of the <hi>Maigre</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, which I reserue (as I said afore) to describe more plentifull hereafter, treating lastlye and for ende of our

disputation, of stones of the vertue of the Adamant, which hath so amazed many of oure late Philosophers, that they doubt not to beleue, that it hath both vital motion and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for want of knowledge of the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie and condition of this stone, haue bene so troubled in their nauigation, that they haue not bene able to discouer either countrey or companie on the sea, whether it were in peace or warre, but by iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Sun or starres: but now that God hath more plentifully set abroache the vessell of his grace by the benefite of the Adamant, naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is both so easy and so plaine, that a man of meane courage or skill may be bolde to proue the perill of the sea, and hazarde him self and goodes in a little pinnysse against all assaultes and daungers of stormes, whiche the Elders durst not doe, because their néedle and quadrante was not tipped or wrought with the Adamant stone: in whome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so are found two vertues of a contrary disposition, for one of the endes maketh the néedle beholde alwayes the north, and the other the south. He that firste founde oute the vse of this stone was named <hi>Flauius,</hi> but the first that wrote of his vertue was <hi>Albertus Magnus. Aristotle</hi> knewe well that it was of a nature attractiue, and coulde drawe yron vnto it, but yet he was ignoraunt to vse it in the Arte of Nauigation: for if he had vnderstoode so farre of it, he had preuented a numbre of miserable shipwracks and daungers of sea, which ouerwhelmed his countreyme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for want of direction by vertue of this stone. Neither was it without cause that <hi>Plinie</hi> (giuing singular estimation to this stone) did forme his cruell complaints against nature in that she was not onely contente to gyue a voyce vnto rocks to send or returne certain cries and calles in maner of an <hi>Eccho,</hi> but also to giue feelyng, motion, and hands to stones, as to the Adamant, wherwith he smelleth and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth yron, and séemeth to be iealous when any offereth to take it from him: he not only allureth yron, and holdeth it
<pb facs="tcp:5864:50"/>
when he hath it, but also is contented to imparte and transferre hys vertue to any thyng that toucheth it, which hath not bene onely an experience among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, but <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> hym selfe confesseth to haue seene the Adamant drawe vnto it a ryng of yron, whiche being rubbed or touched with the Adamant, drew another ring, and so the thirde drew the fourth, and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in suche number, as he made a large coller of rings in the forme of a chaine, by the only ayde and touche of thys stone, such is his propretie and such his wonderful vertue, whiche also hath bene verified by many familiar experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and chiefly by a late triall, whiche I sawe in <hi>Fraunce</hi> in this sorte: There was a knife layd vpon a square thick table, and vnderneath the bourde was helde in a mans hande, a piece of an excellent good Adamant, whose vertue piercing thorough the table that was betwene it and the mettall, made the knife moue &amp; turne alone, to the great wonder of the assistantes. These propreties of the Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant be common, therefore we will syft out of it a more secrete wonder, whyche wyth the profite may also bring pleasure to the Reader. There is nowe a dayes a kinde of Adamant which draweth vnto it fleshe, and the same so strongly, that it hath power to knit and tie together two mouthes of contrary persons, and drawe the hearte of a man out of hys body withoute offendyng any parte of hym, wyth thys further propretie, that yf the poynte of a néedle be touched or tempered wyth it, it pierceth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe all the partes of the bodye, wythoute doyng any harme, whyche woulde not séeme credible, were it not that Experience dyd warraunt it wyth greate wonder. <hi>Hieronymus Cardanus</hi> writeth, that a Physition of <hi>Tours</hi> called <hi>Laurentius Crascus,</hi> had of this stone promised by the meane of the same to penetrate any fleshe wythoute griefe or sorrowe: whiche <hi>Cardanus</hi> did eyther doubte or lightly beléeue tyll the experience assured the effect, for he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:5864:50"/>
rubbed a néedle with this Adamant, &amp; then put it thorough his arme, where he let it remaine without any sorow ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days after, but that which maketh this experience and vertue of the Adamant more famous, is, that he respected neither veins nor sinews, but thrust in his néedles or yro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s indifferently without sparyng any place. This Adamant which he had, excéeded not the bignesse of a beane, and was of colour like yron, distinct of veynes, and peysing aboute the weight of .xij. graines of corne. By this Admant many people were deceyued, like as also it was the occasion to entertain an errour amongst many persons, which myne author confesseth to haue séene by experience about .xv or xvj. yeres past, being in the vniuersitie of <hi>Poyctiers,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came in great pomp a stranger, naming him self to be a <hi>Greeke</hi> borne, who in the presence of the people, gaue him self many and great blowes with a dagger, both vpon his thighes, armes, &amp; almost euery part of his body, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rubbed with a certain oyle, which he called the oyle of <hi>Balsamyn,</hi> it did so refresh &amp; consolidate his hurts, as if the yron had neuer touched the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ther is also at this day in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> one <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Verona,</hi> who practised the like artificial experience with his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, who pinched them in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the people, with pinsers, tongs, daggers, and other tormenting instruments, and that with such horrour, that it greued the eyes of the assistants, and then rubbing theyr woundes with a certaine oyle, he made them hole agayne presently, which so abused the simplicitie of the assistants, that they bought of his oyle, which he assured to be as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to all kinde of diseases what soeuer, whiche was suche a gaine to him, that there scaped no daye wherein he gat not tenne or twelue crownes aboue his hire for the cure of those that were sicke. The mysterie whereof, dyd driue <hi>Cardanus</hi> into such a wonder, that he was very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to searche the cause: and falling for that matter into an intricate <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of Philosophie, he coulde not fynde
<pb facs="tcp:5864:51"/>
nor giue any other reason of it, than that the people were enchaunted: touching the oyle whiche he solde, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he fained to heale his seruant being hurt, he confessed it was a fiction and a thing nothing worth, for that those that bought it of him, coulde do no cure on themselues, or any other. And now to drawe to ende and resolution of al these things, it is moste like, that this <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of <hi>Verona,</hi> and all the rest that haue bene seene to cutte and teare their flesh in peces in sundry parts of the world, dyd not heale them by eyther theyr oyles or balmes (as they fayne) but it is more likely they rubbe their dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, pinsers, and instrumentes wherewith they hurte them wyth this seconde kynde of Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, the same hauyng a certayne se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete and hydden vertue to consoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date that part that is hurt, and to resist all sorow and griefe in the wounde: wherein for a more credite I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende you to the authoritie of <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> in his seconde Booke <hi>De Secretis orb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Who desireth to haue a more large des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of this fishe, let him read <hi>Rondelet</hi> in his first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his vj. booke, wher he affirmeth this fish to be so called by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his colour, greatnesse in proporcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; pinions like to a balde Mouse, yet (saith he) who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidereth thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this fishe, and maner of his flying, he may seeme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to resemble a swallow than a balde Mouse. <hi>Opianus</hi> saith he flieth out of the water for feare he be deuoured of the great fishes. <hi>Plinius</hi> writeth that there is a fishe flying called <hi>Arundelle,</hi> whiche is very like the birde which we comonly cal a swallowe, which as he is rare, and sheweth himselfe by greate wonder with his greate wings, so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, they vse commonly to drie him and hang him vp in their houses: which I thinke was more rare in the time of <hi>Plinie</hi> than now, because there be diuerse founde in sundrie houses in <hi>Spaine, Italie, Fraunce,</hi> and elswhere. <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Campensius,</hi> Phisition to the Lord <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Trans,</hi> sayd, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> not many yeares past, the Lord Admiral of <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> made him a banquet, where he presented him with a flying fishe. And in our time those that haue sayled by the pillers of <hi>Hercules,</hi> affirme that there is such store of flying fishes thereabout, that they séeme rather birdes with wings than fishes of the Sea. Besides it is not inconuenient to set forth in this place the pourtrait of a fishe flying, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a water monster, which is the chiefe cause that I haue vndertaken this treatise of fishes. This fishe or rather monster of the Sea, I haue considered with long viewe &amp; iudgement, and haue caused him to be drawne as neare as I can according to his naturall proportion, wherein I maye boldly preferre as witnesses aboue twoo hundreth personnes who sawe him in <hi>Paris,</hi> aswell as I.</p>

Yet of all those which behelde this fish, &amp; argued vpon his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there was not one that could discerne other artificiall sleyght than as Nature brought hym forth, &amp; formed him.</p>
            <p>The Sea hath also other monsters, which be more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull than these, as the fishe which they call in <hi>Latine Torpedo,</hi> most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon in Hauen townes, and is accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to resemble most of all those fishes that be harde skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and she hath a hidden propertie, which is very stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, for being hidden within the sand, or moudde, she slepeth by a secret vertue, and making also al the fishe that be neare hir immouable and without sense, she féedes vppon them, and deuoureth them, neither doth hir charme of sleepe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende onely againste fishes, but also against men, for if a man touch hir with his Anglerod, she enchaunteth forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his arme.

            <p>Althoughe the water is the proper Element, mansion house and place of abode for fishes, where they féede, liue, disporte, encrease and exercise all their other functions, yet is there of them whiche leaue the Sea, floudes and riuers, and leape vppon the lande, eate and féede vppon hearbes, vse recreation in the féeldes, and sléepe there now and then. <hi>Theophrastes</hi> affirmeth, that neare vnto <hi>Babylon,</hi> when the riuers retire within their ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes, there be certain fishes lefte within caues and hollowe places, which issue out to feede, marching vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their wings, or with their often mouing of their taile, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any offreth to offend or assault them, they flie forthwith into their caues as their refuge.

The auncient Philosophers affirme, that there haue bene founde fiishes vnder the earth, who (for that cause) they called <hi>Focilles,</hi> whereof <hi>Aristotle</hi> makes mention, and <hi>Theophraste</hi> speaking of <hi>Paphlilagonia,</hi> where men drawe fishe (and they be very good to eate) out of déepe diches, and other places wherein no water doth remaine. <hi>Polybe</hi> writes in lyke sorte, that neare to <hi>Narbone</hi> hath bene founde fishes vnder the earth. We maye also bring in amongest other wonders of the Sea, a kind of fishe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Stella,</hi> or Sea starre, bycause it hath the figure of a painted starre: this fishe is of a Nature so hote that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth assoone as he hath deuoured, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in his .v. booke <hi>De Historia anima.</hi> where he gyueth such hotnesse to this fish, that she boyleth what she taketh. <hi>Plinie,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> do likewise affirme that the starre by hir onely touche, doth melte, boyle and burne whatsoeuer she toucheth, and knowing hir vertue, she suffreth hir selfe to be touched with other fishe, to the ende she maye burne them. <hi>Monsieur Rondelet,</hi> a man liuing at this daye, and aswel worthie of credit as the best that write, in his histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie <hi>de piscibus,</hi> affirmeth that he hath séene many starres of the Sea, but one amongest the reste containing almost a foote in length, which he opened in maner of Anotomie, and founde in his bellye three <hi>Coquylles</hi> whole, and twoo <hi>Remollies</hi> halfe digested, such is the greate &amp; furious heate of this litle creature, all which may seeme wonderfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the wonders of the Sea, &amp; yet are they nothing in respect of those whiche we meane to treate hereafter, the same mouing both feare and amaze to suche as haue most nearely sifted the secretes of the Sea. For this litle beast which so amazeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, is called in <hi>Greeke Ethneis,</hi> and of the <hi>Latins Remora,</hi> to whome is gyuen that name, bycause she doth stay Ships, as hereafter you shall heare more at large. <hi>Opyanus</hi> and <hi>Aelian</hi> write that he delites moste in the high sea: he is of the length of a cubite, of a

Whereof also many Philosophers of late dayes, whiche haue trauailed by many ports and hauens in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in that they haue séene hym made an Anatomie, and proued his vertues with wonderfull effectes. It is sure a maruellous and monstrous thing in Nature to finde a fish or creature in the water of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gretnesse of a Limace, which is of force by a secrete propretie of nature to stay imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly what she toucheth, be it the moste huge and tal ship or galey that vseth to scumme the sea, whiche made <hi>Plinie</hi> crie out in this sorte: Oh straunge and wonderful thyng (sayth he) that all the windes blowyng from all partes of the worlde, and the moste furious tempestes raging vpon and ouer the waues, and contendyng wyth extreme vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence against the vessels that sayle thervpon, stand in awe of a little fishe of the greatnesse of a Limace, whose power preuaileth ouer their furie, can restraine and bridle theyr rage, and is of more force to stay the strongest shippe that is, than all their ankers, cables, tackles, or any other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine employed or vsed about the same.

This creature bounde (as it were) by the vertue of this coniuration, remained long amongst them. Immediatly after which tyme, chaunced a sighte no lesse straunge than this: it was an other creature representing the forme and shape of a Woman, who began to cutte the waues, and approche the banke of the Ryuer, hauyng a great bush of haires dispersed, a white face, and of plesant regard, hir fingers and armes wel proporcioned hir dugs somewhat rounde and bigge, shewing hir selfe in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, namely vntill the nauell, the reste (with a lyke reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to nature as the other) she concealed within the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. And after these two creatures hadde long delited the eyes of the people with their sight, they gaue place to the darknesse of the night, and vanished away, without euer being séene afterwarde. Wherof after the Prouost hadde

taken witnesse of the assistants, he dispatched immediatly a messanger to the Emperour <hi>Mauritius</hi> with the newes. <hi>Baptiste Fulgose,</hi> writeth a like historie of a Sea monster, which was séene of a numbre of men, in a certaine port or hauen of the sea, in the time of <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth. This monster (sayth he) was a man of the sea, who hauing left the water, made a roade vpon the land, and caught a childe as he disported hym selfe vpon the banke, which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to cary with hym into the sea, hée was so speedily pursued with men, and hurte with stones, that he was not only forced to leaue his pray, but also had muche to doe to recouer the water: his figure resembled the fourme of a man, sauyng that hys skynne was like the sloughe of an Eele, and had two little hornes on his head: he hadde on eyther hande but two fyngers, and his féete dyd ende like two little tayles, and on his armes he had two little win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as a balde Mouse hath. <hi>Conradus Gesnerus</hi> writeth that there was séene at <hi>Rome</hi> in the great riuer, a sea man, or monster of the sea. <hi>Theodorus Gaza,</hi> a man learned, and as well studied as any of our time, writeth, that on a tyme when he was in <hi>Greece</hi> vpon a certaine coast of the sea, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the rage of a wonderfull tempeste, hauyng taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the shoare a good quantitie of fishe, he sawe amongest certaine other wonderfull thinges, a Mermayde or fyshe, hauyng the face of a woman, fully perfect in euery thing requisite in Nature vnto the wast, from which part doun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward she caried the forme of a fishe, finishing in the tayle like an Eele, euen as we sée them ordinarily drawne by the painter. This Mermayd (as it is written) was vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the grauell or sande, and shewed by hir iestes and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to suffer suche passions, as the sayde <hi>Theodore Gaze</hi> moued to pitie, considering that she had a desire to returne to the sea, tooke hir, and conueyed hir into the water. <hi>Plinie</hi> lykewise writeth, that in the time of the Emperor <hi>Tyberius,</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>Lysbona,</hi> a towne in <hi>Portingal,</hi>

sent Embassadours to the Emperour to certifie hym that they hadde séene many tymes a <hi>Tryton,</hi> or man of the Sea, hyde and wythdrawe hym selfe into a caue, neare vnto the Sea. There was also aduertisement sente to the Emperor <hi>Octauian Augustus,</hi> that vpon the coast of <hi>France</hi> were founde certayne Mermaydes deade vpon the banke of the ryuer. In like sorte <hi>Georgius Trapezuntius,</hi> a man very famous in learning, affirmeth to haue seene vpon the border of the Ryuer, appearyng out of the water in the fourme of a Woman vntill the nauill, whereof seemyng to maruell, and beholdyng hir somewhat nearely, shée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into the water. <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro,</hi> a great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilian Philosopher in the .viij. Chapter of hys thyrd booke assureth for certaintie, that in <hi>Epyre,</hi> now named <hi>Romain,</hi> is a certayne fountaine neare the Sea, from whence yong Maydes for the necessitie of theyr houses, dydde drawe water, and that harde by issued a <hi>Triton</hi> or Sea man, and caughte a little damsell, whome he caried oftentymes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sea, and after sette hir on lande agayne: wherof the inhabitauntes beyng aduertised, vsed suche watche and guarde, that they tooke hym, and broughte hym afore the Iustice of the place, afore whome beyng searched and examined, founde in hym all partes and membres of a man, for whyche they committed hym to certaine garde and kéepyng, offeryng hym meate, the whyche he refused wyth sorrowfull lamentations after hys kynde, not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng any thyng that was offered hym, and lastly dyed of hunger, séeing hym selfe restrayned from the Elemente wherein he was wonte to dwell. Many writers nowe a days do witnesse a thyng more strange than any of these, if it be true, whyche is, that the Archduke of <hi>Austriche,</hi> third sonne of the Emperor <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> made to be caried with him to <hi>Gennes,</hi> in the yere .1548. a Mermayd dead, the same so astonishing the people, that the moste learned men in <hi>Italie</hi> came to visite and sée him.

the most notable &amp; worthie to be celebrated, of al others, is the starre which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducted the .iij. sage Kings of <hi>Perse,</hi> to the place where Christe was borne, the which feared not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the common people, but the sighte thereof rauished and brought into admiration the most learned of the worlde, for that it, againste the Nature of all other starres (which drawe them selues from the Orient to the Occident,) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed hir course into <hi>Palestine,</hi> which is situated towards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> North, causing <hi>S.

learnedly writeth. <hi>Herodian</hi> a <hi>Greeke</hi> authour, in the life of the Emperours maketh mention that in the raigne of <hi>Commodeus</hi> the Emperour, they sawe by the space of a whole daye, a number of starres shyning as though it had bene night: likewise in the yeare that <hi>Lewes</hi> the stutting <hi>Frenche</hi> King died, they behelde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen shining a great number of starres at nyne of the clocke in the morning, wherein as <hi>Hieronimus Cardanus</hi> in his .xiiij. booke <hi>De veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate rerum,</hi> assureth to haue seen in the yere 1532. the .xj. day of Aprill, being at <hi>Venise,</hi> thre sunnes together, cleare, bright &amp; shining. Euen so in the yeare that <hi>Francis Sforce</hi> died (after whose deceasse grew greate warres in <hi>Italie</hi>) there was in like maner seen at <hi>Rome</hi> thrée sunnes, which dydde so frighte the people, that they fell immediately to prayer, thinking the malice and ire of God were kyndled against them for their sinnes. Also the Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> second of that name, who was called before he receiued that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, <hi>Aeneas Siluius,</hi> who died in the yere 460. writeth in his description of <hi>Europe</hi> the .liiij. chap. that in the sixt yere after the <hi>Iubile,</hi> there was séene amongest them of <hi>Sienne</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> twentie cloudes in the ayre, who being stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the wyndes, fought one against another, euery one in his ranke, reculing and approching according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and maner of battaill, and during the conflicte of these cloudes, the winde was not vnoccupied in dispoiling, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, brusing and breaking trées, houses, and rockes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides lifting of men and beastes into the ayre. The anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of time cannot reporte or make mention of a more wonder in the aire, than of a horrible Comet of the colour of bloude, which appeared in the West, the eleuenth day of October in the yeare 1527. being so wonderfull and fearefull, that it engendred so greate terrour to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sorte, that diuers not onely died with the sighte, but others fell into strange and miserable maladies. This strange Comet was séene of manie thousand, continuing

the space of an houre and a quarter, and in the ende began to bring hir selfe to the side of the sunne, after drawing towards the <hi>Midy,</hi> the <hi>Occident,</hi> and the <hi>Septentrion,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be of an excessiue length, and of the colour of bloud, there was séene in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> height of the Comet the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter and figure of the stumpe of an arme, holding a greate sworde in his hande, as he woulde haue striken: about the pointe of the said sword, were thrée starres, but that which was right vpon the pointe, was more cleare and brighte

               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:5864:64"/>
than the others: on the other twoo sides of the beames of this Comet, they sawe a greate number of hatchettes, kniues, swordes of the colour of bloud, about the whiche were a great number of humaine faces very hideous, with their beardes and haire stirring, as may bee seene before fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured. Shortely after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> viewe of this hideous &amp; wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Planet, all the parties of <hi>Europe</hi> were welnigh bathed in humaine bloude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so muche preuailed the inuasion of the <hi>Turckes,</hi> besides other hurtes which <hi>Italie</hi> receiued by the Lord of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> when he committed <hi>Rome</hi> to sacke, dying at the same instant: like as <hi>Petrus Creuserus</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> excellent Astrologians interpret by writing the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of this wonderfull Planet. Euen so for that we haue promised in the induction of our worke, to shewe the causes &amp; beginnings of these wonders, it is therfore now requisite to serch more narrowly the matter, and to decide the question so often debated amongest the Auncients and learned Philosophers. These fantasticall figures, as dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, flames, Comets, &amp; other like of diuers formes, which are séene so often in the Element according to the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of many wise men, do giue to vnderstande, foretel or shew many things that shal and do happen, as <hi>Albumazar, Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, Paulus Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drinus, Ephestion Maternus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aomar, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith, Alkindus, Paulus Manlius, Alberanger,</hi> and generally the most part of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Greekes, Hebrues, Caldees, Arabec</hi> and <hi>Egiptians,</hi> who haue written and attributed so muche to the starres, and their influence, that they haue assured the moste parte of the humaine actions, to depende of the celestiall constellations.

In like maner <hi>Faber Stapulensis</hi> in his Paraphrase of <hi>Metheores,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention that the Commettes, whiche appeared from heauen, signified scarsitie of goodes, aboundance of
<pb facs="tcp:5864:65"/>
greate windes, warres, effusion of bloud and the death of Princes, <hi>Hieronimus Cardanus</hi> a late Philosopher, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his fourth booke <hi>De subtilitate,</hi> and .xiiij. booke <hi>De ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate rerum,</hi> that the hearie and bearded Comets and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like monstrous figures whiche appeare from heauen, be as foretellers and messengers of famine, pestilence, warres, mutations of Realmes, and other such like hurtes which happen to the generation of man. And he further beleues, that the greater and hideous these figures ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, they purporte and shew the greater euils. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Proculus</hi> one of the moste excellent Astrologians which <hi>Grece</hi> at any time norished, followeth the interpretations of suche predictions, by all the signes of heauen, recomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by order the maruellous powers which these starres haue vppon the actions humaine. And there be others as <hi>Ptolome,</hi> whiche haue written, that if any infant in his natiuitie be borne vnder certaine constellations, he shall haue power ouer diuels: there be also others of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but they be most shamelesse &amp; full of blasphemies, who haue so much referred themselues to the dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of starres, that they haue not feared to write, that if any from their nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie were borne vnder the aspect of certaine starres, that they shoulde haue the gyfte of prophecie, and should foretel things to come. And that Iesus Christ the sauiour of al the world, was borne vnder certaine fortunate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stellations, being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was so perfect &amp; wrought so many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.

And the <hi>Ethniques</hi> also, as <hi>Varro, Cornelius Celsus,</hi> and many other, defame them. But farre more diuersly amongst Princes than any other, hath <hi>Picus
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:5864:65"/>
Mirandula</hi> shewed him selfe, who hath so very well brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght to light, and discouered the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of their dreames in a <hi>Latin</hi> worke, which he made against them, that they scarcely dare once lift vp their hornes. Wherefore lette vs now returne to our purpose and shewe so neare as we can, whether these straunge figures and Comets whiche we sée from heauen, be foretellers of things whiche shall happen, or that they be naturall: wherein as <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his first boke of <hi>Metheores,</hi> treating very learnedly of the nature of Cometes, and of these other impressions, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and figures which be made from heuen, sayth, that they be made onely by nature, without makyng mention that they either foretell or appoynt any thing which shall happen: euen so it is to be presupposed, that if <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who is the first and most excellent of all those which haue written at any time in this Arte, had founde neuer so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle coniecture or reason in nature, that they were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of any thing whiche should come to passe, he woulde haue kepte them no more secrete or hidden, than he hath done the other secretes of philosophie, which he hath lefte to vs by his writings. Wherfore it is then certaine, that these fantasticall flames and other figures, whiche we sée from heauen, be naturall and grow vpon this occasion fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. There be thrée regions in heauen, one whiche is most high, who receiueth into hir a maruellous heate, for that she is nexte neighbour to the Element of fyre: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is lower, receyueth the beames of the Sunne beaten backe of the earth, whereof I haue made mention in my description of the cause of thunders. The third is in the mydst of these two, to the which do come the force of the heate, which commeth from the vppermost part, lyke to the heate of the beames of the Sunne, beaten backe when it commeth from the lowest or inferior region. For as <hi>Plinie</hi> witnesseth, the starres be continually nourished of the humor procedyng of the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which be the chiefest
<pb facs="tcp:5864:66"/>
causes of these celestiall flames: for the earthe as <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> sheweth in his fyrst booke of <hi>Metheores,</hi> being chafed of the Sunne, rendreth double ayrely substaunce, the one vapour which we may proprely name exhalation hote and drye, the other is hote and moyste: and bicause the firste vapour is most light, she is suffered to come to the highest region of the ayre, where she is set on fyre: wherof proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth these fyres and flames from heauen, which in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of dyuers straunge shinyngs appeare in the Cloudes in sundry figures, as in the shape of burnyng torches, of shippes, heades, launces, bucklers, swordes, bearded and hairie Comets, with other like things, whereof we haue made mention here before:<note place="margin">

               </note> the whiche engenders greate terror and astonishement to those, who be ignorant of the causes, wherin as it hapened oftentymes amongst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi> in the warres of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> who being brought into such fear and terror,<note place="margin">

               </note> by the sodain appering of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse of the Moone, that their hearts began to faile them: Euen so <hi>Cneius Sulpitius</hi> seing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> continuing in this feare (by a wonderful eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) shewed vnto them by probable reasons, that such mutation in the aire was naturall, and that the Eclipse proceded of no other thing,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The cause of the Eclypse of the Moone.</hi>
               </note> than of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition of the Moone betwixt the Sunne and vs, and of the earth betwixt vs and the Moone, by whiche meanes they were delyuered of their errour, not knowing til that houre, the cause of the sayd Eclipse. The like may be sayd of the raining of blood, the which hath so much frighted the people in the yeres passed, for bicause they were ignorant wherevpon it proceded, as that which fell from heauen, in the yere of health 570. in the tyme that the <hi>Lumbards</hi> wer vnder the conduct of <hi>Albuyn,</hi> traueling through <hi>Italy.</hi> And also ther fel the like yet fresh in memory neare <hi>Fribourgh,</hi> in the yeare .1555. the whyche stained and made the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and trées whiche it touched, of the coloure of redde, and notwithstanding although that this séemeth wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:5864:66"/>
yet oftentymes it is naturall. For like as the earth gyueth diuers colours to many bodies: euen so she colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the water of the rayne, for if the earth be redde, shee rendreth those vapours and exhalations redde, the whiche being conuerted into raine, the heauen in like maner sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to vs redde, and coloured as they were attired and lifted in height: and falling so vpon certaine habites, she maketh them of the colour and die of redde. Wherfore many Historians, as well <hi>Greekes</hi> as <hi>Latines,</hi> amongest their great maruels and rare wonders from heauen, haue made mention of these bloudy shoures. It resteth now to putte to the laste seale this chapiter, and to appoynte the causes of the number of Sunnes and Moones, whych ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare oftentimes from heauen, as the thrée Sunnes,<note place="margin">

We maye also sée the lyke in a table wel painted and polished, which when we behold, there appeareth to vs the shape of two or .iij. being but one in dede, and as much we may say of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Moone. Thus haue we declared the very true causes wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore appere so often .ij. or .iij Sunnes &amp; Moones: let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now from henceforth search in nature the cause and beings of these things, and stay no more at these frippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, deceiptes, and dreames of the Astrologians iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, who therby haue so oftentimes deceiued &amp; begiled vs, that they oughte and deserue to be banished &amp; exiled from all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealths well gouerned: for what trouble, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie and terrour haue they engendred in the conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:5864:67"/>
of a numbre of poore people. As for example, in the yere 1514. when they feared not with obstination to publishe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in all places, that there shoulde be in the moneth of February well nigh an vniuersall floud, for that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of all the planets were in the signe of <hi>Pisces,</hi> and notwithstandyng the day which should haue brought forth these waters, was one of the moste faire and temperate days of the yere: albeit many great personages, fearefull of their prophecies, made prouision of bisket, flower, ships and other like things propre to sayle withall, fearyng to be surprised and drowned wyth the greate abundance of water, whiche they before had tolde of.

To whom he answered, he shoulde be in hys owne house with hys familie: but I knowe very wel sayd the King, that thy starres be lyers: for thou shalt neither sée Moone, Sunne, Starres, heauen, nor thy familie this Christmasse, putting hym presentely in the moste straight &amp; darke prison, in the great tower of <hi>London,</hi> where he continued till the feast was past.

Euen so I knowe a certaine Physition at this day, who writeth of the lyke in diuers of his histories, chauncing in our time to a nere friende of his in <hi>Italy,</hi> not onely at one time, but at many. Whereof, as <hi>Plinius</hi> not onely in an other place, maketh mention of the ryuer <hi>Trasimenus,</hi> whyche was seene all on fyre, but also maketh a certain discourse of these wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full flames, whyche be seene aboute the bodies of men.

But to tell you myne opinion therein, I can not any wayes gather the cause or foundation eyther of the one or other, althoughe I haue promised to shewe the causes and reasons, whervpon these wonders procede and take their beginnyng. For if we wyll saye they be made by Arte: As we haue séene very often in oure tyme cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Ruffians vomite and caste forth of theyr mouthes, certayne flames of burnyng Fyre, whiche <hi>Atheneus</hi> in the fyrst boke of the <hi>Dipnosophistes</hi> and fouretenth Chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth witnesse, whiche coulde not happen (as I thinke) to the Histories before mentioned, for that it hath chanced to greate lordes, vpon whome these wonders haue bene moste proued, by which meanes, they being attended vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wyth a greate numbre and multitude of persones, the fraude thereof was easlyer discouered.

The Historians write that these .iij.

Wherefore the King <hi>Demetrius,</hi> sodainely receiuing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glaunce of the eye of <hi>Lamie,</hi> was taken in the net, and that newe fire in processe of time gained so much ouer him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he liued not but in hir, &amp; not only gaue hir all he had, but also abandoned his wife <hi>Euxonie</hi> to followe his <hi>Lamie.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Plutarke</hi> reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the life of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> that the <hi>Athenians</hi> hauing

This miserable King <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> doated so extremely in the loue of his <hi>Lamie,</hi> that he honored hir as a God, swering by hir, as he accustomed to do by his Gods, till death &amp; fortune which cuts asunder the fillet of those delites, &amp; sends ende to all such enterprises, suffred <hi>Lamie</hi> to die, whereupon that poore King, felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so griped, that as some write of him, he kissed hir, and embraced hir after hir death: and not content with this Idolatrie, he made hir be buried before one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> windowes of his house, and when any of his friends asked the occasion wherefore he buried hir in that place, he aunswered them, sighing dipely: the law of friendship of <hi>Lamie</hi> is so stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly graffed in my heart, that I knowe not wherein to satisfie the loue she bare me, &amp; the bonde which I owe to hir for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, if not to put hir in such a place, that by viewe therof my poore eyes may bewaile dayly the death of hir, and my sorowful harte continually thinke thereof. Whereby the dolor &amp; sorow that <hi>Demetrius</hi> had for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of <hi>Lamie,</hi> was so great and extreme, that all the Philosophers of <hi>Athens</hi> were to dispute thereof, whether of these twoo things were most to be estéemed, either the teares &amp; sorow which he suffred for hir, or the riches which he spent in the obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies &amp; pomps of hir burial. Within a yere &amp; .ij. monethes after the death of <hi>Lamie,</hi> died King <hi>Demetrius.</hi> The second amorous Dame, named <hi>Lays,</hi> spoken of before, was the daughter of a great Sacrificatour of the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so expert in the arte <hi>Magicall,</hi> that he prophecied the perdition of his daughter incontinent after hir natiuitie.

But <hi>Flora,</hi> without making accompte either of golde or siluer, would be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned of hir louer. And being one daye asked the cause of that, she aunswered. I committe my person to Princes and noble men, to the ende they maye deale with me, as noble men oughte to do, for I sweare by all oure Gods, that there was neuer man gaue me so litle, but that I had more than I looked for, &amp; double to that I demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: saying that a sage woman ought not to make price of hir loue, for the amorous pleasure she doth to any man, but rather for the loue she beareth to him, for that al things in the world be priced at a certaine rate, except Loue, which can not be payed but wyth loue. Wherfore all the Embassadours of the worlde whiche came into <hi>Italy,</hi> caried back as greate and seueral reports of the beautie and noblenesse of <hi>Flora,</hi> as of the Publike weale of <hi>Rome,</hi> for that it séemed as mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

a thing to sée the riches of hir house, hir beautie, the princes &amp; noble men who dayly required hir, as also to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the great presents they made vnto hir: for looke what day she passed on horsebacke in <hi>Rome,</hi> the viewe of hir &amp; hir attire, gaue sufficient occasion to all the Citizens to talke thereof one moneth after. She dyed at the age of .lx. yeres, leauing hir wealth and riches to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> as hir onely heires, whiche was esteemed not onely sufficient to haue edified the walles of <hi>Rome,</hi> if they had bene vtterly in ruine and decaye, but also to haue redeemed the common wealth. Wherwith giuing ende to the discourses of these Women, there resteth to searche oute some other cause more straunge and rare in oure wonderfull loues. <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> and <hi>Suetonius</hi> write, that the abhominable tyrant <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> did not only offend grieuously in the abuse of a number of honest and chaste virgins, but also causing to be gelded a faire yong boy, whome he named <hi>Sporus,</hi> with intent to transforme hym into the vse of a woman, he maried hym with open solemnitie, vsing him in the place of his wyfe, touching the exercise of mariage, and assigned dowrie and portion accordyng to the order. And whether may we terme it an act of wonderfull loue or effect of doating foly? <hi>Herodotus</hi> reporteth of the daughter of <hi>Cheopes</hi> Kyng of Egypte, who hauyng consumed his treasure and reuenue in the supplie of a hundred thousande workmen, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vpon a moste sumptuous Pile whiche he made, and being as destitute of money, as voyde of meanes to get it, commaunded his daughter to commit hir selfe to sensuall prostitution, and that with charge, that she should not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly racke hir honoure to a high price, but also refuse none, whose companie broughte commoditie, which she perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med accordingly, demaunding of euery one that delt with hir, a stone, by whose gaine was raised so much as builded the <hi>Pyramides,</hi> or hyll whiche carieth in the front a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and fiftie foote. <hi>Ludouicus Vartomanus</hi> writeth, that

there is an other maner of makyng of loue at this day in vse in a certaine prouince of <hi>Indie,</hi> named <hi>Tarnasseri,</hi> which is no lesse wonderful tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the precedent before recited, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> experience wer to be seene: he declareth, that when a yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is enamored of any dame, desiring to make hir vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the flames of his loue, he taketh a piece of woullen cloth dipped in oyle, and putting therto fire, coucheth the same vpon his naked arme, enduring that flame vntill the cloth be cleane consumed, without shewyng any kinde of dolour, testifying by this, that he is so strongly embraced with the loue of his lady, that there is no kind of torment or martirdome vnder the heauens, whiche he woulde not taste or be partaker of for hir sake. But to the ende we should not tast too much of these filthy and stinking loues, I wil shewe you, that there is to be founde as great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in chaste and vertuous loue, whiche is sufficientely proued by sundry examples, of late written by my brother <hi>G.

And it is more maruellous, that the furie and violence of Loue is so great, that the wilde, brutall and cruel beastes do not onely féele the same: but (which more is) the Trées and liuely Plantes of the earth, the whiche we sée, shewe a certaine likenesse and affinitie of loue: in such sort that as <hi>Theophrastus</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> haue written, there be diuers Trées and Plants, which if you take away the males, and place them farre from the females, they presently wither, and continue in perpetuall barennesse. As we may sée of the Uine, who imbraceth the Elme, ioying and reioycing much at his presence. In like sorte the Iuie, whiche is so great a louer of certain Trées, that it accompanieth them after their death: Which gaue occasion to the Auncients, that when they tooke vpon them to depaint perfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, they expressed the same by the trunke of a deade trée, enuironed about with Iuie.

like vnto the Oliues: for all those, who haue written of the Nature and propertie of this plante, saye that it resisteth the sinne of the fleshe, and that those which either carie the same about them, or drinke the iuice thereof, be neuer tempted at any time to incontinencie: for whiche occasion the maides in olde time, bare the braunches and bowes of that hearbe in their hande, and made garlandes therof to weare vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their heads, thinking therby to make die &amp; estinguish the heates of the flesh. Wherefore <hi>Discori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> in the .xv. chapter of his first booke, treating of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Nature of plants, sayeth that the <hi>Greeks</hi> named this tree <hi>Agnos,</hi> that is to saie chaste, for by that the Ladies sometime in the Citie of <hi>Athens,</hi> garded their chastitie, by making their beads thereof, and doing sacrifice therewith to <hi>Ceres.</hi> Euen as we haue described the singularitie of <hi>Agnus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> which defends the chastetie of such persons as vse the same: so are we nowe to make mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an other hearbe altogether contrarie to the Nature of <hi>Agnus Castus,</hi> and as who would saye his mortall enimie, for it makes suche as vse the same, lasciuious, prompte and readie to the Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerian actes: The Auncients haue named this hearbe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirium,</hi> for that the <hi>Satires</hi> and sauage Gods, were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentours of this plante, for the better satisfying of theyr lusts and concupiscence when they wente to playe by the forrests &amp; caues with the <hi>Nimphes.</hi> Albeit the <hi>Greeks</hi> cal it <hi>Orchis</hi> or <hi>Cmo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore reader, I will not forget to declare that thou shalt not néede to doubte of me in all this treatise of the wonders of plants, the descriptions, facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, temperaments and diuisions of them, for that this worke woulde be excessiue &amp; excede the limits of my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Wherein <hi>Dioscorides, Theophrastus, Galen, Plinie, Matheolus Fuscheus, Ruel</hi> and many others haue so well spoken in that, that there is nothing to be desired more than they haue written thereof, whiche I woulde gladly haue tolde before vnto those which thinke that I had here confounded the diuerse kinds of <hi>Satirium,</hi> like this that the <hi>Greekes</hi> haue called <hi>Orchis Serapias,</hi> wherof <hi>Paulus Aegine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and <hi>Aetius</hi> haue made mention, which others saye to haue receyued that name of <hi>Serapius,</hi> God of the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians,</hi> by reason of the greate &amp; impudent lasciuitie, for which cause they worshipped him in a place called <hi>Canope,</hi> there where he had his Temple of greate reuerence, &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as <hi>Strabo</hi> reciteth in his .xvij. booke of his <hi>Geographies.</hi> Wherefore it suffiseth me in this chapter to write sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, that there is more cause of maruell and wonder in some particular plant, than in euery plant. The Auncients as <hi>Chrisippus,</hi> haue founde cause of wonder, I can not tell by what meanes, in the plante whiche we commonly call
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:5864:78"/>
               <hi>Basill,</hi> who were of opinion that it makes a man, senslesse and madde: the goats refuse to eate thereof, which giues iuste occasion to man to flye the rather from it. They adde further, that brusing it and putting the same vnder a stone, it engendreth a Scorpion, or if they chawe it and set it in the Sunne, it brings forth wormes. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, some saye, that if a man be stoung of Scorpion the daye that he eateth of <hi>Basill,</hi> he shall neuer be hoale, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewise some assure, that brusing a handefull of <hi>Basill</hi> with <hi>Cancres marins,</hi> or of the Riuer, that all the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions farre or neare will come vnto him.</p>
            <p>Wherfore I am not ignorant, that those whiche came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Crysippus,</hi> did so abhorre <hi>Basill,</hi> that they neuer vsed the same. The herbe called of the <hi>Latins, Herbae pulicaris,</hi> hathe such a colde vertue, that being cast into hot boiling water, it will kill the heate therof. In like maner, as <hi>Chameleon albus,</hi> serueth vnto men in stede of Treacle against poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and all venims: Euen so notwithstandyng it killeth and destroyeth Ratts and dogs eating therof. It is in lyke maner a little Thistle growing by the grounde, without any stalke, putting vp pricks like an Hedgehogge, hauing in the middle a knap ful of pricks, in which do appere pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple floures, that growe into plumes, fléeing away with the winde, like as of other thistels, hauing a white roote &amp; swéete, groweth on olde landes and bare hilles.

they vse not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, for it often hapneth that those whiche he deliuered from that disease, by vsing of Persley, fall a fresh into the same againe.

Furthermore the <hi>Consyre,</hi> whiche the Apoticaries (commending with so many barbarous wordes) do call <hi>Consolida maior,</hi> hath so greate a vertue to knit, and make to growe and ioine together freshe hurts, for as <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Discorides</hi> witnesse, being put in a pot with sundrie pieces of flesh, it will knit and ioyne them together: for which cause the <hi>Greeks</hi> called it <hi>Symphiton</hi> for the gret vertue it hath in knitting &amp; ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning togethers.

For in the olde time it was applied to Monkes and Nunnes, and other people of deuotion in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious houses, to pull downe and mortifie their flesh. The Ancients named it <hi>Nimphea,</hi> bicause the virgin <hi>Nympha</hi> being ielouse of <hi>Hercules,</hi> became leane, pale and so full of mortall passions, that death gaue ende to hir sorowes, and afterwarde (as they beleued) she was chaunged into this marrishe and waterie hearbe to delaye hir heates: It is common in euery place and of .ij. sortes, the one hath a whyte flower, and the other carieth a yealowe floure. <hi>Iuye</hi> called in <hi>Latine Hedera,</hi> and in <hi>Greeke Cysses,</hi> is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon herbe, yet it containes in it many things worthy of commendation, firste it troubleth the minde if a man take too muche of it: it brings forth an humour or gumme, whiche as <hi>Galen</hi> saith, burnes secretly as a hoate plaster, without being perceyued: besides it serueth for a depila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to make fall the haire in euery place about man and woman: the little graines or séedes of <hi>Iuye</hi> taken in broth make men become barreine. <hi>Plinie</hi> addes besydes to the vertue of this hearbe, that men that be melancholike and subiect to diseases of the Splene, are easely healed if they do but drinke in cups or goblets made of the wood of this <hi>Iuye.</hi> The Mandrake hath moued greate cause of wonder to suche as haue written of his properties and power, <hi>Pithagoras</hi> calleth it <hi>Antropomorphen,</hi> by reason it hath a roote whiche resembles the forme of a man, others haue named it <hi>Ciroea</hi>

            <p>This may suffise (in mine opinion) for the curious sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the straunge properties of Plantes. There res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth now to discouer vnto you the wonderfull vertues of suche as haue power to confounde and kill man, for the vse of whome, not onely all plants and hearbes, but all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things contained within the pourprise &amp; compasse of of this visible world are and haue bene created, and yet to kéepe him vnder, and that he lifte not vp his horne too high nor swell with pride and ambition, the Lorde hath caused to appeare out of the earth, certaine little rootes &amp; plants with power not onely to be maister ouer his pride, but also euery moment of the daye, to threaten hym wyth death and perfourme it. The Hemlocke called <hi>Cycuta</hi> of the Latins, sufficiently knowen to moste men, is of a propertye to smother and kill suche as do drinke it in any broath, whereof the <hi>Athenians</hi> made a pruofe in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> at suche tyme as he was falsly accused by <hi>Auytus</hi> and <hi>Meluycus</hi> for speakyng blasphemie against the Gods, vsing this hearbe (as a common punishement) and made hymselfe perfourme the office of executioner. <hi>Dioscori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> in his treatise of poysons and their remedies, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerate wonderfully the accidents and <hi>Symptomes</hi> of him that hath eaten of this herbe. For (sayth he) suche as haue eyther dronke or eaten of it, haue a visible vertue in their eyes, althoughe they be blinde and haue their mindes so troubled that they are notable to discerne any thing, and blood continually, and suffer all extreme colds of the body. And lastly, the poyson of this Plant doth so restraine the

And nowe there is a kinde of plant called in Latin <hi>Aconitum,</hi> in Frenche <hi>Aconit,</hi> and in Englishe a <hi>Libardbaine</hi> or <hi>Wolfbaine,</hi> whiche as laste shall seale vp our description of venomous herbes, bicause it is of a more readie and sodain nature of death, than any other, and specially that which they cal <hi>Pardylyanches,</hi> which killeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Libarde and beareth, a leafe like to a wylde Coucumber, but it is somwhat lesse and more sharp: an other kinde of <hi>Aconite</hi> is called <hi>Lycothonon,</hi> bicause that wolues hauing eaten of it die immediatly: the first kinde growth in euery place, but the seconde is founde (&amp; that but seldom) in déepe valleies betwene mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines.

It is moste certain (accordyng to <hi>Plinie</hi>) that as <hi>Aconyt</hi> is the most sodaine poison that is, so the females of any beast whatsoeuer, touchyng it in any sorte with their secrete parts, doe die presently. He sayth again, that <hi>Aconyt</hi> giuen to a man in hot wine, is present poyson and killeth, if he finde not some thyng in the body of man, which can kill it: for hauing encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred any thing of like substaunce to himselfe, he stirreth and quarelleth as if he mette with an other poyson in the intrailes of the man: but that whiche maketh it of more maruell is, that two mortall poisons méeting in the body of one man toge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, the one killeth the other, and saueth the man on liue.

The like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to the father of <hi>Prestantius,</hi> who being turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a horse, carried corne wyth other victualls of certaine knights. All which notwithstandyng (sayth <hi>S.

And touchyng the burdens which they caried, it myght be (sayth he) that the Diuels themselues caryed them, to entertaine the rather the errour of those misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures. But now to preuent such opinions as may importe that there were no euill spirits: but in <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi> time, or other Auncientes, I will inferre thyngs of no lesse wonder, whereof the experience hath happened in our owne tyme. <hi>Gasperus Pucerus</hi> in his commentaries <hi>de Diuinatione,</hi> after he hath long argued the resons touching the Artificiall deceyte in Diuels, brings in an authoritie no lesse maruellous than of terrour: There was (sayeth he) a certaine maide at <hi>Bolonia,</hi> who by the excellencie of hir arte, caried a greate name thorough all <hi>Italy,</hi> and yet coulde not so preuent infirmities in hir selfe, but being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken with a mortal disease she died: An other <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> hir co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, knowing what profit moued by hir art in hir life time, with intent to make the same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to hir selfe, by the helpe of certaine euill spirites, she conueyed a certaine charme vnder the dugs of the dead woman, the which made hir séeme to be on liue in euery respect: for in common assemblies she was séene playe vpon the harpe, sing and daunce as she was wont to do, with other actions and gestures differyng in nothyng from one bearing lyfe, sauing that hir colour was wonderful pale. There happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned certaine dayes after to come to <hi>Bologna</hi> an other <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitian,</hi> who desiring to sée whether the excellencie and skil of this Woman, agréed with the fame she hadde in euery

place, went amongst other to heare hir sing and play. But after he had some small tyme assisted hir doings, he cried sodainly to the people: What madnesse is this? what abuse to youre simplicitie? what do you heare? or why doe you wonder at such deceipt? she that féedeth your fonde eyes wyth these pastimes, is no better than a stinking and vile dead carion. Wherwith afore he had fully ended his excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, she fell dead to the ground. Whervpon the sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie of the diuel and the inchauntresse were discouered.

There was also in <hi>Pauia,</hi> an other woman enchauntresse in the time of <hi>Leouicenus,</hi> of no lesse maruel in hir art than this, but somwhat more cunning, bicause no euill coulde be so secretely committed in <hi>Pauia,</hi> which by hir meanes were not forthwith reueled, the same making the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers come from farre to visite hir: and yet was there in the same vniuersitie a publike professer of Philosophie, a man of very holy conuersation, who refusing continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of hym self to visite or heare this woman, was won at last by the importunitie of his deare friends to sée hir: and being afore, with intent to sounde hir to the deapth, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red amongest other thyngs, which was the best verse that euer the Poete <hi>Virgile</hi> made? She aunswered hym with small leysure, that <hi>Discite iustitiam moniti, &amp; non sperne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Diuos,</hi> was the best and moste excellent verse that euer he writte. The same so amazyng the Philosopher and his companie, that they returned without other replie, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellyng not a little howe she coulde fourme so precise an answer, hauyng neuer learned so muche as to write or reade. Such a like Histarie is verified by <hi>Hieronymus Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus,</hi> and the experience to be iustified at thys day by all the Citizens of <hi>Myllan,</hi> where (sayth he) is at this day ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, a woman called <hi>Margareta,</hi> the wife of a Paynter, who is not ashamed to publishe openly, that she hathe a Diuell or Familiar, whiche followeth hir continually, sauyng that he is absent for two or thrée monethes in the yeare.

only his voice carieth not a sound as though it were neare hir, but seemeth drawne from farre very hollowe, as if it were spoken out of a creuise in the wall: and if any man drawe neare the place, from whence this sound commeth, he may maruel to heare and vnderstande it more plainely in the vttermost corner of the house, than fast by the place which is thought to yelde it: Such is the propretie of the voice, that it is not articulated, nor otherwise formed, but it may be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, albeit it is very soft and weake, in sort that it may more proprely be called a murmure and sounde than a voice: she becommeth an interpreter to his sayings, impartyng the same in playne language to the people: wherof be some women dwellyng in the house with hir, who obseruing hir vse and dealing with it, saye, that sometime she encloseth it in a shéete, and that custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably it biteth or sucketh hir mouth, the same confirmed chiefly in that she hath moste commonly sore lippes. This Historie maketh me remembre that which the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes haue noted of the spirite of <hi>Socrates,</hi> whiche impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth some vanitie in them, bicause <hi>Socrates</hi> caried always suche regarde to the truthe, that for any thing he woulde neither suggest nor supporte a lie: and yet it is confessed by himselfe, that he had one, as graunted hym to folowe him from his infancie, the same being a voyce (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth) that is already to dissuade hym against any thing that is contrary to him, and yet neuer moue him to do the thing whiche he ought to doe: he affirmeth further of hys spirite, whereof he chalengeth the witnesse of <hi>Thymar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> to kill <hi>Nyceas,</hi> (notwithstandyng he had warning by the spirite of the inconuenience that fell of it) in hys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation confessed, that if he had beleued the counsell of <hi>Socrates,</hi> he had bothe auoyded the facte and daunger of the déede. <hi>Franciscus Picus Mirandolanus,</hi> an excellente Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher of oure time, affirmeth, that there was a Priest of the age of .lxxij. yeares, the whiche for .xl. yeares together
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:5864:100"/>
had alwayes a Famyliar in hys companie, who dronke with hym, lay with him, spake to him, and so directed him in all his actions and doings, that the people (not able to conceyue the mysterie of those thyngs) gaue theyr iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he was a foole. This Priest called his spirite by the name of <hi>Hermelina. Cardan</hi> also auoucheth no lesse of hys father <hi>Facius Cardanus,</hi> who for the space of .xxviij. yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, vsed the conference of a Familiar in moste of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the lyfe of <hi>Cymon</hi> writeth, that after <hi>Damon</hi> was slayne by treason within the Bathes or hote house, there appeared long after spirites with such lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table voices and sighes, that notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the gate and entrie were rammed vp to barre accesse, yet it is affirmed at thys daye, that fearefull visions be séene, and dolefull cries hearde.

The lyke auouched by <hi>Georgius Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola,</hi> a notable Philosopher, and by whome passed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey of the Emperours Mynes in <hi>Almayne,</hi> who amongst other places writeth, that in the Myne at <hi>Anneberg</hi> was a mettall spirite which killed .xij. workmen, the same cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the rest to forsake the myne, albeit it was very riche. There were also such like wicked Spirites, at such tyme as our Sauiour Christe was on earth, who kéeping moste commonly in the graues of dead men, became so terrible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that fewe durst passe that way. This is most certain, that <hi>Porphyrius, Psellus, Plotinus, Proclus, Iamblicus,</hi> and certain other of late dayes, assure, that the vppermoste region of
<pb facs="tcp:5864:101"/>
the ayre swarmeth as full of spirites, whiche we call in <hi>Greke Daemones,</hi> as oure ayre is full of birdes, foundyng their opinion, I thinke, in that the ayre and skies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Quindecines be as great, and the regions so delite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and full of pleasure, as we sée the earth replenished with liuely substance, mettals, stones, &amp; plants. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath hir fishes, and the weake ayre here below, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth creatures that breath and liue. Whereupon may be persuaded, that the greate masse of the superiour ayre is full of those spirites, whose excellencie farre exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the inferiour creatures, bicause their region is more cleare and pure, which bicause they seeme things vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of our christian Philosophie, we will ceasse to argue so farre as the matter requireth. And bicause none maye iustly thinke that we giue suche scoape to diuels, as they haue power to abuse the creatures of God (bought so dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (by the precious bloud of his sonne) it is needefull so to tempre and direct the reason of those things, that we giue them not such authoritie ouer vs as the Cat hath ouer the Mouse, or the foole is fearefull of the whip: for if it were y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their power were not gouerned by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mighty hand of God (hating so mortally the kinde of man in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very image of God) their tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nies &amp; cruelties had long ere this extirped both stocke &amp; roote of suche generation: for if they could not of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues enter within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bellies of hogs, without asking leaue according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scripture: how much more ought we to be assured, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without the permission of God, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not offend vs, who are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paunes of his rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his house wherin he hath taken harbor, and carie his marke, figure, and affinitie: besides, what greater witnesse can we haue of the debilitie &amp; small power of the Dyuell, than that whiche he dothe acknowleage in <hi>Iob,</hi> where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding leaue to persecute that Prophet, he sayde not Suffer me to hurt him: but crauing of god to stretch forth his hand &amp; touch his flesh, sayd: <hi>Mitte manu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> et tange carnem

The first being the man, was séen by <hi>Ludouicus Celius Rhodiginus,</hi> as he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the iij. chapter of his .xxiiij. booke of auncient lessons,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:5864:106"/>
folowing in this maner: There was (sayth he) broughte forth a monster at <hi>Zarzara</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the yeare of grace, 1540. and the .xix. day of Marche, worthie to be considered off for many causes: One, for that it was brought into the worlde at such time as <hi>Italy</hi> was afflicted wyth the plague and scourge of ciuile warres. And that thys monstrous childe was a certaine forerunner or messanger, which she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vnto them the miseries of those domesticall quarels: the other causes for the which it deserued to be diligently noted, were for the straunge and maruellous effectes that nature exhibited in this little subiect: for in the first place the mother of this infant broughte it forth within .iij. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths wel formed, which is a thing monstrous in nature: Secondarily, he had two faire heades well proportioned, and two faces ioyned one to an other, and tyed vpon the top of the neck with a proportion maruellous in euery of those partes: he had his haire a little long and blacke: and betwene these two heades, he had a thirde heade, whiche excéeded not the length of an eare. And for the rest of his body, it was so wel made and proporcioned in all thyngs requisite, that it séemed that Nature delited to frame and make him so faire. Who after he had soiorned a certaine tyme in this miserable worlde, died: wherein, as he was made a present to one of the kyng of <hi>Spaynes</hi> lieutenants, gouerning in that countrey, so he thoughte it good to haue him ripped and his bellie opened, and intrailes séen, which being done, he represented vnto the sightes of the lookers on, things no lesse maruellous than the presidents writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of before: that is to say, he had two liuers, two milts, and but one heart. Wherwith endeth the description that <hi>Celius</hi> hath made of that monster. The second monster is a woman, hauing two heads, whose figure is before to be séene with the other, and more to be wondered at than the fyrst in one thing, for that she liued many yeres, whiche is contrary to the nature of monsters, who ordinarily lyue
<pb facs="tcp:5864:107"/>
not long, for the abundance of melancolike humor, which abundeth in them, to see them selues so opprobrious to the worlde, are therby so dried and consumed, that their liues be shorte. Whiche happened not to this maide, which thou seest here portraicted: for at suche tyme as <hi>Conradus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>costenes,</hi> came into the Duchie of <hi>Bauiere,</hi> whiche was in the yere 1541. she was of the age of .xxvj. yeres. That lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Philosopher <hi>Licostenes</hi> writeth one maruellous thing of that monster, for reseruing the duplication of the head, nature otherwyse had left nothing in hir vnperfect. These two heades (as he writeth) had desire in like to drinke, to eate, to slepe, and to talke together, as also dyd all hir o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affections. Wherefore thys mayde wente from dore to dore searchyng hir liuyng, to whome they gaue more willingly for the noueltie of so strange a creature, &amp; so newe a spectacle: Albeit she was chased tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Duchie of <hi>Bauiere,</hi> to the ende she myght marre the frute of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with childe, for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension whiche remayneth in the imagination of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of this monstrous Woman.</p>

at the dogge being couched on the grounde, neither moued nor angry, vouchsaued not once to rise from the earth: the king commaunded eftsones to offer him the Bul, and then the wilde Bore, which seemed to moue the dogge no more than the rest, what prouocation so euer was made the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantes: <hi>Alexander,</hi> enuyin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as it were) that nature had planted so fearefull a heart in suche a huge and massy peece of flesh, commaunded to kill him: Whereupon the Lorde that first ought him and gaue him to the king (bieng more priuy than they, to his valiant disposition), desired <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> that afore the dogge were killed, he should be offred the Lyon or Elephant, which being done forthwith, the dogge began with a wonderfull fury to assaile the Lyon, and so claw him in his cruel kinde, that where he once imprinted his téeth, the caracters remayned and could not be defaced, being also so fierce vpon the Lyon, that he could not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off by any meanes, whereat the king séeming to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and the <hi>Indian</hi> Lord desirous to encrease the pleasure he toke in his pastime, commaunded to cut of his taile, and his foure legges one after an other, tearing in effecte one legge from an other, notwithstanding which horrible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he endured, he gaue not ouer the battaile, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued as constant as in the beginning, wherwith to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a displeasure in <hi>Alexander,</hi> who seemed to gréeue to sée so valiant a dogge so lothsomely dismembred, the Lord tolde him he had two other of the same litter, wherof he made at the same time offer to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King, with charge, that according to their natures, he must proue them against either Lions or Elephants, seeing customably they contemne all other beasts, yelding no glory to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victory which is got of others of baser condition.

out all the world, and be suche sure kéepers of theyr goods, that they wil die rather than suffer them to be taken away. Which is verye well verified in a dialogue wherin <hi>Plutarch</hi> séemes to dispute whether beastes haue reason or not, confirming it by an example of the faith of a straunge dogge, the same being of harde beléefe, were it not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of him that writ it. The <hi>Athenians</hi> (saith he) had a Temple called the Temple of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> garnished with great treasure and riches, for the gard whereof, they kéepe only an excellent dogge called <hi>Caparus,</hi> notwythstanding whose barking and other meanes of defence vsed by him, certaine théeues brake in one night, and toke away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most precious iewels that were in the temple: the dogge séeing the Sexteus with other Wardens of the church, were not moued with his barking at the théeues, runneth out of the Temple as enraged or madde, and pursueth the théefe that fled afore him, not leauing to follow hym, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding his threats and stones which he cast at him. The day being come, the dogge stayed alwayes where the theefe rested, without comming neare him for feare of harme: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well considered of the fellone, who to preuent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which would not be auoided, offred bread to the dogge, which he did not onely refuse to touche, but also did not forbeare to barke without ceassing: which being heard of certaine pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers that way, the reporte came to <hi>Athens,</hi> by which meanes hue and cry was sent forth, and the thefe taken at <hi>Cromion:</hi> but the sporte was to sée the dogge skip and leape afore the fellon, reioysing as thoughe the théefe were hys praie, and taken by hys meanes: for which cause the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens</hi> ordained him to be nourished at the charges of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, and gaue him in custody to the Priests of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. There is also spoken of in diuers Historyes, a like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the fidelitie of a dogge, found by the king <hi>Pirrhus</hi> as he passed with his army, garding the dead bodye of his maister slaine by the high way side, being not so muche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:5864:111"/>
at the view of the mortified ghost of him that lay deade, as double amased when he vnderstoode by certaine paisantes of the Countrey, that the dogge had not stirred out of that place for thrée dayes, without desiring either to drinke or eat. The king for compassion of the dead carkas commaunded it to be buryed, and the dogge for his faith to his master, to be nourished in some conuenient place. And as no inquisition or pollicie could trie out the murder, what diligence so euer was vsed: so it chaunced that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dayes after, the King taking a view or muster of his people, assisting it in his owne person, the dogge attended the King, and lay very stil and quiet at his foote, til it came to their turnes that had killed his maister, to passe along by the king: when the dogge vpon a sodaine (venting as it were the murderers) assailed them with such furie, as if strength had agréed with his good will) he wold haue torne them in péeces: but being not able to performe the effect of his meaning, he loked here and there, giuing out suche ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of pity, according to his dumme kind, as if he had demaunded iustice of the murder at the kings handes. The same mouing in him and the rest of the assistants such sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of the facte in them whome the dogge assailed, that what with torment and other examination, they confessed the matter, &amp; were punished accordingly.

            <p>The <hi>Romane</hi> histories giue also great commendation to the fidelitie of the dogge of <hi>Titus Fabius,</hi> who being conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the iustice of the Senate, and his body laid dead vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, the dogge did not only accompany the dead carkasse, but made such a pitifull howling and crying, that he stirred the assista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to compassion, who (to appease him) if they offred him bread, he tooke it, and in the presence of them all by such meanes as he could, he opened the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mouth of his master, and put in the bread, thinking that as he sawe his distresse, so he would relieue it by meanes as he best might: but that which is more wonderfull tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the faith of this dogge, was, in that the bodye of hys master being cast into <hi>Tyber</hi> (according to their custome at that time to bury dead men) the dogge leaped also into the riuer, not ceasing to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with the waues, till he had got holde of his maister, whom by maine strength he did not only support and kepe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinking, but also drewe him out to the shore, thinking he had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deliuered him from peril. By this and such other may we discerne in some respects a more great faith and amitie in these brute beastes, than in reasonable creatures, who for the most parte now a dayes obserue the order of the swallow, shunning (as they doe the roofe in the winter) their frends touched with any aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or sinister fortune: for whych cause also <hi>Masinissa</hi> the great king of <hi>Numidia,</hi> would neuer commit the garde of his body by night to the faith of men, but vsed for hys saue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that way the company of .viij. or .x<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> great dogges, whom he brought vp for the nonce, and made them be shut in hys cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber by night, to the ende that by their barking he might be warned of any peril: which remaineth in practise at this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And although he haue dilated on this Historie suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, yet notwithstanding, I will write thereof more at large in that I shal be able. He writeth to the Emperour <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> that in the yeare .1545. there was at <hi>Vienne</hi> in <hi>Austrice,</hi> a certain woman named <hi>Margareta,</hi> the wife of a Citizen of that towne called <hi>George Wolczer,</hi> who being quicke with childe from <hi>S.

But when they came to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict of Nature, and hoped to haue receiued the childe, they perceiued such a brute &amp; noise as it had ben a thunder clap within the belly of that poore martir, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which made them to thinke, that the child was dead with the great striuing and battaile that it had with Nature.

by the consideration of this Birde, being moued by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument, if not that they obserued one litle bird of extreme beautie, which at no time touched the earth, but sometimes fell dead from the height of heauen. And as the <hi>Mahometists</hi> trauailed with them, they shewed them this birde, persuading them that she came from <hi>Paradise,</hi> which was a delicious place, where the dead soules toke their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: wherby that people grosse and barbarous, beleuing that which the <hi>Turkes</hi> declared to them, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very curious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to examine of their law, and in the ende became <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metists,</hi> and folow at this day the <hi>Mahomet</hi> law: for which cause they name that birde <hi>Manucodiata,</hi> that is to say, the birde of God, which birde they haue in such reuerence and honour, that the Kings hauing hir aboute them, accompte themselues sufficiently guarded from all perill and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of warre: wherupon the Kings of the Isles aforesayd, did send to <hi>Charles</hi> the fift Emperor, fiue of these litle bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des dead: for as we sayd before, they were neuer taken by any man aliue. <hi>Maximilianus Transsiluanus Gesnerus,</hi> pursuing the Historie of this birde, addeth yet that whiche foloweth: I haue (saith he) attained to write these things by the letters of <hi>Melchior Guillandin Beruce,</hi> a man great in science and doctrine, whiche were brought vnto me to <hi>Padoue,</hi> by the which he writeth hir the birde of <hi>Paradyse,</hi> as here foloweth: Albeit those which haue left in writing the nauigation of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to straunge countreys, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and affirme, that there is a little bird bred and borne in the Isles of <hi>Moluques,</hi> very pleasaunt and of singular beautie, wherof the body is but litle, notwithstandyng by reason of the hugenesse of hir feathers, she séemeth more great, which be brode and houering, disposed in a rounde, in such sort that they represente the circuite of a circle. That little birde representeth in greatnesse and forme a Quaile, being adorned and decked with feathers of diuers colours most faire and bautifull, contenting very muche
<pb facs="tcp:5864:123"/>
the eyes of those which behelde hir: hir head proportioned to the body, somewhat more great than a swallow, hir fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which decke the height of hir, from the vppermoste part of the bones of the skurfe of hir neck to the mydst of hir beake, be short, great, hard, thick, and of a yealowe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and shineth like the purest golde, or the beames of the Sunne: the others which couer hir chin be moste deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, tender, and resemble a piercyng coloure like to the gréene, and not much vnlike to those whiche we see vpon the heades of <hi>Canardes,</hi> being directly against the sunne. That birde hath no féete, and is very like a Hearon, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the feathers of hir wings, sauing that they be more tender and long, holden of a broune colour, participating with redde and blacke. The male of that birde hath a hole vpon the skurfe of his back, where the female putteth and hatcheth hir egges, and not relieued by other meate, than the dewe of heauen, whiche serueth them for meate and drinke. And who lyst to visite the inwarde parts of thys byrde, shall fynde hir full of fat or grease, whereof I may boldly talk, bicause I haue séene two, without legs, which is contrary to the writing of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who affirmeth, that no birde wanteth féete: he dwelleth alwayes in the ayre. I am sure this would amaze you to write wholy the form of this bird by his particulars, as <hi>Gesnerus</hi> writeth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the witnesse of the foresayd authors. Albeit, who is desirous to sée a more ample description thereof, reade that which the sayd <hi>Gesnerus</hi> hath written in the chapter, where he treateth of the birde of <hi>Paradise,</hi> or in the boke of <hi>Auium natura. Hieromeus Cardanus</hi> in his bokes <hi>de subtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> or place where he writeth of perfect beasts, reporteth the like to that which foloweth. In the sayd Isles of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luques,</hi> they haue found vpon the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or in the sea, one dead bird called <hi>Manucondiata,</hi> which is as much to saye in the <hi>Indians</hi> toung, as the birde of God, or Birde of <hi>Paradise,</hi> whiche they haue not séene on liue, for that it hathe no
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:5864:123"/>
féete. Which for my part I haue séene thrée or .iiij. tymes, and alwayes wanting those membres: she dwelleth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in the aire, and that very high and farre of. Shée beareth a body and a beake muche like the sea swallowe both in bignesse and other forme, the quilles of hir wings and tayle be full as bigge as those of an Eagle, when she aduaunceth or stretcheth them abroade. Hir feathers bee very small, and moste lyke (reseruing their litlenesse) to the plumes of a Pehenne or a she Peacocke, and differing in that poynt from the Peacocke hym selfe, bycause these feathers haue not suche starres or eyes as we sée in the tayle of a Peacocke. The backe of the male of this birde is holowe: where by moste reason the female dothe laye hir egges, seing hir belly is also hollow, the same arguyng that by the hollownesse of the one and other, she layeth and hatcheth hir eggs: there is in the taile of the male, a thréede of the length of thrée shaftments, blacke in colour, neither rounde nor square, of an ordinarie bignesse, not much vnlyke to a Shoemakers thréede, by the whyche it may be presumed, that the female is tied and ioyned to his backe, whilest she layeth and hatcheth hir egges. It is moste certaine, that as she remayneth continually in the ayre, so lykewise when hir wyngs and tayle be drawne into a roundnesse, she supporteth hir selfe that way, and being wearie, she becommeth as she was afore. She doth lyue by none other foode than by the dewe of Heauen, whiche serueth hir bothe to eate and also to dryncke, the same arguing a wonderfull diligence and maruell of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to make suche prouysion for this byrde in the ayre. It séemeth not that she shoulde be nouryshed of pure Aire onely, bicause it is too subtile, and it is not likely that she shoulde be nourished of small Beastes and Flies, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the substaunce wherevppon these Creatures bée fourmed, is not engendred in the aire, neither hath there ben founde any such digestion in the bellie of thys Birde,
<pb facs="tcp:5864:124"/>
as they haue written of hir that haue séene hir deade: she hath not hir relief of the vapour which ascendeth from the earth, bicause she was neuer sene to discend so lowe: besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, there is often perill in vapours, and this birde is not consumed but by olde age: all which proue, that she is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fedde and preserued vpon the dewe that falleth in the night. Wherwith ende the opinions of <hi>Galene</hi> and other late writers touching the properties of this bird. Neither can it much disagrée from our purpose of straunge birdes, to auouche in this place the authoritie of <hi>Hector Boetius,</hi> and <hi>Saxo,</hi> who write, that they founde certaine Trées in <hi>Scotlande,</hi> whose frute being lapped within the leaues, and the same fallyng into the water in some conuenient time take life, and turne into a liuing birde, whiche they call a Trée bird. This trée groweth in the yle of <hi>Pomonne,</hi> which is not farre from <hi>Scotlande,</hi> towards the north, the which is verified in some sort by <hi>Aeneas Siluius,</hi> affirmyng that he hath heard, that in <hi>Scotlande</hi> is a trée growing for the most part vpon the banke of a ryuer, which brought forth frute of forme &amp; likenesse to a <hi>de Caunes</hi> réede, which being ripe, fall off themselues, some into the water, and some vpon the lande, and those whiche take the water, are séene to haue life, and swymme vpon the waues: and after certain time to take wings and flie into the aire, which notwithstanding by diligent inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath not ben founde in <hi>Scotlande</hi> but rather in the Iles of <hi>Orchades.</hi>

searche whether there hath ben any such monstrous thing within the courte or not: so if it be true (as it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, in respect of the authoritie of him that wryt it) I think nature hath neuer brought out or formed any thing more maruellous, amongest all the monsters that euer were: for besydes the monstrous and fearefull figure of thys Serpent, there is yet a further consideration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde touchyng the faces, which bothe in view and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment séeme more humaine than brutal: but touchyng the multitude of hir heades, me thinketh it oughte to argue no great strangenesse, to fynde serpents with two or .iij. heades, seing we haue and meane to make mention of bothe men and women that haue hadde no lesse, the same being also witnessed by certaine of our late writers, who trauailyng into <hi>India,</hi> haue séene the same. <hi>Ludouicus Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomanus</hi> in his boke of the peregrinations of the <hi>Indians</hi> sayth, that he hath séen in <hi>Calycut,</hi> fourfooted serpents brée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding within certain marshes, which contain for the height of their body, the bygnesse of a Hog, but of an vgly foule and deformed head: he maketh also mention of an other kinde of serpents which be so venomous, that as soone as they touche or pierce the blood of a man, he falleth forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with dead to the ground.

These hunters beholding at large and with discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the orders and doings of this Serpente, whome they accompted without policie or vnderstandyng, beganne to marche neare him, thinking to take him with their coards and chaynes: but being come within his full view, &amp; that they sawe his eyes flame as fire, his huge and great téeth: and being astonied withal at the hideous noisemade by his hard scales or finnes when he moued on eyther side, and lastly notyng his other fearfull regards of his heade, they began to stande in more awe of the daunger than able to attempt it to the vttermost effect of their meanyng: and yet notwithstanding this feare, thei cast forth their hookes and coardes vpon his taile, which so kindled his fury vpon a sodaine, that he assailed them forthwith with hissing and horrible noyse at his mouth, deuouring at one morsell him that was nexte him, throwing his taile aboute an other of the company, who likewise passed the same way: the same so amazing the rest that they reskued themselues by flight without inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t eftsoones to practise their deuise: albeit not long after the hope of gaine &amp; profit ouercame the present perill and daunger they were in, for that they proued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him a seconde experience rather by arte and policie than strength, making of great cordes hollowe as a bowe net sufficient byg by their estimation, to contain within it the sayd serpent: and then noting diligentely his place of

retire with his times of comming and going, as sone as he was gone abrode to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for some pray, they stopped the entrie of his caue with stones and earth, &amp; by and by made a vault or hollow hole in the grounde, neare to the other where they laid their net: the effect and successe answered fully the meaning of their deuise, for after the serpent had fed sufficiently abrode, and repairing towards his place of rest, was amazed when he heard himselfe pursued with a great noise of trumpets, horsses, dogges and men, whose brute made the whole aire sound after him, and thinking lastly to saue himselfe in his denne, was forthwith ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne in the net, and so ouercharged with blowes (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his force) that he yelded vnwillingly to the snares of the hunters, who, to preuent any mischiefe by his mouth, knocked out his téethe, and so wrapped in his nette as he was taken, they caried him into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him to the King, who wondring no lesse at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the beast, than their pollicie in taking him, gaue order from that time forward, to preserue him with a thin diet, to the end to diminishe his strength, which being iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obserued, made this horrible Serpent, by succession of time so tame and familiar, that he made him to be shewed as a thing of great miracle to straungers, that came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site him: it appeareth in a volume or remembraunce of the acts of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that in the pursute of <hi>Porus</hi> king of <hi>India,</hi> (who fled afore his furie) he found among the deserts &amp; bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sandes many Serpents called <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

oppressed with an extreme drought, that they be neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward satisfied with drinking, being so distempered that way, that the more he drinkes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more he desireth to drink: the same beeing the cause (as <hi>Dioscorides</hi> wryteth) that the auncient Phisitians, finding no remedy able to encounter this venomous infection, haue lefte it at large and vncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There is a kind of Serpent considered of by the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, which is called <hi>Boza,</hi> who féedes most commonly of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> milke of a Cow: He, if he haue time to assist his inclination, becomes very huge and bigge, which was very wel appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the time of <hi>Claudius Caesar,</hi> when one of them was taken and killed, in whose belly was found a whole childe. <hi>Plutarche</hi> is of opinion, that euen as Honye flies are engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of beasts, waspes of horsses, &amp; hornet of asses, so may it be, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of the marrow and carion of men certain kind of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents are bred: which he iustifieth in that he affirmeth, that many (by reason of this corruption) haue bene bredde in graues and Sepulchres of men. Which (accordyng to mine authour) happened in <hi>Auignon,</hi> in the time of hys studie there, where a simple Artisian, opening the lidde of a coffer of leade, wherein was a deade man included, was bitten of a Serpent, which was of suche mortall operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if he had not ben spedely rescued, he had dyed of the infection. <hi>Conradus Lychostenes,</hi> in his prodigious workes, writeth that in September, the yeare a thousand four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ninety and foure, there was a woman in <hi>Cracouye</hi> in a place called the holy Ghost, who was deliuered of a dead childe, hauing tied at his backe a quicke Serpent, which ceassed not to deuoure and gnawe the deade bones of the childe: neyther is that of lesse maruell whereof <hi>Baptista Leo</hi> makes mention in the time of Pope <hi>Martine</hi> the fifth, when he sayeth was founde amongste a sorte of rockes or stones, a great Serpent on liue, the same being so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed wyth a heauy stone, that there appeared neyther place to discerne him, nor hole from whence he might ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

And although she containe not aboue one foote in length, yet is hir poyson so strong &amp; venimous, as she killeth other Serpents wyth the very breathe that commeth from hir fore ende: she is so mortally venomous, that she infecteth and ouerwhelmeth great Cityes with the aire or breath of hir mouth, the same approued not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the historians prophane, as <hi>Dioscorides, Plinie Aelian, Lucian, Isidorus,</hi> with many mo, but also confirmed in some sort by the Ecclesiasticals.</p>

iudged that there was within the caue a <hi>Basilicke,</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise is called <hi>Serpens Regalis.</hi> Wherin as we haue now (as I thinke) treated sufficiently of certaine straunge and monstrous Serpents found in sundry prouinces &amp; partes of the world, it is no lesse necessary (in mine opinion) to search out certain singular things which are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in some particular kindes of them: those which haue treated of the nature of Serpents, haue obserued chiefly that their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements smell sweete, which by natural reason may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede of their drinesse: for Serpents of their owne nature be dry, the same arguing that their excrementes be well boiled by reason of the straitnesse of their intrails. Some affirme that Serpents haue so odiferous a breath, that it séemes as swéete as Muske. There be Serpentes which kepe their venome after their death, as the Uipers, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise their flesh could little profite to the composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Triacle, if they were altogither without poyson. Besides, wherupon could come the excoriation in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that hath eaten them, if they did not reserue some poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? It hath chaunced in our time that such as haue taken of the hide from a beast, that hath perished of the biting of a Uiper, die also of the like disease. <hi>Dioscorides</hi> in his sixth booke wher he treateth of poisons and venomes, saith that immediatly after a man is bitten with a Uiper, the biting swelleth and becometh dry, and of a whitish coloure: there appeareth in the beginning of the biting a fiery anguishe, all died with bloud, which doth force out of the flesh round about it, certaine blisters, as if they had bene burnt wyth fire, then foloweth an viceration, then they bléede &amp; swell, touching those partes that be about the liuer, whereupon are procured vomites of choler, heauie sléepe, shaking tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the whole body, Passions of the vrine and cold sweat. Certaine late Phisitians are of opinion that the Uiper is no other thing than the Serpent which we call in <hi>Fraunce</hi> the <hi>Aspic.</hi> Some do affirme that the Uiper doth abhorre
<pb facs="tcp:5864:129"/>
a naked man, and feareth him more than if he were clad with garments. The Phisitians are of opinion that if a mannes eyes be rubbed euery morning with the skin or flough of a Uiper, his sight shall neuer be dimme nor hurt with suffusion, affirming besides, that if an olde floughe be burned when the Moone is full, and in the first part of the signe of <hi>Aries,</hi> and that the cenders be sprinkled vpon a mannes head, it stirres vp terrible dreames. <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Dioscorides</hi> auouche that the earth neuer receiues within hir entrails, the Serpent that hath once bit a man, seming (as it were in respecte and reuerence of a certaine royall benignitie) to haue in horror him that hathe offended the King, chiefe and Prince of all beastes. <hi>Plinie</hi> wryteth that the spittle of a man, specially of him that is fasting, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous to a Serpent, in so much that if he but taste of it neuer so little, he dieth, and that which more is, if a man but poure it vpon him, it offendes him no lesse than if he had skalding water cast vpon him.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the father against his childe, began to feele as it were a furious warre in his mynde: for as the pitie and innocencie of the infant, withdrewe hym on the one side, so the commaundement of his maister tormented him on the other: albeit reason &amp; remorse of conscience in the end so muche preuailed, as pitie obtained the victorie: in such sort that he resolued not onely to saue the life of the childe but also to cause him to be brought vp in som secret place, without the knowledge of his maister: notwithstanding he coulde not so wel play his part, but that within certain days after, the king <hi>Astiages</hi> did discouer his friende, and that against his will, howe he had saued the life of his son, which he dissembled for a tyme with a good countenance, in such sort, that poore <hi>Arpalus</hi> thynking hym selfe cleare from suspition, and liuing in that libertie of minde, was astonished, that hys maister caused him to be called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him at dinner, hauyng besides made to be killed one of the children of <hi>Arpalus,</hi> which he caused to be so wel seasoned and disguised by hys Cookes, that it was hardly to be discerned what meate it was, causing the same to be serued at the table, without any knowledge to him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: by reason wherof, the poore <hi>Arpalus</hi> mystrustyng no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, did eate therof willingly.

that it was his flesh, bloud and bones which he had eaten, after his rage and crueltie a little appeased, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded pleasantly, and in manner scoffingly, if those meates were not well seasoned and well liked of him: to whom poore <hi>Arpalus,</hi> troubled of an extreme compassion in his mind, fearing him to be angry, answered him soberly, that all was good at the table of a King.

onely content with the killing of an infinite number of persons, by the furie and force of the foure Elementes, as broyling some, drowning others, burying some quick, and making others to be smothered: but besides, searching out more great and horrible wonder in nature, he caused the dead to kil the liuing, by tying the bodies of liuing men to the bodies of the deade, face to face, and mouth to mouthe, leauing them so, till that those which were dead, by their putrifaction had killed the liuing. Let vs passe vnder sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that butcher of <hi>Sathan, Tiberius</hi> the Emperour, who me séemeth hath surpassed in crueltie all those wherof the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians haue at any time made mention: for he forbad vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paine of death, (that which no man hath read of other, but of him, which was) that for the great number of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent men which he caused to die, there should no man la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wéepe, sigh, or make other like dole: and he had of <hi>Satrapaes,</hi> and ministers expresly deputed to execute these cruelties, who had no other charge than to spie and marke with regard héere &amp; there if any man wept, or sighed from his heart, or gaue any other witnesse of sorow or griefe, to the end he might be brought forthwith to the place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, to be punished with the like pain to him, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie he lamented. All these cruelties &amp; tirannies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore specified, be extreme, but those which follow be most brutal, and executed of a rare and straunge fashion: for in the first they touched but liuing creatures, but in these that follow, they fight with those that be deade. <hi>Cambises</hi> King of the <hi>Persians,</hi> was not satisfied with the cruell murthering of <hi>Psamenitus</hi> king of <hi>Egipt</hi> and many others: But besides that being at <hi>Caire,</hi> be caused the carkas of <hi>Damasus</hi> to be drawne out of his tombe, causing the same not only most shamefully to be whipped, pricked full of bodkins, as though he had bene aliue, but in the ende broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it (as <hi>Herodotus</hi> witnesseth) which he proued not only on the behalfe of men, but performed the like on women,

to whom the lawes of pitie be for the most parte most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar.

or adulterour shal not possesse at all the kingdom of God. Wherfore amongst the most principall causes that moued God to drowne the world, was chiefly this wicked vice of whoredom: fiue famous Cities (as it is written in the booke of <hi>Moyses</hi>) became ruinous and ouerthrowne for their disordred and wicked liues. In the booke of numbers xij. kings were hanged, and .24000. men killed for comit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of whoredom. It is wrytten in <hi>Leuiticus</hi> xxviij. chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how the <hi>Chananeans</hi> were afflicted &amp; punished for their whordome: wel nigh all the line of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> (as you may read in the .xxxix. of the Iudges) was afflicted for commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fornication wyth the <hi>Leuites</hi> wife. Diuers greuous punishments were sent vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> for his whoredom, as you may read in the booke of the Kings. <hi>Salomon</hi> for the same cause and committing Idolatrie, became reprobate: wherefore <hi>S.
