         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The verity of this aſſertion we may ſee deeply imprinted in
bloody Characters, throughout the whole ſeries of Engliſh

            </p>
            <p>For our liberty, we can indeed ſhew many of our Kings
large, and good deeds, but few or none of their actions, their
hands alwaies having been too hard for their Seals, Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

Millions, both in Blood, and Treaſure, but let us but paſs
by their promiſes, and view their performances, and we

appears in our Chronicles, where though in the <hi>Theorie</hi> and
<hi>Syſtem</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government hath been limited, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

The Poets fable of <hi>Tantalus</hi> hath been verified in us, who
though we have been ſet up to the chinne in freedom, and
have had liberty bobbing at our lips, yet never could we get
a drop to ſquench our thirſts, or a ſnap to ſtay our ſtomacks,
this being added to our ſufferings, to want in the midſt of
ſeeming abundance, and as the vulgar have it, to ſtarve in a
Cooks ſhop, a trick thoſe Lords we term abſolute were never
ingenuous enough to torment their ſlaves with.</p>
            <p>Were there then no more but this, we might well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

who weare the title of Maſter Tyrants, at the Norman exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which hath thought it beneath a Princes anger to give

ſlavery unleſſe he can make his vaſſals feel the lingring effects
of his Tyranny: it was not enough for us to be ſlaves unleſs
we knew it, leſt otherwiſe not deſiring freedom, we ſhould
not have been ſo ſenſible of their power; we muſt with <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>

and cheat us to our faces.</p>
            <p>Happy and thrice happy may <hi>England</hi> call the condition
of <hi>Turke, Ruſſe,</hi> or <hi>Moor,</hi> who depending only upon their

have bin ſo often forced to rampire in parchment liberty from
the fury of other Tyrant, and as their laſt wills to deliver a few
writen Charters to their ſons, who were alſo to fight, and pay
for them as they did, and be as much the better then too as
they were: For to ſum up all, theſe our ſo dear liberties
were of no other uſe than to drein our purſes as well as veins,
that when <hi>Englands</hi> generous bloud ſeemed encreaſed too
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110807:7"/>
to tamely ſuffer Norman Lords to trample on her upon this
pretence it might be let out; or when her Kings wanted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
they might by theſe lures draw ſubſidies to their fiſts,
and ſo hang them by till the next occaſion; but I humbly
conceive that if our Anceſtors had taken that courſe a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
once did, when he was choſen to judg between a Cook,
and a Country-man, and as their Kings fed them with a
ſight of Liberty, ſupplied them againe with chinking of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
&amp; have executed juſtice without reſpect of perſons, they
had in all probability diverted thoſe plagues, which the
crying ſins of oppreſſion and murder have brought down
from Heaven upon this Nation. But let us deſcend from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls,
and view but the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the very
Idea of Tyranny, and exact copie after which all other Kings
have writ, eſpecially the laſt, and we ſhall not only behold the
map of our Anceſtors miſerie, and folly, but alſo perceive our
own happineſſe, and Gods mercie in not ſuffering us to be
deluded and baffeled as they were.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of the civill flames kindled between Tyranny
and liberty, King <hi>Iohn</hi> expiring, his ſonne <hi>Henry</hi> the third, a
child of nine years of age, by the power of <hi>William Marſhall</hi>
Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> and the conſent of moſt of the Barons, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends
the Throne: and here we may obſerve the unadviſed
lenitie of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords, who not conſidering what was
bred in the bone would not eaſily out in the fleſh, ſo eaſily
accepted of the Sonne, though the Father had plaid the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and Traitor to the height, giving the Crown to the
Pope (he would be a ſlave himſelf rather than they ſhould
not) trampling upon the people, yea deteſting the whole
Nation, as his grief becauſe Corne was ſo cheap when he
thought he had waſted al may make out: But Gods time was
not come, and he was pleaſed to ſet their example to guide
poſterity from ſplitting on that Rock, I mean ſuch
of them who when they have eyes will make uſe of
them.</p>
            <p>But to ſay the truth they were Lords, whom Kings knew
ſo well to cajole, or at worſt ſet ſo together by the ears,
that they could command them into their traps at liſt; let but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110807:7"/>
one have that Earldome, the other this Lordſhip, and their
turns were ſerved, others may ſhift for themſelves if they
can; beſides it was none of their intereſt to ſtub up Tyranny
by the roots, for then down had gon their branches too;
for they knew that when that tree was feld, the Rooks neſt,
muſt to ground with it; but we may be ſilent in this and give
experience leave to ſpeak for us.</p>
            <p>And yet let us but look a litttle further than the gilded,
and embroydered ſuperficies, and we ſhall perceive that theſe
Lordlings eſtate was but even by ſo much more free, and
happy than the Commons, by how much that King of <hi>Cypreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
condition was bettered, when his Iron ſhackles and chains
were converted into ſilver fetters: they enjoyed a little more
gaudie ſervitude, and to ſpeak to the capacity of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman
were as the Fore-horſes in the teame, which though
they weare, the Feather, and have the Bels about their eares,
yet muſt draw themſelves as well as thoſe that follow; nay
and if they did ſeem unwilling to lead, they were ſure to be
laſh'd by the Royall Carters till the bloud came, and have
their gay trappings to boot pul'd over their eares: and this
the wiſe and generous of them knew, and often endeavoured
to remedy, but were ſtill prevented by the envy and jealouſie
one of another, which was created and caſt in among them by
their Kings, as partly will appeare in the following ſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> being thus Crowned at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and many great
Barons daily reſorting to his party (moved both by the proud
carriage of the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and the confeſſion of the Viſcount
<hi>Melun,</hi> That <hi>Lewis</hi> had taken an Oath, and all his Lords, to
deſtroy the Engliſh Nobility) raiſeth a great Army, defeateth
at <hi>Lincolne</hi> his enemies, and forceth <hi>Lewis</hi> to condeſcend to
an accord, depart the Land, and abjure his claim to the Crown,
which for two years he had worn over the greateſt part of the
Land: for <hi>Iohn</hi> by his tyranny ſo galled the Peoples neckes,
that for eaſe they were forced to get a new yoke, and elect
<hi>Lewis,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings ſonne, to defend them againſt his
cruelty, ſuch effects wrought the violence of an unruly King,
and the deſperation of an oppreſſed people.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. Yeare</note>The agreement on <hi>Henrys</hi> part was to reſtore to the Barons,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110807:8"/>
and people all rights and heritages, with the Liberties for
which the diſcord aroſe between <hi>John,</hi> and them, to pardon al
that had aided <hi>Lewis,</hi> and ſet free all Priſoners of Warre, and
to doe this he takes his Oath, or for him the Popes Legat, and
Protectour.</p>
            <p>The Protectour dyes,<note place="margin">4. Year.</note> a man of great wiſdom and valor, and
who had managed affairs to the great ſettlement of the State:
and the King is again Crowned, and Eſcuage of 2. markes a
Knights Fee granted him in Parliament he promiſing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
their Liberties when he came of age.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">8. Year.</note>
               <hi>Henry</hi> having gotten ſome of his Fathers old Counſellors
about him, begins to play <hi>Rex,</hi> and obtains a Bull from the
Pope, whereby he was adjudged of age ſufficient to receive
the Government into his own hands (the power of making &amp;
altering times and ſeaſons it ſeems being then in the Romiſh
Prelats Power) and now ſith He would be of age, in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Archbiſh. of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and the
Lords deſire him to confirm according to Covenant their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Liberties. This was impiouſly oppugned by ſome (as
Princes ſhall ever find mouths to expreſſe their pleaſures) of
his Miniſters, who urged it to have been an act of Conſtraint;
yet at laſt it was promiſed to be ratified by the King, and ſo
by that uſual ſhift of prolongation was put off for that time, to
the greater vexation of that following; for this all his Raigne
cauſed the imbroylments, rendred Him odious to the people,
and made him a far leſſe King by ſtriving to be more than he
was, a juſt reward of violations.</p>
            <p>But this pauſe turned the bloud, and ſhewed how ſenſible
the State was, in the leaſt ſtoppage of that tender veine: For
the Lords began to aſſemble at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> but the Archbiſh of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> (whom the King by fair words ſooth'd into a fools
paradice) by menacing excommunication brought them in; the
King alſo to be even with them, demands a reſtauration of all
thoſe things they had received from his Anceſtors, and to
terrifie them for the future, falls upon the chief ſticklers, taking
divers Lordſhips from them, thus were they forced to ſit down
with loſſe of both Lands and Liberties, and ſuch of them whoſe
ſpirits could not brook the ſight of the Coutt abuſive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110807:8"/>
ſecretly to jogge away into the Countrey.</p>
            <p>The Royall gamſter having dealt ſo well for himſelf, yet
on the ſudden is put to his trumps, yea forced to ſhuffle, and
cut too; Money is wanting to maintain his Wars in <hi>France,</hi>
and this his ranting Counſellours cannot help him too; they
who were ſo high in the laſt Parliament, are fain now to
lower their ſails, the Lions hide muſt be patched up with the
Foxes skin, he muſt promiſe and do any thing for preſent
caſh: A Parliament therefore is ſummoned to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
and of them a relief demanded, but no pennie,<note place="margin">IX<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yeare,</note> without a
<hi>Pater noſter,</hi> no money unleſs their Liberties be confirmed;
and now neceſſity which makes the Old Wife trot, perſwades
<hi>Henry</hi> to be ſo gracious to himſelfe as to comply with them.
Thus <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and <hi>Charta de Fireſta</hi> were confirmed,
which though purchaſed before, and then entred upon and
poſſeſt by the people, yet have been paid for to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
if we conſider the ſums given ſince, and to little or none
if we ſum but up the profit our Landlords let us reap by them.
<hi>Thus the Petition of Right and other later acts were obtained
by us, which being acts of grace were to ceaſe when our King
pleaſed to turn graceleſſe, which he never did, nor intended to
doe untill the firſt oppertunity, wherein a ſmall rub called im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
might be removed out of his way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Lawes thus obtained; downe go the foreſts, and
men repoſſeſs their habitations, which the Norman Lords had
outed them of and beſtowed upon Wild Beaſts, yet more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive
than themſelves, for if <hi>Cato</hi> have any credit, we
muſt believe Kings to be <hi>de genere Beſtiarum rapacium,</hi> no
better nor worſe than ravenous beaſts, and indeed that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
Author Doctor Experience hath by arguments not
to be diſputed againſt confirmed that wiſe Romans aſſertion,
indeed the laſt of Romans who abhorred to outlive the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and honour of his Country.</p>
            <p>And now if we will believe one Writer, the very Doggs
rejoyced, being freed from the cuſtomary danger of loſing
their clawes; but though the Gentleman is ſo ſanguine now,
yet he afterwards becomes as cholerick, and from playing
with, turns to play the very Curre, barking and ſnarling at
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110807:9"/>
all thoſe Lords which ſtood for theſe Lawes: O the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
power of ſlaviſh flattery, working more than a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
change in low Souls, making a man out of his own
mouth judg himfelf leſſe deſerving of Liberty becauſe leſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of it than a Dogge that will fawne and wag his taile at
him who unchains him, whilſt he crouches, and licks his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
who enſlaves and fetters him. But take one obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
along: That as the Norman Conqueror firſt appropriated
all old Foreſts, and diſpeopled places to make new ones, and
ſtill when any parcell of Liberty was regained, thoſe Foreſt
Tyrannies were diminiſhed; ſo now when that Norman yoak
is thrown off our necks, Foreſts and Parks are broken open
with it; a certain ſigne that tyranny is expired now that its
pulſe is ceaſed in the main Arterie. Thus the Hiſtorian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
the Grove of Bayes dyed, which was planted by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi>
when <hi>Nero</hi> was executed, in whom ceaſed that proud,
and bloody Family.</p>
            <p>Another Parliament is called, wherein nothing was done by
reaſon of the Kings ſickneſſe,<note place="margin">10. Year.</note> but only the Legats unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
demands denyed, the Pope being become more than
quarter-maſter in <hi>England,</hi> by the Kings good Fathers means;
in this year alſo the Londoners were fined 5000 marks, and
the Burgeſſes of Northampton 1200 pounds (for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
aiding <hi>Lewis</hi>) contrary to the Oath and Pardon paſſed
at the agreement, as the Prelates were before, who were
made to pay ſuch large ſums that the Legat got 12000 marks
for his ſhare.</p>
            <p>A Parliament is ſummoned at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
himſelf to be of lawfull age,<note place="margin">11. Year</note> aſſumes the power of
Government to himſelf; this he had done before by the
Popes Bull, but it was requiſite for his deſign to grow child
again, and the Pope was contented to have his Bull turn
Calf to help his Son, whom he knew might make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends;
and now to ſhew what metall he was made on, he
cancels and diſanuls the Charters as granted in his nonage,
and ſo of no validitie. Here we may behold the wretchleſs
impudence of theſe Royall Creatures, he that had before in
the eighth year of his Raign, made himſelf of age for his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:110807:9"/>
own ends, yet now is not aſhamed upon the ſame ſcore to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
nonage in the ninth year, wherein he confirmed both
the Charters: Thus if the King ſay 8. is more than 9. the
people muſt believe it, for it is treaſon no doubt to queſtion
their Soveraignes words or actions, and Rebellion to chop
Logick with him,</p>
            <p>And now this cancelling having annulled all hopes of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidie,
He hath a new ſhift to drain the peoples purſes, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a new Seal, and forcing all which held any thing by the
old to renew their Patents, fining at the pleaſure of the Chief
Iuſticiarie, not according to their ability; It ſeemes the Old
Seal was under age too, and for this he had a Bul, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the Pope, or ſomebody elſe, is the queſtion.</p>
            <p>Theſe perfidious and oppreſſive courſes ſo incenſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that the Lords appoint a Randezvouz at <hi>Stamford,</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it ſeems to bait theſe Buls, &amp; by force to keep them from
goring. The King is ſtartled at this news, hearing his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Earl of <hi>Cornewall</hi> was alſo joyned to them, and by
feare brought to promiſe a redreſſe, and ſo pacifies them at
<hi>Northampton,</hi> and buyes his brother to ſide with him, with
his mothers Dower, and all the Lands in <hi>England</hi> belonging
to the Earl of <hi>Britain,</hi> and late Earl of <hi>Bullogne.</hi> Theſe are
the uneven paths which neceſſity forces Tyrants to ſtagger
through, ſcraching up here, and leaving a piece there, uſing the
Rake with this hand, and the Fork with that; <hi>Peter</hi> muſt be
rob'd to pay <hi>Paul;</hi> theſe pilled and polled, to bribe the other:
but theſe ſhifts will be quickly thredbare, by which, what is
got in the Hundred is loſt in the Shire.</p>
            <p>The King having bound himſelf, by his Procurators at

               <note place="margin">13. Year.</note> to the payment of Tenths, it ſeems the Pope would not
do a job of journeywork for nothing, cals a Parliament that
the Legat might demand them; but though the Legat was
impudent enough to aſk the queſtion, yet the Laity were ſo
modeſt as to deny him; the Clergy being over-reachd by
<hi>Segrave</hi> one of the Kings Counſell conſented, and found a
very hard bargain of it; for the ravenons Legat exacted them
at a ſet day, and thoſe that miſſ'd it, were ſure to be hit home
with an Excommunication. Thus between the Lyon and the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110807:10"/>
Wolf, the Flock went to wrack; for no doubt but the King had
a feeling in the cauſe, or his Counſell would never have beene
ſo diligent in the buſineſſe;<note place="margin">14. Year.</note> but all this would not do, he
therefore exacts great ſummes of the Clergy (whom the
Pope could rule and would, it being his turn now) and the
City of <hi>London</hi> for redemption of their liberties, (an excellent
way to make them free, for they ſeldom are ſo of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
yet have they given down largely in this Cauſe, to
their Honour be it ſpoken, and may they be ſo moderate as
not to kick over the palle in the upſhot) and forces the Iews
to pay the third of all their moveables to maintain his Warres
he then began in <hi>France,</hi> whither he goes, leaving them to
pray, that he might deal more Chriſtianly with them for the
future.</p>
            <p>But his evill gotten goods thrived not, and the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
an infinite expence of treaſure, having loſt divers Nobles
and valiant men, without any glory returns home, bringing
with him the Earle of <hi>Britaigne,</hi> and many <hi>Poictovins,</hi> to ſuck
up what could further be wrung from the poor people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
and in order to this calls a Parliament,<note place="margin">15. Year.</note> wherein upon

the <hi>Saracens,</hi> he obtains a fifteenth of the Laity, and Clergy;
but the Popes turn it ſeems was come, who falls a curſing all
that had any hand in with-holding Tithes from thoſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of ſtrangers which he had preferr'd to benefices, and the
King makes a ſtrict inquiſition after them, &amp; forces them all to
runne to <hi>Rome</hi> for abſolution of this horrible ſin of reſiſting
his Paſtors in the main work of their Miniſtery, few of them
having more Engliſh than would ſerve to demand their tithes
but it was enough with the Pope they had that, whoſe ſpecial
care was to ſee the Flock might be fleec'd, for teaching, that
might have ſpoyl'd devotion to <hi>Rome,</hi> which ignorance is the

by the advice of the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> ſith the Parliament
was ſo drie, he fals to ſqueeze his own Spunges, and amongſt
the reſt his darling <hi>Hubert de Burgh</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> and his
Chief Iuſticiarie feels the weight of Kingly kindneſſe, which
loves a man ſo long as he is uſefull; but if any advantage
ſhall accrue, it is very Rebellion ſhould affection be ſo ſaucy as
to plead privilege againſt Royall profit, <hi>and naw kenning of
Kingcraft,</hi> for Kings to be more nice than wiſe. O the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
eſtate of that man, who to curry favour with a Tyrant,
cares not how he acts, nor what he does! aſide he is thrown
ſo ſoon as his great Maſter hath ſerved his turn on him, and
being down is ſure to be trampled on to ſome purpoſe by the
enraged people, who in the ſervants miſery ſeek a recompence
for the Maſters tyranny; and this hath been told us by a
King and Prophet long ago, <hi>Put not your trust in Princes, men
of high degree area lye.</hi> And now the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>
is the Court Minion, but as he tript up the Earl of <hi>Kents</hi> heels;
ſo will he be laid on his back ſhortly, and the ſame nooſe he
made for others, will catch the Woodcock himſelfe ere long;
who was returned from the Holy Wars abroad, to begin it
ſeems wicked diſcord at Home: for he ſhewing the king, that
Foraigners were the only journey-men to drive on his trade
of Tyranny, and fitteſt inſtruments to keep the Engliſh in ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
cauſes him, who for his own ends cared neither whom
nor what he made uſe of, to diſplace all the chief Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
and Barons of the kingdom, and to beſtow all places of
concernment, either Military or Civill, on ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſtrains of ſo ſtrange and inſufferable violences ſo
exaſperate the Nobility, that many combine for defence of the
publique, and the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> in all their names tels the
King how pernicious and dangerous theſe courſes would
prove, whom the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> inſolently anſwers,
That it was lawfull for the K. to call what ſtrangers he would
to defend his Crown, and compell his proud &amp; rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to their due obedience, that is, tame ſlavery; The Lords
netled with this Prelats peremptorineſſe, which the King bore
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:110807:11"/>
him out in, depart with more indignation, vowing to ſpend their
Lives in this cauſe concerning their liberties ſo much, hereupon
the K. ſends for whole Legions of <hi>Poictovins,</hi> &amp; then ſummons
them to appear in the Parl. called on purpoſe to intrap them,
but they were ſo wiſe as to avoid the ſnare, &amp; ſo reſolute as to
ſend him word, That unles he would mend his manners, by the
common Counſel of the kingdom, they would expell both him
and his evil Councellors the Land; But all this avayled them
not, for upon their refuſall to repair to him at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the
King without the judgment of his Court, or their Peers, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
them to be proclamed Out-Laws, ſeizes upon all their
Lands, which he divides among his <hi>Poictovins</hi> (the <hi>Paniſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
that guarded and boulſtered out this Grand Sultan and
his Viſier Baſha <hi>Wincheſter</hi> in their tyrannies) and directs out
Writs to attach their Bodie.</p>
            <p>But now give me leave a little to digreſſe, and ſhew how
our bloud-hounds have run counter on the ſame foile, have
acted the moſt of this ſcene in our dayes. For thus, though
our King wanted not ſo great a ſtock of ſtrangers to ſet up
with, there being ſo many baſe ſpirited Engliſhmen, which
would be inſtrumentall in enſlaving their Countrey, a thing
our noble and generous Anceſtors abhorred to do; yet <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
horſe were to have bin brought over to help to improve
the Trade, and lye for factourage of Tyranny in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Thus the Earl of <hi>Straffora</hi> tels the King he had an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which might be brought over to bring <hi>England</hi>
under the yoak, a Counſel which coſt the Giver his Head;
Thus were <hi>Swedes, Danes, French, Scots, Iriſh,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
ſent for over, and invited by the King to help him. Thus
the Members were illegally proceeded againſt, the Lords
ſummoned to <hi>York,</hi> and the Parliament commanded to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
and all that refuſed handled without mittens, their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
being conferred on thoſe who would engage for Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
and themſelves proclamed Traytors and Rebels, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
theſe things conſidered, it was no marvell God was ſo
often called to witneſſe, that Tyranny was not intended, and
impiety uſed to create credulity, God mocked that men might
be abuſed, ſith no reaſon could be given to gain our belief,
and make us give our own eyes the lye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:110807:11"/>
The Lords though much weakned by the revolt of ſome of
themſelves (the King having won the Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and
<hi>Wincheſter</hi> with a thouſand marks bought the Earls of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
and <hi>Lincoln</hi> to his party) repair into Wales, at that time
very ſenſible of their oppreſſion and the Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> to cry
quittance with the K. and make amends for his former faults,
breaks priſon and joyns with them: hereupon the K. in perſon
marches againſt them, but he is beaten, and forced to retreat
with diſhonor to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> his Foraigners alſo being again
ſent againſt them runne the ſame chance, their Generall and
thouſands of them being ſlain on the place, being fruſtrated
therefore in his deſign of force, the King employes a Fryer to
cajole the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> General of the Forces raiſed
by the Barons, but all the flatteries, promiſes, and threats of
that crafty inſtrument, could not ſhake the conſtancy of that
Noble Lord, who gallantly told him, <hi>That he feared no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
nor would ever yeeld to the Kings will, which was guided by
no reaſon; that he ſhould give an evill example to relinquiſh
the juſtice of his Cauſe, to obey that will which wrought all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtire,
whereby it might appeare he loved worldly poſſeſſions,
more than Right and Honour.</hi> Thus the promiſe of reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his former eſtate, with the addition of great Lands in
<hi>Herefordshire,</hi> nothing prevailed with him, in whoſe heroik
Mind Honour and his Conntryes good were Commanders
in chief.</p>
            <p>No way therefore now being left but that, the King tryes
what may be done by Treachery, and takes a truce with them:
in the mean while ſeizing all thoſe great poſſeſſions which
were left the Earl in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by his famous Anceſtor the Earl
<hi>Strongbow,</hi> that thereby he might draw the Earl over thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
this deſign takes effect, and the Earl endeavouring to
regain his livelihood loſt his life circumvented by treachery.
Thus nobleſt ſouls are ſooneſt intrapt, who meaſuring others
their own thoughts are the leaſt ſuſpicious; but his death
wrought ſuch effects as cauſed the King to diſown the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and lay the load upon his Counſellors ſhoulders.</p>

both againſt him, and his Counſellors, and ſeeing no way to

calls home the Lords, removes the ſtrangers, and brings his

<hi>Wincheſter</hi> with his Baſtard are forced for ſhelter to take San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,

kindred, which muſt needs draw means from this kingdome.</p>
            <p>A Parliament alſo is aſſembled at <hi>London,</hi> (which the
King would have held in the Tower, but that the Lords
refuſed to come) in which Sheriffs were removed for corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

King endeavours to change his officers, and to take the Seale
from the Chancellor, the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter;</hi> who refuſes
to deliver it which he had by the Common Councell of the
kingdom, without aſſent of the ſame, and having carryed
himſelf unblamably in his office is much favoured by the
people. Alſo he receives ſome old caſt officers into favour,
ſuch was his levity and irreſolution, moved with any Engine
to doe and undo, and all out of time and order, wherein he
ever loſes ground; and goes about by the Popes Authority
to revoke his former Grants, which addes to the already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
diſpleaſure of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">22. Year.</note>In another Parliament, or the ſame adjourned, the King
demands relief, and upon promiſe to confirm the Charters,

is granted yet upon condition that it ſhould be gathered

that if the King performed not his promiſe, it might be

and to make ſhew on his part, ſome old Counſellors ſuddenly
removed, and others choſen, which were ſworn to give him
good and faithfull advice (yet I hope he had a Negative voice,
and might chuſe whither he would hearken unto them and be
no King or no?) the Parliament concluded, and with it ended
all his goodly Promiſes.</p>

ſo inconſtant are Tyrants in their favours: they loſt their

of wool made by the King to the Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> the Queens
Vncle, to whom the next year he gave a penſion of 300 marks

we may obſerve, that Officers under bad Princes are not
alwayes ſo bad as men account them, and that when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

            <p>But it ſeems one Gulph ſufficed not to ſwallow up the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

ſo amazed the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that ſeeing
no end of theſe Concuſſions of the State, and liberties of the
Church, he gives over his Sea, and payes 800 marks to the
Pope for his Fine: We need never doubt ſure but that they
paid well for it who were to have it, when ſo much was given
by him that left it. He demands a tenth alſo of the Clergy;
who flying to the King for protection againſt the Popes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
were referred to the Legat: yea and the chief of them
offered to be delivered up unto him by the King, who joyned
with the Pope we may ſee to aw and puniſh the Kingdom:
and though they in the Councell then called ſtood out for a

            <p>No doubt this tender hearted Vicar had ſuch a care of their

Pope aſhamed to demand money for the King, but to ſing the

were made publike, the Parliament make uſe of the good

the Popes Exactions, in ſuch ſort that it gave hope of redreſs;
but this heat was ſoon chill'd by the Popes threats, of ſo irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
and wavering a nature was the King, Woman-like, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
over what he manfully undertook; but this may ſeem to
confirm what was hinted before, that what he did was rather
out of policy to delude the people (whoſe rage was riſen ſo
high, that he fear'd to meet it) than a juſt ſence of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
who in all things elſe which ſtood with his humour or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
was more than enough ſtubborn and ſtiffe.</p>
            <p>And now the Pope having given, or rather taken the foile,
continues his former rapine, yet fearing if he kicked too hard,
he might be thrown out of the Saddle, he ſeems openly to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe,
and promiſes never to ſend any more Legats into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

the former being too eminent for his clandeſtine tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which the King furthers him in all he can, ſo cordiall was
the reconcilement, which ſhewes it was not effected
by fear.</p>
            <p>And to give them their due, both play'd their parts very

The Pope ranting as high in the Counſel, as the King vapou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

Thus alſo was the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Rawleys</hi> eſtates
conferr'd on favourites; and they made Traytors, that Court
Hang-bies might be made Lords and Gentlemen; and to
ſay the truth, in this point, all or moſt of our Monarchs have
ſo behaved themſelves, as if, with the Countrey fellow at
Doctors Commons, they thought <hi>England</hi> was dead dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,
had made them her executioners, and they were come

            <p>But to return where we left. <hi>Henry</hi> was ſo laviſh, and his
Gueſts ſo unwilling to ſeem unmannerly, and refuſe his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that his baggs were now become as empty, as his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
were before; A Parliament therefore is ſummoned at
<hi>London,</hi> and money demanded; but they put him in minde of
his Gueſts, and beſides ſharply reprehended Him, <hi>For his
breach of promiſe in requiring another aid, having vowed and
declared, upon his laſt ſupplie, never more to injure the ſtate in
that kinde; for his violent taking up of proviſions for diet, wax,
ſilkes, robes, but eſpecially wine, contrary to the will of the owners,
whereby Merchants will withdraw their Commodities, and all

ſith his needleſſe expences amounted to above 800000 l.
ſince he began his deſtructive Raign.</hi> (poſtquam Regni caepit
eſſe dilapidator) thus plainly durſt our generous Anceſtors
tell a Tyrant his own to his teeth. Then they reprove Him,
<hi>For keeping vacant in his hands, Biſhopricks, and Abbeys, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Liberties of the Church, and his Oath taken at his
Coronation.</hi> Which it ſeems was judged more than a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in thoſe dayes, though in ours, the contrary hath ſo
falſly, and impudently been aſſerted. Laſtly, <hi>they generally
complain, for that the chief Iuſticia, Chancellor, Treaſurer,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>were not made by the Common-Councell of the Kingdom, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as they were in the time of his magnificent predeceſſors, &amp; as</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:110807:17"/>
               <hi>as it was fit and expedient; but ſuch advanced as followed his
will, in whatſoever tended to his gaine, and ſought promotion not
for the good of the Kingdom, but their own profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we may obſetve that it was no new doctrin, which our
Parliament in the beginning taught us, but that it was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
as well as thought fit ſo to be, by our Anceſtors, though
the Royall Pen-men in their Declarations boldly and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
avowed the contrary.</p>
            <p>With this reprehenſion the King was netled, as his ſpeech
the next Seſsion makes out, for though he promiſed amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they would not beleeve him, and therefore prorogued
the Parliament till Midſummer, that they might ſee whether
he would be as good as his word. (We muſt know Kings were
not grown ſo impudent and daring then, as to diſſolve Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amens
at their own pleaſures.) But he mended like ſour Ale
in Summer, his heat it ſeems increaſing with the Seaſons, and
in the next Seſsion, with an Imperious and Magiſteriall brow
thus expoſtulates with them, <hi>Would you curb the King your
Lord at your uncivill pleaſure, and impoſe a ſervile condition on
him? will you deny unto him what everyone of you as you liſt may
doe? it is lawfull for every one of you to uſe what Counſell, and
every Maſter of a Family to prefer to any office in his houſe whom
he pleaſes, and diſplace again when he liſt, and will you raſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
your Lord the King to do the like? Whereas ſervants ought not
to judge their Maſter, and Subjects their Prince, or hold them to
their cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tions. For the Servant is not above his Lord, nor the
D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſciple above his Maſter; neither ſhould he be your King, but
as your Servant, who ſhould ſo encline to your pleaſure. Wherefore
know I wil yeild to none of your deſires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A brave ranting ſpeech, yet I hope it will not be denyed but
they were evill Counſellors, which put this into that Kings
mouth, though they have been, who penned the late Kings
Declarations, which were ſo like this ſpeech, as they could not
be more, though <hi>Charls</hi> his Declarations had been ſpit out of
<hi>Henries</hi> mouth; in both we may perceive the humour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
proud in the Kings, and jointly miſchievous in their
Counſellors, the firſt accounting their Subjects but their
ſlaves, the ſecond making themſelves ſuch to curry favor with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110807:17"/>
their Lordly Maſters; for let what palliations or diſguizes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
of evill Counſellors be made to cover the ſhame of evill
Princes, wiſe men know, and it hath alwayes been found by
experience, that the Tyranny of the Kings, bears the firſt, and
the ſlavery of the inſtruments but the ſecond part, in the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality
of the miſchiefs, and that theſe Lions rampant, wil make
uſe of none but Aſſes couchant, which are moſt willing, as wel
as moſt able, to bear the load.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Henry</hi> he heaps his favours upon Strangers moſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were apteſt to ſerve his turn; and thus many in our
dayes have been preferred and inriched, not becauſe the King
loved <hi>Laud, Wentworth, Buckingham, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gby, &amp;c.</hi> better than
others, but becauſe theſe were the fitteſt inſtruments to drive
on the trade of Tyranny.</p>
            <p>But to the ſtory. <hi>Herry</hi> would have money, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
would have a redreſſe of grievances, which his ſpeech
abſolutely denyes they ſhould, and ſo they break up in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content:
but though his ſtomach was ſo high, his purſe was
ſo low as he was forced to ſell his plate, and jewels of the
Crown. We ſee here that the late King had a Preſident for
what he did, and a very goodly one too; but what will not
Princes devoted to Tyranny ſacrifice, to obtain their luſtings?
give, pawn, ſell all they can lay their clutches on to carry on
their deſign, which being accurſed, and abominable, none
will be ſubſervient to, but they will be ſoundly paid
paid for it: and truly theſe ſlaviſh wretches buy their Gold
too dear, ſelling their fame, together with their honeſty for a
little traſh, which commonly is torn from them by the hand
of juſtice, which makes them behold the loſſe of all they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
and purchaſed ſo dear, before it puts out their eyes
by a ſhamefull death: no marvell therfore Tyrants are ſo beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly,
being forced to hire their journymen at ſuch high rates.</p>
            <p>He ſends his letters Imperiouſly deprecatory to aid him with
money,<note place="margin">33. Year</note> which with much grudging they do, to the ſum of
20000l. having the Chriſtmas before required New-years
gifts of the ſame Londoners, in hope (no doubt) but to get
ſome of his plate and jewels again, which they had bought of
him a little before: Alſo by calling the Nobles and wealthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:110807:18"/>
perſons apart, he ſcrapes up ſomething; yet when the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of <hi>Borrough</hi> denyed him a 100 marks as he required, he
told him it was more Charity to give an alms to him, than to a
Beggar that went from dore to dore; to this lowneſſe had his
profufe and tyrannicall courſes expoſed him.</p>
            <p>The Iewes alſo were fleeced by the King again, of whoſe

upon the faith he owed to his law to be true, to wit, that the

marks in Silver, beſides 200 in Gold given to the
Queen.</p>
            <p>And the Londoners, in requitall of their bounty, forced to
ſhut up their ſhops, and keep St. <hi>Edwards</hi> Fair 15 dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in a very wet and dirty ſeaſon, being

without their leave, when all the devices and power they can
make are not able to hinder it; well though that proverb ſays,
Neceſſity hath no law, yet with reverence to it's antiquity,
I muſt contrarily affirm, that had it not been for neceſſity
<hi>England</hi> had never had good law, made nor kept, neither ever

for three years, and Eſcuage three marks of every Knights
Fee of the Laity for one year, towards his journey into the
Holy Land, indeed <hi>Gaſcoigne;</hi> which how holy ſoever <hi>Henry</hi>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:110807:20"/>
And the King with all the great Nobility, all the Prelats
in their Veſtments, with burning Candles in their hands, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
in the great Hall at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to receive that
dreadfull ſentence; The King having received a Candle, gives
it to a Prelat, ſaying, it becoms not me being no Preiſt to
hold this, my heart ſhall be a greater teſtimony; and withall
lays his hand ſpred upon his Breſt the whole time the ſentence
was pronounced, which was <hi>Authoritate Dei Omnipotentis,</hi>
&amp;c. which done he cauſes the Charter of King <hi>Iohn</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be read likewiſe openly; in the end, having thrown
away their Candles, which lay ſmoaking on the ground, they
cryed out, So let them which incurre this ſentence be extinct,
and ſtinke in Hell; and the King with a loud voice ſaid, As
God me help I will, as I am a Man, a Chriſtian, a Knight,
a King Crowned and Annointed, inviolably obſerve all theſe
things.</p>
            <p>Never were Lawes (ſaith that witty Hiſtorian) amongſt
men (except thoſe holy Commandements on the Mount)
eſtabliſhed with more Majeſty of Ceremony to make them
reverend, and reſpected, than theſe were; they wanted but
Thunder and Lightning from Heaven, which likewiſe if pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
could have effected, they would have had, to make the
ſentence gaſtly and hideous to the infringers thereof.</p>
            <p>Yet no ſooner was this Parliament diſſolved by a ſacred
and moſt ſolemne concluſion, but the King preſently ſtudies
to infringe all, and with a part of the money he then got,
purchaſing an abſolution of the Pope, returnes to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
oppreſſive courſes, with more violence and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
and for ought we know our late King had the like to
help him over all thoſe ſtyles, for Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> tells us,
there was an Engliſh Lieger in Rome, and our own eyes, that
there were Nuntio's here at home, to continue a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
between the Pope, and his Royall Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</p>
            <p>Thus what the King does, the Pope undoes for money,
ſo curſed a thirſt after Gold was in both: It is no wonder
therefore ſome of <hi>Henry</hi>'s late ſucceſſors were hying ſo faſt to
Rome, who being troubled with the ſame diſeaſe, ſtood in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:110807:20"/>
need of the ſame Mountebanke: and no doubt but <hi>Venus</hi>
hath obtained Armour of proof of <hi>Vulcan</hi> for her wandring
<hi>AEneas,</hi> ſo that the King of Scots is well provided againſt the
Covenants pearcing him to the heart, by the care of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and art of his holy Father.</p>
            <p>But to returne to <hi>Henry,</hi> whom we ſee the greateſt ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that could be given, and that under the greateſt penalty,
an Oath could not hold; who would therefore ſuppoſe
that he or any Kings of ſuch metall ſhould ever be believed
againe by any who write themſelves men (Creatures in
whoſe compoſition are many ounces of reaſon) when the
only Chaine upon earth beſides Love to tye the Conciences
of men, and humane ſociety together (which ſhould it not
hold, all the frame of Government muſt fall aſunder, and
men like Beaſts be left to force, that whoſoever is the ſtronger
may deſtroy the other) hath been ſo often and ſuddainly
broken by the Norman tyrants, in whom this perjury ran
in a bloud almoſt to a miracle? or who could think Maſter
<hi>Prynne</hi> who in print takes notice of their frequent violations,
would ever be drawn by corrupt intereſt to have his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
Liberties ſent to Sea to ſeek their fortunes in ſo rotten a
Bottome.</p>
            <p>Theſe Deeds being done, ſucceeds one ſo monſtrous, that
we muſt almoſt run half way to Credulity to be able to meet
it; for this perjured Prince was not aſhamed to ſend his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
over to ſummon the Eſtates, and demand of them (the
Wounds yet freſh and bleeding made by his impieties) ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Subſidy, but the Parlament denied him, to the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperation
of the Tyrant: yet the Earl of <hi>Cornwall</hi> forced
the <hi>Iews</hi> to pay a great Summ, that he might not return
empty handed to his Brother, who ſtaid untill he had conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
all that ever he could get in this Iourney, which with the
other two made before, coſt him ſeven and twenty hundred
thouſand pounds, more than all his Lands there were They to
be ſold were worth, beſides thirty thouſand Marks, with
Lands, Rents, Wards, Horſes, and Iewels, to an ineſtimable
price, thrown away upon his half-brothers.</p>
            <p>After all this he returns, and the firſt that felt their good
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:110807:21"/>
Lord was come again, were the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and the <hi>Iews,</hi> who
paid ſoundly for his Welcome. The <hi>Londoners</hi> preſenting him
with an hundred pounds were returned without Thanks or
Money, for he was not altogether ſo unmannerly as to deny
to receive it, then being perſwaded Plate would be better wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
they ſend him a fair Veſſell, worth two hundred pounds;
this had ſome Thanks, but yet would not ſerve the turn.</p>
            <p>For the Pope having beſtowed the Kingdom of <hi>Sicil</hi>
on the Kings younger Son (which the Earl of <hi>Cornwall</hi> wiſely
refuſed,<note place="margin">39. Year.</note> knowing the Pope was never ſo liberall of any thing
which was his own) the King to gain this makes all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
he can get out of his Coffers, and Exchequer, or borrow of
his Brother, or ſcrape from the <hi>Iews,</hi> or extort by the rapine of
his Iuſtices itinerants, which he gives to the Pope to maintain
his Wars againſt <hi>Conrade</hi> King of <hi>Sicil,</hi> (you ſee there was a
right Owner of what the Pope was ſo liberal) and yet all this
would not do, for the Pope writes for more, who was loath to
be a Niggard of anothers Purſe; upon this <hi>Henry</hi> ſends him
Letters Obligatory, ſigned with his Seal, with Blanks left to
put in what Summs he would, or could get of the Merchants
of <hi>Italy,</hi> deſiring him to ſtick upon no intereſt, all which was
ſo effectually performed, that he was put in Debt no leſſer
Summ than three hundred thouſand Marks, and yet no <hi>Sicil</hi>
was got.</p>
            <p>Vpon this a Parlament is ſummoned, and of them money
required, which though they promiſed to grant upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he would ſwear without all cavillation to obſerve the
Charters, and let the Chief Iuſticiar, Chancellour and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
be elected by the common Councel of the Realm, would
not be hearkned to: for though he cared not a fig for his
Oath, yet it ſeems thoſe Officers might have reſtrained him
from diſpoſing of his Caſh at liſt, and not ſuffer his Holineſſe
to have a Penny, whereby he might have wanted his Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or elſe the humor of Tyranny was ſo high, that all his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury
was not able to check it for one moment.</p>
            <p>The King thus being left unprovided, the Biſhop of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
Agent for the Prelates at <hi>Rome,</hi> like a truſty Steward
findes a ſhift to help him, for getting certain Authentick Seals
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:110807:21"/>
from them, upon pretence of diſpatching ſome buſineſſe for
them, by Licence of the Pope and King, he ſets them to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of ſuch Summs of Money taken up of <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants
for their Vſe, and ſo makes them pay the Kings ſcores.</p>
            <p>He ſeizes alſo the Liberties of the City of <hi>London,</hi> into his
hands, upon the pretence of their letting a Priſoner eſcape,
making them fine three thouſand Marks to himſelf, and ſix
hundred to his Brother; he requires of the <hi>Iews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> upon pain of
hanging, a Tallage of eight thouſand Marks; and thus having
fleeced them, he ſet them to farm to his Brother; who upon
Pawns lent him a huge maſſe of Money; then the City Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
are ſeized again, but upon payment of four hundred
Marks reſtored.</p>
            <p>And to add to all, one <hi>Ruſcand</hi> a Legat from the Pope
comes and demands the Tenth of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to the uſe of the King, and Pope, preaching the Croſſe
againſt the King of <hi>Sicil</hi> but the Clergy proteſing rather to
loſe their Lives and Livings than yield thus to the will of the
Pope, and King, who they ſaid, were as the Shepherd and
the Wolf combined to macerate the Flock; were ordered to
ſome tune, for the Legat ſuſpended &amp; excommunicated them,
and the King if they ſubmitted not in forty days ſpoiled them
of all their Goods as forfeited.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">40. Year</note>All men by Proclamation that could diſpend fifteen pound
<hi>per annum</hi> were commanded to come in, and receive the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Knighthood, or elſe pay their Fines, as was before
done in the 37. year: and every ſheriffe was fined 5 marks
for not diſtreyning on all whom the Proclamation reached;
this trick was ſhown in our dayes, leſt any oppreſſion ſhould
ſcape unexerciſed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">41. Year</note>A Parliament was held, wherein the Prelats and Clergy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him upon condition the Charters might be obſerved,
52000 marks, but it ſatisfied him not, for he demanded the
Tenths for 3. years, without deduction of expences, and the
firſt fruits for the ſame time.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">42. Year</note>Another was called to <hi>London,</hi> wherein upon the Kings

who abſolutely refuſed it, in regard it lay ſo far off, ſo many
Nations between, the cavils of the Popes, the infidelity of the
People, and the power of the pretenders.</hi> They alſo repeat the
Kingdoms grievances, <hi>The breach of his promiſes, and moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Oathes: the inſolence of his Brethren, and other ſtrangers,
againſt whom by his Order, no Writ was to paſs out of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery;
how they abounded all in riches, and himſelf was ſo poor that
he could not repreſs the Welſh, who waſted his Countrey, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt them was forced to return with diſhonor.</hi> The King
ſeeing his friend Neceſſity was at his Elbow, humbles himſelf,
tels them, how he had often by evil Counſell been ſeduced, and
promiſes by his Oath, which he takes on the Tombe of Saint
Edw. to reform all theſe Errors: but the Lords not knowing
how to hold this ever-changing <hi>Proteus,</hi> for ſecurity adjourn
the Parliament to meet at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in which time they provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for their own, and the Kingdoms ſafety.</p>
            <p>The King in the mean while is put to his ſhifts, and upon
promiſe of high preferment, gets the Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to
put his and his Covents Seal to a Deed obligatory, as a ſurety
for threehundred marks; ſending by <hi>Paſſeleave</hi> this Deed, with
his Letters, unto other Monaſteries, to invite them to do the

            </p>
            <p>And now the Parliament meets at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and in this it is
Enacted that the <hi>Poictovins</hi> and ſtrangers ſhould avoid the
Land, with many other profitable Laws for that time. The
Charters are confirmed, and the King and Prince ſworn to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
the ancient Lawes and Inſtitutions of the Realm, and to
obſerve inviolable the Ordinances of that Parliament. Now
the chief Iuſticiar, Chancellor, and all other great and publike
Officers, are elected by the common and publike Counſell,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:110807:22"/>
which power was, as we may ſee before, uſurped by the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Tyrants, and worn as an eſpeciall flowr of their Crowns,
and fruit of our ſlavery: for it is manifeſt to any, unleſſe ſuch
as will wink, that our Engliſh Kings were but as Generals in
War, without any other great juriſdiction; our wiſe Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
knowing ſuch a truſt enough for one, and therefore kept
the Election of other Great Officers in their own power, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
it was wreſted out of their hands by the Norman Tyrants,
and that not ſo much by the Sword, as by craft; thus though
<hi>William</hi> ſirnamed the Baſtard had defeated <hi>Harold</hi> in the field;
yet upon his Coronation he ſwore to maintain the ancient
Laws, Liberties, and Cuſtomes of the Engliſh Nation, and
again renewed his Oath, and granted the ſame too by Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but when he was throughly ſetled in his ſeat he perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
broke all, impoſed the Norman Lawes, and thoſe in the
Norman tongue, as a badge of our ſlavery, and a means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap
the Engliſh, who not underſtanding them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knew not how
to avoid the incurring the penalties; whereby his Normans
mouths up were made with their Eſtates, &amp; thus his Succeſſors
were forced to ſwear and forſwear to maintain themſelves in
their Kingſhips.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Poictovins</hi> and ſtrangers being baniſhed, preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
the death and ſickneſſe of divers Noblemen, who had
been poyſoned by their practice: and a Steward of the Earl
of <hi>Gloceſters</hi> was executed for it, he having received a great
ſum of <hi>VVilliam de Valence</hi> the head of the <hi>Poictovins</hi> to work
the feat. And though the Kings Favourites cryed out that
he was condemned only upon preſumption, yet the evidence
will appear very ſtrong, if we conſider, that his Lord, and his
Lords brother were poyſoned, the latter dying, the former
lying ſick a long while, having his body ſwell'd, his nails and
hair fallen off, and this Steward convinced to have received a
great ſum of the <hi>Poictovin</hi> their Enemy, for whom he could
make out no ſervice to be ever done, unleſſe what was layed
to his charge; beſides, a Iew being converced a little after,
confeſſed the poyſon was prepared in his houſe.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Cornwall</hi> (now King of the <hi>Romans</hi>) returns
into <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">43. Year</note> and upon his arrivall takes an Oath to obſerve
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:110807:23"/>
inviolably, and obey the Statutes and Ordinances made by the
late Parliament at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Parliament was ſummoned at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">44. Year</note> wherein were
read and confirmed all the Statutes of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
acurſed by the Prelats, which ſhould attempt in word
or deed to infringe any of the ſame: Whereupon Eſcuage is
granted to the King, forty ſhillings of every Knights Fee; a
very conſiderable ſum in thoſe dayes, for there were above
forty thouſand Knights Fees in <hi>England</hi> at that time.</p>
            <p>But the King having an intent to break more Oaths, and
knowing that now it would not ſo eaſily be done, makes a
Voyage over Sea to conclude a peace with <hi>France,</hi> that he
might not be interrupted in the game he ment to play at home,
having diſpatched Meſſengers ſecretly to <hi>Rome,</hi> for abſolution
of his Oath, and to <hi>Scotland</hi> for aydes to be ready upon
occaſion</p>
            <p>When he had concluded with the King of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">45. Year</note> having
made an abſolute reſignation of the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> the
Earldoms of <hi>Anjou, Poictou, Tourenne</hi> and <hi>Main,</hi> upon the
receipt of 300000 Crowns, and a Grant to enjoy what he had
in <hi>Guien, Xantongue, &amp;c.</hi> doing homage and fealty to the
Crown of <hi>France,</hi> He returns, and comes to London,
where he preſently fortifies the Tower, cauſed the Gates of
the City to be Warded, and then to pick a quarrel commands
the Lords to come to a Parliament to be holden in the Tower,
which they refuſing, as he knew they would, he takes an Oath
of all above 12 years of age in <hi>London,</hi> to be true to Him and
His Heirs, and ſets armed men to defend the City Gates, For
fear ſure the Parliament ſhould have come in, and ſo ſpoyled
the deſign, For neither <hi>Henry</hi> or any of our former Kings
were ever ſo daring as to conteſt with a Parliament in the field
or ſet up their ſtandards againſt it, but were alwayes forced to
grant its demands, or quietly ſit down without having their
own turne ſerved, when the Parliament was willing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Henry</hi> being provided for the work,<note place="margin">46. Year</note> cauſes the

at Pauls-Croſſe, and makes Proclamation that all ſhould
be proceeded againſt as Enemies to his Crown and Royal dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
who ſhould diſobey the abſolution; and ſuch was the
blindneſſe and ſlavery of many in thoſe times, that one Bull
begot thouſands of Calves in an inſtant: and yet it ſeems veal
was never the cheaper, for his Son the Prince was forced to
rob the Treaſury at the New Temple to buy him Proviſion,
every one refuſing to lend him or the King a groat, ſo great
credit had their perfidie got them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">47. Year</note>Many being clapt up in priſon who would not be perjured,
the Lords, and others whoſe conſciences were more tender
both of their Oath and Liberties than to believe the Pope,

King humbly beſeeching him to remember his many Oathes,
and promiſes, but when that would not availe them, they
advance towards <hi>London,</hi> where the King lay in the Tower
waiting the gathering of his forces, and the comming over of
ſtrangers which he expected; and now the Biſhops (who

oppreſſion under <hi>Henry,</hi> beſides what his good Father and

            <p>But the Lords being perſwaded that their Liberties and
Rights depended not upon the will of any one Man refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſtand to the partiall award of the French in the Engliſh

No doubt thoſe wiſe and generous Barons not only diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,

            <p>Let the Engliſh High Prieſts then, to their eternall infamy,

he could; at laſt having by ſprinkling Court holy-water,

ſecretly withdraws from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and from

and peece together an Army: And here we may ſee it was no
new thing which was acted by his late ſucceſſor, who in al
his actions made it appeare that he was a right chip of the old
block.</p>
            <p>Now pretences of the Barons inſolencies againſt the King,

ſtanding for Liberty; yet firſt they ſend to the King, putting
him in mind of his oathes and promiſes, and deſiring him to

length divers Scotch Lords, and others with great forces
being joyned to the King, he marches againſt <hi>Northampton,</hi>
where he heard <hi>Peter Montford</hi> was aſſembling forces for the
Barons: the Town was very reſolutely defended, untill
by the Treachery of ſome Monks within ſay ſome, by the
ſubtilty of the Kings Forces ſay others, (who advancing
cloſe under the Wall, undermined it, whilſt the Captains
within parlying with the King on the other ſide) a breach
was made ſo large that forty Horſe might enter a breſt, by
which <hi>Henry</hi> gained it by aſſault.</p>
            <p>This Town being taken ran the ſame fortune <hi>Leiceſter</hi>
lately did, for <hi>Henry</hi> drunk with ſucceſſe, and rage, like a
violent Torrent ſwept all before him, killing, burning, and
ſpoiling where ever his Army came; but here, ſo unmanly
was the cruelty of the Tyrant, that he would have hanged
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:110807:25"/>
all the <hi>Oxford</hi> Schollers (a band of which were in the Town)
for their valour ſhewed in the brave reſiſtance of his forces,
had not ſome of his Counſellers perſwaded him from ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for feare (the only curb to an ignoble ſoule) of
exaſperating their freinds againſt him by his cruelty,
many of the Schollers being young Gentlemen of good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>Here by the way we may obſerve the miſerable effects of
bad Governours in the Vniverſities, by whom ſuch degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſſe
was wrought in our youth, that none in our times
were found more deſperate engagers againſt the cauſe of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
than young Schollers, who heretofore were the moſt
reſolute Champions for it: Let us therefore make no ſiniſter
conſtructions, when we ſee our Governours diligent in
purging the fountaines, if we deſire to have the ſtreams run
cleere.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Northampton</hi> put a period to <hi>Henries</hi> fortune, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he cauſed the Barous to raiſe their ſiedge from <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi>
yet in the height of his jollity he was defeated at <hi>Lews,</hi>
ſuch was the wages of Pride and Rage: And thus the Sunne
ſetting at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> went down at <hi>Naſeby</hi> upon <hi>Charls,</hi>
whoſe ſucceſſe kept time with his preſumption and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Henry</hi> is pitched down at <hi>Lewes,</hi> where the
Barons petitioning for their liberties, and deſiring Peace,
are anſwered by his proclaming them Rebells and Traitors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ſending his own, his Brothers and Sons Letters of defiance
unto them: But this was too hot to hold, for the Lords per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
what they muſt truſt to, notwithſtanding the great
numbers of the Enemy, the Baniſhed <hi>Poictovins</hi> being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with great forces for his aide, bravely reſolve to give
him battel, and as gallantly perform their reſolutions, for
fighting like men for their Liberties, they gain the day, and
take Him, his Brother and his Sonne, with many Engliſh and
Scotch Lords priſoners.</p>
            <p>This victory was received with ſuch univerſall joy, that
when news came of the Queens having a great Army of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
ready to ſet ſale for <hi>England,</hi> ſuch multitudes appeared
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:110807:25"/>
on <hi>Barham</hi> Down to reſiſt them, that it could hardly have
been thought that ſo many men were in the Land: and at this
appearance of the Engliſh the forreiners vaniſh and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſt,
being terrified to hear the Engliſh were ſo unanimous
in the defence of their Country and its freedome; Oh were we
but thus united now within our ſelves we need never fear the
combination of forreiners.</p>
            <p>But theſe noble ſouls being more valiant than wary, more
pitifull than juſt, upon a few feigned ſhews of amendment,
and fawning promiſes of not entrenching upon their liberties,
receive the Snake into their boſomes, which will reward their
kindneſſe with their ruine aſſoon as he is able.</p>
            <p>For in the Parliament aſſembled at <hi>London,</hi> the cry of
blood and oppreſſion being ſtopt and ſmothered up,<note place="margin">49. Year.</note> 
               <hi>Henry</hi>
again is ſeated on the Throne, upon that poore and Thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare
ſatisfaction of himſelf and his ſonne, taking their Oaths
to confirm the Charters and Statutes before at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and
thoſe now newly made: ſure <hi>Mercury</hi> was aſcendent at <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
nativity, ſo potent were his ſtarres in deluding thoſe
who had been ſo oft mock'd, and beguil'd before; when in
reaſon we might ſuppoſe his former frequent violations and
reiterated perjuries ſhould have taught them what truſt was
to be given to a Kings oath, in whoſe eye Tyrranny was ſo
beautifull, that he never dallied to make market both of ſoul
and body, ſo he might but purchaſe his deſired Paramour.</p>
            <p>Theſe oaths being paſt in order to the performance after
the royall mode, the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> is tampred with to
leave the Barons; and by the artifice of thoſe maſters in the
art of Diviſion, who in all times knew how to work upon
the covetous, ambitious and envious humours of great men,
drawn to deſert the cauſe of liberty: and of this we our
ſelves have had a ſad and fatall experience, how many great
ones were cajold by <hi>Charles</hi> at <hi>Newcastle, Hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bie</hi> and the
<hi>Iſlle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> even to the great danger of our Cauſe; nay
the very Houſe was not free, as thoſe <hi>Tueſday</hi> nights votes
may, and the <hi>Fridayes</hi> had informed us with a witneſſe had
not Providence wrought miraculouſly for us, for it can be
made out by good witneſſe that there was a reſolution to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:110807:26"/>
have diſſolved the Parliament, and proclamed the Army
Traitors, had they all met.</p>
            <p>But Gold was too droſſie to make <hi>Gloceſters</hi> towring ſoul
ſtoop, and his free ſpirit could not be ſhackled with ſilver
fetters, ſome other Lure muſt be uſed to bring him down:
and now <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was mounted to ſo high a pitch in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
favour, that <hi>Gloceſters</hi> weaker wings could not reach
him, which whileſt with an aſpiring eye he gazes after, his
ſight was ſo dazzled with the others motion us gave check to
his purſute of the game. The crafty Prince marking his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
ſo works upon the weakneſſe of this young Lord, that by
it he effects what he could not do by his own force; thus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amonds
are cut by their own duſt, and the Champion of
<hi>Englands</hi> liberty muſt be the man can ruine it: accurſed be
that ſorcereſſe envy, ſo fatall then to <hi>Englands</hi> freedome, ſo
miſchievous lately to the ſame, whoſe menacing power had
it not been ſtopp'd by the new modell, had totally routed
the Parliaments whole force, ſo many Diviſions of them being
charged through, and through, and needs muſt that Army
become a Chaos, wherein Commanders conſiſt of jarring
Principles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gloceſter</hi> now being come to his fiſt, away flies <hi>Edward</hi> to
the Lord <hi>Mortimer,</hi> notwithſtanding his aſſurance given not
to depart the Court: that fable of the wiſe men of <hi>Gotams</hi>
hedging in the cuckow, hits many of our anceſtors home, who
with oaths and promiſes went about to keep in their Kings,
when one of the <hi>Norman</hi> brood could flie over ſuch a fence
with the very ſhell upon his head: and as the firſt part of
that ſtorie may be applyed to us, ſo the ſecond is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inſignificant for our Kings, whom we ſhal alwayes find
(together with ſuch as ſing after them) in one tune, crying
out diſloyall, diſſoyall, as if they could ſay as well as do
nothing elſe: yet a Chriſtian may conceive ſuch a found ſhould
make them tremble, by bringing the ſinnes of their fathers
and their own iniquities into their remembrance, did they
but believe there were a God, who will meaſure the ſame
meaſure out unto them which they have meted to others, and
will viſit the ſinnes of the fathers upon the children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:110807:26"/>
               <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> having done the Prologue, the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
begins, wherein the Scenes were ſo well laid, that every
actor was ready to enter, and each had his part ſo well by
heart, that it is plain they had been long conning their leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
for no ſooner were theſe two gone, but the Earles,
<hi>Warren, Pembroke,</hi> with a whole ſhoale of <hi>Poictovins,</hi> and
other ſtrangers, come to land in <hi>Wales,</hi> which with the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
reliques of the battell at <hi>Lewes,</hi> gathered from all
parts, embody in great numbers before the Lords who ſtood
faithfull were aware of them, yet they prepare for them as
faſt as they can: but their fortune was now in the wane, their
pity and credulity had brought them into the ſnare, and their
lives muſt go for ſuffering him to eſcape whom God had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
into their hands: for to condemne the innocent and
abſolve the guilty, are equally abominable in the ſight of
heaven: and our anceſtors to their coſt have made experience
of the truth of the Proverb, Save a thief from the Gallows, and
he ſhall be the firſt will cut your throat.</p>
            <p>Firſt the Armies meet at <hi>Killingworth,</hi> where the Lord
<hi>Simon Montford</hi> ſonne to the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> is defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
this bad newes meeting <hi>Leiceſter</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> haſtens
him to repair the breach made in their fortunes, and he meets
the enemy near <hi>Eveſham,</hi> where in a bloody field fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moſt valiantly, he loſes life and victory both, and
with him many more of the moſt noble Engliſh fall
a victime to perjured Tyranny, whoſe rationall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
ſouls diſdaininga Brutiſh ſlavery, freely offered up
their bodies on the High places of the field, a rich oblation
for <hi>Englands</hi> freedome, which together expired, and lay
butchered by them.</p>
            <p>The loſſe of this battell was imputed to the cowardice of
the Welſh, who in great numbers ranne away in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the fight, not to the injuſtice of the cauſe, of which
the people had a ſacred opinion: but the truth is, there was an
accurſed thing, an <hi>Achan</hi> in <hi>Leiceſters</hi> hoſt, old <hi>Henry</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with whole troops of perjuries, matters, and oppreſſions,
againſt whom incenſed heaven was injuſtice engaged.</p>
            <p>And now that the world might take notice Tyranny was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:110807:27"/>
in the ſaddle, cruelty in the height of revenge pranceth
through the field; for the dead body of noble <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was
moſt barbarouſly abuſed and cut in pieces, the head with the
privy members faſtened on either ſide the noſe being ſent as
a Trophy to the Lord <hi>Roger Mortimers</hi> wife, a preſent indeed
as fitting for a Lady to receive, as it was becoming a Prince,
who was <hi>Leicesters</hi> nephew to ſend, but the people made a
Saint of him whom his enemies by making reliques of, rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
themſelves little better than Devils, and the diſmembred
body gave a fragrant ſent, whileſt the diſmemberers rotted and
ſtank alive, thus after death <hi>Leiceſter</hi> leads a triumph over
Tyranny, which may inſtruct us how far a free and generous
ſoul is above its reach.</p>
            <p>And here notwithſtanding the calumnies and reproaches
wherewith the Royall party backed with ſucceſſe, and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiticall
Chronologers then and ſince have loaded <hi>Leiceſter;</hi>
yet we may take a gueſſe of the worth of that noble Lord by
the love of the people, and malice of the Tyrant: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
cannonizing him for a Saint, do what the latter could
for his heart: and ſure the common people had more than
ordinary cauſe, which could make them practice after an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſuall
manner, which was to judge contrary to event: had
his pride and his ſonnes inſolency been ſuch as ſome would
make them (who endeavour with their ſhame to make a
cloak for their adverſaries knaverie) <hi>Henry</hi> need never to
have been ſo timerous as he was, who not onely confeſſed he
feared the father more than any ſtorm, but could never be
quiet untill he ezpell'd both mother and ſonnes the Land,
though ſhe was his ſiſter, a Lady of eminent note, both
daughter and ſiſter to a King, and they upon delivering up
their ſtrengths were ſeemingly received into favour: thus
dreadfull and hatefull to a tyrant are free and generous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
which muſt expect ſuch uſuage, when they are within
the verge of his power, and ſuch effects of an act of
oblivion muſt our noble Patriots have felt from <hi>Charles,</hi> had
not providence in men been pleaſed to have put bounds to
the paralell, by erecting us a pillar with a <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:110807:27"/>
Let each following line then teach here thankfulneſſe to
Heaven, wherein we ſhall read, from what a labyrinth and
maze of miſery divine mercy hath freed our unworthy ſelves;
in which our forefathers were miſerably impriſoned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured:
and let us prize the clue which hath led us out among
our choiceſt jewels; that giving glory to the hand, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

of the mercies we have received.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> now again where he would be, breaths nothing but
bloud, and revenge againſt all who had ſtood for liberty, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
and purſuing them with ſuch unheard of fury, that
had not ſome potent favorites interpoſed, he had burnt the
whole City of <hi>London:</hi> Thus the Metropolis of <hi>England</hi> had
been laid in aſhes, which ſo generouſly and often hath ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for Liberty, had not God had a work to doe, wherein
<hi>London</hi> was to be gloriouſly inſtrumentall, and ſo delivered it
out of the paw of the Lyon.</p>
            <p>A Parliament now is ſummoned to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the ſeaſon, was likely to do the people much good)
and in this all who took part with the Lords are diſherited, all
the Statutes of <hi>Oxford</hi> are repealed, the wealthieſt Citizens of
<hi>London</hi> caſt into priſon, the City deprived of it's Liberties, and
all the poſts and chains taken away; Theſe things being put in
execution (for ſuch Acts muſt be kept) another Parliament
meets at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> wherein the Acts of <hi>VVincheſter</hi> are
confirmed; Thus topſie turvie is the world changed, that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
the onely refuge and <hi>Aſſilum</hi> for the people to fly to,
&amp; ſo lately the aſſertor of their Freedoms is becom the Mint,
wherein the Tyrant ſtamps for current what he liſts, and makes
the baſeſt metall paſſe for Gold, backing his luſt with pretence
of Law: O now I warrant you <hi>Henrye's</hi> conſcience is tender
in keeping Acts of Parliament, and it is no leſſe than a <hi>piacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>
to go about to infringe them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> in this latter comming to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">50. Year.</note> to ſhew his
goodneſſe and bounty, freely beſtows on his Hang-bies ſixty
Citizens houſes, together with their furniture, and all the
lands, goods and chattels belonging to their owners; Yet at
length he was pleaſed to pardon the City upon the payment
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:110807:28"/>
of twenty thouſand marks, and giving Hoſtages of the beſt
mens Sonnes, to be kept in the Tower at their Parents char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
            <p>Buſineſſe thus diſpatched at <hi>London,</hi> away hies <hi>Henry</hi> to
<hi>Northampton,</hi> where the Popes Legat holding a Synod, curſes
all thoſe who ſtood for Liberty: and <hi>Henry</hi> had been unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
had he not helped his Holy-Father, who all along had bin
ſo kind to him, he good man was agreed with before, it
was all the reaſon then in the World that the Pope ſhould
make his market; thus the poor ſlaves were to purchaſe their
fetters double, ſo coſtly was ſlavery unto <hi>England;</hi> juſtly then
may ſuch be termed niggards and baſe, who will grumble now
though with a round ſum to purchaſe their Liberty. And
now it ſeems <hi>Henry</hi> made not his journey for nothing, for the
gratefull Pope by his Legat this Synod, grants the tenths of
the Church for a year unto him, ſo bountiful in rewarding one
another were theſe Foxes, with what they lurched from the
Geeſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">51. Year.</note>
               <hi>Henry</hi> paſſing his time in ſuch pranks as theſe, at laſt <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>
finding his turning not to ſerve his tongue as he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
takes his time, changes his footing, and aſſembling an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
ſeizes on <hi>London:</hi> this puts the King and Legat ſo to their
trumps, as brought both unto their laſt ſtake, making the one
pawn the ſhrines, jewels, and reliques, the other ſpend the
curſes and excommunications of the Church moſt liberally; but
the Legat might have been ſent packing with his Sonne at his
back in Pontificalibus, had not <hi>Henries</hi> Golden Gods wrought
the miracle, which having thouſands of Angels at command,
quickly brought in great Armies of Forraigners, by whoſe aid
<hi>Gloceſter</hi> was forced to ſubmit, he and all his partakers fining
for their offence to <hi>Henry,</hi> who, no doubt, made them pay for
putting him into ſuch a fear, as well as unto ſuch a charge,
(which could be no ſmall ſum, were he like ſome of his late ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
in defraying only the charges laid out for guilded
clouts) beſides what muſt be given to ſet the little <hi>Dagons</hi>
in their places againe, and appeaſe their and their Prieſts
fury: Thus <hi>Gloceſter</hi> received the reward of his baſe deſerting
<hi>Leiceſter,</hi> being forced by his kind Maſter to find ſureties for
his good behaviour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:110807:28"/>
And now this Earl being brought under the yoak, <hi>Henry</hi>
turns againſt thoſe Barons who ſtood out, and were poſſeſt
of the Iſle of <hi>Elie.</hi> Theſe he firſt attempts by the Legat (his
forlorne Hope and reſerve too it ſeems) who is beaten back
with this repulſe, That unles the Statutes of <hi>Oxford</hi> might be
obſerved, and Hoſtages delivered, that they might peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
enjoy the Iſland, untill they ſhould perceive how the
King would performe his promiſes, they were reſolved to
ſtand it out, and with the venture of their bodies ſeek to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
their Souls, upon which lay moſt ſacred and ſolemne
ties. So great an incouragement was the opinion of their
cauſe, that it made them ſtand upright and undaunted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all theſe ſtorms; and ſo great a diſtruſt had <hi>Henries</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidie
created, that his ſubjects durſt not let him come within
their ſwords point, without Hoſtage given to keep him to
his word; and indeed this Tyrants gaine by their violations,
that none dare believe them but will rather fight it out to the
laſt, as expecting revengefull and treacherous uſage from
them.</p>
            <p>This Anſwer to the Legat ſo netled <hi>Henry,</hi> that he could
not chooſe but wince; and well it might, for his galled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
could not endure the mention of keeping an Oath,
which was a tacit exprobration of him, no more than his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall
humour could of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Articles, which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in them a ſound of Liberty, a thing he ſuppoſed he had by
the ſword ript out of Engliſh breaſts.</p>
            <p>And no doubt but it muſt be thought great incivility in
theſe Barons to dare to believe their eyes before royall perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and great ſaucineſſe in them, to make, or pretend
to make more conſcience of Oathes then their King; for
what was this other than to endeavour to appear more religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
more honeſt, more true, and more juſt than their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Soveraigne? Away with ſuch preciſe, and puritanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
fellowes; there can never be a good world ſo long as
ſuch are ſuffered to goe unpuniſhed; into the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
Court with theſe Sectaries, that the Legat may ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
them; bring theſe ſeditious fellowes before the King,
and the Honorable privy Councell, that they may receive
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110807:29"/>
the reward of their preſumptuous queſtioning the legality of
obeying King and Cardinall, right or wrong; nay, what is
more, they are not contented to be ſlaves as others are, let
them be tryed for Traitours and Rebells, for they have taken
up Arms againſt the King, and talke of defending their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
by the Sword; Thus rang the peale among the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Courtiers, and the like verdict hath been paſt upon
us by the Royall jury men, who in all things have followed
theſe their foremen. Here we may perceive then through the
veile of pretended Proteſtantiſme, and Conſcience, the rrue
riſe of the Royaliſts aſſertions, for the Paraſiticall Papiſt hath
done the like, to whom the reformed Religion was unknown
or abhorred, flattery being the motive, not Conſcience, the
deſire to cologue with a Tyrant, not the fear of diſpleaſing
God.</p>
            <p>And upon theſe worthy conſiderations <hi>Henry</hi> and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
decree ruine to theſe Barons, and the fate of Liberty
was unable to reſiſt their vowes; for Prine <hi>Edward</hi> with a
great Army quickly forces them out of their ſtrengths in that
Iſle whoſe courage was greater than their force, and their
reſolutions more numerous than their party; thus were the
laſt glimmerings of Freedom extinguiſhed, and the whole
Land envolved in darkneſſe, the Engliſh being left to grope
in a blind obedience after the will of their Tyrannicall
Maſter.<note place="margin">52. Year</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> by treacherie having thus triumphed over liberty,
He convenes a Parliament at <hi>Marlborough,</hi> where in a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
he confirms the great Charter, either on purpoſe to
make their teeth water, or to quiet the grumblings on foot
againſt his Tyranny, by this act of grace, which was likely
to be kept now the Bugbears of prerogative, thoſe reſolute
Lords and Gentlemen were deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Now twentieths, &amp; fifteenths, or what ever he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
are readily granted, and glad he would be ſo conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and all things go as well as <hi>Henry</hi> can wiſh, who promiſes
to be a good Lord to them, ſo long as they ſhall continue
humble vaſſals, contented ſlaves unto him; no mumbling or
talking muſt be of Oxford Acts, which it was high treaſon
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:110807:29"/>
but to think on, ſo wiſe the world was now grown over thoſe
former mad Parliaments.</p>
            <p>And thus after he had at leaſt twenty times confirmed, and
as often violated thoſe juſt decrees, notwithſtanding all the
ſolemnities, both civill, morall, and eccleſiaſticall, uſed
in the acts of ratification, and after all the hard ſtrivings,

ſucceeding him in his Tyranny, to which he was Heire,
as to the Crowne; for he made an higher improvement of
his royalty, and got the domination of this State in ſo high
and eminent manner, that (as one ſaith) he ſeemed to
be the firſt Conquerout after the Conquerour, his little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was heaviour than his Fathers loynes, laying inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
taxes on both Clergy and Laity even unto the halfe of
their Eſtates, the Barons and people not daring to quitch, or
move for removall of grievances, untill at laſt needing a vaſt
Summe to maintaine his Wars, he Summoned a Parliament,
wherein he was pleaſed to confirme the Charters to ſtop their
mouthes and open their purſes, and this he often did when
his occaſions urged him to it, which like all other royall
promiſers he performed by leaſure; Never was Royalty
more Majeſtick, and glorious than in this Kings Raign, and
the people leſſe able to oppoſe; but I ſhall conclude his
Character with what DANIEL ſaith of him, he was more
for the greatneſſe of the Kingdom than the quiet of it; for
having been nurſt up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſlaughter, he as it were thirſted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
bloud, ſo that never any King before or ſince (except
our laſt <hi>Charls</hi>) ſhed, and cauſed ſo much to be ſpilt in
the age following within this Iſle of Britaine.</p>
            <p>But all that we ſhall obſerve from his Raigne is this, that
as it was ſaid of the Emperour <hi>Frederick He was a good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
but a bad Man,</hi> ſo the moſt warlike, politick, and
temperate Princes have been the greateſt Tyrants and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors
of the people, the vicious and debauched by their
lewd lives and unmartiall natures, giving the people more
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:110807:30"/>
advantage and better opportunity to regain and revive the
claim of their liberties, which the other by oraft, force, and a
kind of reſpect created by their morality kept them from:
needs then muſt that truſt of powr be dangerous to the Nation
which lighting upon the moſt able perſon proves moſt deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the peoples juſt and native freedome.</p>
            <p>Thus having briefly repreſented the moſt ſignall and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
paſſages throughout this tedious and long reigne of
<hi>Henry</hi> the third, in this ſhort Diſcourſe, where as in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
the Reader may not onely deſcry actions farre diſtant
in time, and near hand, as done in our dayes, but alſo take
an exact view of the whole mannagement of affairs under the
Norman Monarchie, together with the real ground and riſe
of all thoſe former, and theſe latter conteſtations between
the Kings and people of this Nation, upon the ſcore of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
and liberty. I ſhall forbear to ſwell into a volumne
by raiſing unneceſſary obſervations, which I ſhall leave (as I
have done the paralell, where it was plain to every eye) to be
ſpun out by each Readers fancie, being aſſured that the moſt
ſhuttleheaded adorer of our Monarchy muſt bluſh in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that a fine piece, which it appears hath been wrought of
ſuch courſe threds and will onely in ſhort ſet before you
thoſe Tyrannicall, abuſive, and deluſive practiſes by which
our anceſtors have been bobbed, of their Freedome; and the
Norman Tyranny founded and continued over them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the Norman ſirnamed the Baſtard, taking the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of the Diviſions among the Engliſh, invades the
Land, and overthrows <hi>Harolds,</hi> weakned much in a fight with
the invading Norwegians, where though he got the victory,
he loſt the bodies of many, and the hearts of moſt of his
Souldiers by his partiall dividing of the Spoil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harold</hi> ſlain, and <hi>William</hi> victorious he is received, and
crowned King by conſent of the Engliſh, upon taking his
oath to maintain the ancient Lawes and liberties of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And now being as the thought ſettled in the Throne, he
begins to play <hi>Rex,</hi> in Engliſh the Tyrant, ſpoiling the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
of their eſtates, which they were forced to purchaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
of him, who nevertheleſſe reteined a propriety in them,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:110807:30"/>
and would have all held of himſelf as Landlord: thus
came in the ſlaviſh Tenures, and the Engliſh, amongſt
whom were no bondmen before, both Nobility and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
were made ſubject to the intollerable ſervitude of the
Norman.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh thus exaſperated take up arms to regain their
liberty, and that ſo unanimouſly; under the conduct of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Etheling,</hi> then tearmed <hi>Englands</hi> Darling, and <hi>Edwin</hi>
and <hi>Morchar</hi> Earls of <hi>Mercia</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> that the
tyrant not daring to fight them, aſſayes to pacifie them by
large promiſes of addreſſing their grievances, and reſtoring
their liberties, and by the help of ſome Clergy men he ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails,
that meeting at <hi>Berkhamſted</hi> an accord is made, <hi>William</hi>
taking his perſonall oath upon the Reliques of the Church
of Saint <hi>Alhans,</hi> and the holy Evangeliſts, from thenceforth
to obſerve inviolably the ancient Lawes, eſpecially thoſe of
Saint <hi>Edward,</hi> whom the Norman wickedneſſe had ſainted
among the people, ſo tranſcendent was tyranny already
grown.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh deceived by theſe ſpecious ſhews lay down
their arms, and repair to their homes, and now <hi>William</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obtained his end, takes his advantage, and ſets upon
them diſperſt, and never dreaming of any aſſault, impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
killing, baniſhing all he could lay hands on, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the reſt to fly into <hi>Scotland,</hi> overthrowing their ancient
Lawes, and introducing others in a ſtrange language, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating
the old Foreſts, and making new ones, by depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the Countrey, and pulling down Churches, Abbies,
and Houſes for thirty miles together, and yet prohibiting the
people the liberty of hunting upon great penalties, the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
priviledge and delight of the Engliſh: thus by treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
and perjury cheating the Engliſh of their liberties, whom
by force he could not bring under his yoke, he laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
upon which his Succeſſours have erected the ſtately
trophies of Tyranny amongſt us.</p>
            <p>But the Engliſh being of a generous and free nature were
ſo impatient of the yoke, that upon all opportunities they
did endeavour to break it; whereupon our Kings were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110807:31"/>
ſtill to make uſe of other props to uphold their tottering
edifice, which perjury alone was too rotten to ſuſtain, and by
the Pope, Prelates, and Lords, working upon the credulous,
ſuperſtitious, and unſtable vulgar, did even to admiration
ſhore up their <hi>Babel</hi> to the confuſion of liberty.</p>
            <p>1. The Pope was the chief Hobgob in in thoſe dark times,
that ſcared the people out of their wits; for through the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
ignorance of men, he had uſurped the power of
God; this Iugler with the counterfeit thunder of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications,
and curſes, which his Bulls upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
bellowed forth againſt the aſſertors of Liberty, and with
the pretended omnipotency of his diſpenſations with the
oathes of the Tyrant, ſo amazed the people, that he not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
domineered himſelf, but, like the Lord <hi>Paramount,</hi> for great
Fines let the Land out, to be harrowed, and the inhabitants
to be handled like villains and ſlaves to his Royall and well
beloved ſonnes (indeed he was a dear father to moſt of
them) our immediate Landlords.</p>
            <p>2. The proud Prelates, the Imps of that great <hi>Diabolo</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> were many of them ſtrangers, and all of them the
Creatures of the Popes, and Kings (who would chooſe none,
but ſuch as were fit for their deſigns, by their good wills,
and with their ill wills could out any that ſhould thwart
them) and ſo either regarded not our ſufferings, or were
bound to augment them to pleaſe their Patrons, as well as to
pamper themſelves, who being Dioceſan Monarchs were no
foes to Arbitrary power that themſelves might tyrannize <hi>ad
libitum</hi> over their Sees.</p>
            <p>And no doubt but Kings were ſo crafty as to perſwade them
<hi>No King, no Biſhop,</hi> heretofore, to heighten their zeal to the
Royall cauſe, as Prelats of late have ſtiffened them with <hi>No
Biſhop, no King,</hi> in obſtinacy for Prelacy; yet theſe later have
been Prophets againſt their wils, at their fall, who in their
jollity had little or no will to be Preachers, and were ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
in their doctrine, that they confirmed their calling to
be <hi>jure divino,</hi> though Scripture was never ſo clear againſt
it, in the Royall conſcience, to whom a Crown and Scepter
muſt appear moſt ſacred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:110807:31"/>
And now the Father, and Sonnes, the Pope and Prelates
profit requiring it, what could there be imagined, but that it
muſt be ſtamp'd with a divine right? alas it was eaſie with
them to take ſacred from an Oath, and confer it upon the
perjured Violater; they had their holy oyle ſent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by an Angel to <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> that Metropolitan Saint,
and Martyr of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with which Kings were anointed,
and divers other holy devices to make them ſacred, not to be
touched by prophane Civill Lawes, or queſtioned by any but
men in holy orders; who being ghoſtly Fathers, might laſh,
curſe, depoſe, and devote to the Knife, Sword, &amp;c. (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Sacred, and Majeſty, and holy Vnction, and all the
reſt) Emperours, or Kings, if ſtubborn, or encroaching upon
the uſurpations of Holy Church.</p>
            <p>For you may obſerve that clauſe in the Coronation Oath to
maintaine the rights and privileges of Holy Church, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſahle
in former times as well as theſe latter, wherein
conſcience was onely made of preſerving Epiſcopacy: Thus
one part of the Oath was not to be violated upon pain of the
higheſt cenſures; all the reſt but a mere formality, and we
poor Lay-ſlaves not to queſtion our Kings doings, but in a
blind and brutiſh obedience perform all their commands, juſt
or unjuſt, good or wicked, our Clergy Impoſtures making the
Pulpits ring with <hi>to obey is better than ſacrifice, for Rebellion is
as the ſinne of VVitchcraft, &amp;c.</hi> Sacred writ being wrack'd to
torment us, and the Scriptures perverted to ſubvert our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and notwithſtanding the Cheat was ſo palpable, the
peoples underſtandings were loſt in the Fogge, which theſe
Gipſy Magicians raiſed by their Charmes.</p>
            <p>Behold then the reaſon of Epiſcopacies being ſo ſacred and
divine in the judgment of Kings, who were ſo devoted to
Tyranny that they ventured all to maintain it.</p>
            <p>3. The Nobility were made the Whifflers to make roome
for the Monarchicall Maſquers: and although many of theſe
were ſo generous, that they diſdained to be ſlaves, and ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and valiant, that they regained their fredoms, and brought
the Tyrants on their knees, yet ſo ambitious and envious were
the moſt of them, that they were eaſily divided and made to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:110807:32"/>
ruine one another, every one choſing rather to be a ſlave to a
Tyrant, than be equall'd by his fellow, and gaping for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
over the reſt by his obſequiouſneſſ to his great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
thus by envy and Court preferment; being bewitch'd, they
ſtill undid what they had well done, and made the peoples ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up of arms for Liberty the ſtep to their own preferment,
betraying them to curry favour with their oppreſſor.</p>
            <p>Thus were the people ſtill betrayed by their Leaders, and ſo
diſabled and diſheartned for the future to claim their rights by
the preſent loſſe and expence of bloud and treaſure: and thoſe
who faithfully ſtood by them ſeverely proſecuted and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
when the Tyrants though vanquiſhed, ſtill eſcaped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſwearing a little amendment, and were ſet up again to take
revenge upon the peoples, and to reward and preferre their
own partakers. Thus were good patriots diſhearnted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt,
whilſt that the Imps of Tyranny were emboldened, and
ſet aloft to the utter ruine of <hi>Englands</hi> Freedom.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, when it was apparent that the noble and free ſpirits
of the Engliſh could never be ſo depreſt but that ſtill they
would up again, and ſo might at laſt, in ſpite of all oppoſers
break the yoke, with the noiſe of Parliaments and Charters,
Kings often ſtilled the Peoples cries, when indeed the former
were ſo ſtuffed with a King, Lords, and Prelats, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Repreſentatives ſate for little more than cyphers to make
up thouſands and ten thouſands, when the others pleaſed to
ſet the figure before them: and the latter were of little or no
uſe to the People, who received no benefit by them, but ſtood
Kings in great ſtead, helping them to Millions, when all other
ſhifts fayled to get money.</p>
            <p>And now theſe things premiſed, I appeal to the judgment
of all rationall creatures, whether it be not ſo perſpicuous
that the dimmeſt eye, on this ſide blindneſſe, not winking our
of deſign muſt perceive</p>
            <p>1. That continuall claim hath been made by the Engliſh to
their rights and Liberties, ſo that in point of Law no preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
ſucceſſion, continued by force, fraud, and perjury, can
be a juſt plea to barre us of our inheritance, our Native Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which we have now gained poſſeſſion of, the moſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:110807:32"/>
high and juſt judge having given ſentence for us upon our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
and of his free grace enabled us to enter in deſpight of
thoſe who ſo long kept poſſeſſion againſt our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.</p>
            <p>2. That it would be the higheſt imprudencie, if not folly
and madneſſe, in us for the future to truſt the moſt promiſing
and inſinuating Princes with our liberties and priviledges,
which can be no longer expected to be preſerved by them,
than they may ſerve as footwools to advance them in the
Throne of abſolute Tyranny.</p>
            <p>3. That the whole frame of juſt Government, hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
by our Norman Lords, who have made their own
proud wills the rules, and their own greatneſſe and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
the end of their Government. <hi>Sic volo ſic jubeo,</hi> was
<hi>Lex terrae,</hi> I mean the Law which was onely in practice; and
if this be not tyranny let our Royaliſts enquire of <hi>Lipſius</hi> no
ſmall Champion of Monarchy, who makes not the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of the Court, but the Good of the Common-wealth
the mark that Princes are ſet up to aim at: <hi>neque enim prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipatus
ipſe finis eſt, abſit, aut altitudoilla &amp; ſplendor, ſed po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli
ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>um,</hi> it is not the greatneſſe and luſtre of the Prince,
but the good of the people that is the end of Principality,
and that eloquent Panegyriſt in his Oration in the Romane
Senate ſhews that the Empereall dignity conſiſted not in
ſound or ſhew; for ſaith he though we adorned our Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
with majeſty and pomp, yet is there farre more due
from them to us the authours and granters of their power,
as to take care of the Common-wealth, and ſetting aſide
ſelf intereſt to intend the good of the people, <hi>&amp;c. neque e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
ſpecie tenus, as nomine fortuna Imperii conſideranda eſt,
ſunt trabeae &amp; faſces, &amp; ſtipatio, &amp; fulgur, &amp; quicquid ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ud
huic dignitati adſtruximus, ſed longè majora ſunt qua vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſim
nobis auctoribus, fautoribuſque potentiae debent, admitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
in animum totius Reipublicae curam, &amp; oblitum quodammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
ſui Geniibus vivere,</hi> &amp;c. Yet thus to have taught his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and the peoples ſoveraigne power had been little leſſe
than treaſon with one of our Monarchs, which a Romane
Emperour diſdained not to hear in the open Senate, though
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110807:33"/>
he was accounted a more abſolute Lord by farre than one of
our Kings, and we were entitled to more liberty than the
Romans.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, ſo great corruption hath invaded Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
in generall; and ſo univerſally is it fallen from its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
purity, that it is moſt evident its fate is not farre off,
<hi>quin ruet ſua mole,</hi> and will be buried in its own rubbiſh, for
there are Symptomes by which the diſſolution of politick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
may be gueſs'd at as well as naturall, and too much
ſurfetting will bring both into the duſt.</p>
            <p>And let us omit the tyrannies, murders, and idolatries,
and take a view but of the perfidies, and perjuries, the main
pieces of King craft, by which Monarchs have carried on
their Deſigns a long while in the world, and we may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſpirit of prophecy foretell what is likely to befall Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
families even by the light of nature, and a common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of providence, for a very heathen Poet tells us,
