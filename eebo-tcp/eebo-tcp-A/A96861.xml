         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hath wrought among≈øt us: but I ≈øhall not detain thee with a long
Preface from the Book, wherein an ingenuous and rationall ≈øpirit
will di≈øcern, that if our pre≈øent Governours had been bound up to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
rules, we could never have attained that e≈øtate which now by Gods
mercy and their prudence we enjoy, and may ≈øo ≈øtill if our own perver≈øne≈ø≈øe

<hi>Africk</hi> which had one foot, and that ≈øo big, that they covered and ≈øhaded
with it their whole body, may be a perfect embleme of our Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which being at first in≈øtituted for a firm ba≈øis and prop to the body
politick, what by the fatall ≈øloath and ≈øtupidity of the people, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du≈øtrious
craft, and activity of Monarchs was turned top≈øie turvie, and
had got ≈øo between heaven and us, that it wholly deprived us of that free
light and happine≈ø≈øe which God and nature held forth unto us; and thus in
≈øtead of a ≈øupport was become a burden under the weight of which the whole
groaned, nay was almo≈øt pre≈ø≈øed to death; but thou being a member and

&amp; have executed ju≈øtice without re≈øpect of per≈øons, they

from Heaven upon this Nation. But let us de≈øcend from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls,
and view but the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the very
Idea of Tyranny, and exact copie after which all other Kings
have writ, e≈øpecially the la≈øt, and we ≈øhall not only behold the
map of our Ance≈øtors mi≈øerie, and folly, but al≈øo perceive our
own happine≈ø≈øe, and Gods mercie in not ≈øuffering us to be
deluded and baffeled as they were.</p>
            <p>In the mid≈øt of the civill flames kindled between Tyranny
and liberty, King <hi>Iohn</hi> expiring, his ≈øonne <hi>Henry</hi> the third, a
child of nine years of age, by the power of <hi>William Mar≈øhall</hi>
Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> and the con≈øent of mo≈øt of the Barons, a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends
the Throne: and here we may ob≈øerve the unadvi≈øed
lenitie of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Lords, who not con≈øidering what was
bred in the bone would not ea≈øily out in the fle≈øh, ≈øo ea≈øily
accepted of the Sonne, though the Father had plaid the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and Traitor to the height, giving the Crown to the
Pope (he would be a ≈ølave him≈øelf rather than they ≈øhould
not) trampling upon the people, yea dete≈øting the whole
Nation, as his grief becau≈øe Corne was ≈øo cheap when he
thought he had wa≈øted al may make out: But Gods time was
not come, and he was plea≈øed to ≈øet their example to guide
po≈øterity from ≈øplitting on that Rock, I mean ≈øuch
of them who when they have eyes will make u≈øe of
them.</p>
            <p>But to ≈øay the truth they were Lords, whom Kings knew
≈øo well to cajole, or at wor≈øt ≈øet ≈øo together by the ears,
that they could command them into their traps at li≈øt; let but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110807:7"/>
one have that Earldome, the other this Lord≈øhip, and their
turns were ≈øerved, others may ≈øhift for them≈øelves if they
can; be≈øides it was none of their intere≈øt to ≈øtub up Tyranny
by the roots, for then down had gon their branches too;
for they knew that when that tree was feld, the Rooks ne≈øt,
mu≈øt to ground with it; but we may be ≈øilent in this and give
experience leave to ≈øpeak for us.</p>
            <p>And yet let us but look a litttle further than the gilded,
and embroydered ≈øuperficies, and we ≈øhall perceive that the≈øe
Lordlings e≈øtate was but even by ≈øo much more free, and
happy than the Commons, by how much that King of <hi>Cypre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi>
condition was bettered, when his Iron ≈øhackles and chains
were converted into ≈øilver fetters: they enjoyed a little more
gaudie ≈øervitude, and to ≈øpeak to the capacity of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman
were as the Fore-hor≈øes in the teame, which though
they weare, the Feather, and have the Bels about their eares,
yet mu≈øt draw them≈øelves as well as tho≈øe that follow; nay
and if they did ≈øeem unwilling to lead, they were ≈øure to be
la≈øh'd by the Royall Carters till the bloud came, and have
their gay trappings to boot pul'd over their eares: and this
the wi≈øe and generous of them knew, and often endeavoured
to remedy, but were ≈øtill prevented by the envy and jealou≈øie
one of another, which was created and ca≈øt in among them by
their Kings, as partly will appeare in the following ≈øtory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> being thus Crowned at <hi>Gloce≈øter,</hi> and many great
Barons daily re≈øorting to his party (moved both by the proud
carriage of the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and the confe≈ø≈øion of the Vi≈øcount

which for two years he had worn over the greate≈øt part of the

that for ea≈øe they were forced to get a new yoke, and elect
<hi>Lewis,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings ≈øonne, to defend them again≈øt his
cruelty, ≈øuch effects wrought the violence of an unruly King,
and the de≈øperation of an oppre≈ø≈øed people.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. Yeare</note>The agreement on <hi>Henrys</hi> part was to re≈øtore to the Barons,

and people all rights and heritages, with the Liberties for

to doe this he takes his Oath, or for him the Popes Legat, and

            <p>The Protectour dyes,<note place="margin">4. Year.</note> a man of great wi≈ødom and valor, and
who had managed affairs to the great ≈øettlement of the State:
and the King is again Crowned, and E≈øcuage of 2. markes a

               <hi>Henry</hi> having gotten ≈øome of his Fathers old Coun≈øellors
about him, begins to play <hi>Rex,</hi> and obtains a Bull from the
Pope, whereby he was adjudged of age ≈øufficient to receive
the Government into his own hands (the power of making &amp;
altering times and ≈øea≈øons it ≈øeems being then in the Romi≈øh
Prelats Power) and now ≈øith He would be of age, in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> the Archbi≈øh. of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and the
Lords de≈øire him to confirm according to Covenant their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed
Liberties. This was impiou≈øly oppugned by ≈øome (as
Princes ≈øhall ever find mouths to expre≈ø≈øe their plea≈øures) of
his Mini≈øters, who urged it to have been an act of Con≈øtraint;
yet at la≈øt it was promi≈øed to be ratified by the King, and ≈øo
by that u≈øual ≈øhift of prolongation was put off for that time, to
the greater vexation of that following; for this all his Raigne
cau≈øed the imbroylments, rendred Him odious to the people,
and made him a far le≈ø≈øe King by ≈øtriving to be more than he
was, a ju≈øt reward of violations.</p>
            <p>But this pau≈øe turned the bloud, and ≈øhewed how ≈øen≈øible
the State was, in the lea≈øt ≈øtoppage of that tender veine: For
the Lords began to a≈ø≈øemble at <hi>Leice≈øter,</hi> but the Archbi≈øh of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> (whom the King by fair words ≈øooth'd into a fools
paradice) by menacing excommunication brought them in; the
King al≈øo to be even with them, demands a re≈øtauration of all
tho≈øe things they had received from his Ance≈øtors, and to
terrifie them for the future, falls upon the chief ≈øticklers, taking
divers Lord≈øhips from them, thus were they forced to ≈øit down
with lo≈ø≈øe of both Lands and Liberties, and ≈øuch of them who≈øe
≈øpirits could not brook the ≈øight of the Coutt abu≈øive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110807:8"/>
≈øecretly to jogge away into the Countrey.</p>
            <p>The Royall gam≈øter having dealt ≈øo well for him≈øelf, yet
on the ≈øudden is put to his trumps, yea forced to ≈øhuffle, and
cut too; Money is wanting to maintain his Wars in <hi>France,</hi>
and this his ranting Coun≈øellours cannot help him too; they
who were ≈øo high in the la≈øt Parliament, are fain now to
lower their ≈øails, the Lions hide mu≈øt be patched up with the
Foxes skin, he mu≈øt promi≈øe and do any thing for pre≈øent
ca≈øh: A Parliament therefore is ≈øummoned to <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi>
and of them a relief demanded, but no pennie,<note place="margin">IX<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Yeare,</note> without a

and now nece≈ø≈øity which makes the Old Wife trot, per≈øwades
<hi>Henry</hi> to be ≈øo gracious to him≈øelfe as to comply with them.
Thus <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and <hi>Charta de Fire≈øta</hi> were confirmed,
which though purcha≈øed before, and then entred upon and
po≈ø≈øe≈øt by the people, yet have been paid for to ≈øome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe
if we con≈øider the ≈øums given ≈øince, and to little or none

<hi>Thus the Petition of Right and other later acts were obtained
by us, which being acts of grace were to cea≈øe when our King
plea≈øed to turn gracele≈ø≈øe, which he never did, nor intended to
doe untill the fir≈øt oppertunity, wherein a ≈ømall rub called im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øibility

            </p>
            <p>The≈øe Lawes thus obtained; downe go the fore≈øts, and
men repo≈ø≈øe≈øs their habitations, which the Norman Lords had
outed them of and be≈øtowed upon Wild Bea≈øts, yet more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offen≈øive

            <p>And now if we will believe one Writer, the very Doggs
rejoyced, being freed from the cu≈øtomary danger of lo≈øing

along: That as the Norman Conqueror fir≈øt appropriated
all old Fore≈øts, and di≈øpeopled places to make new ones, and
≈øtill when any parcell of Liberty was regained, tho≈øe Fore≈øt
Tyrannies were dimini≈øhed; ≈øo now when that Norman yoak
is thrown off our necks, Fore≈øts and Parks are broken open
with it; a certain ≈øigne that tyranny is expired now that its

the Grove of Bayes dyed, which was planted by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu≈øtus,</hi>
when <hi>Nero</hi> was executed, in whom cea≈øed that proud,
and bloody Family.</p>
            <p>Another Parliament is called, wherein nothing was done by
rea≈øon of the Kings ≈øickne≈ø≈øe,<note place="margin">10. Year.</note> but only the Legats unrea≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
demands denyed, the Pope being become more than
quarter-ma≈øter in <hi>England,</hi> by the Kings good Fathers means;
in this year al≈øo the Londoners were fined 5000 marks, and
the Burge≈ø≈øes of Northampton 1200 pounds (for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
aiding <hi>Lewis</hi>) contrary to the Oath and Pardon pa≈ø≈øed
at the agreement, as the Prelates were before, who were
made to pay ≈øuch large ≈øums that the Legat got 12000 marks
for his ≈øhare.</p>
            <p>A Parliament is ≈øummoned at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
him≈øelf to be of lawfull age,<note place="margin">11. Year</note> a≈ø≈øumes the power of

Popes Bull, but it was requi≈øite for his de≈øign to grow child
again, and the Pope was contented to have his Bull turn
Calf to help his Son, whom he knew might make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends;
and now to ≈øhew what metall he was made on, he
cancels and di≈øanuls the Charters as granted in his nonage,
and ≈øo of no validitie. Here we may behold the wretchle≈øs

the Charters: Thus if the King ≈øay 8. is more than 9. the
people mu≈øt believe it, for it is trea≈øon no doubt to que≈øtion
their Soveraignes words or actions, and Rebellion to chop
Logick with him,</p>
            <p>And now this cancelling having annulled all hopes of a ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidie,

that guarded and boul≈øtered out this Grand Sultan and
his Vi≈øier Ba≈øha <hi>Winche≈øter</hi> in their tyrannies) and directs out

            <p>But now give me leave a little to digre≈ø≈øe, and ≈øhew how
our bloud-hounds have run counter on the ≈øame foile, have
acted the mo≈øt of this ≈øcene in our dayes. For thus, though
our King wanted not ≈øo great a ≈øtock of ≈øtrangers to ≈øet up
with, there being ≈øo many ba≈øe ≈øpirited Engli≈øhmen, which
would be in≈øtrumentall in en≈ølaving their Countrey, a thing
our noble and generous Ance≈øtors abhorred to do; yet <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
hor≈øe were to have bin brought over to help to improve
the Trade, and lye for factourage of Tyranny in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Thus the Earl of <hi>Straffora</hi> tels the King he had an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

under the yoak, a Coun≈øel which co≈øt the Giver his Head;
Thus were <hi>Swedes, Danes, French, Scots, Iri≈øh,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
≈øent for over, and invited by the King to help him. Thus
the Members were illegally proceeded again≈øt, the Lords
≈øummoned to <hi>York,</hi> and the Parliament commanded to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
and all that refu≈øed handled without mittens, their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtates
being conferred on tho≈øe who would engage for Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
and them≈øelves proclamed Traytors and Rebels, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the≈øe things con≈øidered, it was no marvell God was ≈øo
often called to witne≈ø≈øe, that Tyranny was not intended, and
impiety u≈øed to create credulity, God mocked that men might
be abu≈øed, ≈øith no rea≈øon could be given to gain our belief,
and make us give our own eyes the lye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:110807:11"/>
The Lords though much weakned by the revolt of ≈øome of
them≈øelves (the King having won the Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and
<hi>Winche≈øter</hi> with a thou≈øand marks bought the Earls of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter,</hi>

very ≈øen≈øible of their oppre≈ø≈øion and the Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> to cry
quittance with the K. and make amends for his former faults,
breaks pri≈øon and joyns with them: hereupon the K. in per≈øon
marches again≈øt them, but he is beaten, and forced to retreat
with di≈øhonor to <hi>Gloce≈øter,</hi> his Foraigners al≈øo being again
≈øent again≈øt them runne the ≈øame chance, their Generall and
thou≈øands of them being ≈ølain on the place, being fru≈øtrated
therefore in his de≈øign of force, the King employes a Fryer to
cajole the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> General of the Forces rai≈øed
by the Barons, but all the flatteries, promi≈øes, and threats of
that crafty in≈øtrument, could not ≈øhake the con≈øtancy of that
Noble Lord, who gallantly told him, <hi>That he feared no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
nor would ever yeeld to the Kings will, which was guided by
no rea≈øon; that he ≈øhould give an evill example to relinqui≈øh
the ju≈øtice of his Cau≈øe, to obey that will which wrought all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øtire,
whereby it might appeare he loved worldly po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions,
more than Right and Honour.</hi> Thus the promi≈øe of re≈øtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his former e≈øtate, with the addition of great Lands in
<hi>Herefordshire,</hi> nothing prevailed with him, in who≈øe heroik
Mind Honour and his Conntryes good were Commanders
in chief.</p>
            <p>No way therefore now being left but that, the King tryes
what may be done by Treachery, and takes a truce with them:
in the mean while ≈øeizing all tho≈øe great po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions which
were left the Earl in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by his famous Ance≈øtor the Earl
<hi>Strongbow,</hi> that thereby he might draw the Earl over thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
this de≈øign takes effect, and the Earl endeavouring to
regain his livelihood lo≈øt his life circumvented by treachery.
Thus noble≈øt ≈øouls are ≈øoone≈øt intrapt, who mea≈øuring others
their own thoughts are the lea≈øt ≈øu≈øpicious; but his death
wrought ≈øuch effects as cau≈øed the King to di≈øown the bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe,

≈øo the Parliament will but relieve him, will ratifie and confirm

            <p>For the Parliament having ≈øo often found by experience,
that no civill promi≈øe or verball profe≈ø≈øion, would hold in

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:110807:20"/>
And the King with all the great Nobility, all the Prelats
in their Ve≈øtments, with burning Candles in their hands, a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemble
in the great Hall at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi> to receive that

lays his hand ≈øpred upon his Bre≈øt the whole time the ≈øentence

&amp;c. which done he cau≈øes the Charter of King <hi>Iohn</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

away their Candles, which lay ≈ømoaking on the ground, they
cryed out, So let them which incurre this ≈øentence be extinct,

God me help I will, as I am a Man, a Chri≈øtian, a Knight,
a King Crowned and Annointed, inviolably ob≈øerve all the≈øe
things.</p>
            <p>Never were Lawes (≈øaith that witty Hi≈øtorian) among≈øt
men (except tho≈øe holy Commandements on the Mount)
e≈øtabli≈øhed with more Maje≈øty of Ceremony to make them
reverend, and re≈øpected, than the≈øe were; they wanted but
Thunder and Lightning from Heaven, which likewi≈øe if pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
could have effected, they would have had, to make the
≈øentence ga≈øtly and hideous to the infringers thereof.</p>
            <p>Yet no ≈øooner was this Parliament di≈ø≈øolved by a ≈øacred

to infringe all, and with a part of the money he then got,
purcha≈øing an ab≈øolution of the Pope, returnes to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
oppre≈ø≈øive cour≈øes, with more violence and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe;
and for ought we know our late King had the like to
help him over all tho≈øe ≈øtyles, for Ma≈øter <hi>Prynne</hi> tells us,
there was an Engli≈øh Lieger in Rome, and our own eyes, that
there were Nuntio's here at home, to continue a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øpondence
between the Pope, and his Royall Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</p>
            <p>Thus what the King does, the Pope undoes for money,
≈øo cur≈øed a thir≈øt after Gold was in both: It is no wonder
therefore ≈øome of <hi>Henry</hi>'s late ≈øucce≈ø≈øors were hying ≈øo fa≈øt to

            <p>The≈øe Deeds being done, ≈øucceeds one ≈øo mon≈øtrous, that

            <p>Vpon this a Parlament is ≈øummoned, and of them money

               <hi>Gloce≈øter</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> having done the Prologue, the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
begins, wherein the Scenes were ≈øo well laid, that every
actor was ready to enter, and each had his part ≈øo well by
heart, that it is plain they had been long conning their le≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons;
for no ≈øooner were the≈øe two gone, but the Earles,
<hi>Warren, Pembroke,</hi> with a whole ≈øhoale of <hi>Poictovins,</hi> and
other ≈øtrangers, come to land in <hi>Wales,</hi> which with the ≈øcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
reliques of the battell at <hi>Lewes,</hi> gathered from all
parts, embody in great numbers before the Lords who ≈øtood
faithfull were aware of them, yet they prepare for them as
fa≈øt as they can: but their fortune was now in the wane, their
pity and credulity had brought them into the ≈ønare, and their
lives mu≈øt go for ≈øuffering him to e≈øcape whom God had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
into their hands: for to condemne the innocent and
ab≈øolve the guilty, are equally abominable in the ≈øight of
heaven: and our ance≈øtors to their co≈øt have made experience
of the truth of the Proverb, Save a thief from the Gallows, and
he ≈øhall be the fir≈øt will cut your throat.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt the Armies meet at <hi>Killingworth,</hi> where the Lord
<hi>Simon Montford</hi> ≈øonne to the Earl of <hi>Leice≈øter</hi> is defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
this bad newes meeting <hi>Leice≈øter</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> ha≈øtens
him to repair the breach made in their fortunes, and he meets
the enemy near <hi>Eve≈øham,</hi> where in a bloody field fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mo≈øt valiantly, he lo≈øes life and victory both, and
with him many more of the mo≈øt noble Engli≈øh fall
a victime to perjured Tyranny, who≈øe rationall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
≈øouls di≈ødaininga Bruti≈øh ≈ølavery, freely offered up
their bodies on the High places of the field, a rich oblation
for <hi>Englands</hi> freedome, which together expired, and lay
butchered by them.</p>
            <p>The lo≈ø≈øe of this battell was imputed to the cowardice of
the Wel≈øh, who in great numbers ranne away in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the fight, not to the inju≈øtice of the cau≈øe, of which
the people had a ≈øacred opinion: but the truth is, there was an

them≈øelves little better than Devils, and the di≈ømembred
body gave a fragrant ≈øent, while≈øt the di≈ømemberers rotted and
≈øtank alive, thus after death <hi>Leice≈øter</hi> leads a triumph over
Tyranny, which may in≈øtruct us how far a free and generous
≈øoul is above its reach.</p>
            <p>And here notwith≈øtanding the calumnies and reproaches
wherewith the Royall party backed with ≈øucce≈ø≈øe, and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiticall
Chronologers then and ≈øince have loaded <hi>Leice≈øter;</hi>
yet we may take a gue≈ø≈øe of the worth of that noble Lord by
the love of the people, and malice of the Tyrant: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

for his heart: and ≈øure the common people had more than

though ≈øhe was his ≈øi≈øter, a Lady of eminent note, both

their ≈øtrengths were ≈øeemingly received into favour: thus

that none dare believe them but will rather fight it out to the

            <p>This An≈øwer to the Legat ≈øo netled <hi>Henry,</hi> that he could

move for removall of grievances, untill at la≈øt needing a va≈øt
Summe to maintaine his Wars, he Summoned a Parliament,
wherein he was plea≈øed to confirme the Charters to ≈øtop their
mouthes and open their pur≈øes, and this he often did when
his occa≈øions urged him to it, which like all other royall
promi≈øers he performed by lea≈øure; Never was Royalty
more Maje≈øtick, and glorious than in this Kings Raign, and
the people le≈ø≈øe able to oppo≈øe; but I ≈øhall conclude his

advantage and better opportunity to regain and revive the
claim of their liberties, which the other by oraft, force, and a

the re≈øt to fly into <hi>Scotland,</hi> overthrowing their ancient
Lawes, and introducing others in a ≈øtrange language, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating
the old Fore≈øts, and making new ones, by depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the Countrey, and pulling down Churches, Abbies,
and Hou≈øes for thirty miles together, and yet prohibiting the
people the liberty of hunting upon great penalties, the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
priviledge and delight of the Engli≈øh: thus by treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
and perjury cheating the Engli≈øh of their liberties, whom
by force he could not bring under his yoke, he laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
upon which his Succe≈ø≈øours have erected the ≈øtately
trophies of Tyranny among≈øt us.</p>
            <p>But the Engli≈øh being of a generous and free nature were
≈øo impatient of the yoke, that upon all opportunities they
did endeavour to break it; whereupon our Kings were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110807:31"/>
≈øtill to make u≈øe of other props to uphold their tottering
edifice, which perjury alone was too rotten to ≈øu≈øtain, and by
the Pope, Prelates, and Lords, working upon the credulous,
≈øuper≈øtitious, and un≈øtable vulgar, did even to admiration
≈øhore up their <hi>Babel</hi> to the confu≈øion of liberty.</p>
            <p>1. The Pope was the chief Hobgob in in tho≈øe dark times,
that ≈øcared the people out of their wits; for through the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øtitious
ignorance of men, he had u≈øurped the power of
God; this Iugler with the counterfeit thunder of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications,
and cur≈øes, which his Bulls upon all occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
bellowed forth again≈øt the a≈ø≈øertors of Liberty, and with
the pretended omnipotency of his di≈øpen≈øations with the
oathes of the Tyrant, ≈øo amazed the people, that he not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
domineered him≈øelf, but, like the Lord <hi>Paramount,</hi> for great
Fines let the Land out, to be harrowed, and the inhabitants
to be handled like villains and ≈ølaves to his Royall and well
beloved ≈øonnes (indeed he was a dear father to mo≈øt of
them) our immediate Landlords.</p>
            <p>2. The proud Prelates, the Imps of that great <hi>Diabolo</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> were many of them ≈øtrangers, and all of them the
Creatures of the Popes, and Kings (who would choo≈øe none,
but ≈øuch as were fit for their de≈øigns, by their good wills,
and with their ill wills could out any that ≈øhould thwart
them) and ≈øo either regarded not our ≈øufferings, or were
bound to augment them to plea≈øe their Patrons, as well as to
pamper them≈øelves, who being Dioce≈øan Monarchs were no
foes to Arbitrary power that them≈øelves might tyrannize <hi>ad
libitum</hi> over their Sees.</p>
            <p>And no doubt but Kings were ≈øo crafty as to per≈øwade them
<hi>No King, no Bi≈øhop,</hi> heretofore, to heighten their zeal to the
Royall cau≈øe, as Prelats of late have ≈øtiffened them with <hi>No
Bi≈øhop, no King,</hi> in ob≈øtinacy for Prelacy; yet the≈øe later have
been Prophets again≈øt their wils, at their fall, who in their
jollity had little or no will to be Preachers, and were ≈øo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
in their doctrine, that they confirmed their calling to
be <hi>jure divino,</hi> though Scripture was never ≈øo clear again≈øt
it, in the Royall con≈øcience, to whom a Crown and Scepter
mu≈øt appear mo≈øt ≈øacred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:110807:31"/>
And now the Father, and Sonnes, the Pope and Prelates
profit requiring it, what could there be imagined, but that it
mu≈øt be ≈øtamp'd with a divine right? alas it was ea≈øie with
them to take ≈øacred from an Oath, and confer it upon the
perjured Violater; they had their holy oyle ≈øent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by an Angel to <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> that Metropolitan Saint,
and Martyr of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with which Kings were anointed,
and divers other holy devices to make them ≈øacred, not to be
touched by prophane Civill Lawes, or que≈øtioned by any but
men in holy orders; who being gho≈øtly Fathers, might la≈øh,
cur≈øe, depo≈øe, and devote to the Knife, Sword, &amp;c. (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding
Sacred, and Maje≈øty, and holy Vnction, and all the
re≈øt) Emperours, or Kings, if ≈øtubborn, or encroaching upon
the u≈øurpations of Holy Church.</p>
            <p>For you may ob≈øerve that clau≈øe in the Coronation Oath to
maintaine the rights and privileges of Holy Church, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øpen≈øahle
in former times as well as the≈øe latter, wherein
con≈øcience was onely made of pre≈øerving Epi≈øcopacy: Thus
one part of the Oath was not to be violated upon pain of the
highe≈øt cen≈øures; all the re≈øt but a mere formality, and we
poor Lay-≈ølaves not to que≈øtion our Kings doings, but in a
blind and bruti≈øh obedience perform all their commands, ju≈øt
or unju≈øt, good or wicked, our Clergy Impo≈øtures making the
Pulpits ring with <hi>to obey is better than ≈øacrifice, for Rebellion is
as the ≈øinne of VVitchcraft, &amp;c.</hi> Sacred writ being wrack'd to
torment us, and the Scriptures perverted to ≈øubvert our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and notwith≈øtanding the Cheat was ≈øo palpable, the
peoples under≈øtandings were lo≈øt in the Fogge, which the≈øe
Gip≈øy Magicians rai≈øed by their Charmes.</p>
            <p>Behold then the rea≈øon of Epi≈øcopacies being ≈øo ≈øacred and
divine in the judgment of Kings, who were ≈øo devoted to
Tyranny that they ventured all to maintain it.</p>
            <p>3. The Nobility were made the Whifflers to make roome
for the Monarchicall Ma≈øquers: and although many of the≈øe
were ≈øo generous, that they di≈ødained to be ≈ølaves, and ≈øo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and valiant, that they regained their fredoms, and brought
the Tyrants on their knees, yet ≈øo ambitious and envious were
the mo≈øt of them, that they were ea≈øily divided and made to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:110807:32"/>
ruine one another, every one cho≈øing rather to be a ≈ølave to a
Tyrant, than be equall'd by his fellow, and gaping for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
over the re≈øt by his ob≈øequiou≈øne≈ø≈ø to his great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter,
thus by envy and Court preferment; being bewitch'd, they
≈øtill undid what they had well done, and made the peoples ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up of arms for Liberty the ≈øtep to their own preferment,
betraying them to curry favour with their oppre≈ø≈øor.</p>
            <p>Thus were the people ≈øtill betrayed by their Leaders, and ≈øo
di≈øabled and di≈øheartned for the future to claim their rights by
the pre≈øent lo≈ø≈øe and expence of bloud and trea≈øure: and tho≈øe
who faithfully ≈øtood by them ≈øeverely pro≈øecuted and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
when the Tyrants though vanqui≈øhed, ≈øtill e≈øcaped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
≈øwearing a little amendment, and were ≈øet up again to take
revenge upon the peoples, and to reward and preferre their
own partakers. Thus were good patriots di≈øhearnted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øt,
whil≈øt that the Imps of Tyranny were emboldened, and
≈øet aloft to the utter ruine of <hi>Englands</hi> Freedom.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, when it was apparent that the noble and free ≈øpirits
of the Engli≈øh could never be ≈øo depre≈øt but that ≈øtill they
would up again, and ≈øo might at la≈øt, in ≈øpite of all oppo≈øers
break the yoke, with the noi≈øe of Parliaments and Charters,
Kings often ≈øtilled the Peoples cries, when indeed the former
were ≈øo ≈øtuffed with a King, Lords, and Prelats, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Repre≈øentatives ≈øate for little more than cyphers to make
up thou≈øands and ten thou≈øands, when the others plea≈øed to
≈øet the figure before them: and the latter were of little or no
u≈øe to the People, who received no benefit by them, but ≈øtood
Kings in great ≈øtead, helping them to Millions, when all other
≈øhifts fayled to get money.</p>
            <p>And now the≈øe things premi≈øed, I appeal to the judgment
of all rationall creatures, whether it be not ≈øo per≈øpicuous
that the dimme≈øt eye, on this ≈øide blindne≈ø≈øe, not winking our
of de≈øign mu≈øt perceive</p>
            <p>1. That continuall claim hath been made by the Engli≈øh to
their rights and Liberties, ≈øo that in point of Law no preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
≈øucce≈ø≈øion, continued by force, fraud, and perjury, can
be a ju≈øt plea to barre us of our inheritance, our Native Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which we have now gained po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of, the mo≈øt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:110807:32"/>
high and ju≈øt judge having given ≈øentence for us upon our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
and of his free grace enabled us to enter in de≈øpight of
tho≈øe who ≈øo long kept po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion again≈øt our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtors.</p>
            <p>2. That it would be the highe≈øt imprudencie, if not folly
and madne≈ø≈øe, in us for the future to tru≈øt the mo≈øt promi≈øing
and in≈øinuating Princes with our liberties and priviledges,
which can be no longer expected to be pre≈øerved by them,
than they may ≈øerve as footwools to advance them in the
Throne of ab≈øolute Tyranny.</p>
            <p>3. That the whole frame of ju≈øt Government, hath been di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved
by our Norman Lords, who have made their own
proud wills the rules, and their own greatne≈ø≈øe and ab≈øolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe
the end of their Government. <hi>Sic volo ≈øic jubeo,</hi> was
<hi>Lex terrae,</hi> I mean the Law which was onely in practice; and
if this be not tyranny let our Royali≈øts enquire of <hi>Lip≈øius</hi> no
≈ømall Champion of Monarchy, who makes not the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of the Court, but the Good of the Common-wealth
the mark that Princes are ≈øet up to aim at: <hi>neque enim prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipatus

                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>um,</hi> it is not the greatne≈ø≈øe and lu≈øtre of the Prince,
but the good of the people that is the end of Principality,
and that eloquent Panegyri≈øt in his Oration in the Romane
Senate ≈øhews that the Empereall dignity con≈øi≈øted not in
≈øound or ≈øhew; for ≈øaith he though we adorned our Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
with maje≈øty and pomp, yet is there farre more due
from them to us the authours and granters of their power,
as to take care of the Common-wealth, and ≈øetting a≈øide
≈øelf intere≈øt to intend the good of the people, <hi>&amp;c. neque e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
≈øpecie tenus, as nomine fortuna Imperii con≈øideranda e≈øt,
≈øunt trabeae &amp; fa≈øces, &amp; ≈øtipatio, &amp; fulgur, &amp; quicquid ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ud

in animum totius Reipublicae curam, &amp; oblitum quodammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
≈øui Geniibus vivere,</hi> &amp;c. Yet thus to have taught his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and the peoples ≈øoveraigne power had been little le≈ø≈øe
than trea≈øon with one of our Monarchs, which a Romane
Emperour di≈ødained not to hear in the open Senate, though
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110807:33"/>
he was accounted a more ab≈øolute Lord by farre than one of
our Kings, and we were entitled to more liberty than the
Romans.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, ≈øo great corruption hath invaded Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
in generall; and ≈øo univer≈øally is it fallen from its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
purity, that it is mo≈øt evident its fate is not farre off,
<hi>quin ruet ≈øua mole,</hi> and will be buried in its own rubbi≈øh, for
there are Symptomes by which the di≈ø≈øolution of politick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
may be gue≈øs'd at as well as naturall, and too much
≈øurfetting will bring both into the du≈øt.</p>
            <p>And let us omit the tyrannies, murders, and idolatries,
and take a view but of the perfidies, and perjuries, the main
pieces of King craft, by which Monarchs have carried on
their De≈øigns a long while in the world, and we may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ≈øpirit of prophecy foretell what is likely to befall Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
families even by the light of nature, and a common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation
of providence, for a very heathen Poet tells us,
