            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Disgrace of Mankind; or, a Charge drawn up against Drunkards,
and presented to his Highness the Lord PROTECTOR, in the name of all
the Sober Party in the three Nations. Humbly craving, that they may be kept

they consume: And that none may be suffered to sell Drink, who shall either
Swear, or be Drunk themselves, or suffer Others within their Wals.</head>

            <head>1. BRANCH of the Charge.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat as the <hi>Basilisk</hi> is chief of <hi>Serpents:</hi> so of <hi>sinners</hi> the
<hi>Drunkard</hi> is chief. That <hi>Drunkenness</hi> is of <hi>sins</hi> the <hi>Queen:</hi> as
the <hi>Gout</hi> is of <hi>diseases:</hi> even the <hi>root</hi> of all <hi>evil,</hi> the <hi>rot</hi> of all
<hi>good.</hi> A sin which turns a man wholly into sin. That all sins,
all beast-like, all serpentine qualities meet in a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> as
<hi>rivers</hi> in the <hi>sea:</hi> and that it were far better be a <hi>Toad,</hi> or a
<hi>Serpent,</hi> than a <hi>Drunkard.</hi> That the <hi>Drunkard</hi> is like <hi>Ahab, who sold himself
to work wickedness.</hi> That he wholly dedicates, resigns, surrenders, and gives
himself up to serve <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>Satan.</hi> That his only imploiment is to <hi>drink,
drab, quarrel, swear, curse, scoff, slander</hi> and <hi>seduce:</hi> as if to <hi>sin</hi> were his <hi>trade,</hi>
and he could do nothing else; like the <hi>Devil,</hi> who was a sinner from the
<hi>beginning,</hi> a sinner to the <hi>end.</hi> That these <hi>sons of Belial,</hi> are all for the <hi>belly:</hi>
for to drink <hi>God</hi> out of their hearts, <hi>health</hi> out of their bodies, <hi>wit</hi> out of
their heads, <hi>strength</hi> out of their joynts, all the <hi>money</hi> out of their purses, all
the <hi>drink</hi> out of the Brewers barrels, <hi>wife</hi> and <hi>children</hi> out of doors, the
<hi>house</hi> out at windows, the <hi>Land</hi> out of quiet, <hi>plenty</hi> out of the <hi>Nation,</hi> is all
their business. In which their swinish swilling, they resemble so many <hi>frogs</hi>
in a <hi>puddle,</hi> or <hi>water-snakes</hi> in a <hi>pond:</hi> for their whole exercise, yea, Religion,
is to drink; they even drown themselves on the dry land. That they
drink more <hi>spirits</hi> in one night, then their <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>brains</hi> be <hi>worth.</hi> That
more is thrown out of one <hi>swines nose,</hi> and <hi>mouth,</hi> and <hi>guts,</hi> than would
maintain five sufficient families.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Br.</hi> That it is not to be imagined, what all the <hi>Drunkards</hi> in one
<hi>Shire,</hi> or <hi>County</hi> do devour, and worse than throw away in one year:
when it hath been known (if we may give credit to <hi>Authours,</hi> and the
<hi>Oaths</hi> of others) that <hi>two and thirty</hi> in one cluster have made themselves
drunk; that <hi>six and thirty</hi> have dranke themselves dead in the place,
with carowsing of healths; that at one Supper, <hi>one and fourty</hi> have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
themselves, with striving for the conquest: that <hi>two</hi> have drank each
of them a <hi>peck</hi> at a draught: that <hi>four men</hi> have drank <hi>four gallons</hi> of wine
at a sitting: that <hi>one man</hi> hath drank <hi>two gallons</hi> of wine; and <hi>two</hi> more,
<hi>three gallons</hi> of wine a piece at a time: that one Drunkard in a few
hours, drank <hi>four gallons</hi> of wine: that <hi>four</hi> ancient men drank as
many cups of wine at one sitting, as they had lived years, which was in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110246:2"/>
all, <hi>three hundred</hi> cups of wine <hi>amongst four</hi> men: and lastly, that <hi>three women</hi>
came into a Tavern in <hi>Fleetstreet</hi> (when I was a boy, take it upon <hi>Claptons</hi>
Oath and credit, who drew the Wine) and drank <hi>fourty nine quarts of
Sack;</hi> two of them <hi>sixteen</hi> a piece, and the third to get the victory, <hi>seventeen
quarts of Sack.</hi> Which being so, what may the many millions of these <hi>ding-thrifty
dearth-makers</hi> consume in a year in all the three <hi>Nations?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor need it seem incredible, that common drunkards should drink thus:
for they can disgorge themselves at pleasure, by only putting their finger to
their throat. And they will vomit, as if they were so many live <hi>Whales</hi> spuing
up the <hi>Ocean;</hi> which done, they can drink afresh.</p>
            <p>Or if not so, yet custom hath made it pass thorow them, as thorow a <hi>tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi>
or <hi>strainer;</hi> whereby it comes out again as sheer wine as it went in, as
hath been observed.</p>
            <p>Nor hath the richest <hi>Sherry</hi> or old <hi>Canary</hi> any more operation with them, then
a cup of <hi>six</hi> hath with me. And no marvell for if <hi>physick</hi> be taken too oft, it wil
not work like <hi>physick:</hi> but nature entertains it as a <hi>friend,</hi> not as a <hi>Physitian:</hi>
yea <hi>poison</hi> by a familiar use becomes natural <hi>food.</hi> As <hi>Aristotle</hi> (in an example
of a Maid, who used to pick <hi>spiders</hi> off the wals and eat them) makes plain.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Br.</hi> That as Drunkards have lost the prerogative of their <hi>creation,</hi> and
are changed (with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 4. 16.) from <hi>men</hi> into <hi>beasts,</hi> so
they turn the <hi>sanctuary of life</hi> into the <hi>shambles of death:</hi> yea thousands
(when they have made up the measure of their wickedness) are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in <hi>God</hi>'s just wrath in their drink; (as it were with the <hi>weapon in their
bellies)</hi> it faring with them as it did with that <hi>Pope,</hi> whom the <hi>Devil</hi> is said
to have slain in the very instant of his Adultery, and carry him quick to <hi>hell;</hi>
being suddenly struck with death, as if the <hi>execution</hi> were no lesse intended
to the <hi>soul,</hi> than to the <hi>body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That by the <hi>Law of God</hi> in both <hi>Testaments; He that will not labour, should
not eat,</hi> Gen. 3. 19. Prov. 20. 4. 2 Thes. 3. 10. because he robs the <hi>Common-wealth</hi>
of that which is altogether as profitable as <hi>land,</hi> or <hi>treasure.</hi> But
Drunkards are not only <hi>lazy get-nothings,</hi> but they are also <hi>riotous spend-als;</hi>
and yet these <hi>drunken drones,</hi> these <hi>gut-mongers,</hi> these <hi>Quagmirists,</hi> like <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants</hi>
and <hi>vermine,</hi> do nothing all their life-long that may tend to any good,
as is storied of <hi>Margites,</hi> and yet devour more of the <hi>fat of the Land,</hi> than
would plentifully maintain those <hi>millions of poor</hi> in the Nation, that are ready
to famish. A thing not fit to be suffered in any <hi>Christian Common-wealth, yea
far fitter they were stoned to death,</hi> as by the <hi>Law of God</hi> they ought, <hi>Deut. 21.
20, 21.</hi> since this might bring them to repentance; whereas now <hi>they spend
their dayes in mirth: and suddenly they go down into hell,</hi> Job 21. 13. Drunkards
being those <hi>swine,</hi> whom the <hi>legion</hi> carries headlong into the <hi>Sea,</hi> or pit of
<hi>perdition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Br.</hi> That every <hi>hour</hi> seems a <hi>day,</hi> and <hi>every day</hi> a <hi>month</hi> to a drunkard,
that is not spent in a <hi>Tap-house;</hi> yea, they seem to have nailed their ears to
the door of some <hi>Tavern</hi> or <hi>Tap-house,</hi> and to have agreed with <hi>Satan, Master,
it is good being here!</hi> That where ever the Drunkards <hi>house</hi> is, his dwelling is
at the <hi>Ale-house,</hi> except all his mony be spent, and then if his <hi>wife</hi> will fetch
him home with a <hi>lanth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

That the <hi>pot</hi> is no sooner from their <hi>lips,</hi> but they are <hi>melancholy,</hi> and their
hearts as heavy, as if a <hi>milstone</hi> lay upon it. Or rather they are vexed like <hi>Saul</hi>
with an <hi>evil spirit,</hi> which nothing will drive away but <hi>drink</hi> and <hi>Tobacco.</hi>
They so wound their consciences with all kind of prodigious wickedness,
and so exceedingly provoke <hi>God,</hi> that they are <hi>rackt</hi> in conscience, and <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured</hi>
with the very flashes of <hi>hell-fire.</hi> That they drink to the end only, that
they may forget <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>threats</hi> and <hi>judgments;</hi> that they may drown <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
and put of all thoughts of <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>hell;</hi> and to <hi>hearten</hi> and <hi>harden</hi>
themselves against all the <hi>messages of God, and threats of the Law:</hi> which is
no other in mitigating the pangs of conscience, than as a <hi>saddle of gold</hi> to a
<hi>galled horse,</hi> or a draught of <hi>poison</hi> to quench a mans <hi>thirst.</hi> That if they might
have their wils, none should refuse to be drunk <hi>unpunished,</hi> or be drunk <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded</hi>
at the common charge. As how will they boast what they drank,
and how many they conquer'd at such a meeting, making it their only <hi>glory?</hi>
That the utmost of a Drunkards <hi>honesty</hi> is <hi>good-fellowship;</hi> that <hi>temperance</hi>
and <hi>sobriety</hi> with them, is nothing but <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>singularity;</hi> and that they
drink not for <hi>strength</hi> or <hi>need,</hi> but for <hi>lust</hi> and <hi>pride;</hi> to shew how full of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
they are, and how near to <hi>swine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That though these <hi>swinish swill-bouls</hi> make their <hi>gullet</hi> their <hi>god,</hi> and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
more to their <hi>god-belly,</hi> than those <hi>Babylonians</hi> did to their <hi>god Bell,
Bell &amp; Drag. ver. 3.</hi> yet they will <hi>say,</hi> yea <hi>swear,</hi> that they drink not for love
of drink, though they love it above <hi>health, wealth, credit, child, wife, life, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
salvation, all.</hi> They no more care for <hi>wine,</hi> than <hi>Esau</hi> did for his <hi>pottage</hi>
for which he sold his <hi>birth-right,</hi> Isa. 56 12.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Br.</hi> That Drunkards are the <hi>Devils captives,</hi> at his command, and ready

they suffer themselves to be <hi>transformed</hi> from <hi>men</hi> into <hi>swine;</hi> as <hi>Elpenor</hi>

the <hi>table;</hi> which is to <hi>brag</hi> how far they are become the <hi>Devils children:</hi>

Psal. 13. 4. But what a <hi>barbarous, graceless, and unchristian-like practice</hi> is
this, to make it their <hi>glory, pastime,</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> to see <hi>God dishonoured,</hi> his

the <hi>ladder of wickedness;</hi> as thinking their own sins will not press them
deep enough into <hi>hell,</hi> except they load themselves with other mens; which
is <hi>Devil-like</hi> indeed! whose aim it hath ever been, seeing he must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be wretched, not to be wretched alone.</p>
            <p>That as they make these <hi>healths</hi> serve as a <hi>pulley,</hi> or <hi>shoing-horn</hi> to draw
men on to drink more, then else they would or should do: so a <hi>health</hi> being

wrong his own <hi>body,</hi> destroy his <hi>soul,</hi> and wilfully <hi>leap into hell fire</hi> with

wickedness of one that <hi>feareth God,</hi> is far better than the <hi>good intreaty</hi> of a

            </p>
            <p>That with sweet words they will tole men on to destruction, as we tole

they will so mollifie the stiffness of a mans prejudice, so temper and fit him
to their own mould; that once to suspect them, requires the spirit of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning.

have learned to handle a man so sweetly, that one would think it a <hi>pleasure</hi>
to be <hi>seduced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But little do they think, how they advance their own damnations, when
the blood of so many souls, as they have drawn away, will be required at
their hands! For know this thou tempter, that thou dost not more <hi>increase
other mens wickedness on earth,</hi> (whether by <hi>perswasion,</hi> or <hi>provocation,</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample)</hi>
than their wickedness shall <hi>increase thy damnation in hell,</hi> Luk. 16. 27,
28. <hi>Non fratres dilexit, sed seipsum respexit.</hi> And this let me say to the horror

to <hi>death,</hi> and makes him (like <hi>Solomons fool)</hi> die <hi>laughing.</hi> Whence it is, that
many who hate their other <hi>enemies</hi> (yea, and their <hi>friends</hi> too) imbrace
this <hi>enemy,</hi> because he <hi>kisseth</hi> when he <hi>betrayeth.</hi> And indeed what <hi>fence?</hi> for
a <hi>pistol charged</hi> with the <hi>bullet of friendship.</hi> Hence it is also, that thousands
have confest at the <hi>Gallows, I had never come to this, but for such, and such a
Drunkard.</hi> For commonly the <hi>Drunkards progress</hi> is, from <hi>luxury</hi> to <hi>beggery,</hi>
from <hi>beggery</hi> to <hi>thievery,</hi> from the <hi>Tavern</hi> to <hi>Tyborne,</hi> from the <hi>Ale-house</hi> to
the <hi>Gallows.</hi> Briefly, That these <hi>Bauds</hi> and <hi>Panders</hi> of <hi>vice</hi> breathe nothing
but <hi>infection,</hi> and study nothing but their <hi>own,</hi> and other mens <hi>destruction.</hi>
That the <hi>Drunkard</hi> is like <hi>Julian,</hi> who never did a man a good turn, but
it was to damn his soul. That his proffers are like the <hi>Fowlers shrape,</hi> when
he casts <hi>meat</hi> to <hi>birds,</hi> which is not out of <hi>pity</hi> to <hi>relieve,</hi> but out of <hi>treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
to <hi>insnare</hi> them. Or like <hi>traps</hi> we set for <hi>vermine,</hi> seeming charitable,
when they intend to kill, <hi>Jer. 5. 26.</hi> And thou maist answer these cursed
tempters, who delight in the murther of souls, as the <hi>woman of Endor</hi> did
<hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 28. <hi>Wherefore seekst thou to take me in a snare, to cause me to die,
vers. 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he is another <hi>Absolom,</hi> who made a feast for <hi>Amnon,</hi> whom he meant
to kill. And there is no subtilty like that which deceives a man, and hath
thanks for the labour. For as our Saviour saith, <hi>Blessed is the man that is not
offended at their scoffs,</hi> Mat. 11. 6. So blessed is the man that is not taken
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110246:4"/>
with their wiles. For herein alone consists the difference, <hi>He whom the Lord
loves, shall be delivered from</hi> their meretricious allurements, <hi>Eccl. 7. 26.</hi> And
<hi>he whom the Lord abhors, shall fall into their snares,</hi> Pro. 22. 14.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Br.</hi> That <hi>Taverns</hi> and <hi>Tap-houses</hi> are the drinking <hi>schools,</hi> where they

does not work them to this heighth of impiety all at once, but by degrees:
When <hi>custom of sin</hi> hath deaded all <hi>remorse for sin;</hi> as it is admirable how the
<hi>soul</hi> that takes delight in leudness, is gained upon by custom. They <hi>grow</hi> up
in <hi>sin,</hi> as worldlings grow in <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>honour, They wax worse and worse,</hi>
sayes the Apostle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13. they go first <hi>over-shoo</hi>'s, then <hi>over-boots,</hi> then
<hi>over-shoulders;</hi> and at length <hi>over-head</hi> and <hi>ears</hi> in sin, as some do in debt.
Now these <hi>Tap-houses</hi> are their <hi>meeting-places;</hi> where they hear the <hi>devils le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi>
read; the <hi>shops</hi> and <hi>markets,</hi> where <hi>Satan drives his trade;</hi> the <hi>schools,</hi>
where they take their <hi>degrees;</hi> these are the <hi>Guild-hals</hi> where all sorts of

as them to be <hi>silent;</hi> it faring with their <hi>clappers,</hi> as with a <hi>sick mans pulse,</hi>
which alwaies <hi>beats,</hi> but ever out of order. That one Drunkard hath <hi>tongue</hi>

That it is the property of a Druukard to <hi>disgorge his bosom</hi> with <hi>his stomack,</hi>
to empty his <hi>mind</hi> with his <hi>maw:</hi> His tongue resembles <hi>Bacchus</hi> his <hi>Liber

so much impiety to rest within their wals, do make themselves guilty

the <hi>murthers,</hi> the damnable <hi>drunkenness,</hi> the <hi>numberless,</hi> and <hi>nameless abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
that are committed there. For these <hi>Ale-house-keepers</hi> are accessory to

such, since they might, and ought to redress it: so that their gain is most

their whole life being nought else but a <hi>vicissitude</hi> of <hi>devouring</hi> and <hi>venting,</hi>
and their whole study, how to <hi>tole in customers,</hi> and then <hi>egg them on to drink;</hi>
for as if <hi>drinking</hi> and <hi>tempting</hi> were <hi>their trade:</hi> they are alwayes <hi>guzling
within doors,</hi> or else <hi>tempting at the door,</hi> where they <hi>spend</hi> their <hi>vacant hours,</hi>
watching for a <hi>companion,</hi> as a <hi>spider</hi> would watch for a poor <hi>flie;</hi> or as

her great craft, and flattering lips, she had caused him to yeeld,</hi> Prov. 7. 6, to 24.
Though when he sees a Drunkard, if he but <hi>hold up his finger,</hi> the other
follows him into his <hi>Burrough,</hi> just <hi>like a fool to the stocks,</hi> and as an <hi>Ox to the
slaughter-house,</hi> having no power to withstand the temptation. So in he
goes, and there continues as one <hi>bewitch'd,</hi> or <hi>conjur'd with a spell;</hi> out of

in sheer drink, spend all the <hi>cloaths</hi> on their <hi>beds</hi> and <hi>backs.</hi> As be they poor
<hi>labouring men,</hi> that must dearly earn it before they have it, these <hi>Ale-house
keepers,</hi> these <hi>vice-breeders,</hi> these <hi>soul-murtherers</hi> will make them drink away
as <hi>much in a day,</hi> as they <hi>can get in a week; spend twelve pence,</hi> sooner than <hi>earn
two-pence,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Ambrose</hi> observes.</p>
            <p>That thousands of these <hi>Labouring-men</hi> may be found in the very <hi>Suburbs</hi>
of this <hi>City, that drink the very blood of their wives and children,</hi> who are near
<hi>famished,</hi> to <hi>satisfie</hi> the Drunkards <hi>throat,</hi> or <hi>gut,</hi> wherein they are <hi>worse than
Infidels,</hi> or <hi>Cannibals,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 8. who again are justly met withall: For as if
<hi>God</hi> would <hi>pay</hi> them in their <hi>own coyn,</hi> how often shall you see <hi>vermine</hi> suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Drunkards blood,</hi> as fast as he the others.</p>
            <p>14. <hi>Br.</hi> That these <hi>Drunkards</hi> and <hi>Ale-drapers</hi> are always laying their heads
together, <hi>plotting</hi> and <hi>consulting</hi> how to <hi>charm</hi> and <hi>tame</hi> their <hi>poor wives</hi> (for
the <hi>Drunkard</hi> and his <hi>wife</hi> agree like the <hi>harp</hi> and the <hi>harrow)</hi> which if
<hi>maids</hi> did but hear, they would rather make choice of an <hi>Ape-carrier,</hi> or a
<hi>Jakes-farmers servant,</hi> than of one who will be drawn to the <hi>Ale-house.</hi> For
let them take this for a Rule, He that is a <hi>tame devil abroad,</hi> will be a <hi>roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
devil at home;</hi> and he that hath <hi>begun</hi> to be a Drunkard, will <hi>ever be</hi> a
Drunkard. True, they will <hi>promise</hi> a maid <hi>fair,</hi> and <hi>bind themselves</hi> by an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>oaths</hi> and <hi>protestations;</hi> and she (when <hi>love</hi> hath blinded and besotted
her) will believe them; yea, promise her self the victory, not doubting but
she shall reclaim him from his <hi>evil company;</hi> but <hi>not one of a thousand, scarce
one of ten thousand</hi> that ever finds it so, but the contrary. For let Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
<hi>promise,</hi> yea and <hi>purpose</hi> what they will; Experience shews, that <hi>they
mend as sowr Ale does in Summer;</hi> or as a <hi>dead hedge,</hi> which the <hi>longer</hi> it
stands is the <hi>rottener.</hi> And how should it be other, when they cannot go
the length of a <hi>street,</hi> but they must pass by, perhaps an <hi>hundred Ale-houses,</hi>
where they shall be called in. And all the while they are in the <hi>drinking-school,</hi>
they are bound by <hi>their law of good fellowship</hi> to be <hi>pouring in</hi> at their
<hi>mouths,</hi> or <hi>whiffing out</hi> at their <hi>noses:</hi> one serving as a shoing-horn to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:110246:5"/>
other; which makes them like <hi>ratsban'd Rats, drink and vent, vent and drink,
Sellengers round,</hi> and the same again. Oh that a <hi>maids fore-wit</hi> were but so
good as her <hi>after-wit!</hi> then the Drunkard should <hi>never have wife more to
make a slave of,</hi> nor <hi>wives such cause to curse Ale-house keepers,</hi> as now they
have. And indeed, if I may speak my thoughts, or what reason propounds to
me, Drunkards are such <hi>children</hi> and <hi>fools</hi> (to what Governours of families
ought to be) that a <hi>rod</hi> is fitter for them than a <hi>wife.</hi> But of this by the way
only, that <hi>maids</hi> may not so miserably <hi>cast away themselves;</hi> for they had <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be buried alive,</hi> than <hi>so married,</hi> as most poor mens wives can inform
them.</p>
            <p>15. <hi>Br.</hi> That to speak to these <hi>Demetriuses,</hi> that <hi>get their wealth by drinking;</hi>
yea, by helping to <hi>consume their drink,</hi> and that <hi>live only by sin, and the sins of
the people,</hi> were to speed as <hi>Paul</hi> did at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> after some one of them had
told <hi>the rest of their occupation.</hi> Yea to expect amendment from such, in a
manner were to expect amendment from a <hi>Witch,</hi> who hath already <hi>given
her soul to the devil.</hi> That to what hath been spoken of <hi>Drunkards</hi> and <hi>Drink-sellers</hi>
in the particular cases of <hi>drinking</hi> and <hi>tempting,</hi> might be added <hi>seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
times seven more</hi> of the like <hi>abominations.</hi> For the Drunkard is like some
<hi>putrid grave, the deeper</hi> you dig, <hi>the fuller</hi> you shall find him both of <hi>stench</hi>
and <hi>horrour:</hi> Or like <hi>Hercules</hi>'s <hi>monster,</hi> wherein were <hi>fresh heads still ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
one after the cutting off of another.</hi> But there needs no more than this <hi>taste,</hi>
to make any <hi>wise man</hi> (or any that love their own souls) to <hi>detest</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
these <hi>Bawds</hi> and <hi>pandors of vice,</hi> that breathe nothing but <hi>infection,</hi> and
<hi>study</hi> nothing but <hi>their own,</hi> and <hi>other mens destruction.</hi> These <hi>Brokers</hi> of
<hi>villany,</hi> whose very <hi>acquaintance</hi> is <hi>destruction:</hi> As how can they be other
than <hi>dangerously</hi> infectious, and <hi>desperately</hi> wicked, whose very <hi>mercies</hi> are
<hi>cruelty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. Br. <hi>That I have</hi> unmasked their faces, <hi>is to</hi> infatuate their purpose: <hi>that I
have</hi> inveighed <hi>and</hi> declaimed against Drunkenness, <hi>is</hi> to keep men sober; <hi>For</hi>
vices <hi>true</hi> picture, <hi>makes us</hi> vice detest.</p>
            <p>O that I had <hi>Dehortation</hi> answerable to my <hi>detestation</hi> of it! Only here is a
<hi>discovery</hi> how <hi>Drunkards tempt;</hi> if you will see <hi>directions</hi> how to avoid their
<hi>temptations,</hi> read my <hi>Sovereign Antidote against the contagion of evil company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
Only take notice for the present, that <hi>the best way to avoid evil,</hi> is to <hi>shun the
occasions:</hi> Do not only <hi>shun Drunkenness,</hi> but the <hi>means</hi> to come to it: and to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
hurt,</hi> keep thy self <hi>out of shot;</hi> come not in <hi>drunken company,</hi> nor to <hi>drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
places:</hi> As for their <hi>love</hi> and <hi>friendship,</hi> consider but whose <hi>Facters</hi> they
are, and thou wilt surely <hi>hate</hi> them. <hi>Consider what I say, and the Lord give you
understanding in all things.</hi>

               <p>COnsidering the premisses, if there were any <hi>love of God,</hi> any <hi>hatred of

<hi>Christ comes in the clouds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only it is much to be feared, that as we turn the <hi>sanctuary of life</hi> into the
<hi>shambles of death:</hi> so <hi>God</hi> may send a <hi>famine</hi> after such a <hi>satiety,</hi> and <hi>pestilence</hi>
after <hi>famine.</hi> Or rather that our <hi>Land,</hi> which hath been so long <hi>sick</hi> of this
<hi>disease,</hi> and so often <hi>surfeited</hi> of this sin, should <hi>spue us all out,</hi> who are the
<hi>Inhabitants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or in case <hi>God</hi> be pleased to dispense with the <hi>Nation,</hi> the wickedness
that is done by these <hi>Drunkards</hi> and <hi>Drink-sellers,</hi> shall be reckoned, unto
those that are the <hi>permitters,</hi> for their own. For <hi>Governors</hi> make themselves
<hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>those sins</hi> they may redress, and will not. But I know to whom I
speak, and my hopes are depending.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, it is sad to consider, how many <hi>Drunkards</hi> will hear this
<hi>Charge,</hi> for one that will <hi>apply</hi> it to himself. For confident I am, that <hi>fifteen</hi> of
<hi>twenty,</hi> all this <hi>City</hi> over, are <hi>Drunkards,</hi> yea, <hi>seducing Drunkards,</hi> in the dialect
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> &amp; by the <hi>Law of God,</hi> which extends even to the heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<hi>Mat. 5. 21, 22, 28.</hi> Perhaps by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> a man is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for drunk, except his <hi>eyes stare,</hi> his <hi>tongue stutter,</hi> and his <hi>legs stagger;</hi> but
by <hi>Gods Law,</hi> he is one <hi>that goes often to the drink,</hi> or that <hi>tarrieth long at it,
Prov. 23. 30, 31.</hi> He that will be drawn to the <hi>Tavern</hi> or <hi>Ale-house</hi> by every
idle soliciter, and there be deteined to drink, when he hath <hi>neither need of it,</hi>
or <hi>mind to it;</hi> to the spending of his <hi>money,</hi> wasting of his precious <hi>time,</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of his <hi>calling,</hi> abusing of the <hi>creatures</hi> (which thousands want) discredit
of the <hi>Gespel,</hi> the stumbling of <hi>weak ones,</hi> the incouraging of <hi>indifferent ones,</hi>
the hardning of his <hi>associates,</hi> and all the truths enemies that know or hear
of it. Briefly, he that <hi>drinks</hi> more for <hi>lust,</hi> or <hi>pride,</hi> or <hi>covetousness,</hi> or <hi>fear,</hi> or
<hi>good fellowship,</hi> or to <hi>drive away time,</hi> or to <hi>still conscience,</hi> than for <hi>thirst,</hi> is a
Drunkard in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s esteem, <hi>Prov. 23. 30, 31.</hi> Perhaps thou dost not think
so; but can you produce that <hi>holy man of God,</hi> that will not deem him a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,
who can neither <hi>buy,</hi> nor <hi>sell,</hi> nor <hi>meet</hi> any <hi>friend,</hi> or <hi>customer,</hi> but he
must go to the Tavern, or Ale-house, perhaps <hi>six times</hi> in a day; and who
constantly <hi>clubs</hi> it, first for his <hi>mornings draught,</hi> secondly at <hi>Exchange-time,</hi>
thirdly <hi>at night,</hi> when shops are shut in; as is the common, but <hi>base custom</hi> of
most <hi>Tradesmen;</hi> yea, and the <hi>Devil</hi> so blinds them, that they will plead a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi>
of it; and that it is for their <hi>profit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can it be denied, but in cases of this nature, things are rather mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by the <hi>intention</hi> and <hi>affection</hi> of the <hi>doer,</hi> than of the <hi>issue,</hi> and <hi>event.</hi>
And why should not a man be deemed a <hi>Drunkard</hi> for his immoderate and
inordinate <hi>affection to drink,</hi> or <hi>drunken company?</hi> as well as another, an <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,</hi>
for the like affecton to his <hi>neighbours wife,</hi> Matth. 5. 21, 22, 28. Yet
these men are in their own, and other mens esteem, not only <hi>good</hi> and <hi>civil
men,</hi> but <hi>good Christians</hi> forsooth. Certainly, the <hi>more light</hi> we have, the <hi>more
blind</hi> men are, or else this could not be; For I would gladly ask such, Are you
<hi>Christians?</hi> In what part of the <hi>Word</hi> find you a warrant for it? Where find
you, that this <hi>custom</hi> was ever used by any one of the <hi>Saints</hi> in former ages?
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110246:6"/>
Well may you (with <hi>Agrippa)</hi> be <hi>almost Christians,</hi> but sure enough, you are not
with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, altogether such:</hi> and then what will become of you? For <hi>almost a
son</hi> is a <hi>bastard, almost sweet</hi> is <hi>unsavoury, almost hot</hi> is <hi>lukewarm;</hi> and those that are
lukewarm <hi>will God spue out of his mouth,</hi> Rev. 3. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Christian almost,</hi> is like a <hi>woman that dieth in travel, almost</hi> she brought forth
a <hi>son;</hi> but that <hi>almost</hi> killed the <hi>mother,</hi> and the <hi>son</hi> too If thou <hi>believ'st almost,</hi> thou
shalt be <hi>saved almost;</hi> as we say of a <hi>Thief</hi> that hath a <hi>pardon</hi> brought him whiles
he is upon the <hi>gallows,</hi> he was <hi>almost saved,</hi> but he was <hi>hanged,</hi> and his pardon
did him no good. To be <hi>almost a Christian,</hi> is to be like the <hi>foolish Virgins,</hi> that had
<hi>Lamps, but without oyl</hi> in them; for which they were <hi>shut out of heaven,</hi> though
they came to the very door, <hi>Mat. 25. 10, 11, 12.</hi> Can the <hi>door</hi> which is but <hi>almost
shut,</hi> keep out the <hi>Thief?</hi> Can the <hi>ship</hi> that is but <hi>almost tite,</hi> keep out the <hi>water?</hi>
The <hi>souldier</hi> that does but <hi>almost fight</hi> is a <hi>coward?</hi> And therefore if thou lovest
thy self, look to it, and that in time, lest hereafter you most dolefully rue it: For
know this, that you shall once give an <hi>account</hi> for every <hi>idle peny</hi> and <hi>hour</hi> you
spend, and for every <hi>cup of drink</hi> you shall spoil, or waste; and for every one that
is encouraged to do the like by your <hi>example.</hi> For which see <hi>Mat. 12. 36. Luke
16. 2. Rom. 14. 12. 1 Pet. 4. 5. Rev. 20. 13.</hi> &amp; 22. 12.</p>
               <p>That (by the blessing of <hi>God)</hi> our children, and childrens children may <hi>loath
drunkenness,</hi> and <hi>love sobriety;</hi> let this be fixed to some place convenient in every
house, for all to read. The <hi>Persians, Parthians, Spartans,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did
the like, and found it exceeding efficacious: And <hi>Anacharsis</hi> holds it the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
means to that end.</p>

out of compassion to their precious souls; there are above twenty several Books
purposely composed, wherein are <hi>proper remedies</hi> (of the same alloy) for <hi>each soul

will shew them (from <hi>Gods Word)</hi> the very <hi>faces</hi> of their <hi>hearts:</hi> And (like <hi>Peter</hi>
to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Act. 11.) <hi>tell them words whereby</hi> (with blessing from above) both
<hi>they,</hi> and their <hi>Associates</hi> (by their means) <hi>may be saved,</hi> ver. 14.</p>
               <p>And that they might the better recompence the <hi>Readers</hi> pains; whether he
propound to himself <hi>pleasure</hi> or <hi>profit:</hi> they are (as many <hi>Reverend Divines</hi>
deem) a brief <hi>Collection</hi> of the most winning and convincing Arguments out of
the <hi>choisest Authors;</hi> very pithily, orderly, and elegantly conveyed, and embellish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with much both variety of graceful and delightful illustration. Yea, if such as
they concern, shall be pleased to make use of them; they may (with <hi>Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing)</hi>
not only have their vices lessened, their knowledge increased, and their
minds cheered and comforted: but probably they shall find in them the flower,
cream, or quintessence, of what would otherwise cost them twenty years <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to extract.</p>
               <p>It remains only, that the <hi>Patients,</hi> for whom this <hi>Physick</hi> is proper, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
withall to <hi>take it.</hi> For although here is all necessary <hi>provision made,</hi> and
the <hi>guests</hi> lovingly <hi>invited,</hi> yet (of themselves) they will <hi>refuse to come,</hi> as in that
<hi>Parable of the Lords Supper,</hi> Luk. 14. 16. to 25. Because, as <hi>good meats</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome
to <hi>sick persons;</hi> so <hi>is good counsel to obstinate sinners.</hi> Here is <hi>light, but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110246:8"/>
they love darkness rather than light; lest their deeds which are evil, should be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
Only <hi>they that do well, and love truth, will come to the light, that their deeds
may be made manifest,</hi> Joh 3. 19, 20, 21. Also many <hi>young novices</hi> in sin, will enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them, as <hi>Lot</hi> did those <hi>Angels,</hi> that came to fetch him out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen. 19.
And probably some <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Masters</hi> will desire them, to prevent the spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these <hi>Gangrenes</hi> in their <hi>children</hi> and <hi>servants.</hi> But as for the parties prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
concerned and invited, and that stand in the greatest need, and are most
to be pitied; they will even <hi>storm</hi> at this very <hi>offer of help,</hi> and <hi>hiss</hi> like <hi>serpents,</hi>
because it troubles their <hi>nests.</hi> Being like him, <hi>Luk. 8. 27, 28.</hi> who having bin <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
with devils a long time,</hi> was at length very loath to part with his <hi>Guests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, if some, whose hearts <hi>God</hi> hath already changed, would put them
into their hands, and use their best Art to make them relished: (For like
<hi>Babes, meat</hi> must not only be given them, but <hi>prepared</hi> too, and <hi>put into their
mouths,)</hi> some return of good might happily come thereof. As weak means
shall serve the turn, where <hi>God</hi> intends success. Even a word seasonably spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>(God</hi> blessing it) like a <hi>Rudder,</hi> sometimes <hi>steers</hi> a man quite into another
<hi>Course. Antiochus</hi> by hearing from a poor man, all the <hi>faults</hi> which he and his

                  <hi>Antoninus</hi>
amended his future life and manners, by only hearing what the people spake
of him. The very <hi>crowing of a Cock occasioned</hi> Peters <hi>repentance. Augustine,</hi> that
famous Doctor, was converted, by only reading that Text, <hi>Rom. 13. 13. Let

                  <hi>Johns Gospel,</hi> was won to the Faith of <hi>Christ.</hi> And <hi>Melancthon</hi>
much after the same manner. I have read of two famous <hi>Strumpets,,</hi> that were
suddenly converted by this only Argument, That <hi>God</hi> seeth all things, even in
the dark; when the <hi>doors</hi> are shut, and the <hi>curtains drawn.</hi> And <hi>Mountaign</hi> tels
of a libidinous <hi>Gentleman,</hi> that sporting with a <hi>Courtizan</hi> in a <hi>house of sin,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to ask her name, which she said was <hi>Mary;</hi> whereat he was so stricken
with reverence and remorse; that he instantly both cast off the Harlot, and
amended his whole future life. <hi>Bilney</hi>'s Confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

2. 9. Yea, it was an observation of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

converted as many as it blew upon. Yea, even those <hi>Jews</hi> that <hi>crucified
the Son of God,</hi> were converted by hearing those few words of <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 2.
And it pleased <hi>God,</hi> when, my self, was in as hopeless a condition, as any of
those <hi>Sensualists</hi> before mentioned; (I mean, as much fore-stalled with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
