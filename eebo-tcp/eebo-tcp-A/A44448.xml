            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Truly Honourable LORD CUTTS.</head>
            <l>THE reall Lover, burning for the Fair,</l>
            <l>Rather than offer up a Fawning Pray'r,</l>
            <l>Owns his Demerits, owns his Just despair.</l>
            <l>Crowns her with parting Praises, all her due;</l>
            <l>Blushing she Hears them, but Believes them true;</l>
            <l>The Poet so should to his Patron move,</l>
            <l>And sue to Honour as he sues to Love.</l>
            <l>No constant Youth a Second charm can Boast,</l>
            <l>They feel not Fierce desires, who Court the most,</l>
            <l>Should I lose thee, then every Patron's lost.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:55549:3"/>No more to Greatness would the Poet sue,</l>
            <l>Honour's indeed A Name, if such in You.</l>
            <l>All but my constant humble Faith is gone,</l>
            <l>Yet, my sole Claim, is, I pretend to none.</l>
            <l>Beneath your Gen'rous smiles assur'd I grow;</l>
            <l>Who makes me Happy will confirm me so.</l>
            <l>Well may he own his Fortunes once deprest,</l>
            <l>Who finds his late past Ills can make him Blest.</l>
            <l>Let others Quarrell with exalted State,</l>
            <l>Tis mine to Praise, who know thee more than great.</l>
            <l>O what return can you, my <hi>Lord,</hi> receive?</l>
            <l>Or what can Poets to their Patrons give,</l>
            <l>What, what shall I who thro' your Favour live.</l>
            <l>The Muses off'rings to your Fame I owe,</l>
            <l>That taught me Verse, and to Despise it too.</l>
            <l>No guift, no recompence, can Fancy make,</l>
            <l>You only give whence you can never take.</l>

            <l>Generous, alone because you Will be so.</l>

            <l>Ev'n my best Hopes have been Deriv'd from you.</l>
            <l>If e're to active Good I bend my Pow'rs,</l>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT has been the Misfortune of one of my Name to affront the Sacred Prose of <hi>David,</hi> with Intollerable Rhyme, and 'Tis mine, I fear, to have abus'd allmost as Sacred Verse. I have only this Excuse, when I did it, I did not so well Percieve the Majesty and Noble air of <hi>Mr. Milton's</hi> Style as now I do; and were it not allready done, I must confess, I never should attempt it; but if others have the same Opinion of this great Author, as I have, he will not Suffer by me, but rather be the more Admir'd. To say I had nothing else to do, when I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook this, will be no excuse, for Idleness can no more excuse a man for doing Ill, than Triviall bussiness can for not doing Good. And to own I envy'd <hi>Mr. Milton</hi> in his <hi>Paradise,</hi> would make me look like <hi>Satan</hi> in the Eyes of the World, who thought it worse than Hell to see those Seats of Happiness which the First pair enjoyd; yet, I am so Conscious of my Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb facs="tcp:55549:4"/>
now, I allmost doubt, I did; However, this Great Father of the Poetick race of Men, I am assur'd, can't fall by me, Tho' every Charming Fair should Play the <hi>Eve,</hi> and Praise the Fruit. His work like the Tree of Knowledge is Forbidden to the Ladies, to those I mean, who would Tast the Apples, but care not for Climbing to the Bough, and I have heard some say <hi>Mr. Milton</hi> in Rhyme would be a Fine thing; well, if they say so, that must Satisfy all my present Expectation, and for ought I know, <hi>Hercules</hi> look'd well enough in Petticoats; If it will Oblidge them, I should be apt to throw off the Lyon's Skin, and put the soft Apparell on the Whole; Yet, when 'tis done, I must needs own, I would rather Look on <hi>Mr. Milton</hi> Plain, (if I may say so) than in the Gawdy dress my Effeminate Fancy gave him.</p>
            <p>The flaming Sword drove our first Parents out of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,</hi> but <hi>Mr. Milton's</hi> Pen has again restor'd it; strange restitution! He gives it, only telling how we Lost it. Tho' I have but Play'd with him, it has Cost me Pains; he is too Strong for Dallyance; and I, took weak to Close with him, have only Touch'd him at a distance, but in the Wide conflict, the Serpent (he so well describes) has slipt me, and I have been deceiv'd in his Speech as well as <hi>Eve</hi>; he who could Break the Fetters in Hell asign'd him, disdain'd the Chains of Rhyme; however if I attempt any further on <hi>Mr. Milton,</hi> I shall sit Closer to him, but if I meet censure for what I have allready done, I have no <hi>Paradise</hi> of Fame to fall from, and at worst, can but be said to Slip at that Precipice where all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind has Fallen. Now I would beg the Reader's Pardon for a Digression, but I think Nothing that is Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb facs="tcp:55549:5"/>
can be such. I am Generally reported the Author of a Book written in prejudice of <hi>Mr. Congreve</hi>; I shall say but little in my own Vindication, and the odd reason I give for it is, because I am greatly Wrong'd; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse is infinite as Knowledge; they who Favour me with their acquantance, and know all I Write, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all I Think, give me Assurance they Believe I would no more be Authour of any thing Scandalous of <hi>Mr. Congreve,</hi> than those he Favours with his, can Believe he would Deserve it. In short, I declare, I am not, and if that be not Satisfaction to others, I must, Submitting to their Censures, be as Satisfy'd as I can my Self.</p>
