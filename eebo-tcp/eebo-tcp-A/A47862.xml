            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Farther Discovery of the PLOT.</head>
            <p>AS it cannot be deny'd, but that the Kings Witnesses have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
as far, and done as much as men could do, (under their
Circumstances) to make out the Truth of a <hi>Damnable,</hi> and
<hi>Hellish Popish Plot</hi> upon the <hi>Life</hi> of his <hi>Sacred Majesty,</hi> our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
and <hi>Civil Government:</hi> So neither must it be deny'd, on the other
hand, but that the Justice and Wisdom of this Nation have emprov'd
all Discoveries, by the strictest Inquisition, and scrutiny imaginable;
and done all that was possible also toward the suppressing of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,
by the highest Instances of Political zeal and Rigour. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that after so many Priests and Jesuits, and other Leading men
of that Party removed by the stroke of <hi>Publique Justice;</hi> so many of
them under <hi>Confinement;</hi> so many more reduced to shift for themselves
<hi>beyond the Seas,</hi> beside the severe Penalties of the <hi>Law</hi> upon the rest,
with all sorts of Encouragement, both for their <hi>detection</hi> and <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
After all this care taken (I say) to tear up the accursed Plot by
the <hi>Root,</hi> We are yet assured, that (all this notwithstanding) the Plot is
still carried on with <hi>Confidence,</hi> and <hi>Vigour.</hi> And this we have, even
from those very Persons themselves that formerly wrought in the
same Mine with the Conspirators; till through the Grace of a better
Light they came to govern themselves by other Measures. <hi>This</hi> is a
truth no more to be <hi>doubted,</hi> then that of the <hi>Plot</hi> it <hi>self;</hi> which has
stood the Tryall of so many <hi>Solemn</hi> and <hi>Publique Tests:</hi> Beside that we
have the same Authority for the One as for the Other; only the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
not being brought into Proof, the matter of Fact lies a
little more in the Dark.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether or no the</hi> Plot <hi>goes on still,</hi> after all this Havock made of the
<hi>Papists,</hi> is the Common subject of every <hi>Coffee-house Discourse.</hi> They
that must be presum'd to know best, are of opinion that it does; and
those that are upon the <hi>Negative,</hi> reason the point after this manner.
<hi>What?</hi> (say they) <hi>Is it a</hi> Plot <hi>that will work without hands? Where are
the</hi> Papists, <hi>the</hi> Instruments <hi>that should drive it on? Are they in the</hi> Aire <hi>or</hi>
under Ground; <hi>or are they</hi> Invisible? <hi>For as they are now dispers'd, and
broken, (beside the Terrour that overawes them) there are at least</hi> three
Thousand Protestants, <hi>in sight, to</hi> one Papist. But do they ask where
they <hi>are,</hi> because we cannot <hi>see</hi> them? Why do they not rather ask
where they are <hi>Not?</hi> because they may be any where, and we not <hi>know</hi>
them: For, as I have been told by persons of Great Quality, they'l in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
all <hi>shapes,</hi> and Exercise all <hi>Professions.</hi> They speak of <hi>one Jesuit</hi> that
cry'd <hi>work for a Cooper;</hi> another that wrought upon the Trade of a <hi>Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker;
Priests</hi> in <hi>Red coats</hi> Innumerable: And it is observ'd that upon
the bringing of the Late Plot to Light, all the little <hi>Frenchmen</hi> with
their <hi>Marionets</hi> or <hi>Puppet-shows</hi> vanish'd in a trice: which gave a suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93062:3"/>
that they were only a kind of <hi>Itinerant Agents</hi> for the <hi>Faction:</hi> To
say nothing of their skill and Industry, in the managing of all our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
and discontents, to the advantage of their own Party. These
are stories (I know) that are much more easily <hi>Contradicted,</hi> then
<hi>Prov'd:</hi> and therefore without laying any stresse at all upon <hi>Common
Fame,</hi> or <hi>Hearsay,</hi> I shall now apply my self to <hi>that farther Discovery of
the Plot,</hi> which I have promis'd in my Title; and support my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
upon the Authority of Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> himself; with a respect both
to the Validity of his <hi>Testimony,</hi> and to the weight of his <hi>Observations;</hi>
being a Person that hath dived deeper into the Mystery of this Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(with favour of the rest) then any other man.</p>
            <p>As to the Hellish Design upon the Life of our Gracious Sovereign,
by <hi>Pistol, Sword,</hi> or <hi>Poyson,</hi> we hope that the Neck of that <hi>Particular
Plot</hi> is broken, to all Intents and purposes: But we are beholden also
to Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> for the Discovery of <hi>Other</hi> and of <hi>Farther Plots</hi> that are
still carry'd on by the same restlesse Party; tending to the <hi>defaming</hi> of
his <hi>Majesties Person,</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> the <hi>Subversion</hi> of our <hi>Establish'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
and the <hi>Disturbance</hi> of the <hi>Publick Peace.</hi> So that unless the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the still growing <hi>Difficulties,</hi> and <hi>Hazzards</hi> be encounter'd
with <hi>Timely</hi> and <hi>Effectual Remedies,</hi> the work of our Deliverance is but
half done, and we shall yet run a risque of being ruin'd at last even in
the very Port.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dr.</hi> Oates <hi>tells us in his</hi> Narrative, Printed by Authority of Parliament,
<hi>that the Pope, Society of Jesus,</hi> and their <hi>Confederates</hi> in this <hi>Plot, have
a Design to reduce</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>to the</hi> Romish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<hi>and</hi> Obedience, <hi>by the</hi> Sword: Pag. 63. <hi>which they hope to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish,
among Other means,</hi> by disaffecting the Kings best Friends at home
and abroad, and Subjects, against his Person and Government; charging him
with Tyranny, and Designs of Oppressing, Governing by the Sword, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Parliaments, <hi>Pa.</hi> 67.</p>
            <p>By Aspersing, Deriding, Exposing, and declaiming against his Person, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
and Actions in Parliaments, and elsewhere, by Mis-reporting, and
raising False News of his Affairs; by disaffecting his Majesties Allyes, <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Spain,</hi> the <hi>German Emperor,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> by False Intelligence. By
<hi>Seditious Preachers,</hi> and <hi>Catechists,</hi> set up, sent out, Maintained, and
directed what to Preach in their Own, or other Private, or Publick Conventicles,
and Field-Meetings. By setting up false pretended Titles to the Succession of
the Crown; and Animating Different Parties, one against another, on this or
such like False pretences, to Arm and put the People in blood, upon the Kings
Death.</p>
            <p>We have found Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s <hi>Observations</hi> (as to these particulars,) so
punctually true, that every syllable of what he has here deliver'd, is
from point to point, the very matter now in Agitation. For there's
not a day passes without a Libell upon his Majesties <hi>Authority, Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Designes,</hi> and solemn <hi>Resolutions</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>Council;</hi> belying the
Condition of his Affairs, and endeavouring to create <hi>Distsrusts,</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies</hi>
among Forreign Princes, and States, by <hi>False Intelligence; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:93062:3"/>
and <hi>Exciting</hi> of <hi>Turbulent Factions,</hi> and <hi>anticipating</hi> of <hi>Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
to involve us all in Blood; upon a <hi>Remote</hi> and <hi>Undutifull</hi> SUP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSITION
of the KINGS DEATH. And finally, we have
Sedition <hi>Preach'd</hi> as well as <hi>written,</hi> and our <hi>Conventicles</hi> both instructed
themselves, and instructing Others, in the Methods and Principles of
Rebellion, this may suffice for the Doctors Judgment upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
State of things, which in truth looks liker a <hi>Revelation,</hi> then a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to his Reflexions upon the Interest which the <hi>Papists</hi> had in our
Past troubles; these are his words in his Preface to the aforesaid <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who beside these were the First Authours and Contrivers of the late Unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
War, by their Known Diabolical Art of enflaming Parties, and Passions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
each other? And</hi> (addressing to the King) <hi>of your Royal Fathers
Unspeakable sufferings, and Barbarous Usage? It was these that brought him to
his End, and flourish'd Swords, and Trumpets over his dead Body, whom they
durst not approach when Living. The</hi> Putney Projectours (says he) <hi>were
in most, if not all the Councils, that contriv'd his Ruine. What broke the</hi> Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
Treaty, <hi>but the</hi> Romish Interest, <hi>and</hi> Policy? <hi>Who continu'd to
baffle all designs of Peace, and Settlement to this Nation, and Prosperity to his
Majesties Family, but</hi> those Incendiaries, Milton <hi>was a known frequenter
of a</hi> Popish Club;<hi>who more forward to set up</hi> Cromwell,<hi>and to put the
Crown of our Kings upon his Head, then</hi>Papists? <hi>And his new fangled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was contriv'd by a</hi> Popish Priest; <hi>and</hi> Lambert <hi>a</hi> Papist,<hi>for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
these</hi>Thirty years.</p>
            <p>I have inserted these Passages as a Curiosity in the History of those
times; which may perhaps have escap'd other men as well as my self.
For though I never made any Question, but that the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
as it stands Established by Law, in the <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
<hi>Sobriety</hi> of <hi>Discipline,</hi> was ever an <hi>Eye sore</hi> to the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> yet I was of Opinion too, that a Licentious Vein of <hi>Ambition</hi>
and <hi>Sch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sm</hi> among our selves, had carry'd a great stroke also in that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion.</hi> But however, this is a point wherein a man may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
loss of Honour, or Credit, admit the possibility of his being in a
Mistake. Wherefore we shall now (with the <hi>Doctors</hi> Leave) advance
to plain matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> whereupon we have his <hi>Deposition;</hi> the only
Case wherein a man may, without Vanity pronounce himself within
a degree of <hi>Infallible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We finde Pag. 8. that Richard Nicholas Blundell</hi> had every day in the
Week his several places in the City of <hi>London,</hi> where he taught the Youth
Treasonable, and Malicious Doctrine, against the Interest, and Person of his
Sacred Majesty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Also (Pag. 25.) that Richard Ashby</hi> had a Conference for the sending of
New Messengers into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to promote the Commotions there; and to
inform the People, of the great <hi>Tyranny</hi> they did ly under, by reason of their
being deny'd the <hi>Liberty</hi> of their <hi>Conscience;</hi> and that not being to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
but by the sword, they must take that Course to purchase their Liberty:
By which means (sayd the Fathers thus Assembled) we shall weaken both the
<hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and the <hi>Episcopal Faction.</hi> At which Conference, the DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PONENT
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93062:4"/>
was PRESENT, and heard the Words.</p>
            <p>And again,<hi>Two Messengers were sent into</hi>Scotland, <hi>One by the Name of</hi> Father Moore, <hi>and the Other by the Name of</hi> Father Saunders <hi>alias</hi> Brown, <hi>with Instructions to carry themselves like NON-CONFORMIST MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISTERS;
and to</hi> Preach <hi>to the</hi> Disaffected Scots, <hi>the Necessity of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up the Sword for the Defence of</hi>Liberty <hi>of</hi>Conscience. These <hi>the DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PONENT
saw</hi> Dispatch'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take notice, in the <hi>First</hi> place, that here's a Designe carry'd on for
the <hi>Destruction</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Embroyling</hi> of the <hi>Government. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
the pretence of the Quarrel is to be matter of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Thirdly,</hi> it is to be promoted by <hi>Popish Emissaries,</hi> in the <hi>Councils,</hi>
and <hi>Conventicles</hi> of the <hi>Non-Conformists. Fourthly,</hi> the means by which
the <hi>Papists</hi> propound to compass their Ends, are by making <hi>Interests</hi>
with the <hi>Separatists,</hi> under the Disguise of <hi>Ministers,</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively
of the several Parties they have to do withall. And <hi>Fifthly,</hi>
Let me recommend this Particular to your <hi>Special Remark,</hi> that Dr.
<hi>Oates,</hi> throughout the whole Course of his <hi>Depositions,</hi> charges no part
of the <hi>Popish Design</hi> upon any <hi>Intelligence,</hi> or <hi>Communication</hi> with the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> but makes it only to be a practice upon the <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
from the <hi>English Communion,</hi> to transport them into <hi>Tumults,</hi> and
<hi>Distempers</hi> against both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have here in few words, a <hi>Scheme</hi> of the whole business; Here's
the <hi>Designe,</hi> the <hi>Pretext,</hi> the <hi>Instruments</hi> and the <hi>Methods:</hi> and upon the
whole matter, here is the Church of <hi>England</hi> acquitted, as to any
point of <hi>unwarrantable affinity</hi> with the Principles or Practises of the
Church <hi>of Rome;</hi> however that <hi>Testy Frenchman</hi> is pleas'd to speculate
in <hi>his Fanatical Reve'ryes</hi> upon our <hi>approaches</hi> to That <hi>Communion:</hi>
Wherein it may be a Question, whether he is more out in his <hi>History,</hi> or
in his <hi>Morals.</hi> We are, in short, very much obliged to the Doctor,
for clearing our Church to all Gainsayers, from those obloquies which
by both the Extremes are indifferently cast upon us.</p>
            <p>It must not be any longer a supposition, that which Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us his <hi>Oath</hi> for; so that taking it for granted, that there is such a
Project on foot, that the <hi>Papists</hi> are in the <hi>bottom</hi> of it; and that it is
promoted by the Sectaries, only as <hi>Passive Agents</hi> that are blindly
bringing about the others ends: the Question is now how the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may fairly discriminate the <hi>Protestants</hi> from the <hi>Papists;</hi> being
so blended in their <hi>Interest,</hi> as well as in their Councils; and mask'd
under such <hi>Resemblances,</hi> the <hi>One,</hi> of the <hi>Other,</hi> that they are not easily
to be distinguished. It cannot be expected that a pretending <hi>Protestant</hi>
shall own himself to be a <hi>Papist;</hi> so that there's no believing any man
in the Case. And then the <hi>Epithete</hi> of a <hi>Reputed so or so,</hi> is so slender an
Evidence, that many a Reputed <hi>Papist</hi> is found to be a <hi>True Protestant,</hi>
and many a <hi>Reputed Protestant</hi> as true a <hi>Papist.</hi> The known and Legall
Expedient which has been hitherto found Competent enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Reason and Intent of State, is the <hi>Test</hi> of the <hi>Two Oaths</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi>
and <hi>Supremacy:</hi> and yet this very provision will not reach all
cases: For there are many <hi>Papists</hi> that will <hi>Take</hi> them without any
difficulty; and there are severall that call themselves <hi>Protestants,</hi> that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93062:4"/>
will as obstinately <hi>refuse</hi> them. Now though the <hi>Latter (Primo Eliz.)</hi>
was a <hi>Provision for the abolishing of Foreign Power,</hi> and the <hi>Former (Tertio
Iac.)</hi> an Act for the discovering and repressing of <hi>Popish Recusants;</hi> the
Scope and Equity yet of Both these Provisions has a regard to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
of the Government against any sort of people, and against any
Pretensions whatsoever: So that whoever Refuses, upon a <hi>Lawfull
Tender,</hi> to take these <hi>Oathes,</hi> he's a <hi>Papist</hi> in the eye of the <hi>Law,</hi> let his
Perswasion be what it will: For it is the only Priviledge of Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to reade the Heart: or if (for discourse sake) we should suppose
him to be no <hi>Papist,</hi> he is yet in the prospect of <hi>Common Reason,</hi> liable
to that Imposition, because it is exacted as a Proof of his <hi>Allegiance,</hi> not
of his Faith; and men of <hi>Different Judgements</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> may yet <hi>agree</hi>
in <hi>Common Principles</hi> of <hi>Disloyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then again, there's no appealing in this <hi>Case</hi> from the <hi>Prudence</hi>
and <hi>Caution</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> (which is allways presum'd to intend the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good)</hi> to the Testimony of a <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>Neighbour</hi> in favour of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation.</hi>
For the <hi>Law</hi> is a <hi>General Rule,</hi> that takes no notice of any <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi>
to it. The <hi>Law</hi> requires me to <hi>Take These Oaths</hi> in proof of my
<hi>Allegiance</hi> to the Government; and my answer is, <hi>that I am a very Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man, but I cannot take them.</hi> What is this to the <hi>Law,</hi> that takes no
Cognizance of my <hi>Honesty,</hi> but of my <hi>Obedience?</hi> And this <hi>Rule</hi> holds
in Common, as well to the <hi>Papist</hi> as to the <hi>Protestant Recusant;</hi> They
both vouch for their own <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and at the same time they do both
of them Refuse to comply with the <hi>Law.</hi> The Common way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
in this Case, is to cast it in a mans Teeth; <hi>But what? will you make
no difference betwixt a</hi> Papist <hi>that refuses and a</hi> Protestant? Yes, I would,
if you would but shew me how I may certainly know the One from
the Other. Who knows not that <hi>Interest governs the World?</hi> and that
for Reasons best known to themselves, he that is a <hi>Protestant</hi> in his heart
may be induced rather to appear a <hi>Papist;</hi> and the Other, though a
<hi>Papist</hi> in <hi>his heart,</hi> may find it his Interest yet to seem a Protestant? But
we'l yield that Point too; and put the Case, that the <hi>Law</hi> should be
relax'd, on the behalf of any man living, Does not This open a Gap
(let him be never so Honest) to the admittance of ten Thousand men
that may plead <hi>Honesty</hi> too, and yet betray their Duties? And is it not
better then, that some few particulars should suffer by keeping <hi>firm</hi> to
the <hi>Law,</hi> then that the whole should be endanger'd by Remitting it?
so that there is neither <hi>Reason</hi> nor <hi>Safety,</hi> nor <hi>Equity,</hi> in such a <hi>Relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi>
nor any regard of <hi>Common Justice</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> in demanding it.</p>
            <p>But what if it be said, that it is not the <hi>Thing Sworn,</hi> but the <hi>Oath it
self,</hi> that is <hi>Scrupled?</hi> and that there are several sorts of Perswasions
that will not bear any swearing at all? This I must confess, is a Case
somewhat nice, and unhappy, to those people that are so straight-lac'd
in that <hi>Particular:</hi> But then, on the Other side, it is to the <hi>Government</hi>
the most <hi>dangerous</hi> of all <hi>Pretensions,</hi> and lets in all the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Jesuits</hi>
in Nature, under That Colour. So that now take it both ways; If
the <hi>Law</hi> be <hi>partially</hi> Executed, the <hi>Jesuits</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> will shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under <hi>That Indulgence:</hi> Or, if the <hi>Law</hi> should be suspended, out of
a respect to those that would be thought to make a <hi>Conscience</hi> of an
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93062:5"/>
               <hi>Oath,</hi> the <hi>Priests</hi> would all flow into <hi>Those Parties</hi> that should be <hi>exempted</hi>
from <hi>this Test,</hi> and carry on their <hi>Designes</hi> without either <hi>Triall</hi> or <hi>danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to wind up this Discourse, in a plain and clear <hi>Dilemma.</hi> It
must be granted, either that the <hi>Papists have</hi> a Design upon the <hi>King,
Religion,</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and that they advance it by acting the Parts
of <hi>Quakers, Anabaptists, Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Other Sectaries,</hi> or <hi>not.</hi> No man,
I presume will dare to Question the Truth of the Doctors Deposition;
for in so doing he would imply a strange abuse impos'd upon the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But on the other side, admitting it to be true; there can be no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to this Government, without either <hi>dissolving</hi> all <hi>separate Meetings,</hi>
or bringing all <hi>Dissenters</hi> to this <hi>Legal Test;</hi> for otherwise, the <hi>Papists</hi>
have all sorts of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> in herding themselves among the
<hi>Conventicles;</hi> where upon the beating of a Bush, it will be an even wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
whether you start a <hi>Jesuit,</hi> or a <hi>Fanatick.</hi> And in effect, in this case,
there is not much difference betwixt them, where the <hi>Jesuit</hi> plays the
<hi>Fanatick,</hi> and the <hi>Fanatick</hi> the <hi>Jesuit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the main assertion be true, there's no way of finding out the <hi>Papists,</hi>
but by <hi>this Test:</hi> and the <hi>Dissenters themselves,</hi> if they would have <hi>Popery</hi>
ferretted out in good Earnest, cannot chuse but encourage the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Either they <hi>have Priests</hi> among them or they have <hi>not:</hi> If they <hi>have,</hi>
why do they not do the best they can to find them out? if they have <hi>not,</hi>
why do they say they <hi>have?</hi> And again, either the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> are
influenc'd by the <hi>Jesuits</hi> or they are <hi>not:</hi> If they <hi>be,</hi> why do they not do
all that is possible toward the <hi>Purging</hi> of their <hi>Congregations?</hi> If they be
<hi>not</hi> so Influenc'd, why do they pretend that they <hi>are,</hi> and so <hi>set the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
upon the wrong Horse?</hi> And yet again; either it is <hi>possible</hi> to clear their
<hi>Conventicles</hi> of this dangerous Mixture, or it is <hi>not:</hi> If it be <hi>Possible,</hi> why
do they still <hi>complain</hi> of it, and <hi>do nothing in't?</hi> If it be <hi>Impossible,</hi> there is
no way of <hi>Extirpating Popery,</hi> but by rooting out <hi>Fanaticism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the World judge now, with what injustice, the <hi>Order,</hi> and the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls</hi>
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are charg'd with a Tincture of <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and <hi>Popery,</hi> when upon Manifest proof, the <hi>Calumniators themselves</hi>
of our <hi>Ecclesiastical State</hi> are, throughout the <hi>whole Body</hi> of them, tainted
with this <hi>Leaven.</hi> We are now come to the <hi>Bottom</hi> of the <hi>Popish Plot. This
Liberty of wandering from the Rule, is the</hi> Trojan Horse, <hi>which under</hi> a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
colour, <hi>we have entertain'd within our</hi> Walls; <hi>with</hi> Discord, <hi>and</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
<hi>in the Belly of him.</hi>
