         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the goods, chattels and debts of <hi>Walter Vaughan</hi> deceaſed.</head>
            <opener>Moſt humbly ſhewing,</opener>
            <p>THat <hi>Iohn Skinner</hi> became bound in a Recogniſance of three thouſand pounds to <hi>Richard Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">22. Aug. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz. 41.</note> conditioned to pay one thouſand eight hundred pounds to <hi>William Winne</hi> and his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
whereof the petitioner <hi>Eraſmus Record</hi> was one, to whom <hi>Winne</hi> owed 850 pounds; which
condition being broken by the ſaid <hi>Iohn Skinner,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Winne</hi> and <hi>Record</hi> preferred their bill in
Chancerie,<note place="margin">23. Ian. Eliz 43.</note> to put the Recogniſance in ſuite: whereupon the Lord K<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eper did order the 23 of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary
43 of Elizabeth, that the petitioner <hi>Record</hi> ſhould follow the ſuite at his owne coſt and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which he did, in regard that <hi>Winne</hi> was in meane eſtate, and not able to follow it.</p>
            <p>Vpon that Recogniſance the Moytie of the lands of the Mannor of Caſtle-campes in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Cambridge,<note place="margin">Eliz. 44.</note> by courſe of Law and order of the Chancerie was at the petitioner <hi>Records</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
extended, and deliuered in extent to your petitioner <hi>Record</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Winne.</hi> Afterwards
4. Febr.<note place="margin">4. Feb. 45. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz.</note> 
               <hi>Anno 45. Eliz.</hi> by conſent of all parties and their Counſaile, it was decreed in Chancery,
that your petitioner <hi>Record</hi> and his Aſſignes ſhould haue yearely one hundred pounds out of the
extended Moytie, vntill his debt of eight hundred and fiftie pounds were payd him.</p>
            <p>The petitioners further ſhew,<note place="margin">Iacob. 2.</note> that <hi>An. 2. Iacobi,</hi> there was an aſſignement from <hi>Wilbraham, Winne</hi>
and <hi>Record,</hi> made to the ſaid <hi>Walter Vaughan,</hi> being another creditor of <hi>Winne,</hi> with a ſpeciall ſauing
of the petitioner <hi>Records</hi> decree, and all ſuch order or orders as did concerne the iſſues, rents and
profits of the ſaid land ſo extended: and alſo a ſauing of a certaine report of Sir <hi>Iohn Tyndals</hi> (as in
the Decree, and by the Deed more plainly doth appeare) vntill your petitioner <hi>Record</hi> were ſatisfied
and payed out of the extended Moytie eight hundred and fiftie pounds with his dammages.</p>
            <p>Alſo an Act of Parliament paſſed An. 3. Iacobi,<note place="margin">Iacob. 3.</note> concerning the ſaid extended Mannor, on the
behalfe of M. <hi>Sutton,</hi> wherein the right of the petitioner <hi>Record</hi> is likewiſe ſaued.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the petitioner <hi>Record</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Walter Vaughan</hi> were outed by Alderman <hi>Leman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iacob. 4.</note>
by vertue of a former Statute of foure hundred pounds; and after that by Sir <hi>William Smith</hi> vpon a
Statute of one thouſand fiue hundred pounds (he being one of the Feoffees for the ſale of the land.)
But notwithſtanding the ſaid Statutes,<note place="margin">Iacob. 5.</note> your petitioner <hi>Record</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Walter Vaughan</hi> obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
an Iniunction for the poſſeſſion againſt Sir <hi>Iohn Skinner</hi> and Sir <hi>William Smith,</hi> and all clayming
any right vnder them, and thereby were put in poſſeſſion againe. Then M. <hi>Sutton</hi> (hauing no bill
in Court againſt <hi>Record</hi> or <hi>Vaughan</hi>) purchaſed the ſaid Mannor,<note place="margin">Iacob. 5.</note> and retained in his hands one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds towards ſatisfaction of the extent, as Sir <hi>William Smith</hi> hath ſet downe vnder his hand.
But afterwards by a priuate agreement betweene <hi>Sutton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">23. Sept. Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Skinner</hi> and <hi>Winne,</hi> a reference was made
to their owne counſaile, your petitioner <hi>Record,</hi> nor <hi>Vaughan,</hi> nor their counſaile priuie thereunto,
as by the order and report doth appeare, and as <hi>Winne</hi> by his oath and letter doth acknowledge;
notwithſtanding a report was made the ſame day, by which it was pretended that the petitioner <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi>
was ſatisfied, and thereupon was ſix hundred pounds giuen to <hi>Winne,</hi> and the ſame day by an
order foure hundred pounds more was giuen to Sir <hi>Iohn Skinner,</hi> neither of them hauing any right
to any part of it. And thus your petitioner <hi>Record</hi> was defeated of eight hundred and fiftie pounds
due debt, ouer and aboue eight hundred pounds ſpent in following the ſuite theſe two and twenty
yeares, to his vtter vndoing, being a poore old man of the age of 72 yeares.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioners do therefore moſt humbly pray, that in all Acts to be paſſed this preſent
Parliament concerning the ſaid Mannor of Caſtle-campes, the petitioner <hi>Records</hi> right may
be ſaued, or elſe that he may be ſatisfied his ſaid debt of 850 pounds, in ſuch manner
as this moſt honorable Aſſembly ſhall thinke meete.</p>
