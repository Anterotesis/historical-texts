            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

desire their owne deaths, and in their best delights do think themselues most vnhappie, feeding their framed passions not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then with sithfull imaginations. And then as a weary bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye after a sore labour, so I, somewhat in outward shew qualified, in the payne of my sorrowfull thoughts, and hauing incloystered and shut vp the course of my distilling teares: whose drops had watered my pale cheekes, thorow amorous griefe, desired some needfull rest.</p>
                  <p>At length my moyst eyes being closed within their bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shotten and reddish liddes, presently betwixt a bitter life and a sweet death, I was in them inuaded and ouercome, with a heauie sleepe, who with my minde and watchfull spirits, were no perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of so high an operation.</p>
                  <p>Me thought that I was in a large, plaine, and champion place, all greene and diuersly spotted with many sorted flowerrs, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it seemed passingly adorned. In which by reason of the milde and gentle ayre, there was a still quyet whisht: In so much that my attentiue eares did heare no noyse, neither did any framed speech peirce into them, but with the gratious beames of the sunne, the sliding time passed.</p>
                  <p>In which place with a fearefull admiration, looking about me, I sayd thus to my selfe.

                  <p>At length my ignorant sleepes, brought me into a thick wood, whereinto being a pritty way entred, I could not tell how to get out of it. Wherevpon, a soddaine feare inuaded my hart, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused it selfe into euery ioynt, so that my couler began to waxe pale, and the rather by reason that I was alone, and vnarmed, and could not finde any track or path, eyther to direct me forward, or lead me back againe.

so infeebled with wearinesse, that on euery side I feared, when some cruell beast should come and deuoure me, or els vnawares to tumble downe into some deepe pit or hollow place.</p>
               <p>Wherefore more trembling then in mustulent <hi>Autume</hi> be the yealow coulored leaue, hauing left their moisture, being thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye searched with the furious north winde, I lifted vp my hart to God, desiring as <hi>Achemenides</hi> being afraide of the horrible <hi>Cyclops</hi> rather to be slaine by the hands of <hi>Aeneas</hi> his enemie, rather then to suffer so odious a death.</p>
               <p>And my deuoute prayer, sincerely vnited to a contrite heart, powring out a fountaine of teares with a stedfast beliefe to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered. I found my selfe in a short space gotten at libertie, like a new day crept out of a darke and tempestuous night. My eyes before vsed to such obumbrated darkenes, could scarse abide to behould the light, thorow watery sadnes. Neuerthelesse glad I was to see the light: as one set at libertie, that had beene chayned vp in a deepe dungeon and obscure darkenesse. Verye thirstie I was, my clothes torne, my face and hands scratched and netteled, and withall so extreamely set on heate, as the fresh ayre seemed to doe me more hurt then good, neither did it any waye ease my body, desirous to keepe his new recouered scope and libertie.</p>
               <p>And after that I had a little rowsed vp my mynde, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned together my sences in some better sort: I sought a meanes to quench my inordinate thyrst, procured and increased through innumerable sighes, and extreame labour of body. Thus casting my eyes with a diligent regarde about the plaine, to finde some Fountaine whereat I might refresh my selfe: a pleasant spring or head of water, did offer it selfe vnto me, with a great vayne boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vp, about the which did growe diuers sweet hearbes and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter flowers, and from the same did flowe a cleare and chrystalline current streame, which deuided into diuers branches, ran thorow the desart wood, with a turning and winding body, receyuing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it other little channels, vnlading themselues.</p>
               <p>In whose courses the stones lift vp by nature, and trunkes of trees denyed any longer by their roots to be vpholden, did cause a stopping hinderance to their current and whuzing fall, which still augmented by other vndissonant torrents, from high and fertlesse mountaines in the plaine, shewed a beautifull brightnes and soft passing course, to the which short windedly comming, by

meanes of my fearefull flight. I did see a little obscure light, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the tops of the high trees, somewhat deuiding themselues ouer the water, and with the rest of their bodyes and branches, as it were seperating the heauens from my lifted vp eyes. A horrible place to be in, vnaccompanyed of any creature.</p>
               <p>And suddainly hearing the fall of trees, through the force of a whyrle winde, &amp; noise of the broken bowghes, with a redoubled and hoarse sound a farre of, and yet brought to the eccho of the water thorow the thick wood, I grew into a new astonishment.</p>
               <p>And at this instant thus terrified and afflycted, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any receiued hurt, being vpon my knees bowed downe, and inclosing the hollownesse of my hand, therewith determined to make me a necessary drinking vessel: I had no sooner put the same into the water, offring to my mouth the long desired moysture, thereby to refrygerate and coole the extreame heate of my burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, which at that time would haue beene more acceptable vnto me, then eyther <hi>Hypanis</hi> and <hi>Ganges</hi> be to the <hi>Indians, Tigris</hi> or <hi>Euphrates</hi> to the <hi>Armenians,</hi> or <hi>Xeylus</hi> to the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> nation, or to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> his innundation, in bybing theyr burnt and rosted mould, or yet the riuer <hi>Po</hi> to the <hi>Ligurians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Euen then also it fell so out, that I had no sooner taken water into the palme of my hand, offering the same to my open mouth, ready to receiue it: I heard a doricall songe, wherewith I was as greatly delighted, as if I had heard the Thracian <hi>Thamiras,</hi> which thorough my eares presented it selfe to my vnquiet heart, with so sweete and delectable a deliuerie, with a voyce not terrestriall, with so great a harmonie and incredible a fayning shrilnesse, and vnusuall proportion, as is possible to bee imagined by no tounge sufficiently to be commended.

               <p>And then euen as a birde, which through the sweetnes of the call forgetteth to remember the Fowlers deceit, so I letting slip that which nature stood in need of, hastened my selfe back with all speed, towarde that attractiue melodie, which the more I coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, the further it seemed still from me, sometime heere, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there, and still as I shifted places, so the same also chaunged with a delectable voyce and heauenly consent.

vp and downe, I knew not after what, I grew more wearie, faint, and drye, and so feeble, that my legges could but with great paine, vphould my distempered body. And my grieued spirits vnabled long to support the same, what with the feare that I had bin in, what with extreame thirst, what with long and wilesome trauell, and what with doubting the worst that might insue. Thus hote, faint, and drye: I knew not what to do but euen to procure rest for my weary member. I marueled first at this straunge acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and was amazed at this inhumane harmonye, but most of all in that I was in a straunge contry, and vninhabited, being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye fertill and beawtyfull to behould, besydes that I greatly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for the losse of the fayer ryuer which I had so greatly labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to finde out, and now so lightly and carelesly to haue lost the benifit thereof. In this sort I was houlden in an intrycate minde of doubts, at length ouercome with all kinde of greefes, my whole bodye trembling and languishinge vnder a broade and mightye Oke full of Acornes, standing in the middest of aspatious and large green meade, extending forth his thicke and leauie armes to make a coole shadowe, vnder whose bodye breathing I rested my selfe vppon the deawye hearbes, and lying vppon my left syde I drewe my breath in the freshe ayre more shortly betwixt my drye and wrinckled lips, then the weary running heart, pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the haunche and struck in the brest, not able any longer to beare vp his weighty head, or sustaine his body vpon his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knees, but dying prostrates himselfe. And lying thus in such an agonie, I thought vpon the strifes of weake fortune, and the inchauntments of the malicious <hi>Cyrces,</hi> as if I had by hir charmes and quadranguled plaints, been bereaued of my sences.

in the very top, an elect and chosen signe of victorie. Neither in this place was there any habitation or creature whatsoeuer. Thus walking solitarily betwixt the trees, growing distantly one from another, I perswaded my selfe, that to this no earthly situation was comparable: in which thought I soddainely espied vpon my left hand, an hungrie and carniuorous Woolfe, gaping vpon me with open mouthe.</p>
               <p>At the sight whereof immediatly, my hayre stood right vp, and I would haue cryed out, but could not: and presently the Woolfe ranne awaye: wherevpon returning to my selfe, and casting my eyes towards the wooddie mountaines, which seemed to ioyne themselues together, beeing looked vnto a farre off, I sawe the forme of a tower of an incredible heygth, with a spyre vnperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appearing, all being of very auncient forme and workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>And drawing neare vnto this building, I beheld the gratious mountaines before a farre of seeming small, by comming neerer and neerer, by little and little, to lift vp themselues more and more, at the first seeming to mee that they had ioyned together with the building which was an inclosure or end of the valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt mountaine and mountaine: which thing I thought worthy the noting, and without further delay I addressed my selfe more neerer therevnto. And by how much the more I approximated the same, by so much the more the excellencie of the woorke shewed it selfe, increasing my desire to behould the same. For there appeared no longer a substance of vnknowne forme, but a rare Obelisk vpon a vast frame and stonie foundation, the heigth whereof without comparison did exceed the toppes of the side-lying mountaynes, although I thought that they had beene the renowmed <hi>Olympus</hi>

Great lauers condites, and other infinite fragments of notable woorkmanship, far different and inferiour from that they were, in their perfection, but now brought back as it were to their first vnshapelines, being fallen and cast downe, some heere, some there, vpon the earth from the which they were taken. Among the broken and decayed places, wherof great sundrie wall weeds and hearbes, especially the vnshaking Anagyre, the Lentise of both kindes, beares foote, dogges head, Gladen greene, spotted Iuie, Centarie, and diuers such like. And in the myldered places of broken walles grew Howslike, and the hanging Cymbalaria bryers, and pricking brambles, among the which crept Swifts and Lyzarts which I sawe crawling among the ouergrowne stones, which at the first sight in this silent and solitarie place, made me to be warily afraid of them. On euery side there say fallen downe smoothe round pieces of serpent spotted Marble, purple and red diuerse couloured.

               <p>Then comming to the myddle fronture of the great and excellent woorke, I sawe one sole large and marueylous porche worthy of great estimation, proportioned according to the huge quantitie of the rest of the whole work, which was placed betwixt and continued in building from the one and the other of the mountaines hare lipped, and aboue arched, whose space betwixt

as I doe coniecture was in measure sixe furlongs, and twelue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The top of which mountaines were perpendicularly equall eyther of them touching the assured skey.

There then this woonderfull frame willingly as it were ioyned hands and vnited it selfe with the one and the other mightie mountaines, by meanes whereof, the foresaid valley there had an end, that no man could go further forward or backe againe, but to enter in by this broade, large, and wide open porche.</p>
               <p>Vpon this massie frame and mightie woorkmanship, which I take to be in heigth from the roofe or top to the foote, fiue parts of a furlong, was placed a high and woonderfull Pyramides, after the fashion of a square poynted Diamond, and such incredible workemanship that could neuer be deuised and erected, without inestimable charge, great helpe, and long time. So that I thought the excellencie thereof vnthought vpon, to bee a myrrour, the fight whereof was able to dafell any humaine eyes, and quaile the rest of the spirituall sences. VVhat shall I say more? for so far as the reache of my capacitie will afoorde me leaue, in this sort I briefely describe the same.</p>
               <p>Euery side or quarter of this foure squared frame, wherevpon the foote of the Pyramides did stand,<note place="margin">A furlong is 16. pole euery pole being 16 foote.</note> did extend themselues in length six furlongs, which in compasse about euery side aequila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered of like bredth, dooth multiplie to 24 furlongs. Then lifting vp the lynes on high from the foure corners, so much as euerye corner is distant in length from an other, meeting in the top, so as the Perpendicular line may fall iust vpon the center of the Dya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, stretching from both corners of the plynts or square foote, iust and conueniently ioyned together doe make a perfect pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midall figure.

And of the same stone of <hi>Paras</hi> as were the steps: which cube and square stone was the Basis and foote set vnder the Obilisk, which I haue in hand to describe.</p>
               <p>This mightie big stone sharpe topt, sliding downe the extream part from corner to corner, flat sided by the Diameter, was fower paces, at euery equall distant corner, whereof was the foote of a harpie of moulten mettall, their steales and clawes armed.

Of proportioned thicknesse in heigth two paces. Which thus closing and mette together, made the socket of the great Obelisk: which Socket was beautified with leaues, fruites and flowers, of shining cast mettall, and of conuenient bignesse.

Of such a proportion as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon stature might be considered and perfectly seene, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the exceeding heigth thereof in the ayre. Besides the greatnesse of the figure or image: it was a woonder to thinke how such a weight should bee carryed and set in such a place and so high.

               <p>Which great quadrant and square woorke, ioyned not fast to the collaterate and sidelying rockes, but was betwixt spaced and seperated on eyther sides tenne paces. Vpon the right hand as I went of the aforesaid plynth or square sheame, there was most perfectly carued the vyperous head of the fearefull <hi>Medusa,</hi> in a most furious and rigorous forme to looke vpon, and as it were yelling out: with terrible eyes cauernate, and hollow skowling vnder ther ouerhanging browes with a wrympled and forrowed forehead and gaping wide open mouth, which being hollowed with a dyrect waye from the Catill, and vppon stone by a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane lyne perpendicular to the center of the far shewing Pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, made a large enterance and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto it, at which opening mouth, compassed with fowlded haires of vnrepartable curious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes artificiall cunning and costly woorkmanshyppe the assending the turning stayers shewed them selues, and in stead of tresses of haire platted with laces, I saw fearefull vypers and winding ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents growing out from the scalpe of the monstrous head confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly twysting together and hissing, so liuely portrayed and set foorth, that they made me afrayde to behould them.

And among the rest of such nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble partes that I beheld, me thought that this deuise was woorth the noting, because the artifitious and most cunning architect with an exquisite and perspicuous inuention, had made to the stayres certaine loopes or small windowes, imbracing the bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Thus willingly going forward, I came to a vast and wonderfull large Colose, the feete thereof bare, and their soles hollowe, and the legges as if their flesh had beene wasted, consumed and fallen away.

By the haires of his beard you might mount vp to his breast, and by the rent and torne peeces of the same to his stil lamenting mouth, which groningly remained wide open and empty, by the which, prouoked by the spurre of curious desire, I went downe by diuers degrees into his throat, from thence to his stomacke, and so foorth by secret wayes, and by little and little to all the seuerall partes of his inward bowelles, Oh wonderfull conceit.

               <p>And for as much as the affections of men are naturally variable and different one from an other: vpon this occasion I may bee excused. For although that bread sometime denyed and kept backe from the hungrie body, may cause a hard conceit, yet when it is eftsoones offered vnto him, the mallice is forgotten, and the gift very gratefully receyued.</p>

               <p>In all which this porche was most excellent, both for the rare inuention and woonderfull composition thereof, and the strange additions to beautifie the same, in such sorte so exquysite,

so fitly placed, and so curiouslie cut and ingrauen, as the smallest part thereof could not bee accused of anye fault, but the woork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man commended for the perfection of his skill.</p>
               <p>First vpon my right hande belowe, I beheld a stilypode or square stone, like an aulter vnder the bases of the columnes, which hauing vpon the vpper parte a conuenient and meet coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, and accordingly imbowed, the bottome and lowest part in like manner was fashioned, so as the quadrate and aforesayd sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypode, was no broder then long, but a right quadrangule. Which aulter (as I may tearme it) sidelong about, wrought with leaues, hollowed vnder with a gulaterie, and wrapt ouer with the same foliature and leafe worke, hemming in the smooth face or table of the Stilypode of shining white alliblaster, polished and plaine, the outward part of the quadrangule, equilaterally compassing about the same, wherevpon with a woonderfull curiousnes was ingrauen a man neere his myddle-age, of a churlish and swarffie countenance, with an vnshaply beard, thick, and turning into his chyn, by the towghnesse of the hard skinne, and vneasie growing out of the hayre.</p>
               <p>He sat vpon a stone with an aporne of a Goates skinne, the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der parts compassing his waste, and tyed behynde with a knotte, and the neck part, with the hayrie side next him, hung downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his legges. Before him in the interstice of these grose and tumorus calfes, there was an anuill fastned vpon a knottie peece of a tree, wherevpon he was fashoning of a bryganine or haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of burning mettall, houlding vp his Hammer, and as it were striking vpon his worke.</p>
               <p>And there before him was a most noble woman, hauing two fethered wings set vpon hir delicate and tender shoulders, hould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hir sonne an infante naked, which sate with his little hyppes vpon the large and goodly proportioned thighes of the faire god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse his mother, and playing with hir, as she held him vp, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his feete vpon a stone, as it had beene a little hill, with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace in a hollow hole, wherin was an extreame whote burning fire.</p>
               <p>This Ladye had hir fayre tresses curiouslie dressed vpon hyr broad and highe forhead, and in like sorte compassing about with abundance, hir head in so rare and delicate a sort, that I maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led why the Black smithes that were there busie at theyr worke, left not all to looke still vpon so beautifull an obiect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:5298:25"/>There was also fast by, of like excellent woorkemanship,<note place="margin">Mars.</note> a knight of fierce countenance, hauing vpon hym an armour of brasse, with the head of <hi>Medusa</hi> vpon the curate or brest plate, and all the rest exquisitely wrought and beautified, with a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilier ouerthwart his broad and strong brest, houlding with hys brawny arme a halfe Pike, and raysing vp the poynte thereof, and bearing vpon his head a high crested helmet, the other arme sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed and not seene by reason of the former figure: There was also a young man in silke clothing, behynde the Smith, whome I could not perceiue but from the brest vpwarde, ouer the decly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning head of the forenamed Smith. Thys rehearsed hystorie, for the better and sweeter pleasing to the eye, the workeman had graced in this sort. The playne grounde that was hollowe and smoothe in euery cutting out of a limme or body, vpon the table of the stylipode, was like vnto red coroll and shyning, which made such a reflection vpon the naked bodyes, and theyr mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers betwixt them, and compassing them about, that they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med lyke a Carnation Rose couler.</p>
               <p>Vpon the left side of the doore in the like aulter or stylipode vpon the table thereof,<note place="margin">Mercurie.</note> there was ingrauen a yoong man of seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countenance, wherein appeared great celerity: he sate vpon a square seate adorned with an ancient manner of caruing, hauing vpon his legge a paire of half buskens, open from the calfe of the legge to the ancle, from whence grew out on either ancle a wing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to whome the aforesaide goddes with a heauenlye shape her brests touching together and growne out round and firme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shaking, with her large flankes conformable to the rest of hir proportion before mentioned with a sweet countenance offered yoong and tender sonne ready to be taught: the yong man bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe curteously downe to the childe, who stoode before him vppon his pretty little feete, receiuing from his tutor three arrowes, which in such sort were deliuered as one might easelye coniecture and gather after what manner they were to be vsed: the goddesse his mother holding the empty quiuer and bowe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, and at the feete of this instructor lay his vypered caduce.</p>
               <p>There also I saw a squier or armour-bearer and a woman with a helmet vpon her head carying a trophae or signe of victorie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a speare after this manner.

               <p>The two straight pillars of Porphyre of seuen diameters vpon either of the aforenamed stilipodes and square aultars did stretch vpward of a purnish or tawnie colour, the out sides shining cleere and smoothly pollished, chamfered, and chanelled with foure and twenty rebatements or channels in euery collumne betwixt the nextruls or cordels.</p>
               <p>Of these the third part was round, and the reason of their cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in such sort (that is two parts chamfered, &amp; the third round) as I thought was this: the frame or temple was dedicated to both sexes, that is, to a god and a goddesse, or to the mother and the son, or to the husband and the wife, or the father and the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and such like. And therefore the expert and cunning worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in elder time for the feminine sex, did vse more chamfering and channelling and double varietie then for the masculine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their slippery and vnconstant nature.</p>
               <p>The cause of so much rebating was to shew that this was the temple of a goddesse, for chamfering dooth set foorth the plytes of feminine apparell, vpon the which they placed a chapter with prependent folding, like vnto plyted and curled haire, and femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine dressing, and sometimes in stead of a chapter a womans head with crisped haire.</p>

of the boule, shewing foorth a fayre and sweet composed Lyllie in the hollowing of the Abac or Plynth, from the which the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der stalkes did turne round together, vnder the compasse of the square Abac, much after the woorke that <hi>Agrippa</hi> caused to bee made, in the porche of his woonderfull Pantheon.</p>

               <p>The arche of which doore compassing like a halfe cyrcle, was wrought curiouslye and imbowed, and as it were bounde about with laces like beads of brasse, some round, and some like Eglan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine berries of a reddish couler, hanging downe after an auncient manner, and foulded and turned in among the tender stalkes.</p>
               <p>The closing together and bracing of which hemicycle or arch, worthie of admiration, of a rare and subtile deuise, and exquisite polyture, did thus obiect and present it selfe to my sight.</p>
               <p>There I beheld in a hard and most black stone, an eagle display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bearing out of the bignesse of a naturall eagle, which had louingly seazed and taken in hir foote a sweete babe in the swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cloutes, nicely, carefully, and gently houlding the same,<note place="margin">The Eagle of Iupiter that carryed Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimed.</note> least that hir strong, sharpe, and hooking pounces, should by anye meanes pierce thorough the tender skynne of the young infant.</p>

               <p>And thus beyond all measure tost and tumbled in such and so great afflictions my verie soule was vexed within me, striuing to be set at libertie from my vnfortunate and feeble bodie, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vp and downe I knew not where.

               <p>I saw an euerlasting Lampe, burning before an Aultar that was fiue foote high, and tenne foote broad, with the images of golde standing thereupon, which I could not verie perfectly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, notwithstanding the burning Lampe, the grossenes of the ayre was such and so great an enemy to the light.</p>

               <p>There I hauing small delight to make anie long staie, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to take an vnknowne way further in, which my vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken course, I espied a light whiche so long I had wished for, comming in at a litle wicket as small as I could see.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:5298:37"/>Oh with what ioy, and with what a glad heart, I beheld it, and with what cheare did I hasten my steppes towards it.

               <p>Nowe I settled my selfe more towardes my louely <hi>Polia,</hi> and bound my affections more surely to hir.

               <p>And by this time, all lets and hynderances past ouer, a spati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and large going out was offered vnto me. Then by meanes of the cleere light I was somwhat comforted, and reassuming and gathering together againe my wandering thoughts, and restoring my prostrate force, my suspected and vnknowne voyage, made me to set out in running: so as the nearer I came to the doore, the bigger mee thought it grewe. To the which at last by Gods wyll, <hi>Polia</hi> in my amorous brest bearing a predominante vigor, I came, not ceasing to continue forward my fast course: my hands which before I groping helde foorth, to keepe me from running against pyllers, I nowe vsed like a payre of Ores to hasten mee awaye.</p>
               <p>Thus traueling on safely, I came into a verie pleasaunt sighte and counttie, in the which I was not yet without feare, and not daring to rest me downe, the impression of the horrible monster was so fresh in my minde, that mee thought I still heard him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde me, and therefore I could not so easily forget him. But was rayther perswaded to goe on further: first because the countrie was so fertile, pleasaunt and beautifull: Secondly, that I might get farre enough off from the place wherein I was so lately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted. That then I sitting downe, might rest my selfe, and set


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:5298:37"/>
my minde together againe, and forget this conceiued dread, at my entrance in of the gate, the apparation of the white Sorix grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously comming againe into my reteyning memorie, an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie prouacation, and good occasion to animate and comforte me, because that to <hi>Augures</hi> it was a gratefull and propitious signe of good luck.</p>
               <p>At last I was resolutely perswaded to commit my selfe to the benignitie of my good fortune, which some time might bee vnto me an officious and bountifull handmaide, of prosperous euents. And therewithall pricked forward and prouoked to continue on my walke,<note place="margin">Capillata mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistra.</note> whether my wearie and feeble legges would conduct and bring mee. And yet I was (as in good sorte became mee) somewhat doubtfull to enter into such a place, (beeing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne vnto me) where perchaunce it was not lawfull for me to come. Albeit that I was heerin more audacious and bould a great deale, then in the enteraunce of the gorgeous Porche. And thus my brest fast beating, and my minde perplexed, I saide to my selfe.</p>
               <p>There is no cause that should lead mee to turne back againe, all things considered: is not this a safer place, and more fit to slie from daunger? Is it not better to hassard a mans lyfe in the light and cleere Sunne, then to dye and sterue in a blinde darkenesse? and so resolued not to turne backe anye more: with a deepe fet sighe, I called into memorie, the pleasure and delight that my sences had well neere lost: for the woorke which I had seene was full of maruelous woonders, and thinking by what meane I was depriued of them, I called to remembrance the brasen Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in Salomons Temple, which were of such fierce countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as that they would bring men to forgetfulnes.</p>
               <p>And into such an estate I was afrayde that the Dragon had brought me, that so excellent and maruellous woorkes, and rare inuentions, in a manner vnpossible for any humaine creature to performe, worthie to be manifested, and by my selfe diligentlye perused, should now be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that the monstrous and cruell beast was a verrie liuelye substance, and no fiction, the like of any mortall man sildome seene, no not of <hi>Regulus.</hi> The verie remembrance whereof, made my hayre stand right vp, and foorthwith mooued me to mend my pace.</p>
               <p>Afterward returning to my selfe, I thought thus. Heere without all doubte (for so I imagined by reason of the glorious bountie of the beautifull soile) is no habitation but for ciuill people, or rather for Angles and noble personages, and a place for Nimphes to frequent vnto, or for the Goddes and Auncients, Monarches and princes, in so much as my perswasiue desire did prouoke forwarde my restrained pace, causing a perceuerance in my late begun iourney. And thus as one captiuated and subiect to the sharpe spurre of vnsatiable desire, I purposed to houlde on whether the fayrenesse of my fortune should conduct mee, as yet but indifferent and rather languishing.</p>
               <p>Nowe come to behoulde a fayre and plentifull countrie, fruitefull fieldes, and fertill groundes, I did exceedinglye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the desire that mooued mee first to enter into them. But especially to giue thankes to him that had brought mee out from the fearefull place, which now I little regarded being far enough off from it.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5298:40"/>Right forwarde, the Bridge did extende it selfe, and leade to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes a large plaine, resounding all ouer with the sweete chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, melodious recordings, and loude singing of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were leaping and running little Sqirrels, and the drowsie Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouse, and other harmeles beastes.</p>
               <p>And after this manner as aforesayd, this wooddie Countrie shewed it selfe, enuironed about with high mountaines as much as a man might looke vnto, and the plaine couered all ouer with a fine varietie of sundrie sweete hearbes, and the cleare channels of Charistaline streames, sliding downe along the hilles with a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring noyse into the leauell vally.</p>

               <p>When I had well considered of this so fruitfull and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious a place for cattel and beasts to be fedde in and kept, (for it looked as though it would desire a shepheardes company and a pastorall song) I mused what should be the occasion, that so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious a place should lye vninhabited. And casting my eyes further on forward into the plaine before mee, and leauing this fore discribed place, I might perceiue a building of Marble, she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the roofe thereof ouer the tender toppes of the compassing trees. At the sight whereof, I grew wonderfully glad and in good hope, that there yet I should finde some habitation and refuge. To the which without delaie I hastined my selfe. And being come thereunto, I found a building eight square, with a rare and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull fountaine: which was not altogither amisse. For as yet I had not quenched and slaked my thirst.</p>
               <p>This building was eight cornered, small towardes the top and leaded. Vpon one side there was placed a faire stone of pure white Marble foure cornered, half as long again as it was broad, which latitude as I supposed was some sixe foote.</p>
               <p>Of this goodly stone were exact two litle halfe pillers, cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with their bases, holding vp a streight Sime, with a gule and adiected denticulature &amp; cordicules, or worke of harts, with their chapters vnder a Trabet, Zophor and Coronice, ouer the which

was a trigonall conteined, in the fourth part of the stone smooth and plaine without any workemanship in the table thereof sauing a litle garland, within the which were two Doues drinking in a smal vessel.</p>
               <p>Al the space vnspoken of inclusiue was cut in and euacuated, betwixt the Pillers the Gulature and ouerthwart Trabet, did containe an elegant Cigrued Nimph. And vnder the Syme was another quarter wrought with Thors, Torques, Ballons and a Plinth.</p>

By her smal teates (like a yong maids) in her round brests did sprowt out smal strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings of pure and cleare fresh water from the right brest as it had been a threed, but from the left brest most vehemently. The fall of both of them, receiued in a vessel of <hi>Porphyrit</hi> stone, with two Receptories ioyning togither in the same vessel, seperated and distinct from the Nimph sixe foote, standing vppon a couenient frame of flint stone. Betwixt either of the receptories, there was an other vessel placed, in the which the waters did striue togither and meetes, running out at the cut and appointed places, in the middle lymbus of their Receptories, which waters comixt out of that vessel, vnladed themselues into a little channel sliding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and what with one and what with the other, al the hearbes and flowres adioyning, and about were bountifullye benifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>That of the left brest did spin vp so high, that it did not weat or hinder any that would sucke or drinke of the water that strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and sprung out of the right brest.</p>

               <p>These histories were perfected within the compasse of one selfe same stone, and set out in a most blacke ground. Then deseruedly I did commend, both the archytect and the statuarie.

to be adicted to a voluptuous delight. Wherevpon I at that present thought my selfe most happie, onely in the behould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such delights, because I was not able to resist the burning flames which did set vpon mee in the fornace of my heart. And therefore sometime for a refuge and succour I durst not looke so narrowly vppon theyr inticing beauties, heaped vp in their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly bodyes. And they perceiuing the same did smile at my bashful behauiour, making great sport at me: And thereat I was glad, and contented that I might any way occasion their pastime. But I was greatly ashamed, in that I was an vnfit companion for such a company, but that they intreated mee to enter in with them where I stood like a Crowe among white Doues, which made me partly ashamed to behould, and ouerlooke such choyse obiects.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Offressia</hi> a very pleasant disposed piece, said vnto mee. Tel me young man what is your name?

I aunswered. That which were agreeable with hir honour, and sit for your companies. Tel me <hi>Poliphilus</hi> doest thou loue hir wel indeed? Then I fetting a deepe sigh, aunswered: beyond all the delights and cheefest substance of the greatest and most pretious treasure in the whole world, and this opinion hath made an euerlasting impression in my still tormented heart. And she: where haue you lost or abandoned so loued a iewel? I know not, neyther where I am my selfe I know. Then she smyling aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. If any should finde hir out for you, what rewarde would you giue. But content thy selfe, be of good comfort, and frame thy selfe to delights, for thou shalt finde thy <hi>Polia</hi> againe. And with these and such like pleasaunt and gratious questions, these fayre young Virgins, sporting and solacing themselues, we washt and bathed together.</p>

In the voyd and plaine euacuated quadret, there stood two Nimphes, little lesse then if they had been liuely creatures, apparelled, so as you might see somewhat aboue their knees, vppon one of theyr legges, as if the winde had blowne it vp, as they were doing theyr office, and their armes bare, from the elbow to the shoulder ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.

And I had no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner set my foote vpon the steppe, to receiue the water, as it fell, but the pissing Boye lift vp his pricke, and cast sodeinlye so colde water vppon my face, that I had lyke at that instant to haue fallen backward. Whereat they so laughed, and it made

but wel I was contented to let them laugh on. Vpon a sodaine I founde my selfe so lasciuiously bent, and in such a prurient lust, that which way so euer I turned, I could not forbeare, and they as they sung laughed the more, knowing what had happened vnto mee. And it did so increase in mee more and more, that I knew not wherewithal I might bridle and restraine my selfe from cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of one of them, like an eager and hotte Falcon comming downe out of the ayre, vpon a couie of Partriges. I was with such a violent desire prickt forwarde, which I felt more and more to increase in a sault burning. And the more I was to that venerious desire by the violent offers of so oportune and sweete obiects. A foode for suche a pernitious plague, and vnexperienced bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>Then one of these flamigerous Nymphes named <hi>Aphea,</hi> said vnto mee, How is it <hi>Poliphilus</hi>? Euen now I did see you verye merry, what hath altered your disposition?

               <p>At this my lamentable and sorrowing answere, they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to such a loude laughter, wherin they did exceed so much, that neither they nor my selfe with the wearines thereof could goe any further, but were constrained to rest our selues for want of breath, vpon the odoriferous floures &amp; coole grasse, by meanes whereof, I became somewhat oportunely to bee eased, my heate aswaging and relenting by little and little.</p>

Vnto which enclosure when wee came, I founde it equilaterall, with three fences like a streight wall, as high as the Cyprus Trees vpon either sides of the waye, that wee had passed along in: which was altogither of Cytrons, Orenges and Lymonds, bushing with their leaues one within an other, and artifitially knitte and twisted togither, and the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes mee thought of sixe foote: with a Gate in the middest of the same Trees, so wel composed as is either possible to bee thought or done. And aboue in conuenient places were made windowes, by meanes whereof, the bowghes in those places were to be seene bare, but for their greene leaues which yeelded a most sweet and pleasant verdure. Betwixt the curious twistings of the braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and their greene leaues, the white flowers did aboundantly shewe themselues a singular Ornament, breathing foorth a most delectable and sweete odour. And to please the eye, the faire fruite was in no place wanting, where it should yeelde content.

               <p>Which same was founded vpon a steale or smal Pillar of Ias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of diuers colours, beautifully adulterating one with an other, being cut in the middest and closed vp with the cleare Calcido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, of the colour of the troubled Sea water, and brought into a marueilous woorke, beeing lifted vp with guttured hollows ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, one aboue an other, with a reserued seperation, by artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and woonderful ioyntes. It stood streight vp, fastened in the center of a Plynth, made of greene Ophite which was rounde, and somewhat lifted vp aboue, about compassing Porphyr, some fiue inches, whiche was curiously wrought with diuers lynea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Rounde about the steale whiche helde vp the vessell, foure Harpies of Golde did stand, with their clawes and tallented feete vpon the smoothe Table of the Ophite.</p>

And vpon their nauels, an Antique leafe worke. These were verie necessarie for the strengthening of the Pype within the steale and smal Pillar.</p>
               <p>Within the middest of the wombe and bellye, or nauel of the vessel, vpon the Subiect steale, there was proportionately raised vp of the same vessel of <hi>Amathyst,</hi> a substance like a Challice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or the inwarde moulde for a Bell, so high as the vessel was deepe the middle thereof, leuell with the brimme of the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</p>

               <p>From the teates of their breastes the ascending water did spin out lyke siluer twist. And euerie one of them in their right hand did holde a copie full of all kinde of fruites, whiche did extend in length vp aboue their heades, and at the opening, all three of them ioyned rounde into one, with diuers leaues and fruites hangyng ouer the brimmes or lippes of the wrythen Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies.</p>
               <p>Betwixt the fruite and the leaues, there came vp sixe small Pypes, out of the whiche the water did spring vp through a small hole.</p>

               <p>Whiche Porphyrite was three foote from the playne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermost parte to the Pauement, with an excellent vndicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.

               <p>Then in the corpulent bearing out of the belly of the vessell, betwixt one, and the other Dragons, in an equall distance, and of a most excellent melting or casting, there stood out Lyons heads of an exquisite exaction, and driuing, casting foorth by a little pype, the water that distilled from the six fistulets, placed in the copie aboue. Which water, did so forciblie spring vpward, that in the turning downe it fell among the Dragons in the large vessell, where by reason of the high fall, and fashion of the vessel, it made a pleasant tinckling noyse.</p>

               <p>At which imperious commaund, her eloquent and fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable speech ended, humbly, and with a little more audacitie than before, vppon one of the benches of my right hande I did sit downe (lapping my torne gowne together before me with certaine brymble leaues still sticking in it) betwixt the fiue Nymphes that brought mee in, and amongst them next vnto <hi>Offresia</hi> and <hi>Achoe,</hi> placed behinde the Queene, and six other of the chamber vppon the other hande; and in the middest on high vppon a throne did the Queene sitte in an imperiall Maiestie.</p>

The bewtifull and honorable damosels sate in order vpon the Benches, compast about all along by the sides of the walles vppon the right side, and the best of the Court, with a rare and strange kinde of womanly dressing vppon their heads, as is in the world, with the tresses of their haire lapt and bowed vp in Caules of gold.</p>

               <p>Others of the colour of the Obsidium of <hi>India,</hi> blacke and shining, adorned with floures of Orient Pearle, &amp; Carkenets of the same. They stood all waiting with such a venerate atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that when the seruice was brought to the table, they all at one instant time alike, made their reuerent curtesies in bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their knees, and in like manner when they did rise from of their seates, euerie one apparrelled in cloth of Golde, but they did not sit and eate at the same table.</p>

                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:5298:60"/>And first before the Queene, there was placed a frame of three feete of this fourme, vpon a rounde of fine Dyasper, with curious Lineaments. To the which were three stypits, the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er partes whereof, did finish in the forme of the tearing claw of a Lyon, with an exsquisite foliature, compassing about the steales of the stypets, hauing in the middest of euerie one, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened the head of a childe betwixt two wings, from the which betwixt one and other of the stypets, there hung in maner of a Garland a bundle of leaues and fruites bounde togither, and biggest towardes the midst, and vppon the top of the stypets or steales, was put a proiection to beare vp the rounde table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Queene.</p>
               <p>This frame was vnmoueable, but the round table was to be quickly taken of and on, according to the substance of the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels at euery changing of the table.</p>
               <p>And streight way as it were in the twinckling of an eye and turne of a hand, there was put vppon this three footed frame a rounde table of Golde, three foote by the Diameter, and of an indifferent thicknesse, and of this forme and bignes were all the rest.</p>
               <p>Vpon this table was laide a Carpet perfumed, of cloth of Hormisine of a greene colour, euenly distended large and long downe to the pauement: fringed vpon the sides with twisted threede of the selfe same, and mixed with Siluer and Golde, depending downe vnder a border of imbroyderie of Pearle and pretious stone, with a hand-breadth of the pauement on euerie side hanging downe. And of this sort were all the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets bordered and fringed.</p>
               <p>Afterwards followed a faire yoong Damosell and quicke, with a great Bason of Gold filled with the flowers of Violets, tawny, blew &amp; white, and sweet smelling, as in the prime spring time, and strewing of them vpon the tables, except that before the Queene.</p>

The third did wipe and drie her hands.</p>
               <p>The broad and large Receptorie of this fountaine was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed vpon foure little wheeles, which they drew vppon euerie

               <p>The brim of the vessell wherein the rising vp fountaine did stande, was adorned with bubbles of pearle standing vp, and vnder the same was sette an other of an other sorte, and both ioyned together with two claspes of an exquisite dipoliture, fine worke, and pretiously garnished. For among other iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elles of inestimable price, vppon the verie toppe in a flower, there was sette a Diamond in fashion of a peare, glistering and sparkling of a huge and vnseene bignes.</p>

               <p>They stood vpon the base with the right foot towards the

               <p>There were six in a round circuit, one towardes an other: And betwixt theyr shoulders in the Center point of the trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guled base, there rose vp a steale like an olde fashioned Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticke, holding on the toppe thereof suche a bowle or ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell as aforesaide, and so broade as did fill vp the voyde place in the middest betwixt the other six.</p>
               <p>Which bowles were filled with burning coles couered ouer with embers, and in euery vessell vppon the ashes did boyle a little pot of gold, which contrary liquors infused with sweet odours.</p>
               <p>And as I suspected, euery potte had seuerall water, as it were, one with Rose-water, another with water of Orange flowers, another of myrtle, tender greene Lawrell leaues, el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dér flowers, and diuers such lyke sociable symples.

               <p>In the presence of the magnificent Queene there did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes wayte and attend three honourable Nymphes, their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell beeing of golde and silke, maruelously wouen and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and sette with pearle and stone.

Their shooes of golde cutte with halfe Moones, and closed vp at the ioyning of the hornes or corners with buttons and flowers of gold-smithes woorke in a curious sorte, and the

               <p>They stoode thus on eyther hande and before the Queene with a singular and reuerent regarde, attending and readilie perfourming that charge whereunto they were appoynted. And these serued but an one Table: which beeing chaunged, they withdrewe themselues by, and stoode still vppon theyr feete arme in arme, other three hauing supplyed their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And the three that wayted, shee in the middest was caruer.</p>

               <p>The towell was not vsed but once, and then cast by vpon the pauement, and carryed away by one that stoode neare. And so many morsels as shee did eate, so many sweete perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med cleane towelles of silke plyted and finely wrought were vsed.</p>

               <p>After that the Queene had washed, and had her first ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, then all the rest did wash at the same fountaine, casting out water of it selfe, and reassuming the same in a wonderfull manner by two small pypes on eyther sides, and running vp straight in the middest from the bottome of the vessell, the deuyse whereof when I did vnderstand, I was much contented therewithall.</p>
               <p>After the washing of the Queene first, and successiuely of all the rest, there was deliuered to euery one of the wayters a rounde ball of golde wyer-woorke full of small holes, and within stuft with Amber past of a most perfect composition, set with pretious stones, to the ende their hands, eyes, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces should not be idle.</p>

into the middest of the royall Court vppon foure turning wheeles a stately repositorie or cupbord, in fashion like vnto a shippe, and the rest like to a triumphant Chariot, of most fine golde, with many fishes and water monsters, and infinit other exquisite shapes maruelously wrought, and sette full of riche stones, the sparklings and glisterings whereof did shine rounde about the sides of the Court, and reincounter vpon the roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles of the other before spoken iewelles, on euery side fitly placed, as if Phoebus had beene sette by a Nymph to grace hir eyes and countenance with his shining brightnes.</p>
               <p>To all which continuall glistering of ineffable workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe, there could no more bee deuised of equall compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, although it were the Temple at Babylon with the three golden statues.</p>
               <p>Within the which was put all such necessaries perfumed, as were meete and conuenient for the chaunging of the tables, as clothes, flowers, cuppes, towelles, and vesselles, to powre out of, to drinke in, and plates to eate vpon.</p>

thing whatsoeuer, without any defect of grace or delight answerable, according to the dignitie of the place.</p>
               <p>To this first princely table, all the vessels and instruments togither with the table it selfe, were of pure fine Gold. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon there was appresented a Cordiall confection, and as I could coniecture, it was made of the scraping of Vnicornes horne, Date stones and Pearle, often hette, and quenched and pownded small, Manna, Pineapple kernels, Rose water, Musk and Lyquid, Golde, in a precious composition by weight, and made Losenges with fine Sugar and Amylum.</p>
               <p>This was eaten without any drinking vpon it, and it was a Confection to prohibite all Feuers, and to driue away Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly wearines.</p>
               <p>This being done in a moment, all things were taken vp and remoued, the Violets cast vpon the ground, and the table bare. And assoone as this was done, the table was laide againe coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with cloth of Talasike, and also the wayters, and as at the first, there was cast vpon them the sweete flowers of Cedars, Orenges, and Lymons, and vpon that, they did appresent in vessels of Beryl, and of that precious stone was the Queenes table (except the skinking pottes which were all of pure fine Gold) fiue Fritters of paste of a Saffron colour, and crusted ouer with extreeme hotte Rose water, and fine pownded Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and then againe cast ouer with musked water, and with fine Sugar like frost vpon Ise. These Seruices of a most pleasant taste, and of sundry fashions were laid in thus. The first, in oyle of the flowers of Orenges. The second, in oyle of Gilliflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The third, in oyle of the flloures of Gessamin. The fourth, in pure Oyle of Beniamin.</p>
               <p>And the last, in the oyle of Muske and Amber. And when we had wel tasted and eaten of the same delectable meat, there was deliuered to vs a goodly cup of the aforenamed Beryl, with his couer, and couered ouer that also with a thinne Veyle of silke and Gold, curiously folded into the fourme of a Canapie, the ends cast ouer the shoulders of the bearers, and hanging down their backe.</p>
               <p>And in this sort they did present all drinking vessels and others, with meates and sawces couered. Within the drinkyng

               </p>
               <p>Without delaie (after our drinking this table being taken away, and the sweete flowers cast vpon the pauement, there was forthwith spred a cloth of murry silke and carnation: with Roses white, redde, Damaske, Muske, and yealow cast vppon the same. And presently new wayters brought in (appariel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the same colours) sixe pieces of bread cut for euery one, tossed and dressed with refined marrow, sprinckled ouer with Rose water, Saffron, and the iuice of Orenges, tempering the taste and gilded ouer, and with them sixe pieces of pure man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet were set downe. And next vnto them a confection, of the iuice of Lymons tempered with fine Sugar, the seedes of Pines, Rose water, Muske, Saffron, and choyce Synamon, and thus were all the sawces made with conuenient gradation and deliuery. The vessels were of Topas and the round table.</p>
               <p>This third magnificent table being taken vp as before said, there was presently an other innouated, with a cloth of silke smooth, and of a yealow colour, (the wayters sutable) and strewed with Lilly Conually, and Daffadil, immediately this course was presented, seuen morsels of the flesh of a Partridge in a sharpe broth, and so many pieces of pure white Manchet. The sauce Acceres, minced and dissolued in Sugar thrice sod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Amylum, Saunders, Muske and Rose water. The ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and the rounde table of <hi>Chrysolite.</hi> Lastly, they offered a precious drinking cup, and so obserued in the rest.</p>
               <p>The fourth table beeing taken away, the fift was reuested with a cloth of silke, of a crimosen colour, and in like sort the Nimphish apparrel. The flowers of purple, yealow, white, and tawny. The Seruis, eight morsels of the flesh of a Pheasant ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted lying in the grauie, and withall so many pieces of fine white manchet. The sauce was this, water of Orenge flowers, the iuice of Pomegranets, Sugar, Cloues, and Cynamon. The vesselles of Smaragde, and the table of the Souereigne Queene.</p>
               <p>This beeing taken away verie solemnely, there was spred


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:5298:64"/>
an other cloth of silke of a purple colour, and so the apparrel of the wayters.</p>
               <p>The flowers were of three sortes, of Iessamine, tawny, yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and white. The Seruice was nine morsels of the flesh of a restoratiue Peacocke, moystened in his grauie. The sauce was most greene and tart, with Pistacke, Nuttes pownded, Sugar, Cypricum, Amylum, and Muske, Time, white Marioram, and Pepper. The vesselles of Saphyre, and the Princely Table.</p>
               <p>At the seuenth chaunge, they brought in a sumpteous ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of white Iuory, bordered, trayled, and finely wrought with many small pieces vpon the precious wood of Aloes, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; glued togither, and from one side to the other, wrought with knottes and foliature, flowers, vesselles, monsters, little Birdes, and the strikes and caruings filled vp with a black paste and mixture of Amber and Muske. This mee thought was a most excellent thing and sumpteous breathing out, a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful sweet smel. The cloth white and subtily wrought with drawne worke with Satten silke, the ground powdered and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the worke white and plaine, with the representation of shapes, byrdes, beastes, and flowers, and in like sort the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of the wayters. The flowers Lady steale, Rape, Violet, and all sortes of sweete Gilliflowers. And thus there varied euerie where such diuersitie of smelles, seuerally brought in, and so delighfull to the sences, as I cannot sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse.</p>
               <p>Then there was giuen to euerie one a confection in three morsels of the shell, fish, Dact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The vessels were of Iacynth, and the table circulare. An apt and conuenient stone to so excellent disposition and roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all board and straunge banquets, suche as before were neuer heard of.</p>
               <p>After the taking away of these wonderfull Confections,


<pb facs="tcp:5298:65"/>
and the flowers cast downe vpon the pauement in a princely magnificence, there was presently brought in, a great vessell of Cold full of kindled coales, into the which the table cloathes, napkins and towelles of silke were throwne, whiche presently burned light, and after that beeing taken out and cool<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Which most excellent order and sightes, the more that I carefully indeuoured to consider of them, the more ignorant and amazed I founde my selfe.</p>
               <p>But in all thinges assuredly I did take great pleasure with my intended admiration, in seeing of such, so great, plentifull, and tryumphant sumpteousnes, of so incredible costly a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, that it is better to holde my peace then not to speake suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently in the report thereof.

               <p>Yet notwithstanding so supreame and excessiue alacritie, and cordiall delectation, and that onely and extreeme pleasure (occasioned by such and so vnexpected delightes) by one of those three which in the last chaunge attended, was quayled, ouerthrowne, interrupted, lamed, intercepted and made vaine. For shee did represent in her behauiour, the sweet ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture and resemblance of <hi>Polia,</hi> stirring vp by them in me stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling regardes.</p>
               <p>This was no small hinderance vnto mee, in the takyng of those pleasant dainties and princely refection. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing my eyes would now and then with much adoo, bee withdrawne to beholde the bewtie of the Iewels and precious stones, sparkeling and glistering in euerie place, in such diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of straunge and vnseene gloriousnes and conspicuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coraments, as if they had all ought a duetie to her, which made mee with an immoderate desire, to behold the correspondency of her excellent bewtie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:5298:65"/>Lastly, in suche order and sorte, as aforesaide, the tables beeing taken away, I hung downe my heade, because that I might not followe after the last iunckates which I had lost by minding of her that ministred.</p>
               <p>Then first before the sacred Maiestie and royall person of the Queene, and afterwards to vs, fiue fayre Nymphes appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled in blewe silke and golde curiously wouen togeather in workes, did all together appresent themselues.</p>
               <p>The middlemost of them did beare a braunch of coorrall, lyke a tree, such as is not founde amongst the Ilandes Orcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, of one cubite high, which stoode as vppon a little moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, which was the couer of an old fashioned vessell of pure gold, in forme of a Challyce, as high agayne as the couer and the tree of coorrall, full of curious workmanshippe and leafe worke, neuer made in our age, nor the like seene.</p>

               <p>And the mordy cant couer of the same was thicke set with incomparable iewelles: and in lyke sorte all the base and handle whereas conueniencie requyred, and glystering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>

               <p>Vppon this appeared an other maruellous woorke, that was a perpetuall running fountaine artificially deuysed of the aforesaid matter, but of an other notable fashion and worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manshippe, founded vppon an immoueable axeltree, vppon the which two wheeles turned about.</p>

               <p>In euery angular part did sit a Harpie with both her winges extended and stretched vp to the breadth of a higher ves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And vppon euerie side the same diuided into three, the middle parte betwixt the fall of the waters intercepted, did contayne in halfe bodyes carued, a tryumph of Satyres and Nymphes, with Trophees, and exquysite actions, excepte the fore-part and hinder parte moderately sinuated and bent in. The which in steade of squadred lyneament, did contayne a roundnesse waued betweene, in the which was maruellously ingrauen a little sacrifice with an olde Aultar on eyther sides, with manie figures and actions, the rest that was voyde, the tayles of the foresayde Harpyes ioyning togeather, and turning heere and there into leaues, did excellently couer the same.</p>
               <p>Out of the medyan center of the equature and quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gule afore specified and described out of an antyke folyature, did ryse vp an olde fashioned vessell, and verie beautifull, the cyrcuite whereof did not exceede the content of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangulate playne, and this with all the rest of the woorke, and euerie proportionate disquisition, tryall, and examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

both in the highest breadth and thicknesse, with moste conuenient vesseling lineamentes, diligently delymated and fyled, and then finished with an absolute and depolyte defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>The which out of the suppressed orifice thereof did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend vp an other hollowe vessell, the compasse whereof did exceede the aforesaide subiect vessell furrowed and channel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led round about, of a great breadth and large brymmes so wel fashioned, as is possible for any goldsmith to beate out with his hammer.</p>
               <p>In the center poynt whereof did rise and mount an other vessell of incredible workemanship.</p>
               <p>In the bottome of which thirde there were small ridges swelling outwardes, the toppes of them compassed about with a row of diuerse inestimable stones, bearing out and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in colours, as best might content the eye of a curious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidarie and skilfull vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>Vppon the same on eyther sides was made a heade of a monster, from the which on both handes did proceede the garnishing thereof in an exquysite and most rare worke of leaues, inuesting the same about with the congresse of the opposyte heade, and finely gracing that parte of the vessell.</p>
               <p>And in the bearing out of the lippe of the vessell ouer the perpendicular poynt of the heade there was fastened a rynge, from the which vppon eyther sides there hung downe a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of braunches, leaues, flowers, and fruites growing big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger towardes the middest, with a perpolyte bynding to eyther ringes.</p>
               <p>Ouer the middle bending of the garland, and vnder the proiecture of the lyppe of the vessell, there was fixed and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the head of an olde man, with his beard and haire of his head transformed into nettle leaues, and out of whose mouth gushed out the water of the fountayne by art continually into the hollownes of the broad vessell vnder this.</p>
               <p>Vppon the mouth of this last described vessell did mount vppe a pretyous hyll maruellously congest, and framed


<pb facs="tcp:5298:67"/>
of innumerable rounde pretious rocke stones closing one with another vnequally, as if nature had ioyned them growing, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a rounde composed hill, beautifully glistering of dyuerse sortes and colours in a proportionate bignes.</p>
               <p>And aloft vppon the toppe of this little hill, there grewe a fine pomgranate tree, the body, boughes and fruite made all of golde, the leaues of greene Smaragde. The fruit of theyr na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bignesse heere and there aptly placed, their sides cut o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and in place of kernelles they were full of most perfecte Rubyes, as bigge as the kernels.</p>
               <p>After that, the ingenious Artificer wanting no inuention, hee seperated the graynes in steade of the fyline with siluer foyle.</p>
               <p>And moreouer, in other apples, opened, but not rype, hee redoubled the thicknesse of the foyle, making the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelles of an oryentall colour, so also hee made the flowers of perfect corrall, in the cuppes full of bees of golde.</p>
               <p>Besides this, out of the toppe of the hollowe steale, lyke a pype, there came out a turning steale, the lowest part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of rested in a heade, framed from the middle trunke or pype iust ouer the axeltree.</p>
               <p>Which steale or stypet beeing strongly fastened, it bare vp a vessell of Topas of an auncient forme, the bowle whereof in the bottome was broad, and swelling out with rigges in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, rarely bewtified with a coronice, and put vnder with another.</p>
               <p>In which closing and binding together in foure equall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions, there were foure winged heades of a little childe, with foure pipes in their mouthes.</p>
               <p>The rest mounted vp so much as the lower bignesse of the vessell was, beeing closed vp at the orifice with an inuerse folia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Vppon the which there was placed an other vessell as it were a circular couer of a most curious leafe worke, with a smal coronice, and an artificiall orifice.</p>
               <p>From the bottome of which there beganne a flourished tayle of a Dolphin fastened and sowldered to the gracy lament of the vessell, descending downe with his heade finned with leaues, to the circulating brymme of the vessell where the

boyes heades were fixed. And with a moderate swelling out about the head, and streightning in towardes the tayle, they fitted for the eares in a beautiful manner. And all that inclining part with an exquisite polishing did make an expresse shewe of most curious lineaments.</p>
               <p>The vpper vessell was so perfectly wrought, that when the wheele was mooued, the steale with the vessell vppon the toppe thereof, turned about and powred out water through the tree, and when the wheele stoode still, then that lefte turning.</p>

               <p>At this aduise and precious gift, I became amphasiatike, not knowing what to saie or doo, in requitall or giuing of thankes.

               <p>And hauyng thus spoken, shee made a signe or becke with her head to the two Nymphes <hi>Logistica</hi> and <hi>Thelemia,</hi> who presently without delaie, were obedient to her commaund.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5298:79"/>Vppon the backs of these three, dyd stande rysing vp a mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue Pyre of Gold, three square, sharpning vp to the toppe, fiue tymes as high as broade below. And vpon euery front or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, was grauen a circle, and ouer one circle a Greeke Letter, O. ouer another, a Letter <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>There <hi>Logistica</hi> beganne to speake vnto me, saying, by these Figures are discribed, so farre as mans reason can shewe, the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall harmony. And vnderstand <hi>Poliphilus,</hi> that these Figures, with a perpetuall affynitie and coniunction, are auncient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, and Egiptian Hieragliphs, signifying this, <hi>Diuinae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitaeque trinitati vnius essentiae.</hi> Which is now by his holy word, in a most louing sort manifested to the whole world, according to his will: and yet it shall not be a misse to see antiquities, and consider what greater benefite is had by the precious Gospel.</p>
               <p>The lower Figure was consecrated to the Deitie, because it is euerie way alike, and all one: and vpon euery side, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euery way, of like stablenes; vpon euery base, constant and permanent.</p>
               <p>The round Circular standing vppon that, is without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or ende. Vppon the circumferent sides whereof, these three lyneaments are contained, directly vnder euerie Image, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the property attributed.</p>
               <p>The Sunne with his comfortable light, giueth life to euerie thing, and his nature is attributed to GOD.</p>
               <p>The second is the Ower, which is prouident direction, and gouernment of all with an infinite wisedome.</p>
               <p>The third is a Fyerie Vessell, whereby is vnderstoode a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tycipation of Loue.</p>
               <p>And although that they be three distinct things, yet they are contained &amp; vnited in one sempeternallie, with great loue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating their blessings, as you may see by the coppies at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery corner of the trygonall stone.</p>

               <p>And to this ende are the three Monsters placed vnder the golden Obelisque, because that there be three great opinions

               <p>In the Spyre there be three plaine sides, lyneated with three circles, signifying one for euery time. The past, the present, and to come; and no other figure can holde these three circles, but in that inuariable. And no mortall man can at one instant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie discerne and see together two sides of the same figure, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing one integrally, which is the Present: and therefore vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon great knowledge were these three Characters engrauen, O. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Tell me I beseech you fayre Nymphes, (if my curiosity bee not to your discontentment) amongst all the precious stones that I could perfectly behold of great estimation and pryce, one I deemed inestimable, and without comparison most precious; The Iasper which had the effigies of <hi>Nero</hi> cut, it was not much bigger.

And therefore I beeing therein ignoraunt, desyre to knowe the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:5298:80"/>
                  <hi>Logistica</hi> considering of my honest demaund, aunswered me incontinently. Know this <hi>Poliphilus,</hi> in the Iewell was ingrauen an imperiall throne, and in the throne the mighty name of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah</hi> in Hebrew Letters, and before that throne, are cast downe and troden vnder foote, the Gyants which proudly haue lift vp themselues against his worde, and resisted hys will: vppon the left side of the throne is a flame of fire, vppon the right hande a horne of saluation, or Copie full of all good blessednes, and this is all that is contained in the Iewell.</p>
               <p>Then I presumed further to knowe, what should these two things vpon eyther sides of the throne signifie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that were hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den out in two handes: <hi>Thele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ia</hi> quickly aunswered me, God of his infinite goodnesse, proposeth to mankind his mercie and his iudgement, chuse which they will.</p>
               <p>For thys beeing satis-fied, I sayd moreouer. Seeing that most gracious Nymphs, my speeches be not displeasant vnto you, and that I am not yet satis-fied in all that I haue seene, I pray you let me vnderstand this.</p>
               <p>Before the horrible feare that I was driuen into by the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, I beheld a mighty huge Elephant of stone, with an entrance into his bellie, where were two Sepulchres, with a wryting, the meaning wherof is too mysticall for me, that was, that I shoulde not touch the bodie, but take away the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Logistica</hi> forthwith made me aunswer. <hi>Poliphilus,</hi> I doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande very well your doubt, and therefore you shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande, that this monstrous shape and machine was not made without great and wonderfull humane wisedome, much labour, and incredible diligence, with a perplexibility of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to knowe the mysticall conceite. Thou remembrest that vpon the face there hung an ornament, with certaine <hi>Ide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sgnifying thereby, that in thys world, whosoeuer will haue any blessing that shall do him good, he must leaue the body, which is ease and idlenes, and betake himselfe to trauaile and industry, which is the head.</p>
               <p>Shee had no sooner ended her words both pleasant &amp; pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, but I vnderstoode it very well and gaue her great thankes? And yet desirous to be resolued in whatsoeuer I stood in doubt,


<pb facs="tcp:5298:81"/>
and seeing that I might speake boldly, I made this third questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Most wise Nymph, in my comming out of the subterraneall vast dark some place, as I passed on, I came to a goodlie bridge, and vppon the same, in a Porphyrite stone vppon the one side, and an Ophite vpon the other, I beheld engrauen certaine Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragliphs, both which I did interprete<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I stoode doubtfull of certaine branches, that were tyed to the hornes of the scalpe of the Oxe, and the rather because they were in the Porphyrite stone, and not in the Ophit vpon the other side.</p>
               <p>She aunswered me straight way. The braunches, one is of the Thistle or thorne of Iudea, and the other of the Turben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.<note place="margin">The crown of thorne vpon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes head.</note> The nature of which Woodes bee, that the one will not easily take fire, and the other will neither bend, rotte, consume, nor be eaten with wormes. And so that patience is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which with anger is not kindled, nor by aduersity will bee subdued.</p>
               <p>The nature of the Porphy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in the fornace it will neither burne it selfe, but also causeth other stones neere adioyning that they shall not burne. And of that nature is patience, that it will neither be altered it selfe, nor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any other wherein it beareth rule to fall into a furie. And the Ophite stone is of such nature also.</p>
               <p>Nowe <hi>Poliphilus,</hi> I doe greatly commende you, in that you are desirous to vnderstand such secrets: for to behold, consider, and measure the same, is a commendable vertue, and the way to knowledge: whereuppon I had occasion giuen to render innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable thanks, for her great and fauourable curtesies.</p>
               <p>And thus with allowed and delightfull discoursing spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, we came to a fayre Riuer, vpon the banck whereof, besides other fayre greene and florishing Trees, and water hearbes, I beheld a fine Groue of Plane Trees, in the which was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fayre bridge ouer the Riuer made of stone, with three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, with pyles bearing foorth against the two fronts, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the worke of the bridge, the sides thereof beeing of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent workmanship.</p>
               <p>And in the middle bending of the same, vpon eyther sides, there was a square stone of Porphyrite set, hauing in it a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliphic, engrauing of Hieragliphies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:5298:81"/>Vpon the right hand as I went ouer, I beheld a woman, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting abroade her armes, sitting onely vppon one buttocke, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting foorth one of her legges as if shee woulde rise; In her right hand, vpon that side which shee did sitte, shee helde a payre of winges, and in the other hand, vppon that side whereon she was arysing, a Tortice.</p>
               <p>Right against her, there was a Circle, the center wherof two little Spyrits did hold, with their backs turned towards the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the Circle.</p>
               <p>And then <hi>Logistica</hi> saide vnto me, <hi>Poliphilus,</hi> I am sure that thou doost not vnderstand these Hieragliphs, but they make much for thy purpose: and therfore they are placed for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument and thing to be considered, of such as passe by.</p>

               <p>This bridge was built with a moderate bending, shewing the cunning disquisition, tryall, examination, ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This bridge was all of pure Marble.</p>
               <p>When wee had passed ouer the bridge, wee walked in the coole shadow, delighted with the variable notes and chirpings of small byrds, to a rocky and stony place, where high &amp; crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie Mountaines lifted vp themselues, afterwarde continuing to abrupt and wilesome hilly places, full of broken and nybled stones, mounting vppe into the ayre, as high as a man might looke to, and without any greene grasse or hearbe, and there were hewen out the three gates, in the verie rocke it selfe, euen as plaine as might be.

               <p>Alas saide I, with a deepe sigh, my <hi>Polia,</hi> that the greene Arbor resounded againe therewithall, my amourous breathings were such, framed within and sent out from my burning hart.

vnto mee with such a Maiestie, and yet friendly, so as I doubt me, the amorous <hi>Idalea</hi> neuer shewed her selfe to <hi>Mars,</hi> nor to her the fayre Pastor <hi>Adonis.</hi> Nor the delicate <hi>Ganimed</hi> to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or the the fayrer <hi>Psyches,</hi> to her spouse <hi>Cupid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For which cause, if shee had beene the fourth among the three contending Goddesses, if <hi>Joue</hi> had beene Iudge, as in the shady Wooddes of <hi>Mensunlone</hi> was the Phrigian Sheepheard, without all doubt she had beene iudged of farre more excellent beautie, and without equiuolence, more worthy of the golden apple, then all or any one of the rest. At the first sight I was perswaded that shee had beene <hi>Polia,</hi> but the place vnaccustomed &amp; her apparell made mee thinke the contrarie, and therefore my doubtfull iudgement remained in suspence, hauing onely a reuerent suspition therof.</p>
               <p>This honourable Nymph, had her virgineall diuine and small body couered with a thinne subtill stuffe of greene silke, powde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with golde, vppon a smocke of pure white coorled Lawne, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering her most delicate and tender body, and snowye skinne, as fine and good as euer <hi>Pamphila</hi> the daughter to <hi>Platis</hi> in the Iland of Coo, did inuent to weaue. Which white smocke seemed as if it had couered damaske Roses.</p>
               <p>The coate which she wore ouer that, was not like our fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned petticoates with French wastes, for that her sweete proporci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned body needed no such pinching in, &amp; vnholsome weare, hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering procreation and an enemie to health: but rather like a wastcoate, with little plightes and gathers vnder her rounde and pretty bearing out breasts, vpon her slender and small waste, ouer her large proportioned flanckes and little round belly, fast girded about with a girdle of golde: and ouer the same, a gowne or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment side to the ground, and welted belowe.</p>
               <p>This garment beeing very side, was taken vp round about the pitch of her hippes, and before vpon her belly, &amp; tyed about with the studded marriage girdle of <hi>Citherea,</hi> the plucking vp of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bearing ouer the girdle about her like a french vardingale, &amp; the nethermost part falling down about her feet in plightes and fouldes, vnstable and blowne about with the sweete ayre &amp; coole winde, causing sometime, by the thinnesse thereof, her shape to be seene in it, which shee seemed with a prompt readinesse to resist and hynder. Her beautie and grace was such, as I stoode in doubt whether shee were begotten by any humaine generation: her

armes stretching downe, her handes long and slender, her fingers small and fayre, and her nayles thinne and ruddy, and shining, as if she had beene <hi>Minerua</hi> her selfe.

And thus my insatiable and wanton eyes, were the euill beginning of all thys perturbing and contentious commotion, whome I founde the seminaries and moouers of all so great strife and trouble, in my wounded and festering heart. Through theyr contumacy, I was now brought from my selfe, and neuerthelesse, I could not be satisfied by them. My greedy appetyte, extolled her delicate breast aboue any comparison, my eyes delightfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting thervnto, sayd, at least by that we may discouer what y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> rest is; And they, glauncing from that to the regarde of her grace and gesture, set all their delight therein: and my appetite strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and not easilie remooued from thence, I perswaded my selfe, that the plentie and fayrenesse of her head and hayre, and the dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thereof, and the beautie of her forheade, coulde neuer bee compared with of any one or other, like the scrapings of golde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies turning into little roundels.</p>
               <p>With two eyes lyke morning starres in a cleere heauen, more beautifully adorning her heade, than any that euer the warlike <hi>Neco</hi> behelde among the <hi>Acitanians,</hi> wounding my heart like one of the arrowes of the angrie <hi>Cupid.</hi> And thus to conclude, I dare be bolde to say, that no mortall man hath seene, so gracious, so shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, so cleere and pleasant lightes as these were, placed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of this heauenly creature; so that by them my hart was taken prisoner, &amp; was filled with such continuall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies of desire, as if a leafe of the Laurell of the Tombe of the king of <hi>Bibria</hi> had bin placed betwixt, &amp; that strife should neuer cease whilst it was there: so as I thought that this strife would neuer cease, vntill the pleasure were taken away, by reason wherof, I could not perceiue howe I shoulde obtaine the fulnes of my desire, or howe it coulde agree with either one or other.

not to be resisted. For I felt the same leaping and beating against my breast, without ceasing, like as one that striketh vpon a hoarse Taber. And still me thought by her louely and delightfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, by her fayre tresses, and the curling and wauing haire, playing vp and downe vppon her forheade, that it should be <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> whome so greatly I had loued and desired, and for whom I had sustained so many &amp; sundry griefes, without intermission, sending out scalding sighes, the outward reporters of my inwarde flames.

               <p>Shee (as beforesaide) carried in her snowe white left arme, close to her body, a kindled and burning Torch, somewhat higher then her heade a good deale, and the lower ende growing smaller and smaller, shee helde in her hande: and stretching foorth that which was at libertie, more white then euer had <hi>Pelopea,</hi> wherein appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the thinne smoothnes of the skynne, and the blewnesse of the veynes lyke Azure streames<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vppon the faire and whitest paper.

               <p>
                  <hi>Poliphilus,</hi> I thinke my selfe to come in saftie, but it seemeth that you stand doubtfull. Heereat I was more amazed, and my sences in a manner gone to imagine howe she should knowe my name; and al my inward parts vanquished, and hemmed in with burning amorous flames, my speech was taken from mee with feare and reuerent bashfulnesse.</p>
               <p>In this sort remayning, I knewe not vppon the suddaine what good aunswere I might make, or otherwise doe her reuerence, but to offer her my vnworthy and vnfit hande; Which when it was streined in hers, me thought that it was in hot snowe and curded milke, and me thought indeede, that I touched and handled some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which was more then humaine; which when I had so done, I remained moued in minde, troubled and doubtfull, vnaccusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to such a companion, not knowing what to say, or whether to followe her, in my simple apparell and homely bringing vp, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with hers: and as a foole, vnworthy and vnfit for her fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, perswading my selfe, that it was not lawfull for a mortall and earthly creature to enioy such pleasures. For which cause, my


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:5298:88"/>
collour red and blushing, with reuerent admiration, being grieued at my basenesse, I setled my selfe to followe her.</p>
               <p>At length, and yet not with a perfect recalled minde, I beganne to reduce and sommon together, my fearefull and distempered spirites: perswading my selfe, that I must needes haue good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, being neere so faire and diuine an obiect, and in such a place; And so followed her on with a panting heart, more shaking than the birde <hi>Sisura,</hi> or a Lambe carryed in the mouth of a Wolfe.</p>
               <p>And thus touched most feruently with pleasant heates, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; encreasing more &amp; more, they began to boyle &amp; kindle my colde feare, and dispositiuely to adopt my altered heate to sincere loue. Which being thus brought to thys passe, by a prouoked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward desire, yet inwardly as I reasoned with my selfe, it was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully variable and doubtfull. Oh most happye Louer of all Louers, that in requitall of hys, might bee sure to participate of hers.</p>
               <p>On the other side, I perswaded my selfe, that if I shoulde offer vnto her my amorous heart and loue, hauing no better thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow vpon her, or present vnto her, it might be that she would not refuse it: like <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> the King of the Percians; who hauing water presented to hys handes, accepted of it bowing downe himselfe. Heerewithall, me thought yet that a fearefull and chill trembling inuaded mee, infusing it selfe ouer all my body and breast, renewing the force of the extreame fire, euen like dry reede: which being once kindled, is enflamed and nourished with the fresh ayre, vntill at length it is increased so mightily, that it consumeth all to ashes.</p>
               <p>And in like sorte, I fully founde in my selfe, an increase and flashing abroade of my inwarde flames, in their prepared sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, so effectually, that her amorous regardes gaue me mortall and deadly woundes: euen as lightning and thunder, among the stronge and mightie oakes, suddainely with a great force, scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching &amp; tearing them. And therefore I durst not looke vpon her bright eyes, because that dooing so, (being ouercome with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible beauty of her gracious aspect) if peraduenture her radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beames did reincounter mutually with myne, for a little while euery thinge seemed two vnto mee, vntill I had clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the lyddes together, and restored them to theyr former light.</p>
               <p>

But my burning heart humbly hauing opened the same, euen as a rype Apple being eyther bytten or shaken, so it fell and fayled me. And receiuing into his wounded and familiar estuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in some interposition of time, immediatly his accustomed heat and feruor increased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> piercing the inward parts with her virgineall aspects, exceedingly beautified with a comely grace and vnexco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitable elegancie; Because, that into this sweete introduction into my minde, of these first amorous flames, (lyke the Troian horse, full of weapons and deceite) the enterance was made for an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, vnknown, and vncessant plague, deeply festering in my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and poore heart, perpetually remayning: which easily ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with one sweete looke, inconsiderately without delay, haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his owne hurt, and wholly layeth it selfe open to amorous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions, and burneth it selfe with sweet conceits, going into the flames of his owne accord.</p>
               <p>To all which burning desires, her present company did greatly inforce mee, which I esteemed to yeelde mee more comfort, then the North starre in a tempestuous night to the troubled Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner: more acceptable then that of <hi>Melicta</hi> to <hi>Adonis,</hi> or to <hi>Phro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites,</hi> the obsequious Nymph <hi>Peristera:</hi> and more delightfull then <hi>Dittander</hi> to the daughter of <hi>Dydo,</hi> with the Purple flowre for the wounde of <hi>Pius Aeneas</hi>: And finding my heart strooken and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly pricking, secretly filled and compressiuely stuft; recording and gathering together into it, varyable thoughts and working of Loue, my immedicable wounde grewe greater and greater. But gathering vp the remaynder of my sences, as one that durst, I assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my selfe to manifest and lay open before her, my intended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and amorous conceites. And thus loosing my selfe in a blinde folly, I could not choose but giue place to my inuading desires, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently boyling and inforcing me to say thus.</p>
               <p>Oh delycate and heauenly Damosell, whatsoeuer thou art, thy forcyble loue hath set me on fire, and consumeth my grieued heart; I finde my selfe all ouer, burning in an vncessant flame, and a sharpe da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

fast, hauing made a mortall wounde vncurable. And hauing spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thus, to the ende I might discouer vnto her my hidden desire, and moderate by that meanes the extreamitie of my bitter passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: vvhich I felt, the more they were concealed, the more to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and increase, I patiently helde my peace: and by this meanes all those feruent and greeuous agitations, doubtfull thoughtes, wanton and vyolent desires, were somewhat supprest; with my ill fauoured Gowne, that had still some of the Bramble leaues and prickes in the Wood hanging vpon it, and euen as a Peacocke in the pride of his feathers, beholding the fowlenesse of his feete, pulleth downe hys traine: so I considering the inequallitie of my selfe, with such a heauenly obiect, appaled the prouocations of my contumacious and high desires, looking into the vanities of my thoughtes.</p>
               <p>And then I earnestly endeuoured by all the meanes that I might, to subdue, encloyster, and keepe in, my vnbridled gadding appetite, wandring minde, and immodest desire, intending nowe that it should neuer be vttered againe.</p>
               <p>At length I beganne to thinke in the secret depth of my wounded heart, that vndoubtedly this my present continued griefe, was equall with that of wicked <hi>Tantalus,</hi> to whose hotte and thirsting lyppes, the coole and cleere water did offer it selfe, and to his hungry appetite, the sweete fruites honge ouer hys gaping mouth appresenting, but he neuer tasted any of either.</p>
               <p>Ah woe is mee euen in like sort, a most fayre Nymph of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent shape, of a florishing age, of Angel-like behauiour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable, and of rare honour and exceeding curtesie as mine eies coulde beholde, whose company exceeded any exquesite hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine content; and I, iust by her, full of all whatsoeuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation, forcing sollaciously loue and desire, heaping vppe in her selfe the whole perfections of delight, and yet my yauning and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous desire, neuer the more thereby satisfied.</p>
               <p>Well, on this sorte my burning concupiscence nothing allayed, as much as I might, I comforted my languishing hart, vnmeasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tormented, in putting of it in minde, of solacious and amorous hope: and with that, there was neuer a coale so neere put out, but it was presently renued and set on fire, with the company of the next. And my vnbridled eyes, the more they were vnarmed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist her power, the more they were inflamed with the insolent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire


<pb facs="tcp:5298:90"/>
and liking of her wonderfull and heauenly beautie; Still seeming more faire, more excellent, more louely, more to be desired, extreamly apt and praepared for loue: euedently shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth in her selfe, a wonderfull increase of sweete plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>Afterwards I thought with my selfe, it may be that she is some creature which I may not desire, and it may bee the place is not fitte for such thoughtes, and then it may bee I haue made a wise worke, and spunne a fayre thred, if I should bee punished for my impudencie, like <hi>Ixion.</hi> In like sort, the Thracian had neuer founde the deepe seate of <hi>Neptune,</hi> if he had not medled with <hi>Tethis:</hi> and <hi>Gallantide,</hi> the mayde of <hi>Lucina,</hi> shoulde not haue brought foorth in her mouth, if hee had not deceiued. It may that thys Nymph is spowsed to some high and mightie Prince, and I to offer her this dishonour, what am I worthy of?</p>
               <p>And thus resoning with my selfe, I thought that those thinges which had but slender assurance, woulde lightly slyppe away, and that it would not be hard to deceiue, where was no watchfull regarde: and to bolde spirites, Fortune was not altogether fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: and besides, that it was harde to knowe a mans thought. Where-vpon, euen as <hi>Calistone,</hi> being ashamed at her swelling bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, shronke aside from the presence of <hi>Diana</hi>; so I withdrewe my selfe, blushing at my attempt, and bridling my incouenient desires.

                  <p>The same Nymph, vppon the other side was also represented, who hauing mounted vp vppon the backe of the Bull, which was gentle and white, he carryed her ouer the sea.</p>

vpon the proiect corner of the Coronice, full of fruites and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers cut of precious stones, as it were growing out of a foliature of golde.

                  <p>The wheeles, aboue the naues and axeltrees, were closed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Chariot, and the sides thereof vnder the Harpies feete, bent somewhat vpward and growing lesser, turned rounde downward, wherevnto the furniture or trace to drawe it by, were fastned: and where the axeltree was, there vpon the side of the bottom of the Charriot, ouer the naue of the wheele, there came downe a prepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ioyning to the Plynth, twise so long as deepe, of two folia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, one extending one way and the other an other way: and vpon the middle thereof and lowest part, was a Rose of fiue leaues, in the seede whereof, the ende of the axeltree did lye.</p>

                  <p>This Triumph, was drawne by sixe lasciuious Centaures, which came of the fallen seede of the sausy and presumpteous <hi>Ixion:</hi> with a furniture of gold vpon them, and a long their strong sides, like horses, excellently framed and illaqueated, in manner of a flagon chayne, whereby they drewe the Tryumph; such as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricthonius</hi> neuer inuented, for swiftnesse.</p>

                  <p>The middlemost in bright Crymosen: and the two formost in an Emerald greene, not wanting any ornamentes to sette them foorth, singing so sweetly with little rounde mouthes, and playing vppon their instruments, within so celestiall a manner, as woulde keepe a man from euer dying.</p>
                  <p>The Centaures were crowned with yuie, that is called <hi>Dendro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyssos.</hi> The two next the tryumph did beare in their handes, two vesselles of an olde fashion, of the Topas of Arabia, of a bright golden collour, gratefull to <hi>Lucina,</hi> and to the which, the waues will be calme: slender at the bottom, bigge swelling in the belly, and lessening small vp towardes the Orifice; In height two foote, without eares: out of the which, did ascend a thicke smoake or fume, of an inestimable fragrancie. The middlemost, did sounde Trumpets of golde, with banners of silke and golde, fastned to the Trumpets in three places.</p>
                  <p>The other two formost, with olde fashioned Cornets, agreeing in consort with the Instruments of the Nymph.</p>

                  <p>The fourth Tryumph was borne vppon foure wheeles, with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron strakes, forcibly beaten out without fire; All the rest of the Charyot, in fashion like the former, was of burning Carbuncle, shewing light in the darkest places, of an expolite cutting: past any reason, to thinke howe or where it was possible to be made, or by what workeman.</p>
                  <p>The right side whereof, helde this History. <hi>An honourable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with childe, vnto whome Jupiter shewed himselfe (as he was wont with Iuno) in thunder and lightning: insomuch, as shee fell all to ashes, out of the which was taken vp a younge infant.</hi>

                  <p>In the fore-ende, I might see howe <hi>Cupid</hi> hauing shot vp into heauen with hys mischeeuous Arrowe, had caused <hi>Iupiter</hi> to beholde a mortall Nymph: and a great number of wounded people woondering at it.</p>

The height thereof two foote and a halfe, the fashion in maner round, the breadth by dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter one foote and a halfe, and the circumference consisted of three diameters. From the heads of the eagles the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome or foote of the vessell did ascend vp one triens, and a border going about the thicknes of a hand, from which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der


<pb facs="tcp:5298:97"/>
to the beginning of the belly of the vessel, and to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the foote with this hand breadth, was a foote and a halfe. Vpon this stood the forme of the vessell aforesaid one handfull and a halfe broader, which halfe handfull was distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the border, about the brimme of foulding leaues and flowers standing out from the hyacinth. The diameter two quarters &amp; a halfe. Vnder this border there did stick out round about certaine proportions like walnut shels, or the keele of a ship, somwhat thicke and broade at the vpper end, and lessing themselues to nothing belowe. From thence to the orifice it did rise vp two quarters and a halfe, furrowed with turning champhers, and an excellent sime: and in steed of eares to take vp the vessell by, it had two lips standing out and turning in round like the head of a base viall.</p>
                  <p>Vnder and aboue the borders, the vessel was wrought with turned gululs, vnduls, and imbossings, and with such linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were the borders wrought, both vnder and aboue. Vppon the border in the necke of the couer, were two halfe rings, suppressed in the border by transuersion, one of them iust against another, which were holden in the biting teeth of two Lysarts, or byting Dragons of greene emerauld, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out from the couer. They stoode with their serpent like feete vpon the lower part of the couer vnder the necke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the which and the lower vessell, was one quantitie, and from his vpper gracilament descending, he ioyned with the turned in sime of the circumferent lymbus or verdge, where they did closely byte togither. This couer to the necke was made in skalie worke of <hi>Hyacinth,</hi> except the vaynes of sma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragd, for the little dragons, their bellies and feetes faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the skalie couer. These little dragons one against an other, their brests and throtes hollowing out from the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the couer, and their tayles turning vpwards againe, did serue for the eares of the couer, iust ouer them of the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer vessell.</p>
                  <p>The lower turning about, where the couer did close with the vessell being of two parts, ioyned togither with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent foliature, halfe a foote broad, as if they had bin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable.</p>
                  <p>The bodie of this vessell was all run ouer with a Vine, the

stringes and vaines whereof, and small curling twists, were of Topas, farre better then is founde in the Ilande Ophia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, the leaues of fine smaragd, and the braunches of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thist, to the sight most beautifull, and to the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding woonderfull contemplable. The subiect vessell appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thorough the same of Hiacinth so round and polished, as any wheele can send foorth: except, vnder the leaues there was a substaunce left, which helde the foliature to the vessell of Hiacinth, passing ouer and separated from the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. The hollowed and bending leaues with all the other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picidariall lineaments, were performed with such an emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature as was woonderfull.</p>
                  <p>Let vs nowe returne to the circumferent brim of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious vessell. In the smooth partes whereof, vppon eyther sides of the tayles of the Lysarts, I behelde two hystorials woorthy of regard, ingrauen in this sort. Vpon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the vessell, the representation of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> holding in his right hande a glistering sword, of the vayne of the Aethiopian Chrysolits: and in the other hande a thunder bolt of shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Rubie. His countenance sauour of the vaine of Gallatits, and crowned with stars like lightening, he stoode vpon an aultar of Saphyre. Before his fearefull maiestie, were a beuie of Nymphs, seauen in number, apparrelled in white, proffering with their sweete voices to sing, and after transforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into greene trees like emeralds full of azure flowers, and bowing themselues downe with deuotion to his power: Not that they were all transformed into leaues, but the first into a tree, hir feete to rootes, their armes and heads into braunches, some more then other, but in a shewe that they must followe all alike, as appeared by their heads.</p>
                  <p>Vpon the other Anaglyph, I did behold a merrie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant maiesticall personage, like a yoong fat boye, crowned with two folding serpents, one white, and the other blacke, tied into a knot. Hee rested delightfullie vnder a plentifull vine tree full of ripe grapes, and vpon the top of the frame there were little naked boies, climing vp and sitting aloft ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the ripe clusters: others offering them in a basket to the God, who pleasantly receiued them: other some lay fast a sleepe vpon the ground, being drunke with the sweet iuice

of the grape. Others applying themselues to the worke of mustulent autumne: others singing and piping: all which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression was perfected by the workman in pretious stones, of such colour as the naturall liuelinesse of euery vaine, leafe, flower, berrie, body, proportion, shape, and representation required. And in this imagerie, although it was very small, yet there was no defect to be found in the least part belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, but perfectly to be discerned.</p>
                  <p>Out of this former described vessell did spring vp a greene flourishing vine, the twisting branches thereof full set with clusters of grapes, the tawny berries of Indian Amethyst, and the leaues of greene Silenitis of Persia: No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>About which heauenly triumph, with a maruellous and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne pompe, infinite troups of Nymphs, their faire and plentifull tresses falling loose ouer their shoulders, some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with aprons of goates skins and kids, others with tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brels and flutes, making a most pleasaunt noise, as in the daunce called Thiasus, in the triete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And hauing had these discourses with my selfe, I began se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to mourne and weepe, and desire a way that I might die, fetching deepe sighes as if my hart had torne in sunder with euery one of them.
