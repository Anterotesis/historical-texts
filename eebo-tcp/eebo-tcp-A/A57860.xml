            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE fierce Contentions of this Age about the
<hi>Mint,</hi> and <hi>Annise,</hi> and <hi>Cummin</hi> of Religion, (I
mean Religious Ceremonies that men have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
and imposed) hath, in a great measure
hindered people from minding, with that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
that becometh the weightier things of
the Law; to wit, the love of God, and of our
Neighbour, and due regard to the promoting of true holiness, and
the Salvation of mens Souls, the heavy Sufferings of many in
<hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for not complying with such things,
as their imposing Task-masters did not so much as pretend to
give Scripture warrant for, are too notorious to be denied, and
too smarting to be forgotten: How many thousands have been
put on this sad Dilemma? either to wound their Consciences, or
to be destroyed by taking away their Estates, Liberties, Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and life it self. But now the Lord (in his infinite wisdom,
and tender mercy to an undeserving generation) having by some
<pb facs="tcp:95366:3"/>
late Revolutions, first broken the Yoak of the Oppressors, and
made them, for some time taste a little of the Cup that they had
made their brethren drink deeply of; and then gratiously, and
wonderfully, delivered both contending parties from that utter
ruine that was manifestly impending; and made us like them that
Dream'd, and done exceeding abundantly for us, above what we
could think, out done our faith, as was foretold, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 8.
He hath by this surprising providence, laid an Obligation on all
<hi>Protestants</hi> (and they who are such in earnest, will mind it) to
turn to the Lord from every evil way, that hath been in their
heart or hand; and particularly to <hi>keep the unity of the spirit
in the bond of peace;</hi> to endeavour to speak, and do the same
things; and where that cannot be attained, (through want of
light, and other sinful disorders of the Soul, not easily, nor soon
removed, without that pouring out of the Spirit from on high,
promised, <hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 15. and else where; which we should daily,
and earnestly pray and wait for.) To bear with one another in
Love. They who know no other way to <hi>Unity,</hi> but <hi>Uniformity,</hi>
will for ever miss of their design, unless either all men were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in knowledge, and wholly freed from irregular passions, or
Conscience were wholly laid to sleep, and its use banished out of
the World.</p>
            <p>Toward this blessed end, peace among <hi>Protestants,</hi> sober rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
between Dissenting Parties, may have some usefulness;
even <hi>Eristick</hi> Writings, may prove <hi>Irenick,</hi> if managed, and
read, with that Spirit that becometh the gospel; that is, with
due love to truth and peace; and if I did not judge this book to
be of that tendency, I should never consent that it should see the
light. The Apostle giveth us two excellent directions for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this end, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 16. (beside the duty of forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till the Lord clear mistakes to them who are out of the way,
which he doth more than insinuate, <hi>ver. 15.)</hi> but alas, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
these ways to peace we contend, as will appear in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise:
<pb facs="tcp:95366:3"/>
Yet in my opinion, the Apostle doth there clearly hold forth,
that there is a rule to which all are obliged to conform their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and principles, and particularly, Church Administrations:
<hi>Let us walk by the same rule:</hi> In all reason, this rule must
be Divine, in that it is here generally injoyned to be minded, and
that by all Christians. Is it imaginable that the Apostle intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to oblige all the Churches to take a rule of mans making for
directing them how they shall please <hi>God?</hi> Besides, Church, or
humane Canons never were, or are like to be the same in all
Churches; nor indeed can they of the things that are left to the
Church to order at her discretion, that which is fit in one place,
may be most unfit in another. Wherefore if the Apostle had aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at these, he would have spoken of Rules, not a rule. We have
then cause to think, that the way to Church peace is to take the
Word of <hi>God</hi> for the rule by which all the affairs of his House
should be ordered: If we would enjoyn nothing, peculiar to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to be observed, but what is warranted there: And would
not be too busie in making Canons, for determining these things
that are Extrinsick to Religion, its Rites common to it with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
solemn actions, further than necessity requireth, and in
these determinations, keep within the bounds of the general di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
of the Word of <hi>God:</hi> If we would do all things in the
Church <hi>decently and in order;</hi> and then make nothing such
by our Will and Authority; but enjoyn the Observation of these
things, that Scripture hath declared to be such, or nature, and
civil custom hath made such: If we would content our selves
with that <hi>decency</hi> and <hi>order</hi> that was in the <hi>Apostolick
Church:</hi> Our Controversie would soon be at an end. It is
true, even where Scripture is taken for the rule, there might
be some different apprehensions about the meaning of this rule,
what it enjoyneth; but they who sincerely seek the mind of <hi>God</hi> in
his words, and depend on him for the light of his Spirit, readily
will either find what they seek, or will soberly and peaceably
differ from their brethren. But when this rule is laid aside, and
<pb facs="tcp:95366:4"/>
mans wisdom must injoyn what is fit in <hi>God's Worship,</hi> (even
though they be Learned, Wise, and Holy men, and in authority
in the <hi>Church,</hi> yet not infallibly guided; and much more when
any of these Qualities are wanting) there can hardly he an end
of controversie, it will be hard to set bounds to their multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
(of which the <hi>Popish Church</hi> is a fatal Witness) and hard
to bring them to an end by composing them, unless blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
be asserted; at least as to some things: And how many
things these shall be, who knoweth?</p>
            <p>The other Direction that the Apostle giveth in that place, is,
let us mind the same things: Vnity in design is very conducive
to Vnity in Heart and Practice: When all have one end before
them, they will the more readily fall into the same way leading
to that end; as when many are travelling to the same <hi>City,</hi> they
will readily go in the same road; or if one take a gainer way, as
he thinketh, then another, yet they will not fall out about that.
Let us then all make the one thing needful, our business; let us
mind serious and practical Religion; and in Subordination to
that, let us mind the <hi>Conversion,</hi> and <hi>Edification</hi> of the Souls
of the people under our charge: Let us set our selves against Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality,
Ignorance, (which, alas, doth abound every where)
Atheistical and careless neglect of Religion: Let us labour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
the people to mind how they shall be saved, and put them
in mind of the hazard of resting on out side Worship, whither it
be with, or without the Ceremonies that we controvert about:
If we all have a true Idea of that Religion, that we should la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to instill into the minds of people, and have that impression
if the weight, and indispensable necessity of it, that the Apostle
expresseth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. knowing therefore the terrour of the
<hi>Lord,</hi> we perswade men: If we were one in this, it would much
contribute to oneness in things that are more remote from the
essence and life of Religion. But while we mind our own things
which must needs be very different) while one sort is for their
Grandeur, and Riches, and Dominion, and Ease; and another
<pb facs="tcp:95366:4"/>
is for his Ease and Applause among one sort of men: While we
are for keeping up a party, for victory over them that we contend
with, and for maintaining our credit, so as we are ashamed to
change, least we fall under the imputation of being once in a
mistake: I say, while these different ends and motives are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to influence us, we must be far from agreement about any
thing that hath been the Subject of our Debates, while Lusts
war in our Members, Wars, and Fightings will be the product
of them, <hi>Ja.</hi> 4. 1. As this purging of our selves, from bad things
might conduce to the <hi>Churches</hi> peace, so might a joynt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
on both sides to purge the <hi>Church</hi> from bad Men; an Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
Scandalous, Heady, and Vnsober Ministry is a great
let to peace: God will not be at peace with the <hi>Church,</hi> while
such are countenanced, and good men cannot with any satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
behold such Scandals to Religion, and such effectual Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the ruine of Souls, continued in the <hi>Church:</hi> Such
Ministers are Make-bates in the <hi>Church:</hi> While some effectual
course is not taken to remove them, the <hi>Church</hi> is like to have
little peace, either with <hi>God,</hi> or in her self. Let all then (if
they would see <hi>Religion</hi> flourish, and the <hi>Church</hi> setled in peace)
contribute their endeavours to get the unsavoury Salt (that hath
long made us unpleasing to <hi>God)</hi> cast out; and to oppose the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of them into the Holy Function of the Ministery, who are
not in some tollerable measure such as the Apostle requireth,
and are not in a probable capacity, by their life, and doctrine,
and diligence, to do good to Souls; and let none countenance or
plead for unfit persons, either to be admitted into, or kept in the
<hi>Church:</hi> Pity to mens Persons, or Families, being horrid cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
when the ruine of Souls is the necessary consequent of such
Acts: When love to the Salvation of men beareth sway with us
above zeal for a Party, we will easily be prevailed with in this.
If this piece of Reformation be endeavoured, all Ranks must put
hand to it, the people by discovering such, where they are, and
not calling, nor countenancing them, when they want a guide to
<pb facs="tcp:95366:5"/>
their Souls: And Magistrates, by endeavouring the regulating
of such Laws as do in any wise open the door to such men to enter,
or protect them when they already are in places: And Ministers
in their station, by rejecting such <hi>Candidates</hi> of the Ministry,
as are not duly qualified, and censuring the immoralities of such
as have made a shift to get into that Office, notwithstanding of
their notorious unworthiness.</p>
            <p>In order to obtaining the Peace of the Church (which we
all prize and desire) Reformation is also necessary; peace and
purity will not long be separated the one from the other; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
reformation must not be wanting, if it will give hope of
Peace, even from Enemies, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 7. much more is it the
way to be blessed with peace from our Friends; without it there
is no peace with God, nor Man, but such as is a Curse to them
who have it, 2 <hi>King. 9. 22. Isa.</hi> 32. 17, 18. Church Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
must also truly be endeavoured by us, if we would have
Church-peace; it is no token for good, when sinful Evils (Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Jealousie, that provoke the Lord to jealousie) are in the
Church, and yet all agree in these ways; none lament them,
none reprove them, none take care to keep their Garments clean
of the Corruptions of the Time; like those whom the Lord
doth so highly commend, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 3. If we expect peace, we
must be humbled before the Lord, for our personal and publick
Deviations, and be ready to confess them before the World; we
must take Shame, if we expect that he should favour, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
us. See <hi>Ezek. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> 10, 11. While we are fixed in evil
ways, and will not be convinced; or so proud that we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to acknowledge that we have been out of the way: God
nor Man can make no peace with us. Neither is this all, but
we must turn from our evil ways, of whatever sort they be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
while Church Grievances are continued; while no
effectual course is taken, and that unanimously, and with seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
application, to remove Scandals, to satisfie the Consciences,
and quiet the Minds of such as are grived; how can Attempts
<pb facs="tcp:95366:5"/>
for Peace have any success? I suppose it will not be denyed by
sober and intelligent Men, that there are faults in the Church
(tho' some do strangely Hyperbolize in declaiming of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
but they that are in that strain, of whatever party
they be, do little understand the Scripture Patern, and the
Church-way that themselves own, and do not compare the one
with the other) Non-residences, Pluralities, want of Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Discipline, abuse of Excommunication, making that which
passeth for Church Discipline and censures; to be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to mens purses, than to their vices; and other such
things, are too grosly evil to be defended, and too well known to
be denyed, or dissembled. It were one good step toward peace, if
there might be a prospect of getting such Enormities done away;
and the affairs of the House of God managed in a way more like
that of the Gospel. It might also make for our Peace, if all of us,
of both parties, should put on a Spirit of meekness, and rather
lament what we cannot approve, than reproach one another for
such things. An unsober, and fierce Spirit hath too much appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on both Hands; our Zeal for and against the things contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
is no way proportioned to the things themselves. Many
have not a different degree of Zeal against the grossest parts of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
from what they use against some of the Rags of that Whors
attire; tho' all be unjustly charged with this, yet it is too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to be the temper and way of some: Its true immorality in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and visible Enmity against the practice and power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
may justly stir the indignation of a serious Christian, but to
be so affected toward all that differ from us, in the lesser matters
of Religion, is a Zeal not kindled from Heaven: On the other
Hand, the odious comparison that is made between <hi>Popery</hi> and
<hi>Presbytery,</hi> preferring the former as more Eligible, which is
frequent in the Mouths, not of the Rable only, but of Men of
Name and Authority in the Church, doth not savour of that meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
guided by a sound judgment, which becometh the Gospel: Let
them who are Godly and Sober on both sides, love and esteem one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb facs="tcp:95366:6"/>
in the Lord; and we may hope for more peace in the Church,
than yet we have seen. This ill temper now hinted at, should be
shunned by all, and reproved where it appeareth, by them who would
promote the peace of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>If by all the means mentioned, or other good ways, peace cannot
be obtained, we must not step out of Gods way to obtain it; Truth
must be bought at any rate, but Peace may be too dear to be bought
by a Christian: It may be <hi>impossible,</hi> it may <hi>not lie in us to live
peaceably</hi> with some men; yea, or with a Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 8.
Holiness is simply necessary not Peace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. Wherefore
it is to be expected, that we should yield in the matters of God
(however little they maybe comparatively) as one may and ought
to do, for peace sake, in his own matters; Men cannot command;
their Light &amp; Consciences, are unplyable things to worldly, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Arguments; yea, to those that seem to have somewhat in them
more divine, seeing the least Evils is not to be done, or assented to
for attaining the greatest good: Over-powering light to change
our minds, or forbearing one another, till that light arise; are the
true methods to compose Debates in the Church. Assent and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrption
to what is required, while an inward dislike of it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
is away to Peace in a Church; that the Lord doth not approve,
and that will not have Stability, nor a good Issue.</p>
            <p>I have no further account to give of this book, but that it
was written a few years ago, which must excuse some passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that may seem not to suit our present case: It was a doing
when King <hi>James</hi> came to the <hi>Crown;</hi> the case of <hi>Protestants</hi>
soon after made it appear unseasonable to contend about our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Sentiments wherein we differ, when we all were like to be
undone by a <hi>Deluge of Popery.</hi> But now after the state of the
Nation hath been unhinged, and is in a hopeful way to be setled,
it may seem allowable, if not necessary, that each Party should
put in their claim, and give the best reasons they can for their
prete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sions; and that with all moderation and peaceableness:
And having so done, what they should leave it to them who ought
<pb facs="tcp:95366:6"/>
to judge, what is fittest to be chosen. This I have endeavoured
<hi>ut potui, non ut debui,</hi> wishing that some other person, by
whom it might have been done to more advantage, had taken this
Task: Some may readily dislike the way of managing this debate,
following the Antagonist <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: but this I could not well
shun. The <hi>Reverend Doctor's</hi> method not being very exact,
and many things that might stumble an ordinary Reader, being
brought in by him, where it could little be expected. This way
I thought most useful for them who want instruction; and others,
as they do not need any help that I can afford them, so they can suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
no prejudice by this manner of reasoning. I submit all that
I have said, to the censure of the judicious, candid, and unbyass'd
<hi>Reader,</hi> and to the Authority of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in any of
her <hi>Lawful Assemblies.</hi> If any shall judge that I have yielded too
much; or, that I have condescended too little for the sake of unity,
I am willing to be corrected, by any who shall bring plain Scripture,
or solid reason, for what they alledge.</p>

Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> a Man formerly Eminent for his Moderation;
yet in this Bock, now under examination, treateth his Antagonists
with that Contempt and Severity that was not expected from a
man of his worth. That poor suffering party, though they have
no Shelter against their other Afflictions, but to make that GOD
their Refuge, for Obedience to whom they suffer; yet may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
I hope, a modest Apology for their way and practice, by
which that Reproach that is cast on them may be rowled away,
and their Innocency vindicated. In order to this, I have made
bold to attempt the Answering of this Book (looking for his help
whose Cause we plead.)</p>
            <p>But before I meddle with the Book it self, it is needful to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
his long PREFACE, consisting of 94 pages, wherein his
main business is to fasten on the <hi>Non<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>conformists</hi> a most heavy
Charge, as if they were Promoters of the Interest of <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. If any <hi>Dissenters</hi> of that Time did use the Excellent B.
<hi>Jewel</hi> (whose Memory is still precious among all Protestants) <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully
and spightfully for preaching his Opinion,</hi> in Defence of the
Church-Order of <hi>England,</hi> they deserve Blame; it had been their part
to vindicate their Principles by a sober and rational Defence against
the Bishop's Arguments, but not to shew Disrespect to a person who
had so well deserved for his Learned Labours against <hi>Popery.</hi> But
I do not well understand how this unworthy Carriage should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with the Character that the Dr. doth afterwards give of these
Dissenters, as to their moderation and compliance with the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch's</hi>
way, when he hath a mind to expose the present <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi>
as far degenerate from their Ancestors in the same Profession.
But of this more in its due place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. He complaineth <hi>(p. 2.)</hi> of his own hard Usage on <hi>the like
Occasion.</hi> His Sermon entituled, <hi>The Mischief of Separation,</hi> was
indeed solidly refuted by several <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> and in that
sence his Sermon was <hi>hardly used;</hi> but I never heard before, that
<hi>hard Arguments</hi> were counted <hi>hard Vsage</hi> from an Adversary; and
if Bishop <hi>Jewel</hi> had no harder Usage for his Sermon, there was no
need of this Complaint, unless it were to make his own hard Fate
the more conspicuous, by so venerable a Parallel. This Reverend
Author should consider, That tho' we owe and give all due <hi>deference</hi>
to the <hi>Memory</hi> of Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi> and to the <hi>Worth</hi> of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi>
for their Labours in Defence of Protestantism; yet it is neither
Ingratitude nor Incivility in us to defend the purity of Gospel-Worship
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95366:9"/>
Worship against their Assaults: We honour them, but retain our
Liberty of dissenting from them, and of owning our Dissent, when
they mistake, and are out of the way. We call no man <hi>Rabbi,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
one Master, <hi>CHRIST,</hi> whose written Word we make the
Rule of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship.</hi> But one great part of the Doctor's
<hi>hard Vsage</hi> lieth in this, <hi>That it hath been maliciously suggested by
some, and too easily believed by others, that he was put on that Work with
a design to inflame our Differences, and to raise Persecution.</hi> I confess
<hi>Malice</hi> to suggest <hi>Evil,</hi> and over-easiness to believe it, is a thing too
common among Dissenting Parties; the Lord heal these Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
on both hands; but the particular Ground of this Charge on
his Antagonists, should have been mentioned. If any have suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
that he was put on the Work; if the work be good, that doth
extenuate the fault of such Suspicion. I know no Evil in following
either the Advice or Command of others to do our Duty: So that
hither to there is no Ground for the heavy Charge of Malice and
malign Credulousness. If any have judged his Design, that is not
fair dealing, such Secrets are to be left to the Judgment of him <hi>who
knoweth the Hearts.</hi> But tho' I have a great deal of Charity in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the <hi>Intentio Operantis;</hi> yet it is not so easie to pass a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Judgment on the <hi>Intentio Operis;</hi> but he endeavoureth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
his Vindication in this, where I shall attend him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. His professed Design in preaching that Sermon, was
only his just apprehension, <hi>That the Destruction of the Church of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<hi>under a pretence of Zeal against</hi> Popery, <hi>was one of the likeliest
Means to bring it <hi>[Popery]</hi> in.</hi> Here he supposeth, (if I understand
what he saith) that the Protestant Dissenters <hi>aim</hi> at the destruction
of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> or at least, that Non-conformity tendeth
to destroy it, than which no imagination can be more groundless;
nor can I conceive what should give cause to such a thought, unless
it be an extravagant Idea, that some men frame to themselves of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as if her Essence consisted in the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and the removing of these were the destruction of the Church:
We, <hi>who Dissent from that</hi> which they call the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are
far from such low and dishonourable thoughts of Her; we look on
her as a Reformed part of the Church of God, professing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion, in opposition to the Errours of <hi>Popery,</hi> but mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this True Religion with some humane Ceremonies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we think, that opposing of these Ceremonies is <hi>so far</hi> from
tending to the Destruction of the Church, that it conduceth much
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95366:10"/>
to reforming of Her: But suppose the Ceremonies were good and
lawful things, it is still a strange Notion, and inconsistent with the
Sentiments concerning them, that our Brethren do profess, that
they are <hi>indifferent</hi> things, and of no necessity: If they <hi>be so</hi> what
hazard is there of the destruction of the Church, from their being laid
aside? If the Non-conformists had their wish, it would inferr no
other Alteration in the Church, but the removal of such Accidents,
which the A betters of them do, say, That <hi>possunt adesse vel abesse sine
subjecti interitu;</hi> such Incoherences would not have been expected from
so Learned a Pen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. It is also unfairly (to say no worse) hinted, That Non-conformists
Zeal against Popery is but pretended, and that the real
Design is to destroy the <hi>Church of England;</hi> we can clear our selves
of both before a higher Bar, and therefore lay little weight on
such Suggestions; neither do we meerly dislike the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are <hi>Popish;</hi> he knoweth that we have other Arguments
against them; I hope <hi>Non-conformists</hi> shew their Zeal against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
in other things: Nor do we desire the <hi>Destruction of the Church,</hi>
that these Ceremonies may fall to the Ground, but the removing of
the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> may be more acceptable to him, who
can make her stand in despight of the Gates of Hell. If he charge
us with the Church's Ruin, because our <hi>Divisions</hi> about the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
may tend to it: For answer; Let it be considered, who giveth
culpably the <hi>Rise</hi> to these <hi>Divisions,</hi> Whether they who forbear the
Ceremonies, because Sinful; or, they who do violently impose
them, tho' Indifferent, in their Apprehension: But this will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
fall to be further discoursed. I deny not, that Papists design
the Ruin of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but not as <hi>Ceremonious,</hi> but as
<hi>Protestant;</hi> they do not design to destroy Her by removing what
the Non-conformists scruple, but by taking away what they agree
with Her in: And therefore there is no Cause to think, that the
removing of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> (which Non-conformists desire) though
under a pretence of Zeal against Popery, or under whatever other
pretence, should be one of the likeliest means to bring it in; which
our Author feareth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. The Learned Dr. hath caught this Notion, That <hi>Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,</hi>
by their Zeal against Popery, are like to be Instruments of
bringing it in; and he seemeth to be very fond of this fine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit;
runneth away with it at a great rate; is confirmed in it
from the proceedings of Papists, <hi>(p. 2.)</hi> starteth a Paradox, <hi>(p. 3.)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95366:10"/>
As it seemeth to unthinking People,</hi> (like the <hi>Non-conformists) that when
Papists <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> appear no longer in that Work, others out of meer Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Popery, should carry it on for them; and these unthinking people
are carried away with meer no se and pretences, and hope those will secure
them most against the Fears of Popery, who talk with most passion, and
with least understanding against is;</hi> and more to this purpose. One may
think it little Glory for the highly Learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in refuting such a contemptible Adversary, as he here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth:
But their Wisdom, and Learning, and Reasons for what
they hold, will (I hope) find more Equitable, and less Supercilious
Judges in the world; neither will Hectoring stop their Mouths,
though they are ready to be silent to plain Scripture or solid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
He judgeth <hi>(p. 3, 4.) That East and West may meet, and the
most furious Antagonists</hi> (of <hi>Popery) <hi>may become of the easiest
Converts: Deus avertat omen.</hi>
               </hi> If we may form any Conjecture of
what may be, from the Observation of what hath been, <hi>easie
Conversion to Popery</hi> is liker to be found among his own party, who
are tame and gentle towards Popery, and no way <hi>furious.</hi> And if
any be <hi>furious</hi> against it, let them bear their blame. We applaud
and practise <hi>Rational Zeal</hi> against it, but not <hi>Fury,</hi> for <hi>The Wrath
of Man worketh not the Righteousness of God.</hi> He cannot get out of
this fear concerning many Thousand zealous Protestants: I deny
not, but there is cause of Fear; for many have got sound Principles
in their Heads, without saving Grace in their Hearts; and the
Knowledge and Fortitude of most is very weak, and the best have
Cause to fear themselves, and look to him who is able to make
them stand; but I hope all the Ground of Fear is not on our
side.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. But now the Learned Author cometh closer to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
<hi>viz.</hi> To lay down Grounds of his Opinion, that he is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in, That the principles and practice of Non-conformists do
tend to re-introduce <hi>Popery</hi> among us; one is, <hi>That they mistake
what Popery is, being as much afraid of an innocent Ceremony, and of
the Cross, as of real Idolatry: and of Kneeling, as of Adoring the Host.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Dr. might have known, that the learned Labours
of some Non-conformists against Popery, do sufficiently testifie, that
they are not ignorant what it is. 2. We generally know, that the
Ceremonies are not Popery, but lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k on them as a part of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but are far from equalling them with some other parts of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
that are far <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>re grosly evil. 3. We never counted even
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95366:11"/>
the <hi>nocent</hi> Ceremonies used in <hi>England</hi> (for <hi>innocent</hi> Ceremonies,
we know none but those of God's Institution) so bad as real Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
nor Crossing and Kneeling, so bad as worshipping Images, tho'
we count both sinful, and dare practise neither: Therefore if we
should come to see our Mistake in the one Case (which we expect
not) yet there is no Ground for the Consequence of this alledged
by him, <hi>viz.</hi> That we should suspect our selves deceived in the other
also, unless he would say that every Discovery of a Mistake that
Men make about the smallest matters in Religion, will shake the
very Foundation of their Faith; which I hope he will be very far
from asserting, left they that have read his <hi>Irenicum</hi> in former
years, and now read his Sermon, and this Defence of it, should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
that which Good Men will be far from imputing to a person of
his worth, especially when he doth not deny, but rather own a
Change in some things now debated, <hi>p.</hi> 72. of the Preface.</p>
            <p>Sect. 8. <hi>It looketh like another Ground, that Non-conformists
serve the Designs of Papists, that</hi> When they find the undoubted Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Ancient Church condemned as Popish and Antichristian, by
their Teachers, they must conclude Popery to be of much greater Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
than really it is, and when they can trace it so very near the Apostles
Times, they will soon believe it setled by the Apostles themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Here is still a confounding of something that is Popish with
Popery, a part taken for the whole, an Accident, without which
Popery can well consist, and which doth subsist without Popery,
with the body and substance of Popery. He looketh on his Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonists
(according to his wonted Esteem of them) as very mean
Logicians, when he will have them conclude the Antiquity of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
in those things that he and we do jointly dislike it in, from the
Antiquity of some Rites that were used under that Apostasie, and
which we have continued among us under the Reformatiom. 2. It
were still as bad a Consequence from our traceing some things near
to the Apostles times, to inferr that they were setled by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:
For we can make it appear, that not only soon after the
Apostles times, but in their times, some things were in the Church
that they did not setle; as the Love-Feasts, which they reproved
and abolished after that abuse of them was observed. 3. To call those
things that Non-conformists Scruple, <hi>(Viz.)</hi> The Ceremonies, the
undoubted practices of the Ancient Church which may be traced
near to the Apostles times, is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> a bold begging of
the question: the proof of it we expect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95366:11"/>
               <hi>Sect. 9. It will, saith he, (P. 5.) be very hard to perswade considering
men, that the Christian Church should degenerate so soon, so Vnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
and so Vniversally, as it must do, if Episcopacy and the use of
Significant Ceremonies were any parts of the Apostasie.</hi> Here is still the
great Antiquity of these things taken for granted but not proved.
But further, his <hi>Considering men,</hi> if they read and <hi>consider</hi> the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
will easily be perswaded that a Church may very early and
quickly degenerate, and that <hi>Vnanimously</hi> and <hi>Vniversally;</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in some things that are of lesser concern in Religion. How
suddenly did the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> degenerate, and <hi>Aaron</hi> with them,
when <hi>Moses</hi> was but 40 days absent in the Mount, &amp; that in matters
of higher moment than what we contend about; even worshiping
a Calf for God? see <hi>Ex.</hi> 32. 1. and particularly <hi>Vers.</hi> 8. And the
Lord foretold to <hi>Moses</hi> their after Apostasies, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 16. And
<hi>Moses</hi> took notice of their Apostasies while he was yet with them,
and how soon they would break out after his departure, 27. 29.
How <hi>Quickly, Vnanimously,</hi> and <hi>Vniversally</hi> did the ten Tribes apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statize
after <hi>Solomon</hi>'s decease? And is not the whole History of
the Church of <hi>Judah</hi> under her Kings, a witness of this? When ever
a bad King arose, presently the pure Worship of God was turned
to Idolatry. In the days of <hi>Joash,</hi> as soon as <hi>Jehojada</hi> was gone, how
quickly did a Faction, with a Complement to the King, turn the
whole Nation to Idolatry? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 17, 18. These Apostasies
were in higher points than we now speak of; and yet, How quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did the Church thus degenerate? And that this should not be
thought strange, even in the Gospel-Church we may see, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what Christ telleth us, of the <hi>Tares sown while men sleep,</hi>
and growing up insensibly, and without Observation: Also the dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy
that the Church fell into, even while the Apostles were alive,
and <hi>faithfully</hi> watching over her; and that, both in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and
<hi>Practice,</hi> is evident in the Errours in <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia;</hi> in the
Abuses in publick Administrations at <hi>Corinth,</hi> insomuch as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
behoved, even in his own time, to make a Reformation, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back to Apostolick Example, and the Law of Nature, for
reforming some Indecencies among them; and to Divine Institution,
for reforming their Enormities, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. 20. 23. If these evils
crept in under the Inspection of the Apostles, What wonder is it
if Men afterwards began in some things to deviate in Church-pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice?</p>

work, v.</hi> 7. This Allegation the learned Dr. putteth off with a
Scoff, <hi>p.</hi> 17. but we must not therefore part with it. It is evident,
that there was then a tendency among some of the Members of the
Christian Church to several of these Evils, which being grown
up to Maturity of Wickedness, Antichristianism was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
made up; not to speak of the gross Heresies that then were,
and others that were foretold, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 29, 30. The Ambition of
<hi>Diotrephes</hi> was a fermenting toward Lordly Prelacy, 3 <hi>Joh. ver.</hi> 9. So
was the Idolizing of some Ministers among the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor.</hi>
3. 4. So the turning aside to the Jewish Ceremonies, a carnal, gawdy
sort of Religion, not contented with the simplicity of Gospel-Worship,
for which the <hi>Galatians</hi> are reproved, <hi>Gal. 4. 9. The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of Angels, voluntary Humility, subjection to Ordinances, touch
not, taste not, handle not, Will-Worship, Col. 2. 18. Forbidding of Meats
and Marriage, 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 3. and in a word, the turning the Spiritual
Religion of GOD into a Carnal outward Shew. All these, I say, was
a working toward the vile Superstitions that afterward grew up
under the Antichristian Apostasy, of which our Ceremonies are
some Remains. Now, if there was such a secret working of such
Evils in that time, is it any wonder that some unallowable practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
should be in the Church, soon after the Apostles, and be little
taken notice of?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. And this is yet less to be wondred at, if we consider the
defects and uncertainty of the History of the Church in Times next

the Law, which the Jews call <gap reason="foreign">

of the want of the Light of History. It was little better
with the Christian Church at first. We have very little distinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of her Order; and what we have, is but in some things, not
so full as to enable us to pass a Judgment with Confidence of all
their Practices in Church-Administrations: It is no good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there is no mention of Dissent from, or Non-conformity to
the Church-practices of the First Times; <hi>

considering that the Writers of those Times (who were glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Lights, yet Men, and subject to mistakes and passions) would
not readily give account of what might make against their own
practices. And it can be made appear, that the best of the Church
Guides, after the Apostles, were in mistakes greater than what we

now scruple at: But the early Degeneracy of the Christian
Church (which our Author thinks it so absurd to imagine) is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed
by the most ancient History, and nearest to these Times. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,

used in the Church, how early there was a degeneracy in these,
out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who lived in the second Century, <hi>Epist. ad Victor.

evident, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> imputeth such negligence and unskilfulness
even to the First Age, and nearest to the Apostles, if not in the days
of some of them, as made them fall from Christs Institution in some
things. The consideration of all which maketh me wonder at the
Confidence of the learned Author, who saith, that <hi>So sudden and
insensible a Change of the Church is so incredible, that they that think it
could be, may on the same Grounds believe that other parts of Popery did
as soon prevail.</hi> That this Change did soon prevail, we believe not,
but that it might, we see no Absurdity in it; and for other parts of
Popery, we can tell when most of them begun, and therefore are
not obliged from the Antiquity of one part of it, to acknowledge
the same of another; neither is there any Inconveniency in asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that these Mistakes crept in insensibly. Seeing the Apostle
speaketh of them as a Mystery that was long working, before it
came above-board. What he saith of humane Policies keeping long
to their first Institution, maketh little to his purpose, both because
the contrary is most frequently observed; they often degenerate,
and that unobserved by the Vulgar, through the Cunning of States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and because corrupt Nature is not so apt to deviate from
Humane Constitutions, as from those that are Divine. Few Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Frames have been so often, and quickly, and easily changed, as
the Religious Worship of the Jews was, in the time of the Judges
and Kings. I hope by this time it will appear, that the Principles
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95366:13"/>
of the <hi>Church's Enemies</hi> (so he falsly calleth the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> who
are no Enemies to the Church, but to her humane Ceremonies)
bringeth no such mighty prejudice on the Cause of the Reformation,
as he with confidence inferreth from what he had discoursed; for
we neither own such Antiquity in the Ceremonies; nor, if we did,
would that inferr the Antiquity of Popery in its grosser parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. He again chargeth his Adversaries, that <hi>They must forgo
the Testimony of Antiquity, and that by so doing they run into insuperable
Difficulties in dealing with the Papists, which his Principles do lead
through; for they can justly charge Popery as Innovation.</hi> And to that
purpose citeth Bishop <hi>Sanderson (p. 6.)</hi> In answer to him and the
Bishop too, We say, 1. That we do not forgo the Testimony of
Antiquity; though we do not Idolize it, as some do; we will not
be conclud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but take its help to search into the Mind of God revealed in
His Word: Its greatest Admirers must needs forgo it sometimes,
both Papists and Prelatists; and the ancient Authors themselves do
not seldom disown all Authority in them or any men to determine
in the Controversies of Religion: But I shall not digress into this
Debate, What Weight is to be laid on Antiquity; it is enough at
present that we deny, and our Adversaries have not proved (nor
shall they ever be able to prove) that Bishops and Ceremonies are
so ancient as they affirm them to be; what Instances he intendeth,
or can give from his present Adversaries, (the Non-conformists)
<hi>that they maintain such principles as destroy the Justice and Equity of the
Reformation,</hi> I know not; when we meet with them, we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
them; mean while we profess our selves ready to disown all
Principles that can be made appear to be of that tendency.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s three ways how Non-conformists
promote Popery eventually, tho' not intentionally, which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth,
<hi>p.</hi> 7. are such as to unbyassed men will seen unworthy of
the learned Bishop to propose, or the learned Dr. to applaud; the
first is, <hi>By helping to pull down Episcopacy, at which,</hi> he saith, Rome <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced.</hi>
But, will any say that this Joy of <hi>Rome</hi> was because Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
is such an Enemy to Popery; when they have it as well as we,
and when it is not to be seen in any Protestant Church as in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland?</hi>
yea, I must say, Except in <hi>England.</hi> Is it not obvious, that
their Joy was for our Broils on that occasion, and not for the Ruin
of that which they love so well? Will any deny that <hi>Rome</hi> rejoiced
as much at the pulling down of Presbytery in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95366:13"/>
of its Settlement in <hi>England,</hi> for our Changes, Anarchy, and
Confusions are their Advantage? The Second is, <hi>Their opposing the
interest of</hi> Rome, <hi>with more Violence than Reason.</hi> The Third is,
<hi>Their frequent mistaking the Question, especially through the necessity of
some false Principles, which they will maintain, whatever come of the
common Cause of the Reformation.</hi> It is not easie to reply to these;
I shall only say, there is no Truth in what is here said, nor the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
becoming a Disputant, in saying of it, without any pretence
to proving it. Let not the Dr. think that the Bishop's <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> will
convince us; the Folly and Indiscretion that he is pleased next to
grieve us with the Imputation of, and to back again with the same
learned Bishop's Authority, <hi>(p. 8.)</hi> is another of his Arguments,
which we will not attempt to answer, save with the words of <hi>Psal.
123. 3, 4. Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us, for we are
exceedingly filled with contempt, our Soul is exceedingly filled with the
scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.</hi>
What he after mentioneth of the Popish Instruments, being for the
most violent courses, doth not concern us, who endure, but use no
Violence: Let them look to it, who with such Violence do press their
Brethren in things acknowledged Indifferent, which they think un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
and ruine them for not yielding. What Service this may
do to the Papists, who are such Lovers of <hi>Violent Courses,</hi> let the
World judge. The <hi>Jews,</hi> by indiscreet zeal, brought the <hi>Romans</hi>
on them, which they designed to shun: If he will prove our zeal
against Popery to be also indiscreet, we shall endure the parallel.
He cannot get that Notion out of his Head, <hi>(p. 9.)</hi> that was met
before, That Non-conformists attempt to overthrow the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church, because they are against the Ceremonies. What
Service this may do the Papists, may be considered: to make the
<hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> which, I suppose, doth constitute the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> have a Trifle (such an Indifferent Ceremony must be) for
such a part of her Constitution, as with it she is overturned, they
will be apt to inferr, that we reckon our Religion a Trifle. Let it
be considered, whether talking at this rate doth not look liker a
<hi>Transport,</hi> than what can be justly charged on the Non-conformists.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. Who doubteth but the Papists <hi>envy the Church of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
and <hi>wish her torn in pieces,</hi> and <hi>wish there were no Bishops in</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
and that <hi>they have endeavoured to destroy her Constitution and
Government?</hi> But what is all that to the purpose? Doth it hence
follow, that they who dislike her <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are doing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95366:14"/>
the same Work? The Tendency (much less the Designs) of Papists
and Non-conformists can never be drawn into one Channel, till he
prove, that it is the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
aim to destroy, and not the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> in it; and that
their spight at the <hi>English Bishops,</hi> is, not because they are <hi>Protestant
Bishops,</hi> but because they are Bishops. It may, with as much shew
of Reason, be said, That a Physician promoteth the design of his
Patient's Enemy, who aimeth to kill him, whereas the Physician's
Work is, to remove his Disease; both would have the Man what
he is not, but there is no Concurrence between them, either in their
intention or tendency of their Work. What followeth doth as
little prove his point, as I shall shew by brief Answers to his Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<hi>Did not</hi> Cranmer, Ridley, <hi>&amp;c. suffer Martyrdom by their</hi> (the
Papists) <hi>means? Ans.</hi> Yes, but not because <hi>Bishops,</hi> but as <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.
Did not they own the same Episcopacy which is now among us,
and which men by Book upon Book seek to destroy? (p. 10.) Ans.</hi> That
maybe a Question, but I now suppose they did: these worthy Servants
of God had Reformed much, but left this Unreformed; they did
worthily in their Generation, yet as men who are Imperfect, we
may rather wonder, that in that time of Darkness, which they had
been born in, and under the prejudices of their Education, they
discovered so much of Errour, than that they in that Crowd of
Corruptions that they had to purge out, over-looked this.</p>

<hi>Is all this</hi> (writing against Bishops and Ceremonies) <hi>done for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Reformation? Is this the way to preserve the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
among us, to fill mens minds with such prejudices against the first

                  </gap>ment of it, and to make the World believe, that the Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

that our Martyr-Bishops exercised an unlawful Authority over Diocesan
Churches? But wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ther will Mens indiscreet Zeal carry them?</hi> Here's
a Tragical Outcry, as if Non-conformists went about to destroy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
because they are not for <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> What a
strange unaccountable fondness have these Men for their <hi>Diana,</hi>
who talk at this rate! If this Discourse have any Nerves, it will at
once condemn all these, as the worst Enemies that true Religion
hath, who have found any fault in a Reformed Church, as if it
were a thing impossible, that a <hi>True Reformation</hi> should be an <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Reformation.</hi> But thus it is with Men who have left Scripture-Guidance,
and become fond of Humane Authority in Religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95366:14"/>
We honour the Reformers, but do not Idolize their Persons;
where they follow Scripture, we follow them, (and the Apostle requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
no more of his Followers, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 1.)</hi> but where they recede
from the Rule we must needs Dissent.</p>

Adversaries, if we consider that the <hi>English</hi> is not the only <hi>Imperfect
Reformation,</hi> that hath been in the World, and that what our
Author here alledgeth, would equally justifie all their defects, and
condemn all Endeavours after further nearness to Primitive Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<hi>Church</hi> in all her practices, he largely insisteth on afterward, and
there it is to be considered whether it was so, or not; and if o, what
is our Concern in it. He telleth a long Story of <hi>Jesuits</hi> imployed
under the Disguise of <hi>more zealous Trotestants,</hi> to oppose the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,

dispute; for it hath alwaies been the way of that active party to
endeavour the Dividing of them that are not of their Communion.
But, I know not what Blame that can reflect upon the <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi>
or their practices; I do not doubt, the same party had a hand
in the Divisions of <hi>Calvinists</hi> from <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and are willing to take
all occasions to divide, that they may ruin; but if the Lord turn
it to Good, and to their Disappointment, and if his Servants keep
his Way, while they part from the way of other Men, let the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi>

Let them who are the culpable Cause of the <hi>Divisions</hi> look to

out according to their wish. Now the <hi>Division</hi> hath its Rise from
the <hi>Impositions</hi> of one party that assume the Name of the <hi>Church,</hi> and
the <hi>Scruples</hi> of another party. If the <hi>Church</hi> impose that which is
lawful and necessary, and the other party scruple that, and so <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide;</hi>
in that case the <hi>Dissenters</hi> must bear the blame of the <hi>Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and are guilty of <hi>co-operating with the common Enemy, in ruining
the Protestant Religion:</hi> But if the <hi>Church,</hi> by Her <hi>Impositions,</hi> burden
the Consciences of Her Members with things that She counteth <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
(i. e.) Needless,</hi> and the <hi>Scruplers</hi> reckon as <hi>unlawful,</hi> and
have just ground so to do; then the blame of Separating, and of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Papists to ruin our Religion, lieth at the <hi>Church</hi>'s door;
wherefore all this might have been spared. Let the learned <hi>Dr.</hi>
soundly refute our Principles, and then cast what blame he will on
us; but till that be done, (which we expect not) let him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that was granted <hi>March, 1671-2.</hi> as <hi>being procured by the Papists.</hi>
If any <hi>Non-conformists</hi> had a hand in procuring <hi>Liberty</hi> (which I do
not believe) to them, I think their Brethren will disown them in that
Act. That <hi>Papists</hi> had a hand in it, is not improbable, both for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95366:17"/>
their own ease, and to make the <hi>Difference</hi> among <hi>Protestants</hi> the
more conspicuous: But was it fit, that we should forbear a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Duty because of their ill Design? We did not join in the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Church before that, but worshipped God after his own
<hi>Institution,</hi> without <hi>Humane Ceremonies:</hi> All the Change in our way
on that Occasion was, that what before we had done in corners, and
with hazard, then we did safely and openly; and, what fault was
in this? But, <hi>One saith, that the Presbyterians suspected the kindness,
and joined with the Conformists, like wise Men, and refused the Bait:</hi>
Who said so, or on what Ground, I know not; we went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the <hi>Conformists,</hi> than <hi>Conscience</hi> of Duty had made
us do before; but it had been a strange thing, if when <hi>Liberty</hi> was
granted us to worship God in his own way, we had then joined with
a <hi>Superstitious Worship,</hi> which we could not do before. If that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
mean, That <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were then willing to concurr with
the <hi>Conformists,</hi> as their Protestant Brethren, in all things lawful,
to disappoint the Designs of the common Enemy, we approve of
that <hi>Inclination,</hi> and think the Dr. cannot charge us with any thing
to the contrary in practice: Wherefore it is without all Reason,
that he dateth the <hi>Presbyterian Separation from that time,</hi> p. 23. Their
<hi>building Meeting-houses, and using Separate Meetings,</hi> p. 24. will not
prove it; for the one they did before, and the other was but a more
publick owning of what was their private practice, when under the
lash of the Persecution. Defending their practice by writing, is no
proof neither: If he can prove, that they do it <hi>on Principles that will
justifie any Separation,</hi> let them be blamed; but this, I suppose dropt
from his Pen without due consideration. That they chuse Ministers
one after another, is as little proof as the rest; how to judge I know
not, of what his <hi>credible Person</hi> informs him, <hi>Of ten Ministers coming
into one City.</hi> It is a hard Case, when Ministers put to great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
by the <hi>Five Mile Act,</hi> that it being suspended, they might not
live in Corporations for their Accommodation. Let the Author of
the <hi>Peaceable Design</hi> (cited p. 25.) answer for himself; I am sure,
such <hi>Non-conformists</hi> as I have conversed with, never approved of
the <hi>Tolerating of Papists.</hi>

had a hand in our <hi>Divisions</hi> (whoever denied it) in perswading the
unlawfulness of hearing the Conformists preach. Whoever broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
that Principle, it was never received among the more sober
and intelligent of the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> especially the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:95366:17"/>
it is their <hi>Corruptings of God's Ordinances,</hi> not their dispensing of
them, that we refuse to join with them in; and when we cannot join
in the one without the other, we must forbear both; which is by
a necessity from them, not our choice; but of this he will give fitter
occasion to speak afterward. What he citeth out of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
p. 28, 29. 30. tho' there be Expressions of the keen Spirit of that
learned Writer, which might have been a little softened, yet all
that he saith, proveth no more but this; From among the <hi>Non-conformists</hi>
have gone out some Sects, that by their unsound princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
have given advantage to the common Enemy, which we deny
not, but lament; but if this prove our way evil, and tending to
<hi>Popery,</hi> the same must be concluded against the <hi>Reformation from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
where the <hi>German Anabaptists</hi> sprung up; yea, <hi>Christianity</hi>
shall not escape, for did not <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> and other like Hereticks, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise

            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 25. The Dr. (p. 31.) triumphantly appealeth to any impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Reader, <hi>Who most serve the Popish Designs, those who keep to the
Constitution of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>or those who fell into the course of
separation.</hi> I hope the Judge that he constituteth, having conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his Allegations, and the Answers hitherto discoursed, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
us of all accession to <hi>Popish Designs;</hi> but if we should take as
much pains to retort the same blame on his party, as he hath done
to accuse us, it were easie to guess where the Sentence of <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
would fall; but I delight not in such unbrotherly work, and
there is the less need for it, that <hi>day unto day uttereth speech,</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the sidings of that party with the Enemies of our Religion:
That the Papists designed to force all to seek a general <hi>Toleration,</hi> is
not unlikely; but that <hi>Non-conformists</hi> did desire or seek it, is unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
insinuated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 26. When I consider what he writeth (p. 33, 34.) I see cause
to retort his own words on him, which he useth, p. 23. <hi>If such bold
and notorious untruths are published now, what account may we expect will
be given to Posterity of the passages of these Times?</hi> He doth represent
the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> very <hi>unfairly,</hi> if not very <hi>falsly;</hi> as that on the
Discovery of the Popish Plot, the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> seemed to be <hi>Like
men roused out of a deep sleep, amazed, confounded, fearful of every thing,
mistrusting all that were not in such a consternation as themselves.</hi> VVere
they not as vigilant and jealous over the Papists, as other Protestants
even before that time? Yea; who that will see, doth not know that
they exceeded their Neighbours in this; he hath forgotten what he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95366:18"/>
had before so often declaimed against them, That they pretended to
be the most zealous <hi>Protestants</hi> about their fear of Popery, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet
zeal against it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with which he besprinkles most of his
pages: But now, of a sudden, they are transformed into a sort of
Men asleep, having neither fear of, nor zeal against it. How doth
passion blind men? <hi>Impedit ira animum, &amp;c.</hi> Their fear and consterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the discovery of the Plot, is as groundlesly affirmed as their
sleep before it: No doubt, they were apprehensive of Danger, as all
the Protestant Nation were, and still are; but what Signs of such
Disorder was among them, he doth not say, because he could not;
therefore a general Accusation was more apt to calumniate them by.
But it may be (and it is beyond a may be) they fasted and prayed
more than some others did on this occasion, and that some reckon a
sign of Guilt and Fear, beyond what is to be found in good men.
Some (saith he) in this case pressed the Dissenters to study Union
among Protestants; But were they then, or ever, backward to it
on sinless terms? or, would they have had them abandon the light
of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

again chargeth the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> that <hi>Formerly they carried
smoothly towards the common and innocent Papists, as they stiled them, and
thought them equally capable of Toleration with themselves.</hi> It were
well done in the Dr. if he can make this appear against any one
<hi>Non-conformist;</hi> but if it be spoken with reference to them in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
nothing can be more <hi>calumnious.</hi> It is of the same stamp that
followeth, p. 34. <hi>Their trucking under-hand for Toleration with the
Papists; they represent,</hi> saith he, <hi>those of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
in Masquerade.</hi> Did ever any <hi>Non-conformist</hi> talk at this rate
of <hi>Conformists</hi> in general, as he would have his Readers believe? And
if it have been said of some, and those of no mean degree in the
Church, time partly hath tried, and it is like, will further try the
truth of it; I commend his Humanity, and being free of undue heat
against the Papists, on occassion of that <hi>horrid Plot.</hi> If there was <hi>due
heat,</hi> we require no more; but he doth most injuriously charge us
with rage and fierceness in that case: I know not, that the wise and
sober among the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> (if he will let it be said, that there
be any such among them) did exceed due bounds of the zeal of God
against such a party of his Enemies. He next fighteth with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Censures that then passed on many of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> which we
are not concerned in. I wish him to consider, that as sometimes <hi>vox
populi</hi> is <hi>vox diaboli,</hi> so also not seldom it is <hi>vox Dei.</hi>

taunteth as high pretenders to, and self-applauders in wisdom and
self-denial) <hi>would in so critical a Time have joined with them against
the common Enemy, or let them know their Sense of the present state of
things.</hi> Except in their <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> were never
backward to join with them, and much less at that time; for letting
the <hi>Church-men</hi> know their sense of things, I know not what occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they had for that, except in their Sermons, in which they were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
and faithful against Popery, as their Brethren were. He next
falleth heavily on the <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> and <hi>true and only way of Concord,</hi>
as most <hi>Vnseasonable</hi> and <hi>Divisive</hi> pieces. The Author of these
Books is of age and ability to answer for himself, and yet living
and writing: I need say nothing for him, only this I make bold to
say, abating the vehemency of the stile, and forwardness of that
learned man's <hi>genius,</hi> which sometimes run into over-lashes, that
another cannot so well defend as himself; for the substance of the
Books, let the Dr. try it when he will, he may possibly find it a hard-enough
Task to deal with them. What that Author saith in the
name of the whole party, (which the Dr. taketh advantage from,
p. 37.) doth not oblige the party further than they see Cause to
own it.</p>

the occasion and Design of his <hi>Sermon,</hi> which was answered by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Hands, and in defence of which, this Book now under our
consideration was written: I shall concern my self little about it,
being ready to give all possible Charity to the design of so worthy a
person, in undertaking and managing that Affair. I shall consider
what is said on this occasion, no further than shall be needful to the
defence I now manage of our present way. It is most injur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ous that
he asserteth, that (by such Books as he had mentioned) <hi>the zeal of
many was turned off from the Papists against those of the Church.</hi> Is
there any thing in these Books that favoureth Papists? or any thing
that maketh the Church of <hi>England</hi> worse than that of <hi>Rome?</hi> If
withdrawing from the Corruptions of the Church be defended, this
hath no tendency to lessen Zeal against Papists. He that complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
of hard usage, (tho' without cause) should not so retaliate, as
to call his Brethren, who differ from him, and give reasons for their
so doing, <hi>an enraged, but unprovoked company of Men.</hi> This, and
much of that nature, we resolve patiently to bear. He must give us
leave to deny what he imputeth to our way, p. 40. That <hi>It is a great,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95366:19"/>
dangerous, and unaccountable Separation:</hi> If his Arguments against it
prove as hard as his Words, it will not be easie to stand before him;
if this be to <hi>touch us with a soft and gentle hand,</hi> as, <hi>ibidem,</hi> what
will his severities prove? Sure he hath forgot himself, when with
the same breath he calleth us <hi>peevish and partial men,</hi> and saith, <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 29. The <hi>Vnseasonableness</hi> of this <hi>make-bate Sermon</hi> is object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which he attempteth to disprove with a Flood of Words, all
built on this Foundation; <hi>That the Church was reviled, run down
by a popular Fury, &amp;c.</hi> This is the usual respect the learned Dr. is
pleased to treat his <hi>Antagonists</hi> with. Other men think, that a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Dissent and with-holding Communion in unlawful things,</hi> backed
with solid Reasons given for so doing, was all that the <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi>
were guilty of; and that, that needed not give such an <hi>Alarm</hi>
as if there had been <hi>a Design to ruin the Church,</hi> as he
fansieth; and unbyassed men will think, that such a Sermon, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
chosen to be preached before the Magistrate, rather than before
his Ordinary Hearers, doth not savour so much of a design to guard
the Consciences of the People against <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> as of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Design; what that was, may be easily guessed at, for all that is
said to the contrary. I speak now of the <hi>Tendency of the thing,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than of the <hi>Intention of the person;</hi> but I rather chuse to wave
this matter than contend about it, being more concern'd about the
Truth of what was said, than the Season of Saying it. I shall be as
little concerned about the sharpness and severity of his <hi>Sermon,</hi>
which is the other Objection that he answereth from p. 44. though
I am sure, what I have already noted in this Preface, sheweth, that
such a way of treating Dissenters is not <hi>ab hoc homine alienum;</hi> but
I must do him that right, as to acknowledge, that there is more
mildness expressed in the <hi>Sermon</hi> than here, he being galled by the
pungent Reasons of his Answerers; yet there wants not some <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>
in the <hi>Ink</hi> that the <hi>Sermon</hi> was written with; but, I confess, that
is so common a fault among imperfect men, that we must say, <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am

he thinketh the blame of it is on our part, I judge it but conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
to that Opinion that he exposed it, (and us by reason of it)
with all its Aggravations; and if we cannot clear our selves in this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95366:19"/>
matter, let us lie under as much blame as he can load us with. But
withal, I hope he will remember, that if the <hi>Schism</hi> be caused by the
fault of his party, all the sad imports of his excellent Discourse will
return on his own Head, and those of his way: Wherefore I wish
all this had been waved, and the merits of the Cause only minded.</p>

with (to wit) that he saith (p. 49.) <hi>The most godly People among them
can least endure to be told of their faults;</hi> is, as I think, not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vindicated, by saying, that <hi>He meant it of them who will not hear
their own Teachers telling them of the sin of Separation;</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth;
for they that are so unteachable, are not the most godly
of the <hi>Non-conformists:</hi> I hope there are among them who can hear
Sin of whatever sort charged on them, and soberly consider what is
said; and if on Enquiry they be convinced of a fault, will humble
themselves, and confess, if not, will soberly clear their Innocency
by Reasons. Far less is it a fit Vindication of this Assertion, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
what he had said to Dr. <hi>O.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Mr. <hi>A.</hi> and the rest of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerers
of his Sermon. I hope he doth not think that Defence of
Truth, or of that which one is convinced to be such, is alwaies the
Sin of not enduring to be told of faults: Neither do I by so saying
<hi>referr the determining of our Debates to mens Fancies,</hi> which he hinteth,
p. 47. that we call the <hi>Dictates of Conscience</hi> (I am sorry that he doth
either so undervalue Conscience, or reflect on the worthy Persons
that answered his Sermon.) If we cannot shew plain and evident
<hi>Reasons</hi> for what we say, (as he requireth) we refuse not <hi>causa ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere.</hi>

of his Sermon, of the mimick Gestures of the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> when
it was spoken of; the Truth of which History, tho' I doubt, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
disprove. It neither was worth his writing, nor my confuting.
He thinketh <hi>it lay at bottom of many mens Stomachs, that he did not
perswade the Church of</hi> England <hi>to the Dissenters.</hi> Who did ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
that? We pretend to no Authority over Her; if she would
have condescended to us for Peace sake (which that Party talk so
much of) to forbear imposing her unnecessary things, which we
judge unlawful, that should have satisfied us. But he thinks (p. 53.)
<hi>it had been unseasonable to speak of Alteration of Laws before Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
who are tied to the Laws; that such Alteration is one of the
weightiest things.</hi> Ans. <hi>Supposing</hi> (as he there saith) <hi>his private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for Abatements,</hi> there was no need of proposing the Alteration
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95366:20"/>
of Established Laws; but the exposing of them that were under the
lash of Inconvenient Laws, may well be forborn, before the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of these Laws, by a man that thinketh that Abatement should
be made of the rigour of these Laws; I do not think (as he doth)
that <hi>the alteration of every Established Law is a Matter of such weight
as any thing that can be taken into consideration,</hi> provided the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
about it be by such as have Power to alter it: What is more
common than altering of Laws when they are found inconvenient?
Our first Reformers thought not so under <hi>Edward</hi> 6. The <hi>Liturgy</hi>
(and the Law for it) was altered when excepted against by Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
abroad, and some Zealots (so the Historian speaks) at home,
<hi>Full. Chur. Hist. 6, 7. p.</hi> 386. Why may not this be done now, when
Dissatis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>action is become more universal? But it is a supposition
that I can give no account of, that the Laws against <hi>Non-conformity</hi>
(for of these his Discourse must be understood, if it be at all to the
purpose) should be so looked on, as that they concern the <hi>preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church and Religion:</hi> That Church and Religion must
stand on a tottering Foundation, that cannot be preserved, if those
things be laid aside which are acknowledged to be indifferent. But
thus it is to dote on <hi>Mens Inventions;</hi> it is ordinary to equal, if not
preferr them, to <hi>Christ's Institution, Mark 7. 13. Mat. 15. 6. Qui
amat ranam, ranam putat esse Dianam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 32. But the Dr. is not content, not to advise the altering of
these Laws, where it had not been very pertinent to propose it, but
he bringeth Reasons able (as he thinketh) to preponderate all the
Considerations that any might use for changing them; these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are in number Six; the 1. is, <hi>The Impossibility of satisfying all
Dissenters.</hi> Must therefore none be satisfied, because all cannot?
Some will be satisfied, if you will but forbear imposing what God
hath not commanded: Others will not be satisfied, unless you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
also some of <hi>Christ's Institutions,</hi> such as <hi>Infant Baptism;</hi> is it
reason to neglect the doing the one of these for Peace and Unity,
because you cannot do the other? The 2. is, <hi>The Vncertainty of
gaining any considerable number by Relaxations.</hi> If any man look on
this as uncertain, it must be either because he knoweth not what we
scruple at or because he thinketh us resolved to dissent without
reason, when the reason of our Dissent is removed; but, I hope the
Dr. is neither so ignorant, nor so uncharitable: He may be well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
that by relaxing the <hi>Imposition</hi> of humane Ceremonies, all
the Presbyterians shall be gained to join in worshipping of God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95366:20"/>
with the <hi>present Church;</hi> and I hope he will not say, that they are
no considerable number in <hi>England.</hi> His 3. Reason is, <hi>The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of keeping Factions out of the Church, considering the ungovernableness
of some mens Tempers and Principles. Answ.</hi> If the Discipline that
<hi>Christ</hi> hath instituted be duly exercised in the <hi>Church,</hi> that will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make men governable, yea, actually govern them; or it will
exclude them out of the <hi>Church,</hi> and so Factions shall cease in the
<hi>Church:</hi> But it is a strange piece of <hi>Ecclesiastical Policy,</hi> on suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
that some will prove <hi>ungovernable,</hi> to obtain the making of
Civil Laws for imposing those things on mens Consciences, which
the Imposers count <hi>need nots,</hi> and they on whom they are imposed,
know them to be unlawful. This is the way to make them ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable
(in reference to these particular <hi>Impositions)</hi> who would
tamely submit to any Yoke that is not contrary to that of <hi>Christ.</hi>
But it seems the Dr. looketh on all that scruple at human Ceremonies
as ungovernable Persons: And we rationally think, that his Party
are resolved, that we shall either be governed by their Will, (not by
the Word of God) or they will take the most effectual ways that
they can to keep us out of their <hi>Church.</hi> I confess, <hi>Conscience</hi> is an
<hi>ungovernable</hi> thing, except by the Laws of <hi>Christ;</hi> but it is much the
Strain of some of his Party, (I am confident the Reverend Dr. doth
not mean so ill) to ridicule and cry down Conscience in private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that they may be <hi>governed</hi> by the <hi>publick Conscience,</hi> (a <hi>Soloe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism</hi>
in Divinity, never heard of before) <hi>i.e. The Will of the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours;</hi>
the thing, to wit, <hi>Blind Obedience,</hi> is an old <hi>Popish</hi> Tool, to
enslave <hi>Consciences;</hi> but such an express affronting of Conscience,
(God's Deputy in the Soul) is a new Invention that this Age is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 33. His 4. Reason is, <hi>The danger of breaking all in pieces by a
Toleration.</hi> Ans. <hi>Toleration</hi> is both commanded in Scripture, <hi>Rom.
14. 1. Eph.</hi> 4. 2, 3. In this last place it is joined with endeavouring
after Unity, so far is it from being the way to break all in pieces, as
the Dr. thinketh. It is also condemned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2, 20. wherefore it
should not have been so generally censured, as a <hi>Church-ruining thing.</hi>
Beside, <hi>Toleration</hi> is not that which we plead for in the first place,
but that the things that grieve our Consciences may be removed,
that so we may join with you in worshipping God in his own way,
that we may need no <hi>Toleration;</hi> but if that cannot be obtained,
our next desire is, that we may be suffered to worship God in that
way that is acceptable to him by our selves, when we cannot do it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95366:21"/>
with you; neither is it a <hi>vast and universal Toleration of all Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
Heresies, and Vnpeaceableness,</hi> that we contend for, but a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
of such as live peaceable in their Dissent from you in the
smaller Concerns of Religion. This <hi>Toleration</hi> would break nothing
in pieces, but the denying of it tendeth to break all in pieces: For
while Men have the use of their <hi>Conscience,</hi> they will <hi>Dissent,</hi> and
serve God in the way that they apprehend pleaseth him, without
mens leave, when they cannot do it with their leave. It is a great
mistake to think that Unity among Christians lieth only or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Vniformity,</hi> and not rather in <hi>Consent,</hi> in the main points of
Religion, and loving <hi>forbearance</hi> in reference to the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 34. The 5. is, <hi>The exposing our selves to the Papists and others,
by receding too far from the first principles and frame of our Reformation.</hi>
This is plain enough; yet without wronging the scope or sence, it
might have been thus expressed more openly, <hi>We are ashamed to mend,
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st Men should think that we once were wrong.</hi> This Reason, if it
prove any thing, will conclude against all <hi>Reformations:</hi> Might it
not have been pleaded against the abolishing the high places in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s,
<hi>Azariah</hi>'s, and <hi>Josiah</hi>'s time; (of which before?) This will
expose us to <hi>Baal-</hi> Worshippers, as too far receding from the first
Principles of our Reformation: Might not the same have been in
K. <hi>Edward</hi> 6's time, and in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, in the one of which
somewhat was mended that was defective in the Reformation by
<hi>Hen.</hi> 8. And in the other <hi>Praying for the Dead,</hi> and some other things
were laid aside, that had been under <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. It is beyond
my capacity to understand how this could expose you to the Papists
or any other; what could they say, but that some of their <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions</hi>
were at first over-lookt, which now you see the Evil of, and
think fit to remove them? What advantage could they make of all
this against the Church of <hi>England?</hi> It will be hard to convince
those of mistake, who think, that cleaving to these Ceremonies doth
more <hi>expose the Church</hi> to the <hi>Papists,</hi> and give them hope of their
thinking at last of returning to them, when they see how loath they
are to go too far from them. This Principle seemeth to make what
we have done, or the <hi>first Frame of the Reformation,</hi> the Rule of the
<hi>Reformation,</hi> rather than the Word of God: Neither can the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aside of humane Ceremonies be rationally esteemed a receding
very far from the <hi>Frame and first Principles of the Reformation,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are of so inconsiderable moment, and next to nothing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the weighty points of Truth that we gained by the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95366:21"/>
               <hi>Reformation.</hi> It is known to them, who have lookt into the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> that this very principle put an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Bar to all <hi>Reformation</hi> in the Papacy, that was so much desired, and
stickled for by some. His <hi>sixth</hi> Reason is, <hi>The difficulty of keeping out
priests,</hi> pretending to be allowed Dissenters: This reason is near of
Kin to that which <hi>papists</hi> use against Peoples reading Scripture;
The difficulty of keeping men from catching <hi>Heresy</hi> by it: If the
Dr. here suppose the Dissenters to be well affected to the Priests, and
willing to have their Company; or so unskilful, that they cannot
discern a Priest's Droctrine, from that of a <hi>Protestant;</hi> or to admit
Ministers among them, to the Discharge of that office, without Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and Testimonials: Or, if he suppose, that when men are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by Law, to Worship God without Ceremonies; that the Law
is so laid asleep, that men may do what they list: If, I say, all
these things be supposed, this Reason may seem to have some weight,
but without such a supposition, it is lighter than Chaff, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Pen of the learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 35. I perceive the Dr. cannot get that fancy out of his
Head, That <hi>the strength and union of the National Setlement dependeth
on continuing of the present Impositions, and that they are necessary to keep
out Popery.</hi> Enough hath been already said, to lay open the fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this Imagination, and its inconsistency with what Sentiments
about the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> themselves do on other occasions declare,
when it serveth a turn. After some indecent contempt of Mr. <hi>A.</hi> in
reference to what he had said of the Dr's <hi>Sermon,</hi> he distinguisheth
(p. 55.) between <hi>Lay-Communion</hi> and <hi>Ministerial Conformity,</hi> that he
meddleth with the former, not the latter, his reason is, If the
People thought themselves bound to do what is their Duty towards
Communion with the <hi>Church,</hi> many Ministers would change their
Mind. I contract, but not misrepresent what he saith. To this I
return two things, 1. Why <hi>Ministerial Conformity</hi> should not be
taken into consideration in such a Discourse, is not easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood:
But that we may see the Dr. hath a mind not only to make
a distinction but a difference between <hi>Non-conformist</hi> Ministers and
their People, according to the Maxime, <hi>Divide &amp; impera.</hi> If all the
People might lawfully conform, and the Ministers also could submit
to what he calleth <hi>Lay-Communion,</hi> is no regard to he had to the
many <hi>Hundreds</hi> (not to say <hi>Thousands)</hi> of ministers, many of them
<hi>Eminent,</hi> and most, if not all of them, <hi>compleatly fitted</hi> for the Work
of the Gospel, and who have God's and His <hi>Church</hi>'s Call to that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95366:22"/>
Work? Is there no Consideration to be used by the <hi>Church,</hi> how
the Labours of all these may not be lost, while the Harvest is great,
and the Labourers few? (unless it be thought, that the Case is not
so now) and, Shall they all be rendered useless, rather than the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Subscription and Assent to what is confessedly not instituted
before born? Doth this savour of that Regard to Souls, and of
that love of Peace and Unity that our Brethren make such a noise
with, when it suiteth their purpose? Tho' they think us no <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
for want of <hi>Episcopal Ordination,</hi> yet we cannot think so of our
selves; and that one Principle sheweth them the greatest <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
that are among <hi>Protestants;</hi> for by it they unchurch most, if
not all the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> and unminister all their Pastours and
nullifie <hi>Baptism</hi> and all the other Ordinances that are among them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 36. The other thing that I reply to this distinction of the
Dr's is, That we have such rational and well-grounded Scruples
even against <hi>Lay-Communion,</hi> that is, joining in their <hi>Service,</hi> and the
use of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that nothing that we yet have seen, is able to
remove, as I hope the Progress of this <hi>Debate</hi> shall make appear.
He alledgeth, (p. 6.) that <hi>The scruple of the Surplice is worn out, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at the Sacrament is generally allowed by the more moderate Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists:
For the sign of the Cross,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith, <hi>The sin (if it
be one) in using it, is not the Persons who bring the Child to be baptized,
but the Ministers;</hi> and that he also debateth for the use of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy.</hi>
To all this I answer, We have the same Scruple against the
<hi>Surplice</hi> we had of old, but do not for it withdraw, it being the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister's
fault, not Ours. For <hi>Kneeling,</hi> it is our own act, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must either be dispensed with in it (which the Church will
not do) or for bear the Sacrament in which it is; for we utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that the more Judicious of the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> do allow it;
neither do I see how they can, and disallow other Ceremonies; for
they all stand on one bottom (to wit) that they are not instituted:
but more of this in its due place. For <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>'s Authority we
lay little weight on it; he hath his own Singular Opinions which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
party do unanimously allow. His Reasons in their place we shall
Consider. What he saith of the <hi>Crossing</hi> the Baptized Party, I know
not that I shall hereafter be put in mind of it, wherefore I answer,
That tho' it be the Ministers Action, yet it is the Parties (or his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives)
passion; and that Personal. It cannot be done on my
Person, or my Child's without my Consent and Submission; as if
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95366:22"/>
I willingly suffer Holy Water to be sprinkled on me, I am culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

unmanly and barbarous usage that he met with for his <hi>Sermon,</hi> I am
wholly a stranger to, and can pass no Judgment on it; but if this be
as he saith, it is no way to be justified. But he should not charge the
party with this: There are some Scurrilous and Mean wits among all
Parties of men, who have no other way to express their Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
what they dislike: And if we should trouble the world with
such publick Resentments of the same kind of dealings, and worse,
that we and our way have met with, and Daily do meet with, not
only from the Rabble and drunken boozers of his party; but
from Pulpits and the Press, not by the baser Phamphelteers only,
but famous Authors (witness Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s <hi>History of Presbytery)</hi> we
might write Books abundance. His citation of <hi>Bishop Whitgift</hi>
cometh little short of a full proof of what I now say, in that he

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 38. The Dr. next, <hi>p.</hi> 59. taketh a view of the forces that
he saith were mustered up against his <hi>Sermon,</hi> and passeth a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
on each of his Adversaries, which I shall not stay to Consider.
Only I think he Treateth <hi>Mr. B.</hi> with too much of the same sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that he complaineth he hath received: Tho' I think none
who knoweth the writings of that learned man, will applaud his
severe strain. And for <hi>Mr. A.</hi> whether the Dr. was piqued by
some home Thursts that he had met with from him, I know not;
but a man of his Worth and Learning should not have been so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised,
and his VVriting Represented so Contemptibly as the <hi>Dr.</hi>
dealeth with him; the facetiousness of his strain needed to have
bred no such Disgust; it is neither so. Low nor Scurrilous as the
Author would make us believe; others look on it as a condiment to
prevent <hi>Taedium</hi> and nauseousness. I know none that blameth the
excellent Writings of <hi>Mr. Fuller,</hi> which have a pleasantness not
unlike that of <hi>Mr. A</hi>'s. The debate that next falleth in between

            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 39. One of his Antagonists <hi>(p. 71.)</hi> chargeth him with
changableness, in writing here contrary to what he had written in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95366:23"/>
his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> about which he maketh Diverse Apologies. A change
in this Learned Man is too visible, and if it had been to the better,
it had not been Culpable; but because his Changes do not so much
concern our present debate about <hi>Conformity</hi> to the present <hi>Church</hi>-way,
I shall not meddle in that matter at this time: Especially a
change being (upon the matter) acknowledged by himself, <hi>p.</hi> 76.
One thing I cannot pass over; That he had Asserted in his <hi>Irenicum,
that if others cast them wholly out of Communion, then is their Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
necessary:</hi> which he would reconcile with what he here writeth,
<hi>p.</hi> 47. by shewing a difference as to this between the <hi>Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and of the <hi>Church of England:</hi> for saith
he, <hi>Our Church doth not cast one wholly out of Communion for meer Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Non-conformity, but alloweth to Communicate in some parts of
worship. 2. Ours is but the lesser Excommunication;</hi> which he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
<hi>publick defamers of the Orders of the Church to be under, ipso facto,
by the Canons; but that it layeth on no Obligation till duely Executed:
But the Excommunication of</hi> Rome <hi>is with an anathema.</hi> All this is very
little to the present purpose: for if we be all, <hi>ipso facto, Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
and if this <hi>Excommunication</hi> be most frequently (as it is) <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
against us, and <hi>capias</hi>'s issued out commonly against us; and all
this for meer Scrupulous Non-conformity (as he calleth it) by these
means we are <hi>de facto,</hi> put in such a Case, as we cannot enjoy all the
Ordinances of God among them; and therefore we must either live
without Gods Ordinances; or have them out of Communion with
their <hi>Church.</hi> Again, he Alledgeth <hi>p.</hi> 75. that <hi>he could not mean, that
there was an equal reason in these cases, when he expresly determineth,
That, in the case of our Church, men are bound in conscience to submit to
the orders of it:</hi> Neither doth this help the Matter; for if we think
(as we do) that we are bound, in Conscience, not to submit to
all the Orders of the <hi>Church,</hi> some of them being unwarranted by
the Word of God; and if for this Opinion, and suitable Practice
to it, we be so <hi>excommunicated,</hi> as we cannot enjoy God's Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with the <hi>Church;</hi> then we are cast wholly out of the <hi>Church,</hi> and
our <hi>Separation</hi> must be Lawful, on the ground that of old he
had laid down. But <hi>pag. 76. He would, in that case, allow us a
serupulous forbearance of Acts of Communion; but not to proceed to a
positive Separation.</hi> But if we make use of his Allowance, the
<hi>Church,</hi> who is of another mind, putteth a Bar to our Enjoying all
God's Ordinances: What can we then do, but either live without
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or proceed to that, which he is pleased to call a <hi>positive Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:95366:23"/>
We are not convinced, that our Practice is condemned
by the wiser <hi>Protestants</hi> abroad, for all the Letters that he mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth;
of which, in their place: And it is a rash Assertion (which
he knoweth cannot be Tried) <hi>pag. 77. That if a Council were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
of all the Protestant Churches in</hi> Christendom; <hi>we should not
doubt of their Determination, of the unlawfulness of the present Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
He, our Author, maketh good the saying, <hi>Quod misere volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
id facile credimus;</hi> any man that hath seen the <hi>Vniformity,</hi> in
almost all things, that is between our mode of Worship and their's;
and the great Deformity that is between theirs and that of the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> will find reason to expect a quite contrary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
from such an Assembly. We may appeal in this case
even to some of the Sons of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> The excellent
and Pious, and Learned <hi>Sr. Matthew Hales,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Schism,</hi>
hath this passage. <hi>In times of manifest Corruptions and Persecutions,
where Religious Assembling is dangerous, private meetings, howsoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
publick Order, are not only Lawful, but they are of necessity and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
All pious Assemblies in times of persecution and Corruption, however
practised, are indeed, or rather alone, the Lawful congregations and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Assemblies, though according to form of Law, are indeed nothing
but Riots and Conventicles, if they be stained with Corruption and
Superstition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sest.</hi> 40. He answereth an Objection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pag. 77. That <hi>the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of this Book is now unseasonable, being a hindrance to the Vnion
of Protestants, to which there seemeth now to be a general Inclination.</hi>
He Alledgeth (p. 78.) that <hi>the principles of Non-conformists hinder
that Vnion, and lay a foundation for perpetual Divisions.</hi> He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that we will not own this, and therefore proveth it (as he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
<hi>On the principles laid down by some of the Dissenting Brethren;
Let the constitution be never so easie to themselves, others may make use
of their grounds, and carry on the Difference as high as ever.</hi> I wish he
had told us what these grounds are. But it is an Odd kind of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning;
we will not endeavour Union with them who may be <hi>Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated,</hi>
because they who are not to be <hi>Tolerated,</hi> will expect the
same favour. The ground on which we plead for forbearance, is,
our Scruple about what you confess to be no Institution of Christ
nor necessary duty; we in our Conscience judge it unlawful, and
can shew good reason for our so judging: How this ground can be
Improved by any body to heighten Differences, unless it be by the
peremptoriness of them that will Impose such Things, I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95366:24"/>
He professeth to <hi>be for Vnion that will lessen differences,
and not weaken,</hi> but strengthen the Protestant Religion: Now let
any judge whether the Union that is founded on the ground pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
be not such.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 41. He saith, p. 97. That <hi>Vniversal Liberty differeth from
Vnion, as loosing from binding; and it is strange, if that which Papists
lately thought the best Means to bring in Popery, should now be lookt on as
the most effectual way to keep it out. Ans.</hi> We do not, nor ever did
plead for <hi>Vniversal Liberty,</hi> which was that which no doubt <hi>Papists</hi>
aimed at, <hi>ergo nihil dictum. But suppose,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Indulgence be at
present strictly limitted to Dissenting Protestants, we are not sure it will
always continue so; Will not the same Reasons, as to Scruple of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
suffering for Religion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be extended further when occasion serveth,
and Popery getteth footing on the Dissenters Grounds? Ans.</hi> Were it
not as rational for us to say, Tho' we can now join with the <hi>Church
of England,</hi> in her present Ceremonies, what know we how soon on
the same grounds she may bring in all those of <hi>Popery?</hi> Let us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
evil surmising, and mind our present Duty, especially seeing
the way to prevent this feared Evil is obvious, (to wit) that no
<hi>Indulgence</hi> be granted after, but what there is as good Reason for,
and as little hazard from, as is at present: Neither do we plead for
<hi>Indulgence</hi> meerly on the grounds of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruple of Conscience,</hi> or <hi>Suffering
for Religion;</hi> but on other grounds in conjunction with these, as hath
been a little above expressed. It is like our Grounds may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in his wide-Bellied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if by it he means all grounds
of Forbearance now may be extended to plead for an <hi>undue Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
then all Forbearance of <hi>Christians</hi> that dissent in any thing, must
be unlawful, which is contrary to the Scripture formerly mentioned,
and to the general Sentiments of all Christians, except Papists,
whose Religion standeth by Blood and Cruelty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 42. Where</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>more Labourers
and a greater Harvest than under the greatest Liberty of Conscience?</hi>
Witness the state of the <hi>Northern</hi> Kingdoms, compared with the
number of <hi>Papists</hi> in the <hi>united Netherlands;</hi> I can soon tell him
where, (to wit) under <hi>Episcopal Persecution of Protestants in</hi> Britain.
If this be a mistake, these Nations have been for some Years in a
Dream. Again, his Instance is wide from the purpose, for we
plead not for a <hi>Toleration</hi> of all sects, and particularly not of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists;
what <hi>Toleration</hi> is in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> themselves can best give
account of. He asserteth it impossible to keep out <hi>Popery,</hi> where
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95366:24"/>
               <hi>Toleration</hi> is allowed; and I assert it as impossible to keep in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
in an impure <hi>Church,</hi> where it is not allowed; and yet there
is no inconsistency between the two Assertions, if we distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a <hi>Limited Toleration,</hi> which we plead for, and one <hi>Vnlimited,</hi>
which he all along speaketh of. To talk of <hi>Toleration</hi> thus without
distinction, is to walk in the Clouds, and not descend to the thing
in debate, which is unbeseeming a Disputant.</p>
            <p>Sect. 43. <hi>He bringeth Three Arguments, p. 79, 80. to prove his
Assertion;</hi> 1. Because of the various waies of creeping in under seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Disguises, which the Priests and Jesuits have, and can never be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
where there is a general Indulgence for Dissenters, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
Church-power is allowed to separate Congregations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This Argument <hi>Supponit falsum,</hi> which we have often
disclaimed; to wit, That we plead for a general Indulgence to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters;
we desire it may be limitted to men of peaceable Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Practices; to such as differ from the publick way in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not Fundamental nor near to the Foundation (and for our part,
who are Presbyterians, we seek forbearance only in things that are
acknowledged to be none of <hi>Christ's Institutions,)</hi> and in things
that are neither against Godliness, nor the Peace of Church or
State. Another Falshood that he supposeth, is, That we plead for
<hi>an unaccountable Church-power in Separat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Meetings.</hi> We plead for
no Power in them, but what a good account can be given of from
Scripture; and what is allowed commonly to a Church as such.
2. I mention'd before a way of preventing the creeping in of <hi>Priests</hi>
and <hi>Jesuits,</hi> for all their Cunning, (to wit) The due Exercise of
Church-Discipline, in all the ways that shall be tolerated, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the admission of Ministers to their Office; and if these Foxes
creep in at undiscerned cranies, if Discipline be in vigour, they may
be cast out again, before they can do any considerable harm to the
Flock.</p>
            <p>Sect. 44. <hi>Argument</hi> 2. Because it will be great hardship, when mens
heats are over, for them <hi>(the Papists)</hi> only to be deprived of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Consciences, when the wildest of Phanaticks are allowed it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Still the old Supposition must found all his Arguments.
We plead for no <hi>Toleration</hi> to any <hi>Phanaticks</hi> (properly so called)
much less to the wildest of them. 2. There are many weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why <hi>Papists</hi> should be denied that Liberty that is allowed to
<hi>Protestant Dissenters;</hi> from the Grossness of their Heresies, the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
of their Worship, the Unpeaceableness of their Principles,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95366:25"/>
such as dethroning Kings, and cutting off all people that are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
in their Sence; their Principle of bearing down all Religion
but their own. Had a <hi>Non-conformist</hi> spoke as much on the behalf
of Papists, what a noise would our Author have made about it,
that <hi>we do their Work, &amp;c.</hi> His 3. Argument is, <hi>Because the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Sects that will be kept up by this means, will be alwaies thought a
plausible Argument to draw men to the Popish Pretences of Vnity.
Ans.</hi> By whom will this be thought? Surely, by no man that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth,
1. That Unity in <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> is no perswading Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to them who regard the Truths of God. 2. That our Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
are in things of the smallest moment in Religion, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
with Christian Love and Meekness, (for who exceed these
Bounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be punished by the Laws, notwithstanding a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
granted.) 3. That the <hi>Popish</hi> Unity is but pretended, there
being more and weightier Differences among them, than among us;
as the Dr. well knoweth, and hath, by his learned Labours, made
the World know. His 4. Argument is, <hi>Because the allowed Sects will
in probability grow more insolent upon a legal Indulgence, and bid defiance
to the Setled Constitution, as we have seen already by the yet visible Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of the former Indulgence. Ans.</hi> 1. He hath little Charity for
his Brethren, in expecting such things from them, and less in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
such an Observe on what is past, without any ground known
to unbyassed men. If he mean of any Indecency in Speech or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
among the vulgar, we cannot answer for that; there is too
much of it on both hands: Neither is it fit, that on such a frivolous
Ground the Sober and Conscientious should be persecuted. 2. If
Insolency shall happen (as God forbid) to be the consequent of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to Dissenters,</hi> let the Guilty be punished by the Law. We plead
for <hi>Toleration</hi> to Mens <hi>Consciences,</hi> not to their <hi>Immoralities;</hi> but,
<hi>Are we to expect, that the Laws of Men should work more upon them than
the Grace of God? Ans.</hi> Not on their Minds and Wills to change
them, but on the outward Man to restrain them. Such an Effect
may be rationally expected, and is daily observed in other Cases. It
is an odious Representation, as if <hi>the Vse of the Liberty pleaded for
were only to preach and pray, &amp; write &amp; dispute against one another;</hi> and
as absurd an Inference, that <hi>there seemeth to be much of Sence and
Reason in the Papal Pretence to Vnity and Infallibility.</hi> Whatever our
Author, or the by-slanders that he mentioneth may think, they who
have a just Abhorrence of <hi>Popery,</hi> will think, that none of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions</hi>
that are amongst us, are so bad as it by far, tho' we desire
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95366:25"/>
neither to excuse nor extenuate them: Nor do we refuse to concur
in our Station in any good way to heal these <hi>Distempers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 45. The rest of the Dr's Preface is taken up in expressing
his <hi>cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>scendency</hi> to the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> in the things that they scruple, tho'
he pleadeth for the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> as Lawful, (which is afterward to
be debated) yet he would have a Liberty allowed, that they who
scruple them, may have the Ordinances without them. If this were
put in practice, it would be one step toward healing: But it seems
the Church-men are not of his mind: However, we do thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
own his <hi>moderation.</hi> His other Condescendencies to such as scruple
Joining in the use of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> are for the most part very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
and might make <hi>England</hi> Happy, if they were practised.
But till some appearance of that be, it will be needless for us to tell
our Sence of them in particular: But his kindness to his Brethren
of the Ministry doth not so well appear by his Discourse from <hi>p.</hi> 88.
He is willing to gain the People, but seemeth to look on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
as Competitors; his Reasons for dealing so with them it were
not hard to answer; but considering, that there is little hope of
seeing even what he holdeth to be made practicable, I think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to contend about it; only I must tell him, that tho' we be as
far as he is against <hi>Lay-men,</hi> (as he speaketh) or any unordained Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
usurping the Office, or doing the Work of a Minister, yet his
Proposals are very lame, as to affording any Ministers at all. And
then what do all his commendable yieldings, as to the People, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e?
Would he have them have Separate Meetings, but no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in them to Administer the Ordinances of God to them? This
is a sort of <hi>Toleration</hi> that would neither be for our Advantage, nor
the Credit of the Church that alloweth it: So that in a great many
Pages he hath said nothing.</p>
            <p>There is nothing further to be noted in the Preface; for we wish
the Proposals that he maketh, for Reforming some Abuses in the
<hi>Church,</hi> p. 93. might take effect.</p>
            <p>Having now got through the <hi>Preface,</hi> I proceed to the <hi>Book,</hi>
which the Learned Author divideth into Three Parts; the 1. is,
An Histori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al Account of the Rise and Progress of the Separation.
The 2. is, Of the nature of the Separation. The 3. is, Of the Pleas
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r the Separtion. I shall accordingly divide this Examination,
and follow him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, so far as the clearing of our Principles
and Practice does require it. The Name of <hi>Separation</hi> is justly odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95366:26"/>
in the Church; and it is certain, that where-ever it is, some
great Blame lieth on the one Party or the other, and sometimes on
both; but there often is a sad and undesirable <hi>Separation,</hi> attended
with bad Consequences, where yet the one Party is wholly inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
I should here speak somewhat to open the nature of that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
that the Learned Dr. chargeth us with, but that were to
anticipate what is to be discoursed, animadverting on the Second

               <head>PART I. The Dr's Historical Account of the Separation, Examined
and Answered.</head>
               <p>IN his Sect. 1. he premiseth two things, in prosecuting which,
his First Part of his Book is taken up. The first is, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the present Reasons for Separation would have held
from the beginning of our Reformation, yet no such thing was then
practised or allowed, by those who were then most zealous for
Reformation.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. I. The Practice of the First Non-conformists considered.</head>
                  <p>BEfore we consider his <hi>2d.</hi> Proposition, let us try how this will
abide the Test. Here are two Assertions put together, which
for the greater clearness I shall consider apart; the one is <hi>Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi>
the other <hi>Historical:</hi> The <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part of his Proposition, is,
That <hi>the present Reasons for Separation</hi> (I shall not contend about
calling our practice so, not being willing to contend about words)
<hi>would have held from the beginning of the Reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I deny, and shall first give the Reason of my denial, and
then try the strength of what he saith for his Assertion. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that I bring, is, That our Reformation was carried on by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
as <hi>Rome was not built in a day,</hi> so neither was it pulled down
among us in a day. King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. began this Work, but did it so
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95366:26"/>
lamely, that <hi>Protestants</hi> were little satisfied. There wanted not
<hi>Non-conformists</hi> then, who were all the true <hi>Protestants;</hi> many of
them laid down their Lives for their <hi>Non-conformity.</hi> After him,
his Son <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. a religious and zealous Prince, reformed many
things, but not all at once; for the <hi>Liturgy</hi> was twice Reformed
in his Reign, <hi>Full. Ch. Hist.</hi> book 7. p. 386. once in his First Year,
and again in a Parliament held in his 5, &amp; 6. Years; and again,
in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> there were also some Alterations
made in the <hi>Rubrick, 1 Jacob.</hi> 1603. saith the same Author. And
it is known, that several things unreformed in <hi>Edw. 6's</hi> Reign, were
after taken away; as may be seen by comparing his <hi>Injunctions</hi> with
what afterward was practised in them. We have mention of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to Confession in Lent, Art.</hi> 9. of <hi>High Mass, Art. 21. Prayer for
the Dead</hi> is expresly injoined in the form of bidding of Common
Prayers; all which were afterward removed, name and thing; yea,
these very <hi>Injunctions</hi> gave people Hope of a further Reformation;
for they were only intended till a Parliament should be called. And
<hi>Art.</hi> 27. People are injoined, <hi>not to violate the Ceremonies not as yet
abrogated;</hi> which gave the people confidence, that such <hi>Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
were not to be continued as a Burden to Mens Consciences, but
were used for the present supposed necessity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The Case is far otherwise with us; we are put beyond
all Hope of Relief; a Yoke of <hi>Humane Ceremonies</hi> wreathed on our
Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k, without any probability of being loosed from it: For after
the King's happy Restauration, then there was the fairest oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
that could be wished for Condescendence and Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Ceremonies having gone into Disuetude for 20 years, and
the Nation being more generally against them than ever before, by
the Light of the Word, that had for so many years been more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fully held forth than before; and when a great number of
Ministers presented a <hi>Petition for Peace,</hi> to their Brethren then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionate
to Reform the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and used the strongest Reasons,
the most earnest Obtestations, and the greatest Condescentions that
could be, to obtain either a taking away of what was grievous to
their Consciences, or, at least, a forbearance in them, (all which
may be seen at length in the Book it self;) yet nothing was to be
obtained, but <hi>Impositions</hi> made more strict, and our Yoke made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
than before, rather than lighter; so that there remained no
more Hope for our selves, or our Posterity; but either we and they
must take up with a Worship, that, we are convinced, is mixt with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95366:27"/>
some things that maketh it displeasing to God, or live without God's
Ordinances, or worship God apart by our selves. May not we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to God, and to all the World, That whatever our Brethren
talk of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity, we were for Peace, but when we spake, they
were for Wars?</hi> Psal. 120. 6. while they will not abate nor bear
with us in one Ceremony, (which themselves declare <hi>Indifferent)</hi>
for that <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> that they extol so highly; yea, for the
keeping out of <hi>Popery,</hi> the re-entry of which they pretend to fear
by our <hi>Divisions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. These things being considered, it is very evident, That
our Case is not parallel with that of the first <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> in
reference to Communion with the Church, and therefore the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that moved them to go along with the present way, do not
conclude, that we ought to do the same; for, 1. There was then a
necessity apprehended by some of the best men for retaining some
of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that had been in use in <hi>Popery,</hi> lest too sudden and
visible a Change (it being the out-side of Religion that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
doth most consider) should have scared the people from owning
the <hi>Reformation;</hi> and we know, <hi>Necessitas quicquid coegit defendit:</hi>
On this Ground even the Apostles retained for a time a little of the
<hi>Jewish</hi> Observations, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28, 29. I do not say, that there was
a necessity for this, but it was then thought to be, and therefore
must needs influence their minds and practice, as if there really had
been such a necessity: But now it is evident to unbyassed men, that
there is no such necessity for retaining these Ceremonies. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pists</hi>
are so far from being brought over to us by symbolizing with them,
that they conceive Hope, from that very thing, of our returning to
them; as hath been made appear by several passages in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and Discourses, which I now stay not to rehearse: And in
very deed, our <hi>Service,</hi> especially in Cathedrals, cometh so much
nearer to their way, than it doth either to the way of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church (so far as it is recorded in Scripture) or to the way of
most of the Reformed Churches; that it were no hard task to bring
in <hi>Popish</hi> Worship (abating the <hi>Service</hi> being in <hi>Latin)</hi> and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
(for in that also we are at no great distance from <hi>Popery)</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, without being observed by the Vulgar. And the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is yet the less for retaining them among us, that our People have
not been bred in <hi>Popery,</hi> as in those Times, when the Ceremonies
were retained, and therefore are not in that hazard that they were
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>all back into <hi>Popery</hi> upon the abolishing of them; yea, it is so far
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95366:27"/>
from that, that the disuse of these might make Popery to be more
forgotten among the people, these being some of the Ornaments by
which that whorish Worship was once decked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. A Second Ground, why the reason of their cleaving to
the <hi>Church-way</hi> doth not conclude for our doing the like, is, They
had cause to look on their Grievances but as temporary, and knew
that further <hi>Reformation</hi> was designed, and might be in a short time
expected, and therefore it was Reason that they should rather for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
for that time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Edification, (I mean the external means
of it) that they might have had by pure Ordinances, rather than
seem to make a Breach. This Reason doth not at all touch us, who
are out of all hope of such purity of Ordinances in the Church, as
is pleasing to God, or consistent with His Acceptance; (I mean,
from us, who know the right way; for I shall not judge what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
an impure worship, invincibly not known to be such, may
find with God) they had not in vain essayed to make Peace with
their Brethren, and been rejected with a peremptory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>leaving to
the least <hi>Indifferent Ceremony,</hi> rather than to satisfie the <hi>Conscienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Seruples</hi> of those who doubted; which is our Case. Therefore
we are (even by them who blame us for what they force us to)
brought to a necessity of worshipping God apart from them, seeing
we neither can now do it, nor hope that afterward we may do it
with them. And this our Necessity is heightned, and our Case made
yet more different from theirs at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> when we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
That that was a time of <hi>Reformatio, Status convalescentiae;</hi> ours
is rather <hi>status decidentiae,</hi> a time of <hi>Encreasing,</hi> rather than of <hi>Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing</hi>
the number of <hi>Superstitions,</hi> and coming nearer the <hi>Popish</hi>
Modes, rather than going further from them. Instances of this are
not a few; take for a taste the allowing of Plays on the Lord's day;
(the zealous promoting of the Book of Sports by that party, is not
yet forgotten) whereas that day was, <hi>Art.</hi> 24. of King <hi>Edw.</hi> the 6's
<hi>Injunctions,</hi> before mentioned, appointed <hi>to be given wholly to God in
hearing the Word of God read and taught in private and publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
&amp;c.</hi> A further Conviction in this Matter may be abundantly
had from a book entituled, <hi>The Advances of</hi> England <hi>toward</hi> Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
which Book, tho' our Reverend Author labours to disparage,
p. 35. of his Preface, yet agreeth so well with what men see with
their Eyes, that it is not fit to be slighted; for, <hi>Tho' some be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and blamed in that Book that appeared most zealous against</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
<hi>yet it is no Rarity for Words and Deeds to clash. Quid verba
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95366:28"/>
audio cum facta videam?</hi> And if it be true, that the Author before
his death was sensible of the Injury he had done to some, yet his
Evidence that he bringeth will still be compared with what every
one saw to be the tendency of some mens way. I might here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the obligation of the <hi>National Covenant</hi> that we are under, as
they were not to whom the Dr. would make our Case parallel, tho
I never thought, that that Bond made any new Duties or Sins, that
were not such antecedently; yet the Oath of God maketh the Tye
that we are under to Duty, and against Sin, more weighty, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravateth
the sin of doing what is contrary to it; but of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
I conclude then, that the present Reasons of Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would not have held from the beginning of the Reformation,
<hi>quod erat probandum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. The learned Dr. (p. 2.) after explaining the terms of
his Assertion which we have denied, proveth the Identity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
in their Case and ours, by <hi>the Ceremonies, Liturgy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>being
the same.</hi> Let all this be admitted; as they were dissatisfied with
these then, so are we now; but we join not in these practices, as
they did, and worship God without them, as they did not; because
our Case doth not make these things appear so needful as theirs
did, because we have no Hope of <hi>Reformation,</hi> as they had; beside our
being under an additional Tye against such <hi>Superstitions,</hi> which they
were not under. Not content with this, the Dr. thinks to prove,
that we are more obliged to join in the <hi>Church's Worship,</hi> than those
at the Reformation: 1. Because of the <hi>Number, Diligence, and
Learning of our allowed Preachers.</hi> 2. Because <hi>the Ceremonies are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched.</hi>
3. Because of <hi>the Mischiefs that we have seen of Separation.</hi>
To the first I answer; As what we complain of in the present Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
is not the Ground of our with drawing (though it is a sad
Grievance, and tendeth to make the Ordinances of the Lord to be
abhorred in the Eyes of the people; as the ways of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons did,
1 <hi>Sam. 2. 17.)</hi> so neither can their Commendation by him given,
be a sufficient Reason for our joining in corrupted Ordinances. I
confess, the number of the present Ministers is greater than in those
days, the generality of the Clergy continuing Popish; and I am
far from derogating from some among them, who are learned and
diligent (and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> add) pious men, and sound Protestants: But as for
the far greatest part of the <hi>Parish Ministers,</hi> that the people are
most edified by, or disappointed of their Edification, they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Strangers to <hi>England,</hi> or strangely byassed, who see not cause
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95366:28"/>
to complain of their <hi>Ignorance, Idleness, and vitious Conversation,</hi> if
not of all these three. To the Second; I know not what retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath been made of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> since the beginning of Q. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s
Reign, but I know Additions have been made, if not
as to Imposing, yet as to Use, and some Additions to the Holidays
hath been imposed; but if they were fewer than they are, they
are enough to corrupt the Worship of God, and furnish as strong an
Argument to forbear such corrupted Worship, as if they were more
numerous. A grain of <hi>Arsenick</hi> may justly make one forbear a Dish
in which it is, as well as if there were two or three in it. To the
Third; As he hath seen <hi>Mischiefs of Separation,</hi> and we do not exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
them, so have we of <hi>Impositions,</hi> yea, all the <hi>Mischiefs</hi> of that
kind are justly imputable to these <hi>Impositions,</hi> they being the Cause
of the <hi>Separation;</hi> and, <hi>causa causae est causa causati.</hi> Our Ancestors
had hope of freedom from that Yoke, as hath been said, which we
have not; therefore no Inconvenience (that is not our Sin) can
warrant us to join with, and in the depravations of the Worship of
God, which were our Sin, as neither can such inconvenience excuse
us to live without Ordinances alwaies, as the former <hi>Non-conformist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. In his 2. <hi>Section,</hi> he cometh to the proof of the other
part of his Assertion, to wit, <hi>That there was no Separation practised
or allowed by those who were most Zealous for the Reformation.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
<hi>there were different apprehensions about some few Things;</hi> but
denieth <hi>that they were the Things now Scrupled at; and that any Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
was made because of them.</hi> I shall not much dispute either of
these, because the Cause that I defend is not much concerned in
them, but standeth on a better foundation, than the opinions or
practices of men: And because our case and reasons differs from
theirs as hath been shewed, yet shall I a little examine what he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
under both these heads. For the former of them; he
proveth it only from <hi>Mr. Roger, Scrupling only the square Cap and

but people (tho scrupling them) complyed with the use of <hi>Liturgies</hi>
and <hi>Cerimonies.</hi> May be it was so at the very first, while <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
was hopefull going on. I have already shewed why we are
not bound by such Examples: I shall now Apologize for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable
practice of the those holy men, to excuse them <hi>atanto,</hi> though
not <hi>atoto.</hi> The glorious Change that then was wrought in the
<hi>Church,</hi> did so affect then, &amp; engage their zealous hearts to Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
that they did not so throughly consider, as they ought, the
sinfulness of the <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> They had got so many things reformed,
the evil of which was so incomparably beyond that of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
that these seemed as nothing to them. It is known that the limitted &amp;
scant powers of our Souls, our Understandings, Affections; yea, our
Senses are by some vehement Objects so diverted, as that meaner
Objects at the same time cannot move them, nor be noticed by
them. It was much that these men discovered any evil in the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi>
but that the principles that the Reformation was built on
led them to that; (to wit) That <hi>Scripture</hi> is the Rule by which the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the House of God must be ordered; but it is no wonder that
they did not so fully discover the Evil of them, nor were so affected
with it, as we who have had longer time and less hindrance to think
on these things. I am far from thinking, that they had either less
Light, or less tenderness of Conscience than we, but that their Mind
and Conscience were exercised about higher Matters, which we have
(through the Lord's goodness) so settled to our hand, that reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these is not our Work. They were imployed to do the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
part of the Work; to cast out <hi>Antichristianism;</hi> it was left to
others that succeeded them to cast out of the House a little of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi>'s
Furniture, that had been forgotten, or by minding greater
things, over-lookt, lying in some corners of the House: So that it
doth no more inferr blame on us forbearing the use of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
that they used them, while they reformed the <hi>Church</hi> from

with the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> is consistent with all that
respect that is due to those excellent Persons, who in the beginning
of the <hi>Reformation</hi> practised otherwise; for we owe such respect to
no man, nor men, as to reckon them infallible in Opinion or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
Also what hath been said may take off the edge of the Dr's
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95366:30"/>
jeering Insinuations, That <hi>these things are now such Bug-bears to scare
People from our Communion, and make them cry out in such dreadful
manner, of the mischief of</hi> Impositions, <hi>as though the Church must una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ceremonies.</hi> We have little Answer to this sort of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation,
only we say, It is not Childish Fear, but Conscience
guided by Scripture, that scareth us; neither do we count these Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
such as will break (tho' they defile) the Church, but they
are too heavy for our Consciences to bear, and the example of men
using them, can yield us no ease of this Burden. When the Dr. doth
thus ridicule the <hi>Scruples of Conscience,</hi> that his opposites pretend to
have, either he thinketh, that an <hi>Erring Conscience</hi> is to be cured by
contempt and scorn, or that we do only pretend to Conscience in
our Dissent: The former is no sign of a good <hi>Casuist,</hi> nor the latter
of a good <hi>Christian;</hi> for such will <hi>not judge, lest they be judged.</hi> He stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
much at two Expressions of one of his Antagonists; one is,
That it is unreasonable, that Men should create a necessity of <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
and then complain of the Impossibility of <hi>Vnion: Hath our
Church</hi> (saith he) <hi>made new Terms of Communion, or altered the old
ones? Ans.</hi> Though the <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> be not new, as to the
matter of them, they are perpetuated on new grounds, which make
them now harder to be submitted to than before, for they were
brought in at first on a <hi>present Necessity,</hi> as then was thought, the
Nation being <hi>Popish,</hi> and ready to abandon the <hi>Reformation,</hi> if that
was offended. Now it is not so; they were continued in a Reforming
time, and now fixed in a time when no such thing is to be expected,
but rather the contrary: They were retained in the Morning twi-light
of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> but now in the Noon-day of Gospel-light
long shining among us, fixed in perpetuity, so that the present Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
give a new Being to these <hi>Stumbling-blocks;</hi> especially, they
are new grounds of <hi>Separation,</hi> because now they are scrupled at
more than at first; and though the things were before, yet they did
not such Mischief then as now; and therefore, they who continued
them when thus hurtful, (though it were granted, that the hurt of
them arose from the mistake of the Scruplers) do create a necessity
of Separation, while they may remove these scandals, and will not.
But they that scruple, cannot remove their Scruples. The other
Expression is, That <hi>continuing of the Ceremonies, is, venturing our
Peace in an old Worm-eaten Bottom;</hi> which the Dr. against all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
understandeth of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> but is indeed to be understood
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95366:30"/>
of the <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> The <hi>Reformation</hi> is founded on <hi>Scripture,</hi> a sure
and sound Foundation. The <hi>Ceremonies</hi> on Mens Will and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and therefore justly termed <hi>a Worm-eaten Bottom.</hi> That he
saith, <hi>There was no</hi> Non-conformists <hi>in K.</hi> Edw. 6. <hi>days,</hi> is before
disproved; and if there had not, while we can give Scripture-ground
for our <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> we need not be ashamed, tho' Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs

Doth not all this fully express what I have already said, That all
the Ceremonies ought to have been cast out at first? That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,
partly by the Church's, and their want of due light (like
one in a state of Convalescency) and partly out of a design to gain,

Might not we answer the same way to all his Allegations of the
<hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>first Reformers</hi> compliance with the Ceremonies;
(to wit) That good men did not scruple where it was reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
that they should. The words that he cited out of the
<hi>Act. and Monument. Vol. 3. P.</hi> 319. where Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> calleth Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
the Lord's Cognizance, and not <hi>Tippets, &amp;c.</hi> do rather make

Baggage;</hi> and no reason can be given why these should be so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
except that they are brought into Religion by Man, not by
God; which agreeth to all the <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> Who they were that
kept secret Meetings under B. <hi>Ridley,</hi> it is needless to enquire. The
Dr. guesseth, that they were <hi>furious Anabaptists</hi> or <hi>secret Papists.</hi> I
know no reason for this guess; but because he is resolved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there
shall be no <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were some excellent men, who disliked the Ceremonies, I have
shewed; that some of them did use them notwithstanding, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.
That any did separate, I do not undertake to prove;
nor can he prove the contrary, so much as probably. I am sure,
there were Principles then maintained by a Party of men, which
would have made them do as we do, if their Practice had been suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95366:31"/>
adapted to the Sentiments that they had about the Ceremonies,
which maketh it not unprobable that some of them did withdraw;
though it may be the men of more note among them, who conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the necessity of their Case, as warranting that Practice, might do
otherwise; but it is no way likely, that the Church did so furiously
impose these things on the Consciences of Scruplers, as we are now
imposed on.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. The Dr's long Harrangue, p. 6, 7. to condemn our
practice by the contrary practice of the first Reformers, doth either
prove nothing, or it concludeth, that it is possible that such holy
Men could mistake: Which before he himself had imputed to holy
Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> one of them here mentioned by him. Their Holiness,
Learning, Integrity, Industry, profound Judgment, Mortification,
did not entitle them to <hi>Infallibility.</hi> Were it not easie to name ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

(a term suited to that Contempt of <hi>Non-conformists</hi> that his Book
is full of) should be in the right, when one more Holy and Learned
than he is in the wrong; especially in things of that moment that the
Ceremonies are of? For, I look on it as <hi>taunting,</hi> not <hi>disputing,</hi> to
talk of <hi>the mighty importance of the Ceremonies to the Souls of Men; the
Beams of Vnlawfulness in them, of which a Mote could not be seen by the
Reformers;</hi> we count them of such Importance, as a tender Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

as many other things are. We see a <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I shall not controvert it, only I shall make a few Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
on it, having first in general noted, That it is no wonder
(nor is it argumentative against us, who take Scripture, not Mens
Opinions for our Rule) that they who in <hi>England</hi> were inured to
that less-pure way of Worship, did cleave to it abroad, till by see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and learning away more consonant to Scripture, they fell in
with that: And it is as little to be wondred at, that some gave
more pliable Ears to the right way that they were instructed in,
in strange places; and others clave more obstinately to that they
had been bred with; (we know what a prejudice Education causeth)

prove (as he cannot) that all the <hi>Non-conformity</hi> that is in <hi>England,</hi>
was brought from beyond Sea, he saith nothing, unless he also
prove, that it was not brought out of the Scripture. We must not
reject every thing in Religion that is not of <hi>English Original,</hi> lest we
by so doing throw off both <hi>Christianity</hi> and <hi>Protestantism.</hi>

<hi>These</hi> (English Exiles) <hi>with the People in all other places,</hi> Geneva <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
kept to the Orders established in our Church.</hi> Here is a notable
Falshood, (to wit) That all the <hi>Exiles</hi> kept to the Orders of the
<hi>Church of England;</hi> himself excepteth those at <hi>Frankford;</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Fuller,</hi> above-cited, telleth us of a Party of <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> before
that time in <hi>England,</hi> headed by <hi>Rogers</hi> and <hi>Hooper;</hi> no doubt some
of them fled from the <hi>Marian</hi> Persecution, and it is not probable
they would use the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that here grieved them, when they
were under no Law to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ompel them. Another thing that I take
notice of, is, He challengeth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for saying, That at <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
the Contest was between them who were for the <hi>English Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
and them who were for a more free way of <hi>Praying;</hi> but I see
not how this is disproved by him; the Confirmation of it may be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95366:32"/>
rather gathered from the Accompt he giveth of these Debates, p. 9.
(to wit) that when the Magistrates first required them not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from the <hi>French</hi> in Doctrine or <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and then took off
that restraint: Yet they altered the <hi>English order,</hi> and brought it
nearer to the <hi>French Model;</hi> which we know doth not impose a
<hi>Liturgy,</hi> nor restrain <hi>free Prayer;</hi> but at most proposeth a <hi>Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
wherein are some set Forms, as helps to them that need them.
To say, that those who laid aside the <hi>Responses, Litany, and Surplice,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>d many other things,</hi> were still for the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> is to speak at
random. But he omitteth a material passage, (because it maketh
against him) with which <hi>Fuller, Ch. Hist. lib.</hi> 8. p. 27. supplieth
us, out of the same History that the Dr. citeth, (to wit) <hi>The
Troubles at</hi> Frankford: That <hi>they laid aside the Liturgy, Surplice and
other Ceremonies in Service and Sacraments, both as superfluous, and
superstitious:</hi> wherein then did they differ from <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. He saith, p. 9. That <hi>the Question among them was not,
Whether a Liturgy, or not; but whether the Order of Divine Service,
was not to be accommodated, as much as might be, to the</hi> French. This
is to confess, that they did not contend for the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> as

for free Prayer,</hi> because in his <hi>Ep. 55. (mihi 87.)</hi> to the <hi>Protector</hi> of

a more Impartial Historian (out of the Book that the Dr. pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

end this Debate came to; even such an end, as a blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

3. 15. The fore-cited Author, p. 30, 31. telleth how <hi>Cox</hi> prevailed
by <hi>new Recruits out of</hi> England: <hi>And</hi> Knox<hi>'s Party again by the
Favour of the Magistrate, and the</hi> French <hi>Minister: And that</hi>
Cox<hi>'s Party being depressed, embraced a strange way to raise themselves,
and accuse</hi> Knox <hi>to the State, of Treason against the Emperour; and
that in Eight places of a Book of his.</hi> The seven last the Historian
saith, may be well Omitted. The first is, <hi>That he called the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
no less an Enemy to Christ, than was</hi> Nero. This the Impartial
Historian cryeth out on; the Words being spoken some Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in <hi>England,</hi> by one that owned no Natural Allegiance to the
<hi>Emperour;</hi> that they should be charged on him, by Men of his
own Religion, in Exile with him, to the endangering of his Life:
And of this, he saith, alluding to <hi>Rachel</hi>'s Words, <hi>With great rather
than good Wrestling, have I wrestled, and prevailed.</hi> So was Mr. <hi>Knox</hi>
advised by the Magistrate to depart; not <hi>forbidden</hi> by the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
(as the Dr. saith) <hi>to Preach:</hi> And those that clave to him,
were scattered. Here is <hi>Episcopal Peace,</hi> and here is a taste of
the Spirit and Methods, by which they carry on their Cause.

(it is his own word) used the other party, ejecting their Church-Officers,
without taking any notice of them, or asking their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
Also how they refused to let the matter come to Hearing or
Arbitration, by which he saith, <hi>Cox</hi>'s party lost much Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
How they reproached the other as <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> when they had
made the <hi>Shism</hi> in a peaceable Church. And after he telleth us,
how <hi>Cox</hi>'s party brake among themselves about other things, oftner
than once, and that to a scandalous heighth. Which may be seen at
length in the Author. If this be convenient in a Congregation, let any
judge; it is strange that the Dr. and Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> both, should Read
these Historical passages, with so different Spectacles.</p>

in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> so they in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and elsewhere, <hi>got a better like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        </gap>s, especially when they
have such Abetters, whose Authority goes beyond any Reason with them.
And that is the true Foundation of our unhappy Differences, that yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</hi>
I have abridged his Words; but given the full sence of them.
And now I shall Note a few things on this Discourse. 1. He will
not allow it, it seems, that <hi>Non-conformists</hi> of old, or late, have
ever made the Bible the Rule of their worshipping God: No, they
are meer <hi>Consuetudinary Men,</hi> and soon taken with any new Fashion,
and so Obstinate, that they will not part with any Custom, when
once taken up. Thus he is pleased to picture those that dissent from
him: We expected more Charity from him. 2. If <hi>Non-conformists</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prove what they hold, by Scripture, and sound Reason; let them
lie under as much of his Reproach, as he shall please to cast upon
them. But if they can, I hope he will retract this rash Censure. 3. If
<hi>Custom</hi> did so far <hi>Influence</hi> these men, methinks the Customs that they
had first received in their native Country, should have been a sufficient
Antidote against all Foreign Infection to the contrary. But their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken with the way in other Countries, rather sheweth, that their
former way was built on <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Education;</hi> and that the
Change was from Scripture Light, that they had met with abroad,
which they could not resist. 4. I have shewed before, that they
had these principles before they went abroad; even in King <hi>Edward</hi>
6's. Time, there were not a few of that way. 5. It is strange that
all Countries beside <hi>England,</hi> are so Clownish, that they cannot bear
the Pomp and Ceremonies of Divine Worship here used: How then
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95366:35"/>
doth Popery get any Entertainment beyond Sea, even among the
<hi>Sw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ssers;</hi> which Religion will vie with Ours in outward Splendor?
If the Genius of a Nation did determine men in Religion (as
the Dr. insinuateth in this cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>) how is it that the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are
not used among the <hi>Protestants in France,</hi> which is the pattern for
Modishness and Gaiety to <hi>England,</hi> and other parts of the World?
but this is so indigested a Notion, that it doth not well become
the Learning of Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet;</hi> tho it be good enough for some
to rant with over a Pot of Ale. 6. Whether our party or his,
be more guilty of <hi>Obstinate insisting on mens Authority, in defiance
of Reason,</hi> let the World judge. We are content to set aside all
the <hi>Authority</hi> of men, <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern;</hi> and to referr our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
simply to the Determination of <hi>Scripture:</hi> But mens Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is the Argument that the Dr. in this Book doth most insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I hope the Reader may by this time perceive, whether the
Dr. doth truly or faIsly Assign the Foundation of our <hi>Differences,</hi>
which I, with him, acknowledge to be unhappy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 21. He saith, p. 14. That in the <hi>English Reformation,</hi> they
proceeded more out of reverence to the Ancient Church, than meer
opposition to Popery (which some other Reformers made their
Rule.) Here are two mistakes not to be passed in silence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. The
<hi>Ancientest Church</hi> had none of the Ceremonies; they were neither
in the <hi>Apostolick Church,</hi> nor in that which was near it. How an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
they were, he will after give occasion to enquire. So that
<hi>England</hi> took for their pattern, the <hi>Church</hi> that was much declined
both in <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>Purety.</hi> 2. What can be more grosly false,
than to say, that other <hi>Reformers</hi> made meer opposition to <hi>Popery</hi>
with their rules. Two things make the contrary evident. 1. They
did not reject all that <hi>Papists</hi> held, as, That there is one God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
2. They rejected nothing of <hi>Popery,</hi> but what they gave other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for, than that the <hi>Papists</hi> held it: (to wit) That it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Scripture, or not instituted by Christ; and so condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Scripture, as <hi>vain Worship,</hi> being a <hi>Teaching for Doctrines,
the Commandments of men.</hi> We make Symbolizing with <hi>Papists,</hi> or
other <hi>Idolaters,</hi> an Argument against the <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> but we reject
them not on that account only; and so meer opposition to <hi>Popery,</hi>
is not the rule of our <hi>Reformation.</hi>

was the <hi>Rule,</hi> and a far <hi>better Rule</hi> than that: Tho' even that hath
its use to direct us in <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Again, he saith,
That <hi>Calvin yieldeth to this Moderation, that such Ceremonies might be
retained, as were easie, and fitted to the Capacity of the People; provided
they were not such as had their beginning from the Devil, or Antichrist.</hi>
His words are, <hi>Adeoque Ceremonias ipsas ad usum &amp; captum esse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodandas;

that sort fall under that Censure, they being not from God, and
being Parts of Worship, they are from <hi>Satan,</hi> or <hi>Antichrist;</hi> but
he would have all the Externals of Worship, so fitted to peoples ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
as that they do not hinder, but rather help in the inward
exercise of it. And if <hi>Calvin</hi> did yield in that <hi>Infancy</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
(which I think he did not, otherwise he could not blame
the <hi>Imperfection</hi> of it) That the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> might be retained, it
maketh nothing for perpetuating of them. The Dr. saith, <hi>They
proceeded by this Rule of Moderation, taking away all the Ceremonies
that were of late Invention:</hi> And he saith, p. 14. That <hi>the Ceremonies
retained, were more ancient than the great Apostasy of the Roman Church.</hi>

<hi>Kneelling</hi> in the Act of receiving the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> Neither will

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 23. He endeavoureth to free our <hi>Ceremonies</hi> from <hi>Popery,</hi>
because <hi>the Cross is used by Papists in the Scrutinies before Baptism; we
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95366:36"/>
use it after Baptism; and Kneeling is not strictly required by the</hi> Roman
<hi>Church, in the act of Receiving; as appeareth by the Pope's sitting, or a
little leaning.</hi> For the first, What great difference doth it make,
whether Crossing be used before or after Baptism, seeing it is not
to be omitted, but belongeth to that Sacrament, as one of its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts?
Our quarrel with it is not that it is used after Baptism, but
that it is used, being none of <hi>Christ's Institutions,</hi> but of <hi>Man's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi>
and abused in the Popish Administration of Baptism. For
the Second, I hope he will not deny, that <hi>Kneeling</hi> in the act of Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

That the Pope, who to them is above the Laws of God, should be

were retained by our Reformers, tho' they were distasteful to some
Protestants, and like to prove the Occasions of future Contentions.</hi> These
Reasons are three, 1. <hi>Out of a due reverence to Antiquity. 2. To ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
the Reformation before Enemies, in that we would not break with
them for meer indifferent things. 3. To shew our consent with the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Churches.</hi> To these I return a word or two in general, and
then shall answer them particularly. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Shall we slight or cross Christ's Institution in the Worship of
God, for the sake of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or <hi>Papists,</hi> or <hi>Protestants</hi> either? I am
far from thinking, that our <hi>Reformers</hi> had so little regard to <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;</hi>
nay, that was the Weapon they alwaies used against the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
tho' in reference to the Ceremonies, they did not so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it, as they should have done. But the Dr. and his Party seem
to lay little weight on it in this Controversie, for he maketh little
or no use of it through this large Book, which is somewhat strange
in a Controversie of Divinity. It is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to use weapons so

of these Reasons, nor all of them in conjunction, is sufficient to
establish any point of Truth, or to warrant any part of Divine
Worship: Wherefore they should first have proved the <hi>Ceremonies</hi>
to be lawful, and then these three Reasons might well have come in
as <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> to confirm the use of them; but to manage the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God by such Considerations, without any other Reason was
too slender a Ground to proceed upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 25. Let us now consider his three Reasons in particular.
For the First, <hi>Due reverence to Antiquity. Ans.</hi> 1. We reverence
<hi>Antiquity</hi> as much as our Brethren do, but with these two Cautions;
1. That we preferr the <hi>first Antiquity</hi> to that which was later; the
<hi>Apostolick Church,</hi> to the Ages of the <hi>Church</hi> that succeeded. If they
can shew us any footsteps of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in that <hi>Church,</hi> we shall
embrace them, if not, give us leave to reject them, even out
of <hi>Reverence to Antiquity.</hi> 2. We do not own <hi>Antiquity,</hi>
(where there was no <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as was in the Apostles)
for the Rule of our Faith or Worship. We know, the Church
may erre, and did very soon begin to decline; of which
somewhat before, and more afterward. We reverence <hi>Antiquity</hi>
so far, as not to recede from it without sufficient warrant from
Scripture or clear Reason; and to reverence it further, is to idolize
it, and put it in the place of Divine Authority. <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. Why are
not our Brethren uniform in their <hi>Reverence to Antiquity?</hi> Do not
they desert <hi>Antiquity</hi> in more things, and those of more moment
than the <hi>controverted Ceremonies</hi> are? Will they deny the <hi>naevi pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum</hi>
that Divines, both <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> have observed?
They have laid aside the <hi>osculum,</hi> that then was called <hi>pacis, sanctum,
vel fraternitatatis,</hi> used presently after Prayer, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> calleth
<hi>Signacul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m orationis;</hi> the <hi>Agapae,</hi> that, notwithstanding of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
check, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 21, 22. were used in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95366:37"/>
before the Lord's Supper, sometimes after; also the <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi>
(if not only, yet more ordinarily) <hi>the day before Easter and
Pentecost;</hi> the <hi>Trina immersio;</hi> the <hi>Communio Infantum;</hi> the <hi>Gusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
mellis &amp; lactis,</hi> all used in <hi>Baptism</hi> in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time. Of the
same sort are the <hi>diluting of the Wine with Water,</hi> in the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
the sign of the Cross used in <hi>Omni conversatione,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
hath it; The <hi>carrying the Eulogias, or consecrated Symbols, to the Sick
and others;</hi> all these in the Second Century. In the Third Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
were brought in <hi>Offerings</hi> and <hi>Prayers for the Dead,</hi> and <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism
in Baptism.</hi> What a world of Ceremonies were added in the
Fourth Century, is too well known. Now, all these were as
ancient as the Times of the first Christian Emperors, to which the
Dr. saith, p. 17. that <hi>Our Reformers endeavoured to reduce the state of
the</hi> Church; if it was thought fit, and no disrespect to the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
to reject their practices in some things as innocent as our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
why not in them also, there being no more warant in the Word
for the one sort of things than the other? This is to make <hi>Respect
to Antiquity</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erve a turn, or mens own designs; which I hope
our worthy Reformers were far from, whatever may be said of
their Successors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect. 26. Ans.</hi> 3. If the Dr. had pleased to tell us how ancient
the Ceremonies that he contendeth for are, we should have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
his Allegations; I am sure he cannot equal them in <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
with the Rites above-mentioned, which yet his Church reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
We affirm them to be <hi>Novel Inventions,</hi> brought in under a
considerable, tho' not the highest, Degeneracy of the <hi>Church;</hi> when
we meet with his proofs to the contrary, they shall be answered. I
wonder to hear from such an <hi>Antiquary</hi> as Dr. <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>llingfleet,</hi> That
<hi>purging out of these Ceremonies is a Reforming 1600 years backward;</hi> as
if all the <hi>controverted Ceremonies,</hi> or any of them, had been in the first
Century, in the very daies of the Apostles; I suppose he will find
it a hard Task to prove this. By what hath been said, it is easie to
discover the weakness of what he alledgeth about <hi>giving unspeakable
Advantage to the Papists, by reforming 1600 years backward;</hi> for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do we own the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> to be so old; nor could <hi>Papists</hi> have
any advantage, if we reject what is unwarranted by the
Word, however ancient it be. Indeed, if we should part with
Scripture, and referr the decision of our Controversies with the
Papists only to <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hurch-History,</hi> it were to give them advantage, if
we should disown any thing so ancient, but I hope the Dr. will not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95366:38"/>
advise us to that course, and therefore there is no hazard. It ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to this <hi>unspeakable advantage</hi> in the Dr's Opinion, That when
they (the <hi>Non-conformists)</hi> are pinched with a Testimony of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
presently cry out of the Mystery of <hi>Iniquity</hi> already working
in the Apostle's Times, as tho' every thing that they disliked were
a part of it. <hi>Ans.</hi> Tho' we have hitherto met with none of his
<hi>pinching Arguments</hi> from <hi>Antiquity,</hi> yet we think that Allegation no
such ridiculous Evasion as he would make it, seeing the Spirit of
God was pleased to give us this warning; and after-Ages gave a
clear proof of the fulfilling of this Scripture, by the ripening of
those Inclinations that were among some in the Apostles days, of
<hi>falling back to beggarly Elements; Gal.</hi> 4. 9. and <hi>subjecting themselves
to mens Ordinances: touch not, taste not, handle not,</hi> Col. 2. 20, 21.
into the highest of Superstition and Depravation of the Worship
of God, as <hi>Antichristianism</hi> came to a height. If the load of humane
Traditions were a part of that <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> that was adult
under <hi>Antichrist,</hi> why should we not think that these Beginnings
were a part of these first workings of it, that the Apostle complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
of? If we make any thing that disliketh us, a part of that
working <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> that we cannot prove to be evil, and to
have had its Rise in the decay of the Church, let us bear the blame.
He saith, the rejecting of the Ceremonies gave a great check to the
Reformation in <hi>France,</hi> and citeth for it <hi>Thuanus</hi> and <hi>Balduinus,</hi>
both <hi>Papists,</hi> without pointing to their words, or places where they
may be found; wherefore I look on what he saith as <hi>gratis dictum:</hi>
And if it were true, it saith no more, but that there were two in
<hi>France,</hi> that were fond of humane Ceremonies, as there are many
in <hi>England.</hi> VVe have cause to bless the Lord, that the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>France</hi> was not checked, but made very glorious Progress,
was owned by many, great and small, was sealed with the Blood of
many Martyrs. And that it was not universally received, we may
rationally impute to the supreme Power being against it, which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to have the Command of the Consciences of the greatest and
carnal part of the world: But what the Dr. saith in prosecuting this
reason, I wish he would reconcile with his Third Reason, That <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
retained the Ceremonies, to <hi>shew their consent with other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 27. His Second Reason is, <hi>to manifest the Justice of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
by letting Enemies see, that we did not break Communion
with them for meer indifferent things. Ans. 1. Papists</hi> might have
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95366:38"/>
seen that, if they would have opened their Eyes, without our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
any of their <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> (to wit) That we brake with them
on weighty points of <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and not for <hi>Ceremonies</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
<hi>Ans.</hi> 2. When we had separated from their <hi>Church,</hi> on such
<hi>weighty Accounts,</hi> we were not to retain any thing that they had
corrupted the Worship of God by, to please them; neither could
we retain those to shun breaking with them, having already broken
with them on other accounts. <hi>Ans.</hi> 3. The Dr. taketh it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Question between him and us,
(to wit) That <hi>the Ceremonies are meer indifferent things.</hi> If he
prove this, he must carry the day. What Advantage the <hi>Popish
Bishops</hi> (for all their Subtilty and Learning that he talketh of)
could have made of rejecting of these as well as the rest of humane
Ceremonies, I know not; they had a large Field to expatiate in
with the People, by holding forth to them: How many Usages of
the ancient Church the Reformers had rejected, that were (in the
Dr's sence) <hi>meer indifferent things,</hi> as <hi>Holy Water, Cream, Salt, Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
&amp;c.</hi> How little addition could the rejecting the <hi>Cross, Surplice,
&amp;c.</hi> with the rest, have made to their strength? What he citeth
out of <hi>P. Martyr,</hi> is abundantly answered <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. for he speaketh
not of Vestments used in, but out of Worship, about which, he would
not have such Contentions made at such a time, but have them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
afterward. The Dr. citeth his words Indefinitely, <hi>Other
Reformed Churches;</hi> but the Author's words are, <hi>Per multas Ecclesias
n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n ab evangelio alienas.</hi> I suppose he meaneth the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
<hi>Greek Churches;</hi> for <hi>P. Martyr</hi> well knew; That in the rest of
the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> no such Vestments were used.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 28. Let us now hear his Third Reason, <hi>to shew their consent
with other Protestant Churches;</hi> and he instanceth in the <hi>Lutheran</hi>
Church. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This Reason could not be used by the English
Reformers, because they would surely rather have imitated the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinist
Churches,</hi> with whom they agreed in Doctrine, than the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran
Churches,</hi> from whom they differ'd in considerable points of
<hi>Doctrine;</hi> if they had designed to symbolize with other Churches;
and had been influenced in their determination of this matter by
that design, sure they would have symbolized with the <hi>soundest
Churches. Ans.</hi> 2. Neither could this Reason have had any weight
if they had used it, seeing there were m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> of a
contrary Practice; and therefore the <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> would
have carried the rejection of the Ceremonies; whether the notes had
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95366:39"/>
been <hi>ponderanda</hi> or <hi>numeranda. Ans.</hi> 3. If our <hi>Reformers</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
a Consent in Ceremonies with the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, why
did they retain these, and not the rest used among them, which are
(most of them) as little liable to Exception, as those retained, and
are not by their multitude such a burden as those of the <hi>Papists?</hi> I
hope the Dr. when he considereth better, will retract this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for there is no <hi>Reformed Church</hi> on earth, that the Church
of <hi>England</hi> sheweth any Consent with in her Ceremonies. <hi>Ans.</hi> 4.
I have elsewhere shewed, from good Authority, That the <hi>Lutheran</hi>
Churches at first had no humane Ceremonies, but what they now
have, crept into those Churches afterward, as other Evils did, which
<hi>Luther</hi> did not authorise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 29. He will not only have <hi>Lutherans,</hi> but the chief among
the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> to be of his Opinion. He citeth, <hi>Calv. Ep. ad Sadol.</hi>
That <hi>he was for restoring the Ancient Face of the Church:</hi> His words
(which I found not easily in that long <hi>Ep.)</hi> are, <hi>Vt instauretur ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tusta
illa ecclesiae facies quae primo ab hominibus indoctis &amp; non optimis
deformata &amp; foedata, postea a pontifice Romano, &amp; ejus factione, flagitio
se lacerata &amp; prope deleta est.</hi> It is evident, that he is not speaking
of Ceremonies only, but mainly of the Doctrine of the Church, that
was in Controversie between him and the <hi>Cardinal:</hi> Also, that it is
the <hi>Apostolick Church</hi> that he speaketh of, whose Face he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
to have been deformed before <hi>Antichrist</hi> came to an height.
He citeth also <hi>Calvin de vera Eccles. Reformatione,</hi> ch. 16. which Book
I find not in the Catalogue of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Works; only among his
<hi>Tractatus Theolog.</hi> I find a <hi>Supplex exhortatio</hi> to the Emperour and
Diet at <hi>Spire, De necessitate reformandae Ecclesiae;</hi> which I have diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lookt into, and find no such Passage in it, but much contending
against Humane Ceremonies: And he apologizeth for their casting
them out, by shewing, <hi>Quod nihil vel primo digito attigimus, nisiquod
christus pro nihilo ducit, cum frustra coli Deum humanis traditionibus
pronunciat.</hi> Wherefore, if <hi>Calvin</hi> owne <hi>Symbolical Ceremonies</hi> (as
the Dr. alledgeth) we must understand him of those of <hi>Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi>
or charge him with Inconsistency with himself. <hi>Oecolampadius</hi>
(saith he) <hi>lookt on the Gesture in the Sacrament as indifferent;</hi> so do we;

secret dislike of the Ceremonies, but the Act of Conformity being passed,
and the Vse of the Liturgy strictly enjoined, there was no Separation;
some of them accepted of Preferment in the Church: The Bishops shewed
kindness unto them for their Zealous Preaching.</hi> A few remarks on
this, will serve to clear our way. 1. It seems the <hi>Episcopal Party</hi>
had not such respect, as was fit to the Consciences of their dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Brethren, in that they were getting Laws made, to force
them to that, which they could not perswade them to by the Gospel:
but this is the Old Spirit of that party, which still createth trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the <hi>Church.</hi> 2. That some of them accepted of Preferment
(and these he nameth; <hi>Gilby, Whittingham,</hi> are among them, whom
<hi>Fuller</hi> placeth in the Ranck of <hi>fierce Non-conformists,)</hi> sheweth how
loath they were to divide from their Brethren, as long as they
were suffered to keep their Consciences undefiled. 3. He omitteth
to tell us, that these men would never subscribe to the <hi>Liturgy,</hi>
nor use the <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> which Mr. <hi>Fuller, Lib. 9. p.</hi> 76. informeth
us of, that <hi>not only these fiery men</hi> (as he calleth them) <hi>but even
the moderate Non-conformists, as Mr.</hi> Fox, <hi>Mr.</hi> Lawrence Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,
refused to subscribe. 4. It was a commendable piece of
Moderation in the then Bishops, that they suffered these Men to
Preach; notwithstanding of their <hi>Non-conformity.</hi> Indeed there
was cause for it; they were able and useful men, and the Church
had much need of their Labours: <hi>Fuller</hi> saith, p. 65. <hi>Tolerability
was Eminency in that Age. A Rush Candle seemed a Torch, where no
brighter Light was seen before;</hi> where he telleth us of a Sheriff's
Preaching for want of other to do that work, and how sorrily he
performed it. If the present Bishops would exercise the same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
they needed not to be afraid of <hi>Separation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 31. He proceedeth to tell us, that these <hi>Non-conformist
Preachers first let fall their dislike of Ceremonies, and gaining Ground,
they called them the Livery of Antichrist, and enflamed the People, and
this was the first Occasion of pressing Vniformity with Rigor: Some
were silenced; as kindness had made them Presumptuous, this made them
Clamorous.</hi> Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> giveth another account of this matter, p. 76.
<hi>The English Bishops conceiving themselves Impowered, by their Canons,
began to shew their Authority, in urging the Clergy of their Diocess,
to subscribe to the Liturgy, Ceremonies, and Discipline of the Church;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95366:40"/>
and such as refused the same, were Branded with the Odious Name of
Puritans;</hi> and p. 81. He sheweth how <hi>Ministers</hi> were contented,
before <hi>B. Grindal</hi> (one of the most moderate, but pressed to Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
by the rest) who asked them, have we not a Godly <hi>Princess,
speak, is she Evil?</hi> A Question fitter for the <hi>Inquisitors</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi>
than a Protestant Bishop. That the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> preached
against the Ceremonies, is neither to be doubted nor wondered at;
so did our Lord and Master, and his Apostle <hi>Paul:</hi> It was their duty
to teach people to observe all that Christ hath Commanded, that
being their Commission; if they spake Falshood, or Truth in an
undue manner, they were liable to Correction. What our Author
calleth inflaming the People, others will call faithful warning of
them, against what might displease God, and defile their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
Any who enflameth them to unsober, or unpeaceable
principles or practices, let them bear their blame. I see nothing
in their Carriage, under the Bishops forbearing of them, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eth
the Name of presumption, nor under their Sufferings, that
should be called <hi>Clamorousness, as the Dr. calleth their informing
their Friends at</hi> Geneva, <hi>how they were used.</hi> But it is the Spirit of
that party to use cruel Severity against them, that differ from them,
and reproach them, if they say they feel it: <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Stoical
Apathy</hi> are not the same thing. There is nothing yet said by the
Dr. that can cast the Blame of Separation on the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi>
or free the Bishops of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 32. He saith further, p. 19. at the end; <hi>About this time the
dissenting Party being exasperated, by silencing some of their most Zealous
Preachers, began to have separate Meetings, where they Preached and
Prayed, and had the Sacraments.</hi> Here we have out of the Mouth
of an Adversary, the true Cause and Original of the Separation,
tho' somewhat unfavourably represented; the cause of it was, they
could not have Gods Ordinances, without Mans Inventions, their
Ministers being silenced, who administred them purely; and
tho', but some of them at first were silenced, yet the rest were
under the same Condemnation by the Law, and daily expected the
Execution of the Law on them; and all the People could neither
have the ordinances by those that were as yet unsilenced, nor could
they live without them: So that it was not Exasperation, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to wait on God in his own Ordinances, that made them take
that course. This account of it themselves give (as the Dr. hath
it, p. 20. before the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> whose Discourse to them the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95366:40"/>
Dr. relateth, unbecoming the Moderation of B. <hi>Grindal,</hi> charging
them with <hi>lying pretences,</hi> without any Ground mentioned, and
unbecoming the Learning of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> charging them with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 33. The next thing he insisteth on, is, <hi>Beza</hi>'s advice to
the Ministers and people; who, tho' he sheweth his dislike of the
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and adviseth the Ministers not to subscribe; yet pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the silenced Ministers not to Exercise their Function a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the will of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and the <hi>Bishops:</hi> And the People
to wait on the Word and Sacraments; notwithstanding of the
<hi>Ceremonies;</hi> that they might by these means obtain a through <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:</hi>
And to Ministers, he saith, that they should not leave
their Functions for the Sake of the <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> In which Advice
the Dr. doth much insult. How impartially <hi>Beza</hi>'s opinion in this
case is represented by the Dr. I know not, not being able at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to get a sight of the Book; but some other Citations already
examined, make me jealous; especially, seeing the Dr. maketh <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi>
contradict himself; for p. 21. he maketh him advise the silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Ministers to live privately, and not exercise their Functions
against the Will of the Q. and the Bishops. But p. 22. he maketh
<hi>Beza</hi> say to them, that the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are not of that moment,
that they should leave their Functions for the sake of them. But
whatever were <hi>Beza</hi>'s opinion, <hi>Non-conformists</hi> of old and late,
took the Word of God, and not the Authority of Men, for the
Rule of their Faith and Practice: They honour such as <hi>Beza,</hi> and
are ready to receive Instruction from them; but must have leave
to examine all by Scripture, as the <hi>Beraeans</hi> did the Doctrine even
of <hi>Paul.</hi> Again, <hi>Beza</hi> is far from advising Ministers to forbear
Preaching a together, because restrain'd by the Magistrate: That
principle never obtained among Protestant Divines; and is to be
examined afterward; but he disliked their publick appearance in
that case, which may be constructed a Defiance and Contempt of
the Magistrate. For they had hired a Hall in <hi>London</hi> (as publick
as any <hi>Church)</hi> for their Meetings. Christ's Apostles were private,
with the Doors shut, when they might not be publick, and so
should we; and yet not give over Preaching and Hearing when
Men forbid us: We should do it peaceably and inoffensively; but
do it notwithstanding. For his Advice to the People, I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it; yet doth it not reach our Case; for he adviseth to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi>
for the present, with express mention of their Hope of a
further <hi>Reformation;</hi> which we are out of all hope, that ever our
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95366:41"/>
Clergy will yield to. In <hi>Beza</hi>'s Resolution of a Case mentioned by
the Dr. p. 23. I desiderate one cause of <hi>Separation</hi> from a Church,
(to wit) <hi>Imposing unlawful Terms of Communion,</hi> unless either
this be comprehended under the <hi>right use of the Sacraments,</hi> that
he mentioneth; or such withdrawing be not properly a <hi>Separation,</hi>
but a being driven away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 34. He saith, this Advice of <hi>Beza</hi>'s put <hi>an effectual stop to
the Separation.</hi> I find no such thing in History, but rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
The same opinion he citeth of <hi>Gaulter ep. dedicat. in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil.
ad 1. Ep. ad Corinth. &amp; Zanchie ep. lib.</hi> 2. p. 391. where <hi>Gualter</hi>
complains of the Lyes and Prejudices against the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
I wish it have not been Lyes written by that party, that made him
write so, and <hi>Zanchie</hi> is even for <hi>Ministerial Conformity.</hi> It is an
easie thing to gather Scraps and Sentences out of mens. Writings,
that represent them as speaking what they never thought; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more ordinary with this Author, than to perswade
himself. (at least to endeavour to perswade his Reader)
that all the World are of his opinion. It is enough to us in this
matter, that the Reformed Divines beyond Seas, did not use the
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi> but have condemned them, and that on such Grounds,
as make them unlawful to be used, (to wit) that they are <hi>Vain
Worship, Additions to the Word of God, the Symbols of Popish Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
&amp;c. and if notwithstanding of all this, any of them would
perswade us to use them; their <hi>Doctrine</hi> doth hinder us to obey
their <hi>advice,</hi> which we look on as an overlash of Charity to the
then good <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who were Labouring to <hi>Reform</hi> the
<hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Popery.</hi>

for Adversaries to represent <hi>true Zeal</hi> as <hi>fierceness;</hi> but if there
was undue forwardness among them, we defend not the Faults of
Men; but the Truth of God, which they owned. There was a

for the Complaint that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> maketh of them, which he Citeth
out of <hi>Fuller, Ch. Hist. lib.</hi> 9. p. 106. If the Circumstances be
considered, it will be found not to prove what the Dr. bringeth
it for. We must know then out of the same Author, that the
Complaint in this Letter was against some particular men in <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
College, who were no Representatives of the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi>
that it was not occasioned by any of their Principles, or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Practices, but by a particular injury done by these men to Mr.
<hi>Fox,</hi> as he thought: And Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> was as likely to be byassed in
the matter, in Controversie between him and these men he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of, as they were: The Matter was, his Son <hi>Samuel</hi> had left
the College, and gone beyond Sea, without leave either of his
Father, or the College; and at his return was suspected of <hi>Popery;</hi>
and for this, he was by that party, that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> is so angry with,
expelled the College. Beside all this, any who readeth that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>'s, may see a Strain, and meet with Expressions
very unbecoming Old, Reverend and Good Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
professed himself a <hi>Non-conformist;</hi> tho he had more Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
about the use of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> than some others had: <hi>Factiosa
ista puritanuorm capita; isti ter puri puritani,</hi> and some other foul Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
with the odious name that Enemies gave to that Party,
are very unsavory from such a Pen: But Age and supposed Injury,
must bear the blame of the peevish strain, that is too manifest
throughout that whole Letter. It were a hard case, if the faults
either real or supposed of some, were always to be charged on
all the Party: The Dr's own Party would be black enough, if
they were thus dealt with; and even the Historian, no Friend to
the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> calls this Letter such a Strain of Rhetorick, as
once <hi>Tully</hi> used, <hi>pro Domo sua;</hi> and imputeth the too much pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

and Second, presented in the Name of the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> to the
Parliament, by Mr. <hi>Thomas Cartwright:</hi> But I see not by what
he citeth out of these <hi>Admonitions,</hi> wherein the bitter Zeal of
that Party appeared: Neither that they despised <hi>the old Trifling
Controversy about Garments and Ceremonies;</hi> for these were still the
Grounds of their <hi>Non-conformity;</hi> tho they complained also of
other Grievances. Neither do I find that they said all was out of
Course in the <hi>Church;</hi> they owned the Protestant Religion; but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95366:42"/>
desired, that the <hi>Reformation</hi> might be more through, by laying
aside some of the Remainders of <hi>Popish Superstitions,</hi> formerly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt.
I wonder why the Dr. should startle so much at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining

their Clergy, the Ceremonies annexed to the Sacraments;</hi> which are
the Grievances by these <hi>Admonitions</hi> laid before the <hi>Parliament,</hi>
with an humble Petition for redressing of them. Seeing he knoweth,
that these are the very things that our Controversie is Conversant
about; and, tho' all these be not the Grounds of our withdrawing
from their Worship, yet all of them are such things as we are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with, and desire a <hi>Reformation</hi> of. That he calleth them <hi>bold
and groundless Assertions,</hi> is a more bold and groundless Assertion than
any of them; for, he knoweth, Grounds have been given; which
it were better to refute, than rail at. It is also strange, that he
saith, That these <hi>Admonitions</hi> gave the true occasion to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Practice of <hi>Separation;</hi> when himself assigneth another Cause

maintained <hi>with greater Heat than Learning,</hi> is the Dr's Dialect, not
seldom occurring. That they <hi>courted the Vulgar most,</hi> is like some
others of his Representations; if they did, they acted not wisely:

that doth not much move us; we are content that they enjoy their
Pomp and Greatness, if they will let us enjoy the Worship of God
in purity and peace. That this will inferr a Principle of Levelling

taketh in their way, in contemplation of the <hi>fat Rectories, Prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Deaneries,</hi> and <hi>Bishopricks</hi> that they daily have in view? but
such ways of Reasoning, I reckon fitter for the vulgar, whom he so
much despiseth, than for Scholars. He telleth of a <hi>mighty Interest
they got among the people,</hi> and compareth this prevalency with that
of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> What if we should compare the
prevalescency of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> among the Clergy and others, with that
of <hi>Popery</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and elsewhere, Arguments one as strong as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
That <hi>others would refine on us, as we refine on the Church,</hi> is a
Plea against us, that would well suit, and hath been often used by
Papists, against our deserting them. If others do that which is
wrong, because we do what is right, we are not accountable for
that. If he can make it appear, that our Principles lead to other
mens evil practices, we shall disown such Principles. I know not
what Name to give his Assertion, that the consequence (to wit, the
<hi>Brownist Separation)</hi> seemed so unnatural from their own (the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi>'s)
Principles; for nothing can be more rashly or falsly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
It behoved the Dr. to attempt the proof of this, not barely
to assert what is so injurious to his Brethren, and that he might
well know that they would be far from owning. All that we have
from him as a Colour of Proof, is a most unfair representation of
what the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> had said, That the Church had <hi>neither

<hi>Historical Labyrinth,</hi> about the Non-entity of <hi>Separation</hi>
from the <hi>Church</hi> by the first <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> and found how little
Truth or Candour there is in his Account of these Matters, and how
little that little Truth, that is in his Histories, doth make against
our Cause; I shall now attend him in his <hi>Historical Collections,</hi> to
prove, That when Separation began, it was vehemently opposed by
the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> who were dissatisfied with many Corruptions
in the Church. By the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> who opposed the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he cannot mean all the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> the <hi>Separatists</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
being also such; but that among the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> some
were for Separation from the Church, and others opposed it. And
so it is at this day; some are dissatisfied with humane Inventions in
the Worship of God, and yet have more Freedom than some others
of their Brethren have to use them.</p>

and expedite. The first thing that I premise, is, That if I should
grant all that the Dr. discourseth, from p. 27. to 29. the end of his
First Part, it would conclude nothing against our Cause, for it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth
only to this; That some good men were not of our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
nor practised as we do, but used the Ceremonies, tho' they
were dissatisfied with them. If Arguments from the Authority of
Men could satisfie our Consciences, we should not be <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists;</hi>
for the Hinge of the Debate between us and our <hi>conforming</hi>
Brethren, is, Whether God ought to be worshipped according to
the Prescript of His own Word, and that in all the parts of His
Worship, greater and lesser; or, may in some of them be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
by the <hi>Traditions of Men.</hi> We expect Divine Authority
for every thing whereby we worship God, and cannot rest on that
of Men. And therefore, if the Dr. could prove, That all men that
ever were (who were not infallibly guided) did worship God by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95366:44"/>
                     <hi>Humane Traditions,</hi> this cannot warrant us to do so. And yet this
doth not inferr <hi>Self-will,</hi> or <hi>pretending to be wiser, or more consciencious
than all men;</hi> yea, or any men; (an Objection frequent in our
Brethrens Mouths, and more frequent with Papists against Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants)
for it is not Will, but Conscience, guided by Scripture-light,
that we are determined by: And we are alwaies ready to receive
Light from the Word, if our Antagonists can hold it forth to us,
tho' it were to the changing both of our Opinion and Practice:
And we judge no Man's Light nor Practice; they stand and fall to
their own Master; <hi>let every one be fully perswaded in his own Mind:</hi>
But we dare not be so far the <hi>servants of Men,</hi> as to subject our
Light and Conscience to them. If we may retort without offence,
It seemeth to us a less fault (if it be any) to seem wiser than those
that have gone before us, (if differing from them import so much)
than it is in our Brethren to seem wiser than Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
from them they do manifestly and confessedly differ, in the
things we now controvert about.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. Another general Consideration that I premise, is, That there
are such considerable Differences between the old <hi>Church of England,</hi>
in which these <hi>Non-conformists</hi> lived, and this new Edition of it, who
now require <hi>Conformity</hi> from us, that their Example cannot, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
be judged sufficient to oblige us; even Apostolick Example, in
some cases, is not declarative of what is our duty, as it is in other
cases: Beside that, the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> then were sound and
orthodox, and the Doctrine of the Pulpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s and Press was fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to the Doctrine of the Church, contained in their <hi>confession
of Faith,</hi> the 39 <hi>Articles.</hi> Now, it is far otherwise with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part, (I am far from charging all with this blame); who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not how frequent (yea, almost universal) <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine
is? How some of them preach and print <hi>Socinianism,</hi> and without
a check from the Church? and, How many Popish Doctrines are
either maintained or extenuated by some, is too well known by
them who converse in <hi>England.</hi> In the Old Church of <hi>England,</hi>
pious men were cherished: In This, we know how not only <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters,</hi>
tho' never so sober and religious, are persecuted to their
utter undoing: But men of their own way, who are sober and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
are by the <hi>High-Church-men</hi> discountenanced and slighted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the nick-name of <hi>Whigs</hi> or <hi>Trimmers.</hi> So that, if we judge of
the <hi>Church of England</hi> by her <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> and the Temper
of her ancient Clergy; the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> with a few of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:95366:45"/>
do best deserve that Name. But this, tho' it be our great
grievance and discouragement from Communion with the Church,
is none of our Grounds for withdrawing from her publick Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. I say then further, as I did of the <hi>Church</hi> in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
6's time, That Church was a reforming Church; even in the
beginning of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> Reign, they were about purging out of
the old Leaven; and therefore many good men, who were dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with <hi>Humane Trash</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> yet cleaved to publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
notwithstanding, till a better Season should appear for
purging it out (tho' I think they did better who stood at a greater
distance from these Relicks of <hi>Superstition.)</hi> But we are out of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of <hi>Reforming</hi> of these things: What Attempts have been
made by Arch-bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> Bishop <hi>Cozens,</hi> and others, to re-intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
some of the ejected Ceremonies, is not unknown; and what
superstitious Gestures and Practices are used by many without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of Superiours, which yet are not imposed, but are at
present a sort of <hi>candidate Ceremonies,</hi> and stand in the place of the
<hi>Competentes</hi> or <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> waiting for a fit Season to be brought
into necessary and universal observation, none is ignorant, who know
any thing of <hi>English</hi> Affairs. The Advances that the present <hi>Church
of England</hi> hath made toward Popery, not in these things only, but
in greater matters, cannot be obscured by any thing that the Dr.
hath said against the Book written to that purpose; of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
If our Ancestors bare with these <hi>Fopperies</hi> when they had
Hope to get them removed, as other things of the same kind had
been a little before, it doth not follow, that we should comply with
them, when we see them like to grow upon us; yea, when we see
them made use of, as an Engine to drive away the best Protestants,
that Popery may the more easily re-enter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. Another <hi>Difference</hi> between our Case and that of <hi>Non-conformists,</hi>
in former times, is, We have been in full and quiet pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the pure Ordinances of God, without the mixture of mens
Inventions, as they never were: Therefore their using of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
was only not going forward, but our doing so were going
backward. Sure it was not so great a Fault in the People of <hi>Israel,</hi>
to be slow to entertain <hi>Moses,</hi> proposing a Deliverance to them out
of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as to talk of returning back thither: Nor in <hi>Lot,</hi> to
linger in <hi>Sodom,</hi> as in his Wife to <hi>lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k back</hi> toward it. I hope these
Comparisons may be pardoned, not being intended to equal the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95366:45"/>
Evils to be shunned, but to illustrate the greater Evil of Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding,
than that of Continuing in a thing that is amiss; <hi>Licet
magna componere parvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> If any Objection be made against the
way that we came into that Possession, I shall not dispute the Truth
of that Allegation; but the thing being our due, by <hi>Gospel</hi>-Right,
we were to <hi>stand fast in the Liberty wherewith Christ had made us
free, Gal.</hi> 5. 1. I do not know, that their freedom from Ceremonies
could be defended at Man's Bar, though, I am sure, it could at
<hi>GOD</hi>'s Bar, and so can ours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. A <hi>Third Difference</hi> is; At this time, Ministers of ancient
standing, and approved usefulness in the Work of the Gospel, who
had received Ordination in the way mentioned in Scripture, by
<hi>the laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery;</hi> which is also the way of
Ordination used in most <hi>Protestant Churches;</hi> must be re-ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
otherwise they cannot be Ministers of the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
nor the People enjoy the benefit of their Labours: Which <hi>Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
was never heard of in the <hi>old Church of England,</hi> nor the Need
of it ever asserted: <hi>P. Martyr, Bucer,</hi> and others that came from
beyond Sea, had the Right Hand of Fellowship given them in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as Ministers of Christ, without that. Neither was it ever heard
of. that I have met with, in any of the <hi>Churches of the Reformation.</hi>
Therefore People then might hope to enjoy God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s Ordinances
from those that dispensed them purely; which we cannot in your
Church; and consequently, we have more cause to seek them
where they may be had, than our Ancestors had. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There
never was in the <hi>Protestant Church of</hi> England, before our days,
such a number of the Lord's Harvest-men thrust out of his Work,
for their not complying with <hi>Humane Ceremonies</hi> in God's Worship,
Two Thousand (some say more) in one day, before they
were silenced, one, or two, or three, and that for some real or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
personal Misdemeanour: For, tho' there was an <hi>Act of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi>
in the beginning of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> Reign, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t <hi>Non-conformists</hi>
preached, and People heard them: But here such a number laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and that mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly for <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> and the People out of all
Capacity to enjoy pure Ordinances in the Church. Here was some
more Reason for having the Ordinances by themselves, than was
before. And, to make this difference between our Case and that
of our Ancestors, more considerable, these Ministers were silenced
by the Church, (tho' <hi>clave errante)</hi> ours only by the Magistrate, who
never prete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ded a Power to give or take away <hi>Ministerial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95366:46"/>
Fifthly,</hi> We are under the solemn Oath of God against
<hi>Superstition,</hi> (under which Head we reckon the Ceremonies) which
our Ancestors were not: And we cannot see how our using of them
consisteth with our keeping of that Oath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. A Third general Consideration to blunt the edge of all
this Historical Discourse of the Dr's, is, That the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>paration</hi> that
the <hi>old Non-conformists</hi> did so much oppose, was quite another thing
than that which he can charge upon us. It is of two sorts, that of
the <hi>Brownists,</hi> or <hi>rigid Separatists,</hi> who denied the Church of <hi>England</hi>
to be a <hi>True Church,</hi> but held it for an <hi>Antichristian Soci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ty,</hi> and
therefore not to be communicated with. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d that of the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi>

but thought it unlawful to join with them, because of the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of scandalous Sinners with visible Saints, that was among them.
<hi>Separation</hi> on the first Ground is well refuted by the <hi>old Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists;</hi>
and that of the second, by the <hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi> and other
<hi>Presbyteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e indefensible. But our <hi>Separation</hi> (if it may be so called)
is pass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h many things that are a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to us, and which we wish to be reformed, rather than have Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Meetings. We own the Parishes of <hi>England</hi> as the Church
of Christ; the <hi>Petition for Peace</hi> is a publick and authentick witness
of all this; but our Brethren will have no Communion with us,
unless we will own the Ceremonies that they, without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from Scripture, impose on us, which we cannot do without
sinning against God, and wounding our Consciences; and we can
and do give good Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Let then any Indifferent Person judge, Whether it be fair
dealing to condemn our not joining in the publick Worship of the

Separations. But occa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>y against it.</hi> If the Dr. would prove any thing
against us, he must shew, That there was no forbearing of publick
Ordinances, on account of scrupling the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> by the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi>
before this, the contrary of which I have shewed: Also,
That it was <hi>Separation</hi> on that account, and no other, that they
wrote against, the contrary of which is most evident. He may
know, that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> now do differ nothing from the <hi>old
Non-conformists</hi> in this; for they have as much set themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the same sort of <hi>Separation,</hi> and can make it appear, that
this is no way unsuitable to their own Principles or Practice. It see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
by what the Dr. citeth out of Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> that the Separation
was charged on him, as laying a Foundation for it by his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
just as it is now with us. If the <hi>Dr.</hi> can charge any of us with
<hi>bitterness</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> the two Characters given by <hi>Parker,</hi> to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratists;</hi>
let the Guilty bear their blame: But I am sure our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
that he is angry with, import no such thing; and therefore
such an oblique Reflection on us in general, is not Brotherly dealing.
We love not to recriminate.</p>

by <hi>Barrow</hi> and <hi>Greenwood,</hi> against the <hi>Separation,</hi> Three of them
were taken out of the <hi>Admonition,</hi> given in by the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> to
the <hi>Parliament.</hi> He here exposeth these <hi>Non-conformists</hi> that then
were, as very ridiculous men, who laid down Reasons for Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and yet were so much against other mens practising what
they gave Reason for. If he think them such men, why would he
bind us to their Authority, which is the tendency of this long Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course?
But the <hi>Dr.</hi> doth both mistake and misrepresent this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
His Mistake is, In the <hi>Admonition</hi> these things were presented
as Grievances, to be redressed, not as Grounds of Separation. His
Misrepresentation is, These Monitors did not speak of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
Government, and Worship, as wholly unlawful, antichristian,
and false; for they owned the Ministry and Worship (whatever
thoughts they had of the Government) as right for the substance,
tho' vitiated by some Modes adhering to them, which they desired
to be removed. It is true, <hi>Gilford</hi> saith, they make a <hi>vile Schism;</hi>
rending themselves from the <hi>Church of England;</hi> but doth he not
add, <hi>And condemning by their Assertio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

World, even as the Donatists did of old time?</hi> Which sheweth, that it
was not scrupling of <hi>Humane Ceremonies</hi> that they are charged with,
but nullifying of Churches, because of some Corruptions in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>Gilford</hi>'s words that follow, p. 29. we are not concerned in: We
know, that many were the sad effects of that <hi>Separation,</hi> diverting
People from the serious Exercises of Religion, to Janglings. And
it is not without this effect on some, where the oppressed Party
is Innocent, as to the main; but that proveth not, that we should
comply with unscriptural Ceremonies, to shun this Evil, but that
they should not be imposed on us. As to <hi>Gilford</hi>'s blaming them,
for not coming to the <hi>Book-Prayers,</hi> this he spake without Book,
either in the heat of Disputation, in which many do over-reach;
or, it was his Opinion, but is not ours. I agree with <hi>Gilford,</hi>
That <hi>the Corruptions of the Church of</hi> England <hi>did not make her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian;</hi>
and therefore the <hi>Brownists</hi> were to be blamed in <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating</hi>
from her as <hi>Antichristian;</hi> not we, who are ready to join
with her as a Church of Christ, but cannot digest her <hi>Humane Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi>
in Divine Worship. That <hi>Gilford</hi> was a <hi>Non-conformist,</hi>
the Dr. needed not to be at so much pains to prove. That all
<hi>Non-conformists</hi> are fallible men, and some of them mistaken in some
things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we willingly grant. We also close with what his next Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
saith, p. 30. That he is a Member of that <hi>Church,</hi> where he is
by Providence placed, and that he ought not to separate from it
while it is a true <hi>Church,</hi> only with this Exception, Unless that
<hi>Church</hi> require me to sin; and if I will not do so, exclude me:
Which Exception it could not be expected that he should menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

down the concessions of these <hi>Separatists,</hi> (to wit) That <hi>the
Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>is sound and saving; that they will
not separate for every blemish in the Church.</hi> So far we agree. But
they pleaded (saith he) that the Corruptions of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
were such, as overthrew the very <hi>Constitution of a Church;</hi> in
which we differ from them, as he saith <hi>p.</hi> 33. the <hi>old Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi>
did, of whom he saith that they held, <hi>That nothing could justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95366:47"/>
Separation from the Church, but such corruptions which overthrow the
Being of it.</hi> And he saith, <hi>The force of all their Reasonings against
the Separation, lay in this, and the denying of such corruptions to be in
the Church.</hi> For proving of this, he sheweth, That the <hi>Separatists</hi>
thought nothing could justifie their Separation, but that which <hi>nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified</hi>
the <hi>Church;</hi> and it is no wonder, for they minded nothing but
an active <hi>Separation,</hi> and not that of being driven away by sinful
<hi>Terms of Communion</hi> imposed. It is true, they mention the <hi>Service,</hi>
as one of their Pleas for Separation, but not barely as unlawful to
be used, but as <hi>nullifying the Church</hi> which we never pleaded: For,
what he addeth, p. 35, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> when they
would <hi>disprove the Separation,</hi> only proved the <hi>Church of England</hi>
to be a True Church: It is no wonder that they minded no
more, seeing that was to overturn the very Foundation of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Cause. But, Did they ever teach, that we ought to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with a <hi>true Church</hi> in those parts of her Worship that are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?
which is the one half of the Controversie that we now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.
He insulteth much in an Assertion of the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi>
p. 36. at the end, That <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>is a true Church of
Christ, and such a one, as from which whosoever wittingly and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
separateth himself, cutteth himself off from Christ.</hi> I might say as
much as all this, without giving the least advantage against our
Cause; for we do not separate our selves, but the Door is shut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, by as many Bars as they have imposed <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which
we cannot use without Sin, and they will not suffer us to worship
God with them without these. Again, We do not continually se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from the <hi>Church,</hi> but are ready and waiting to return to
Communion with her in all Ordinances, whenever these sinful Bars
shall be removed that keep us out; the <hi>Separatists</hi> could say nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these. That the <hi>old Non-conformists</hi> did not understand
their Assertion of such a Case as ours is, is evident; for they were
men of so much Sence and Reason, as that they could not imagine
it impossible, that any should lawfully withdraw from joining with
a <hi>Church,</hi> because of sinful <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> required: They
could not blame any Member of the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> to refrain
from the Communion of that Church, if that Communion were
denied to that Member, unless he would either approve of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Nicolaitans,</hi> or at least consent to the tolerating of it.
Such is our Case; we are denied Christ's Ordinances in the <hi>Church,</hi>
unless we will approve, by our practice, the Ceremonies which we
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95366:48"/>
judge sinful; with what Face can they blame us, for doing that
which themselves put us into so great a Necessity to do? Have we
not rather cause to take up <hi>David</hi>'s complaint against them, 1 <hi>Sam. 26. 19. They have thrust us out from the Inheritance of the Lord, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
go serve other Gods.</hi> Had it been fair dealing to call <hi>David</hi> a
<hi>Separatist</hi> in his Exile, because he waited not on the Temple Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice?
And yet the Necessity that he was under, of abstaining from
it, was not so great as ours: That was Bodily Hazard, ours is Soul
Hazard by sinning against God.</p>

Assertion, p. 36. prove no more than what is already granted, as
any that readeth and understandeth them, may perceive. What
he bringeth out of <hi>Jacob</hi> against <hi>Johnson,</hi> and <hi>Ball</hi> against <hi>Can,</hi> is
nothing against us; to wit, That <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>is a true
Church.</hi> From p. 39. He sheweth that <hi>Non-conformists</hi> held, That
the Corruptions of the <hi>Church of</hi> England, were not such as did
over-throw the Being, and Constitution of it, which we willingly
yield to. What he Citeth out of other <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> p. 40, 41.
about <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> shall be examined
in its due place; if the Lord permit. I know some <hi>Non-conformists</hi>
have had, and some now have a greater freedom to use it than
others have: But as now there are, so of old there were, others
that could not comply with it. What ever was <hi>Giffard</hi>'s opinion
about the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> being <hi>Antichristian;</hi> if he thought them Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to be used (which is our Question) I know not why he
should be reckoned a <hi>Non-conformist:</hi> But indeed there is nothing
of that, in what the Dr. Citeth, p. 41, 42. What he bringeth, p.
42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47. out of several <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> to shew that
the <hi>Ministry, Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of the <hi>Church of</hi> England, is
not <hi>Antichristian,</hi> nor the <hi>Church-Antichrist;</hi> we are not concerned
to disprove, and the Dr. might have spared all this Transcribing,
it being wholly beside the question. Some things he maketh them
say, that deserve a little Animadversion; but I will not now Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress

Separation,</hi> and how it was opposed by the <hi>Assembly</hi> of
<hi>Divines,</hi> by such reasons as will hold against the present Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I confess there is a <hi>present Separation,</hi> that these Reasons do
hold against; for that same <hi>Separation</hi> doth still continue: But he
doth not prove his point, unless he make it appear that these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

conclude, that we should use the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> rather than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear

what he saith, we shall attend in their course. What reflection the
Dr. thinks to cast on the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> by the breaking of <hi>Brown</hi>'s
<hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Midleborough;</hi> and his jugling in the Matters of God, I
know not. This long Story hath either no design, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
impute to a Man of his Parts; or an ill design, which I am
loth to impute to one of his Worth. However it be, we disclaim all
concern in it. There have been Breaches and Apostasies among
others, as well as among <hi>Non-conformists.</hi> That a nameless Author

was such a bad Man, as the Dr. maketh him: But I know some of
these Meetings that the Dr. is so displeased with, are blessed of the
Lord. He imputeth these and the other Dissentions that followed,
to the Judgment of God on them; this we are no way concerned
to Apologize for: Their way was Evil, and it did not prosper:
If the Doctor can prove our way to be Evil, let him pass what
Judgment he will on what befalleth us, but till then, Sobriety in
judging is becoming. No doubt the <hi>Papists</hi> thought they had as good
cause to construe Providence to favour them, because of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions,</hi>
and <hi>Ruin</hi> that followed in <hi>Germany,</hi> on the <hi>Reformation.</hi> We
have Sins enough to provoke the Lord against us; but we are not
convinced, that the Things in Controversy are to be reckoned among
them. Let the Dr. impute this to our <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> at his pleasure,

they thrust us out from Word and Prayer too, by denying us all

in the <hi>Church</hi> of our own choice. This Discourse against the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Separation,</hi> I meddle not with, and therefore pass over all
that he saith, from p. 53. to 59. only touching Two or Three Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages.
What Mr. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n</hi> saith. p. 54 of the principles of the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
inserting <hi>Separation,</hi> is so far True, that their holding the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95366:49"/>
unwarrantableness of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> doth inferr on them
who act conscientiously, that they should rather refrain from join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with any <hi>Church,</hi> than own the one, or use the other: And if
these be made the necessary <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> with a <hi>Church,</hi> we
must suffer our selves to be <hi>separated</hi> from such Imposers. p. 59.
Some complaining of the <hi>Mischief</hi> of <hi>Impositions</hi> (a Word the Dr.
is very angry with) because unordained men were not suffered to
Preach, when and where they listed, is no fit Parallel to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
that others make of the <hi>Mischief of Impositions,</hi> when they are
Excluded the <hi>Church,</hi> for not using <hi>Humane Ceremonies:</hi> In the
one case there is restraint of what is contrary to Scripture; no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
in the other. That is imposed to be done, which is without

                     </gap>rtifices the
Dr. reacheth at, that he may ridicule our unwillingness to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on by Man's VVill, in the VVorship of God. p. 58<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he saith,
<hi>Presbyterians would not have all left to Conscience:</hi> Who ever said
otherwise; or can say otherwise, unless they would first burn their
Bibles? We never made <hi>Conscience</hi> the <hi>Rule;</hi> it must be guided and
ruled by Scripture. What he saith of <hi>Popular Government,</hi> let them
answer it who are concerned. He saith, <hi>Humorous and Factious
People, will always be complaining of the Mischief of Impositions.</hi> (This
Title of Mr. <hi>A</hi>'s Book, is a great Eye-sore to him) but he should
consider that on the other hand, an <hi>Imperious, Superstitious Clergy,</hi>
that will be <hi>Lords over Gods Inheritance,</hi> in dispite of the Apostles
Words, will always be <hi>Imposing,</hi> and take it ill that any should
think their <hi>Impositions</hi> a Burden; as wise and sober Men may do
without being either <hi>Humorous</hi> or <hi>Factious.</hi> He saith, <hi>the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Liberty of Conscience, will unavoidably lead men into Confusion.</hi>
Many think that such indistinct and rash Assertions, are more like
to lead Divines into <hi>Confusion,</hi> in managing their polemick Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.
Must <hi>Conscience</hi> then be bound Hand and Foot, and carried
whither the <hi>Prelate</hi> pleaseth? Will even Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> own Mr. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>'s
Notion of the <hi>Publick Conscience?</hi> Hath <hi>Conscience</hi> no use, but
to discern what is my <hi>Lord Bishop</hi>'s Will, or what the <hi>Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
saith? We are as far from owning an <hi>unbounded Liberty of
Conscience,</hi> as the Dr. is; but the absolute denying of all <hi>Liberty of
Conscience,</hi> is liker to lead Men into <hi>Atheism,</hi> than giving them
some <hi>Liberty</hi> to lead them into <hi>Confusion.</hi> Let <hi>Conscience</hi> then have
<hi>Liberty,</hi> where it hath Scripture warrant for what it holdeth (which
is the <hi>Liberty</hi> we plead for to our selves) and let it not be rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95366:49"/>
dealt with in things that are of lesser Moment in Religion,
where they that profess <hi>Conscience,</hi> are otherwise sober and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
and there is no hazard of confusion from <hi>Conscience.</hi> It is
a more innocent thing, where it is rightly dealt with, than the
Dr. taketh it to be, and we think it is more to be regarded, than
the Rules of Order and Government in a <hi>Church,</hi> which the Dr.
seemeth to bring in Competition with it. I mean such Rules as
are but of mans devising. It is false, that <hi>the Presbyterians cannot
Answer Independants, as to the pretence of Conscience; nor they the
Anabaptists.</hi> For the one can refute the other wherein they mistake,
and tell them that <hi>Conscience</hi> cannot make their Error to be a Truth:
And yet they can bear with Godly and Peaceable Men in these
mistakes, because of their <hi>Conscience.</hi>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. He telleth us, <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. That <hi>the Presbyterians charged
the Dissenting Brethren; with being the occasion of an inundation of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
by their going upon the principle of Liberty of Conscience.</hi> I am
far from justifying that <hi>Toleration,</hi> which the <hi>Independants</hi> pleaded
for, and which (by their means, some say) was used in our late
times of Distraction: Then there was no <hi>King</hi> in our <hi>Israel.</hi> All Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
should be opposed: Gross Error punished and restrained
by force: But will it hence follow, that we must not have leave to
Dissent, even from those things that the <hi>Church</hi> imposeth, without
Warrant from the Lord? <hi>All the Citations</hi> that the Dr. bringeth,
p. 59, 60, 61. are evidently against a vast <hi>Toleration.</hi> The <hi>Vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
in Religion, that the <hi>Scotch-Commissioners</hi> speak of, is not to be
understood of <hi>Words in Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Humane Ceremonies</hi> (for would
they not then have first setled that way at home?) but of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and Discipline, and Worship so far as commanded by
Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. The Dr. is pleased to give himself the Trouble, from
p. 61. to 73. to transcribe the Substance of the many and large
debates, that were between the <hi>Assembly of Divines,</hi> and the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Brethren:</hi> But he will find it hard to apply the condemning
of their Separation to our Case: For they refused Communion
with the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> whom they could not charge with requiring
them to use any mode of Worship, but what was commanded: They
left the <hi>Church</hi> for supposed Corruptions, which were none of
their personal fault, nor were they put under a necessity of approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. VVe are willing to have Communion with the <hi>Church,</hi>
if we may be suffered but to forbear these personal <hi>Accusations</hi> that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95366:50"/>
were our Sin, if we should do them. But let us hear what conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
the Dr. draweth from these Debates, p. 73, 74. The <hi>1st.</hi> is, That
<hi>the Old Non-conformists thought themselves bound in Conscience to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and did look on Separation from
it as Sin, notwithstanding its Corruptions.</hi> This he thinketh he hath
so proved, that the shining of the Sun may as easily be denied: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it hath been disproved in what is above discoursed, and with
what measure of clearness, let others judge; also how inconcludent
mens Authority is in Gods matters, hath been shewed. The <hi>2d.</hi>
Conclusion is, That <hi>all Men were bound in Conscience toward preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Vnity of the Church, to go so far as they were able: So that
the lawfulness of Separation, where Communion is lawful, is one of
the newest Inventions of this Age.</hi> This conclusion I easily yield to:
and who are the Inventers and Maintainers of the Contrary, I
know not. I hope he will not blame us, when we are thrust out
of the <hi>Church,</hi> that we do not lie about the Church-walls; rather
than go to another place, to Worship God by our selves. If we
do any thing but what we can shew Christ's command for, let him
blame us. <hi>3d.</hi> Conclusion. <hi>Bare Scruple of Conscience doth not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
Separation, altho it may excuse Communion in the particulars
scrupled; provided they have used the best means for a right Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
I do so fully Assent to this Conclusion, that I shall say more than
the Dr. doth; to wit, that bare scruple of Conscience, cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
even Communion in the particulars scrupled, whatever means
have been used for Information: For Scruples that have no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
Ground (and what else can be meant by <hi>bare Scruples,</hi> I
know not) make an Erring Conscience; which however it may
excuse <hi>ae toto,</hi> can excuse from nothing, <hi>in totum.</hi> But if our Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
such as they are, (and we may say, we have used the best
means that we could for Information) do excuse us from Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the particulars Scrupled, and if by the force of rigid Men,
we be deprived of Gods Ordinances, unless we will communicate
in these scrupled particulars; I hope the Duty that lyeth on us
to worship God, and not live like <hi>Atheists,</hi> will so far warrant that
which the Dr. will call <hi>Separation;</hi> that it will be hard for him to
disprove it, unless he retract this conclusion; by which he hath
given a sore Blow to his cause. I oppose to this regardlesness
of Mens Consciences, that the Dr. seemeth to allow himself in, the
Judgment of the Excellent Judge <hi>Hales</hi> in his piece of <hi>Schism,</hi> who
saith, <hi>That nothing absolveth from the Guilt of Schism, but true and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95366:50"/>
unpretended Conscience:</hi> Also, that <hi>requiring the doing of an unlawfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
or suspected Act, is a just cause of refusing Communion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. Conclusion 4. <hi>Where Occasional Communion is lawful, constant
Communion is a Duty.</hi> I suppose he meaneth of that particular <hi>Church,</hi>
in which a Man is a Member, and hath his constant Residence; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it is manifestly false; for it is lawful for me to have Occasional
Communion with the Protestant <hi>Church of France;</hi> but that I am not
constantly bound to Communicate in <hi>England,</hi> if my Occasions
call me often abroad. But take it in the most favourable Sense,
the Assertion is not true: It is lawful to have Occasional Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with a <hi>Church</hi> that hath one Ordinance pure, <hi>Exemp. Gr.
Preaching:</hi> I may as occasion serveth join in that Ordinance, but
if there be nothing else pure, or that I can partake of without Sin,
in that <hi>Church,</hi> I am obliged to look after another Occasion, where
I may enjoy all Gods Ordinances without sinful additions; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
got that opportunity, I do not see what Obligation lieth on
me <hi>constantly</hi> to hear in that <hi>Corrupted Church,</hi> rather than where
I enjoy all the Ordinances in Purity. What he alledgeth out of
the <hi>Assemblies Reasons,</hi> against the <hi>Dissenting Brethren,</hi> doth not all
quadrate with our case; for the <hi>Congregational Men</hi> could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that any unlawful <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> were imposed on them
by the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> in one Ordinance more than another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if they might join in one Ordinance, they might in all; and
so had no excuse from constant Communion, if occasional Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
was lawful. But this question about occasional and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Communion the Dr. bringeth in afterward; therefore enough
of it at present.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. Conclusion <hi>5th.</hi> That <hi>withdrawing from the Communion
of a true Church, and setting up Congregations for purer Worship, or
under another Rule, is plain and down-right Separation, as is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the Answer of the Assembly of Divines, to the dissenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
It is strange that this Learned Author, should Cite these
Men for condemning our Practice, who were of the same Principles

Dr. <hi>Burgess,</hi> Mr. <hi>Case,</hi> Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Newcomen,</hi> &amp;c. whom he

from a true <hi>Church</hi> that they condemned (for such is both

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95366:51"/>
of Communion</hi> on her Members) but a Separation for pretended
Corruptions in a true <hi>Church,</hi> which Corruptions were not impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
on the Separaters, either to be practised or approved of by
them, and so could not become their personal Sin. This Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they condemned; and that with good reason; for where the

the Old Non-conformists: Nor by the Doctrine of the Assembly of
Divines.</hi> The former I have disproved, tho' he saith, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t's clear by
undeniable Evidence:</hi> The latter, he saith, is, in effect, confessed
by all his Adversaries; to make out which he citeth in the Margin,
Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Owen:</hi> For the latter, no wonder he confess
it, seeing he was for that very Separation, which the <hi>Assembly</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
And the former is yet alive to speak for himself: And it is
as little wonder that he should say so; for he denieth that any of
<hi>Assembly</hi> were <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> I have already shewed that the
the <hi>Assembly</hi> might well Assert, That Separation from a <hi>true Church</hi>
was <hi>Schismatical;</hi> the men that they debated against, separating
or such Grounds, as either proved the <hi>Church</hi> false; or gave them
no colourable ground for that <hi>Schism:</hi> But they could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it without Exception. He taketh a great deal of pains, p. 75.
to prove that any difference that is between our <hi>Separation,</hi> and
that which the <hi>Assembly</hi> condemned, is but in some Circumstances,
that do not make the one unlawful, and the other not: But that
it is otherwise is clear, if we consider (as hath been said) that
they had no thing Imposed on them as Duty, and as <hi>Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
which had been their Personal Sin to do, as we have. If
this make not a material, and pertinent Difference, I <hi>know not what
can do it.</hi> But, saith he, <hi>the Assembly used general Reasons, that have
equal force at all times. Ans.</hi> These general reasons may suffer an
Exception; which they did not, nor needed not mention, because
it was not the case in hand: Nor do we make the Difference to lie
between that and this time; but between their and our Grounds of
<hi>Non-communion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 19. He saith, <hi>it cometh to the same point, whether the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
(on which men separate) relate to some Ceremonies required, or
to other Impositions, as to Order and Discipline; if they be such as they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95366:51"/>
pretend to a necessity of Separation. Ans.</hi> 1. The Dr. then maketh no
difference between a Scruple that hath ground for it; and one that
hath none. If he can make our Scruple appear to be groundless, as
he confesseth theirs to be, he hath advantage against us. <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. Is
there no difference between having probable grounds for a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and having no such grounds? Is there any comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
scrupling at using <hi>Religious Ceremonies,</hi> that have no warrant
in the word, but are in general, at least, condemned in it, and
scrupling at some pretended Corruptions, that no Scripture Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth?
<hi>Ans.</hi> 3. If the Dr's reasoning be good, either we must
bear with none that scruple, unless we scruple the same thing: Or
we must bear with all that Scruple. The first of these excludeth
all Christian forbearance; the last he will not alledge. <hi>Ans.</hi> 4. He
mentioneth <hi>Impositions as to Order and Discipline,</hi> only that we may
seem Imposers as well as his party is; that is unreasonable, not
only because we can shew Christ's Laws for our Order and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
which he will not pretend to shew for the <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> But
also because we can bear with sober and faithful Brethren, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
approve of all that we do; which his Party will not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. He mistaketh the Case when he insinuateth, That <hi>we
have no more but scruple of Conscience to plead.</hi> The Dr. should not
have alledged this, till he, or some of his party had answered all
our Reasons of Scrupling, in many Books, neither touched by him,
or any other: But now he will Knock down our cause with one
blow. He saith, <hi>he put the Case as clear as possible, to prevent all
Subterfuges, and slight Evasions.</hi> He supposeth five scrupling Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<hi>one at the Liturgy, a Second at the Cross and Kneelling, a Third
at wrong gathered Churches, a Fourth at Infant Baptism, a Fifth at
Preaching by set Forms, and being stinted by an Hour-glass:</hi> And he
saith, <hi>the Nature of the Case doth not vary according to these.</hi> If
this be the Dr's <hi>Herculean Argument,</hi> we shall not need to fear his
Strength so much as before. Surely the Learned Dr's parts could let
him see more Reason to bear with sober and intelligent men,
who dare not join with a <hi>Church</hi> in worshipping God, by <hi>Religious
Ceremonies</hi> not instituted by Christ, than with Fantastick <hi>Quakers,</hi>
who cast off God's Ordinances, because of an Hour-glass; but that
his prejudice doth, in this, darken his understanding. But the
Tendency of his Discourse seemeth to be; either Church-Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
must lead us Blind-fold, so as we must scruple nothing impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
or neither Scripture, nor Reason shall limit our Fancy; but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95366:52"/>
we may scruple what we will. He saith well, p. 76. (and the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> before him had said it) <hi>If they alledge Grounds to justifie
themselves, they must do it</hi> ex natura rei, <hi>and not from the meer errour
or mistake of Conscience.</hi> We will most willingly join issue with
him on this Condition, provided the <hi>natura rei</hi> may be judged by
Scripture, as all the Worship of God should be. If he can prove
the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that we scruple, to be such as we may use without
Sin; or, if we prove not the contrary, let him call us as <hi>vile Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratists</hi>
as he pleaseth. If the Dr. had pleased at first to hang the
matter on this Pin, and not to have filled his Book with so many
Citations, to strengthen his Cause with Humane Authority; he
might have saved both himself and me all this labour, that hitherto
we have been at. It is no great commendation either of the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or of the sobriety of his Church, that he saith, <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> hath as much
occasion (cause</hi> he should have said) <hi>to judge their</hi> (the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)
<hi>scruples unreasonable, as they do those of the Quakers.</hi>
                     </hi> What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
about occasional communion, is answered above. That
which he citeth out of Mr. <hi>A.</hi> of the <hi>Assemby's</hi> being transported
in the heat of Dispute, is not so derogatory from that venerable
Meeting, as he would make it: It is rare to find it otherwise with
sinful men. How many things did thus slip from the Pens of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that the Dr. will not approve? But we do not
hereby give up the Cause to the dissenting Brethren, nor forsake
the <hi>Assemblies</hi> Principles; it is one thing, not to approve all that
men say, and another thing to condemn the Cause that they plead
for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 21. Our Author doth next undertake <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. to shew how
<hi>we have deserted the Principles of the old Non-conformists, as to private
Persons reforming Church-Discipline, setting up new Churches, and the
preaching of Ministers, when silenced by the Laws.</hi> For the setting up
of <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> he citeth several <hi>Non-conformists</hi> against
it, without the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> p. 78, 79, 80, 81, 82. To all which, I
answer, That two things are expresly in these Citations, that make
what they condemned not, to reach our Case: For, 1. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
private mens endeavouring a <hi>publick Reformation,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the <hi>Magistrate;</hi> so it is thrice expressed, p. 81. out of
<hi>Confut. of the Brownists.</hi> Now we meddle not with a <hi>publick Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
otherwise than by our Prayers and Advice, as we have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
(which is there also expresly allowed by them) but content our
selves to serve God privately, when we cannot do it publickly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95366:52"/>
Sin. To this same purpose is that which is cited out of <hi>Giffard,</hi>
p. 79. That <hi>tho' every one ought to keep a good Conscience, yet no private
Persons are to take on them publick Authority to reform.</hi> If we do so,
blame us for it. 2. These <hi>Non-conformists</hi> all along speak of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Persons reforming the Discipline of the Church. Now, what
is done among us of that kind, is done by Ministers, who, though in
the State they are private persons, and therefore are not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with matters of that concern: Yet in the <hi>Church</hi> they are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
persons, and have Authority from God, to dispense his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
But I do not, by what I have said, intend to homologate
all that the Dr. citeth out of these <hi>Non-conformists;</hi> several things
they assert, that cannot well be defended; but I shall not digress so
far, as to particularize them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. I shall only say, That had this Principle <hi>of not refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the Ordinances of Christ by People, among themselves, till the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
gave countenance,</hi> taken alwaies place in the World, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Christianity</hi> had not come in the place of <hi>Jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ism,</hi> but <hi>Arrianism</hi>
had extinguished the <hi>Orthodox Profession.</hi> Have we not Examples of
People who were under <hi>Arian</hi> Bishops, setting up new Bishops over
themselves, in <hi>Epiphan. Haeres. 73?</hi> Doth not <hi>Hilary</hi> exhort the
People to separate from <hi>Auxentius,</hi> their <hi>Arian</hi> Bishop, <hi>adversus
Arianos,</hi> when yet there was no <hi>Orthodox Magistrate</hi> to countenance
these things? Yea; had this Principle obtained, there had been
no <hi>Reformation</hi> from <hi>Popery,</hi> in most places, where now, through the
Lord's mercy, it is. Say not, that our reforming of Worship and
Discipline is not in things of that moment; for tho' that be true,
yet it is not of no moment; without it we should either join with
men in Sin, or live without the Ordinances of God. Let me here
make use of the Testimony of a worthy Person, one whom the Dr.
afterward bringeth against us; and therefore, in reason, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
his Suffrage, (tho' we are far from hanging our Cause on mens
Opinions, as the Dr. doth) that is, the learned <hi>Monsieur Claude,</hi> in
his excellent Book called, the <hi>Historical Defence of the Reformation;</hi>
the design of which, is, to shew, that every man hath a right to believe
the truth, and to dissent from Errour, and to profefs this, and to
reform Religion, by setting up Religious Assembles, for the true
Worship of God; when they cannot have Truth, nor right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in that which goeth under the name of the Church. He saith,
(Part 2. p. 169.) <hi>As it is ridiculous to demand of a man, in a civil
Society, what personal Call he had to live, to labour, to avoid that which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95366:53"/>
would be hurtful to his Life, and to have a care of his own Preservation;
so it is also an Absurdity to demand of our Fathers, what Call they had
to believe aright in God, and to worship him purely, and to remove far
from them all that which they believed to be contrary to a spiritual life,
and their own Salvation.</hi> And much more to this purpose. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth,
p. 170. <hi>Is not this to rend the Church by Divisions?</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth,
<hi>No; for the Vnity of the</hi> Church <hi>lieth not in Errour, or false
Worship; it is love to the</hi> Church, <hi>to endeavour her cure, by shewing a
good example.</hi> And, <hi>Part</hi> 4. p. 14, 15. When it is objected, That
the Protestants could not separate, because their Pastours were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; he answereth, <hi>That many Pastors went along with them;
and if that had not been, they might have chosen Pastors;</hi> all which he
discourseth at length. We have an Example of setting up God's
Ordinances without, yea, against the Laws of men, in the Word.
It is clear from <hi>Ezr.</hi> 5. with <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 21. that the Temple was built
against Law: And it is clear from <hi>Hog.</hi> 1. 2. that it was the
Peoples Sin, that they neglected it so long, even when Law was
against them; and that they ought to have done it before <hi>Haggai</hi>
and <hi>Zechariah</hi> put them on it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 23. Next the Dr. (p. 82.) bringeth in some <hi>Non-conformists</hi>
condemning Ministers Preaching, after they were silenced. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to any that readeth, p. 82, &amp; 83. that it is <hi>silencing</hi> by the
<hi>Church</hi> that is there spoken of; but our restraint is by the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi>
only, who doth not pretend to give nor to take away Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
power. <hi>Pag.</hi> 86. he bringeth Mr. <hi>Bradshaw</hi> reasoning against
Ministers preaching against the will of the <hi>Magistrate;</hi> but in the
First part of Mr. <hi>Bradshaw</hi>'s Discourse, it is evident, that he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
only against publick Preaching in such a place, in defiance of
the Magistrate, and running on the Sword's point, or opposing
Sword to Sword; which we are far from either practising or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving.
I confess, p. 87. he is for the Ministers <hi>living privately;</hi>
yet saith expresly, that he is to labour mean while privately, upon
particular occasions offered, (why they may not be also sought, I
know not) to strengthen and confirm in the ways of God those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that are deprived of his publick Labour. If this be not an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of his private preaching, I understand it not: But. <hi>Mr.</hi>
Bradshaw <hi>will have the People to submit to the Ministry of another in
publick, with the liking of the Magistrate, tho' he would have them to
affect and love the former as their Pastor.</hi> How congruous this Advice
is, I shall not enquire, not laying so much stress on mens thoughts
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95366:53"/>
of things, as to be turned out of our way by them. But Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi>
seemeth to speak of a Case wherein the <hi>Magistrate</hi> is offended
with a Minister on some personal account, and another is set over
the People, with whom they may as lawfully join, as with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
but that doth not come near to our Case, in which Ministers
are restrained, because of a Scruple common to them and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that join with them; to wit, using the Ceremonies. Would he
have the People, over the belly of Scripture-light, to join with the
new Incumbent in <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and not rather enjoy the Ordinances in
purity, tho' in private, from their own faithful Pastor? I cannot
see how that can be gathered from his words; but if it was his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
we crave leave to differ from him. Beside, Mr. <hi>Bradshaw</hi> did
never advise, that some Thousands of Ministers being all laid aside
at once, should deprive the <hi>Church</hi> of their more private Labours,
when they were forcibly restrained in publick: The <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi>
in former times, were not in our Circumstances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 24. The Dr. is now come to his <hi>Triarij,</hi> his last Argument
to prove what was the general Sence of the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> in this.
It is Mr. <hi>Sprint</hi>'s Argument for Conformity, rather than to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived;
to wit, That <hi>a lesser Duty should cede to a greater:</hi> He sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
Conformity and Preaching to be a greater Duty than ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
from the <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> And he confirmeth this (it seemeth)
by the Apostles, who, he saith, submitted to the <hi>Jewish Ceremonies,</hi>
rather than lose the Liberty of the Ministry. The Dr. I see, hath
not <hi>kept his best Wine till the end of the Feast;</hi> this is one of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
of his Allegations; for the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> had an easie Answer
to this Argument, that here a Sin, and forbearing a Duty, are brought
in competition; which maketh an easie choice, to wit, using <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Ceremonies,</hi> with <hi>not preaching in publick.</hi> What he saith of
the Apostles using the <hi>Jewish Ceremonies,</hi> is quite out of our way, for
these <hi>Ceremonies</hi> for a time were indifferent, as all acknowledge;
bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, that ever any of the Apostles used them, after the full promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
of the Gospel, and the Destruction of the Temple, when
they became not only <hi>mortuae,</hi> but <hi>mortiferae,</hi> (as the Schools speak) we
utterly deny. But even what he maketh the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> answer,
concerning the greater usefulness and necessity of the preaching of
the Apostles, than of their preaching, maketh nothing for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign:
Nor doth it prove, that they did not think that the Apostle's,
<hi>Wo be unto me, if I preach not the Gospel,</hi> did reach to their Case; for
it can import no more, but that if such a great necessity might war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95366:54"/>
some things otherwise not warrantable, (as the <hi>abstaining from
things strangled, and Blood,</hi> was warranted; yea, made necessary by a
present necessity) their publick Preaching was not of that moment;
and it was only their publick Preaching that was hindred by their
<hi>Non-conformity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have got through the Thicket of his <hi>Historical Coll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN the Second Part of his Book, the Learned Dr. enquireth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the nature of the <hi>Separation.</hi> (I wish he had taken as much
pains to find out the true Cause of it, and to get that remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved);
where he considereth the several Principles, on which he
alledgeth, That the several sorts of <hi>Dissenters</hi> do proceed in their
separating from the <hi>Church.</hi> I am not obliged, nor shall I endeavour
to defend all these; the owners of them not agreeing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
let every one stand up for his own Principle. But there is
one general Principle that I think <hi>Non-conformists</hi> agree in, That
the <hi>Church of England</hi> imposeth some unlawful <hi>Terms of Communion,</hi>
and because of not submitting to these, she excludeth the <hi>Dissenters</hi>
from her Communion; and being thus excluded, they think it
their duty to worship God apart by themselves, when they are not
suffered to do it with the Church without Sin. If any do add to
this other Principles, I leave the defence of them to their Authors.
This is to be further opened in the <hi>Third Part;</hi> where the Dr. exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth
the several <hi>Pleas</hi> for <hi>Separation.</hi> He is pleased to take a great
deal of pains to refute some things, as insufficient Grounds for <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi>
which some Dissenters have mentioned in their <hi>Books,</hi> as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
motives; there being other sufficient Reasons for <hi>Non-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
which never any of them owned, as the sole ground of their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
or a sufficient Reason for not joining with the <hi>Church</hi> by it
self. This is to set up a man of Straw, that he may get a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
by bearing him down. Instances enough of this kind will occurr
in our progress. I shall consider what is argumentative against the
Principle already mentioned, that I hold.</p>

                  <head>SECT. I. Some Opinions about Separation from the Church of
England Examined.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Dissenters,</hi> with reference to the Principles of their with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
from the <hi>Church,</hi> he divideth into two sorts: 1. Such
as hold <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>occasional Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church,</hi> lawful;
but not <hi>total</hi> and <hi>constant Communion;</hi> and that they may chuse
Communion where there is greater purity and edification. 2. Such
as hold any Communion with the <hi>Church</hi> to be unlawful, because
they believe the Terms of its <hi>Communion</hi> to be unlawful; such as
the <hi>Liturgy, Cross, &amp;c.</hi> This distinction is unhappily stated; for,
1. <hi>Non exhaurit divisum.</hi> There is a third sort, who hold <hi>partial</hi>
and <hi>occasional Communion</hi> lawful, but not <hi>total</hi> and <hi>constant,</hi> and yet
believe the <hi>Churches terms of Communion</hi> unlawful; and because of
that Belief, cannot communicate <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>constantly</hi> with Her.
We can hear a Sermon, join in Prayer, without partaking in any of
the unlawful <hi>Terms of Communion,</hi> to wit, <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Liturgy;</hi>
but we cannot enjoy other Ordinances; and often we are even
excluded from these by their <hi>Excommunications,</hi> and therefore
must seek the Ordinances elsewhere. 2. <hi>Partial</hi> and <hi>Occasional
Communion</hi> are not the same thing; nor <hi>total</hi> and <hi>constant,</hi> as to
the lawfulness of them. One may have <hi>communion</hi> with you, and
that not only <hi>occasionally,</hi> but <hi>constantly,</hi> in God's Ordinances that
are kept pure; and yet refuse <hi>communion</hi> with you in your own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
and in those Ordinances of God, that ye have so annexed
those devices to, that the one cannot be had without the other.
And there are some that practise accordingly; they wait on your
Sermons and Pulpit-prayers <hi>constantly,</hi> but refuse the rest of your
Worship. 3. I think there are few, if any <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> that think
the <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> with your Church lawful, and can keep <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional
communion</hi> with Her, and yet <hi>separate</hi> for greater purity and
edification. If any such be, they make a causeless <hi>Separation</hi>
indeed.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. He will now proceed with all clearness, (which he hath
not done in the fore-mentioned distinction) and consider three
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95366:55"/>
things; 1. What things are to be taken for granted by the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Parties. 2. Wherein they differ among themselves about the
nature and degrees of <hi>Separation.</hi> 3. What the true state of the
present Controversie about <hi>Separation</hi> is. For the first, he saith,
<hi>There are three things that we cannot deny.</hi> And I say, There is not
one of the three, but they are to be denied, or at least distinguished,
and not admitted, as he setteth them down: The first of them is,
<hi>That there is no reason of Separation, because of the Doctrine of our
Church.</hi> I do cordially agree with the learned Authors, whom he
citeth in the proof of this, p. 95. That there is no cause of <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> or refusing communion with all
Her Congregations, on account of that which is the <hi>Doctrine of the
Church,</hi> contained in the 39 <hi>Articles;</hi> for we assent to them all as
true, except those about <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> and we would not
<hi>separate</hi> from the Church, because of Doctrinal mistakes in these
things, if the owning of them were not <hi>imposed</hi> as <hi>Terms of our
communion</hi> with Her. But it is not so easie to perswade us, that
there is no just cause to withdraw from the Communion of some
particular Parishes in <hi>England,</hi> where <hi>Arminianism</hi> or <hi>Socinianism</hi> is
commonly taught; where the practice of Godliness is ridiculed,
and Principles striking at the root of it, are instilled into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;
such as, That <hi>all the aids of the spirit that men pretend to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that are above that Exercise of their own Faculties, that is in their
own power, is but fancy; that the Person of Christ is not to be minded by
Christians, but only obedience to his Laws; that, Resting on Christ, Rolling
the soul on him, are no fit expressions of Faith.</hi> What would the Dr.
have serious Christians, who are concerned about the Salvation of
their Souls, do, when such a Minister is set over them? Shall they
hear him? That were to sit down to a Table, where Poison is
strewed over all the Meat, and it is hard, if not impossible, at the
best dangerous, to pick out a wholsome bit. And it is contrary to
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s Advice, <hi>Prov. 19. 27. Cease, my son, to hear the Instruction
that causeth to erre from the words of knowledge.</hi> They who would
have such Doctrine heard, but not received, may as well advise to
go to the Stews, but not commit Fornication. Should they complain
to Superiors, against the erroneous Preacher? But what if they get
no redress, and the Heretick be countenanced and dignified, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that all this is known to the World, by the Press, as
well as the Pulpit? What if such a Case as this, or little less evil,
be not rare? Ought not people to seek their Souls Food in corners,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95366:55"/>
when they cannot have it in the publick Assembly, being mean
while ready again to join with the Assembly, when the Lord shall
remove this stumbling-block?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. The Second Concession of his Adversaries, that the Dr.
setteth down, is, That <hi>there is no other Reason of Separation, because
of the Terms of Communion, that what was from the beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi>
A sufficient refutation of this may be seen, <hi>Par. 1. Sect.</hi>
1, 2, 3, 4. If he can tell of some Alterations that have been made
to the better, we can tell, and have told of others made to the
worse. It may be, <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> thinketh <hi>Lay-communion</hi> easier than
before; he thinketh it so easie, that he practiseth more of it than
his Brethren can do. But that is no proof. What he objecteth
from the practice of the Martyrs is above answered. The Third
Concession; That <hi>Communion with the</hi> Church of England <hi>hath been
still owned by the Reformed Churches abroad.</hi> I have before answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this also, shewing, That though some of the Divines, (for no
Churches ever gave any hint to that purpose) in their condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
have shewed aversion from our withdrawing, yet they have
laid down Doctrinal Principles, that necessitate what they are so
averse from. Their <hi>receiving the Apology and Articles of our Church
into the harmony of Confessions,</hi> the Dr. bringeth as an Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Separation from Her: But it is a frivolous Argument, both
because the Collection of these <hi>Confessions</hi> is not the work of the
Churches, but of a private Writer; as also, because the Author of
that Book reckoning <hi>England,</hi> among the Protestant Churches, doth
not by so doing oblige all to submit to her unlawful <hi>Impositions.</hi>
What <hi>Durel</hi> hath said, or he or others can say of the good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. The Second thing that he insisteth on, he beginneth,
<hi>Sect.</hi> 2. to examine the several Hypotheses and principles of <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
that are at this day talked of among Dissenters: He saith,
some seem to allow <hi>Separate</hi> Congregations only in such places, where
the <hi>Churches</hi> are not capable to receive the Inhabitants. And this
he groundeth on some passages, wherein some had defended their
Meeting-Houses by this Consideration, that all the Inhabitants in
<hi>London</hi> could not hear in the <hi>Churches.</hi> But did ever any of them
say, that this was either the only, or main reason of their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95366:56"/>
or was it not rather brought as an Additional Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to blunt the Edge of that Clamour, that was raised against
<hi>Non-conformists</hi> Preaching, by them, who neither could benefit the
People themselves, nor would suffer others to do it; whereas the
<hi>Non-conformists</hi> had other reasons for not joining with the <hi>Church,</hi>
but worshipping God without <hi>Humane Mixtures,</hi> in other Assemblies?
But even that reason might have some weight, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> against
the Silencers of <hi>Non-conformist</hi> Ministers: I hope to give better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in due time and place, for the <hi>Non-conformist</hi> Ministers Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But I am very free to declare, that in a <hi>Church</hi> where there is no
cause of withdrawing from her Ordinances, this alledged is not
sufficient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. Some, saith he, <hi>Sect. 3. do allow Communion with some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Churches in some Duties, and at some Seasons; but not with all.
Churches, in all Duties, and at all times.</hi> And from this he chargeth
the <hi>Separation</hi> as a Mystery, as if we dealt not openly and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
in setting down our opinion. But I ask the Dr. who of the
<hi>Non-conformists</hi> did ever thus express their opinions without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Explication? And if none have, it is not Candour so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
us: We desire not to walk in the Dark, nor are we asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of our Principles. We profess then, That in Parishes, where
Truth is Preached, and not dangerous Error, and in those Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
to which no <hi>Humane Ceremonies</hi> are annexed, as Preaching
and Prayer; and when we are not obliged to wait on the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
in those Assemblies, where we have all the Ordinances in
purity, as we cannot even in the Parish mentioned, because of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
<hi>Impositions</hi> made the <hi>Terms of our Communion</hi> with them: I
say thus, we can join with them; but not otherwise. I hope there
is no Labyrinth in this Declaration of our opinion.</p>

principles with the <hi>Old Separatists;</hi> which he prove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h of some of
the People, out of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s reproof of them for their unsober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
I know the Reproofs of that Learned Author, were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
dealt at Random: But if any of the People have undue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of things, and understand not so well as need were,
what they profess, will that ruin our cause? Is there no such
blame among his Party? Do they all speak Judiciously, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
and with no Tincture of <hi>Popish Principles</hi> in managing their
<hi>Conformity.</hi> But he will (p. 103.) have even our Teachers to
come near to the principles of the <hi>Old Separatists; for what matter
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95366:56"/>
is it,</hi> saith he, <hi>as to the Nature of the Separation, whether the Terms
of our Communion be called Idolatrous or unlawful? whether our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
be called a false or insufficient Ministry? scandalous Vsurpers and
Persecutors? Whether our Hierarchy be called Antichristian, or Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Institutions of Christ? Ans.</hi> 1. A difference sufficient to
make our <hi>Separation</hi> lawful, and theirs unlawful, is, that we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
being put away by the <hi>Church,</hi> for not submitting to unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Terms of Communion:</hi> These left the <hi>Church,</hi> and would not join
with her, even tho' these <hi>Terms</hi> had not been imposed; looking
on the <hi>Church</hi> as no true Church. <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. Whatever fault we
find with the Ministers of the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> we do
not <hi>separate</hi> because of these; we would join with you for all these
Grievances, if you would but suffer us to do it, without sinning
against God in that, which is our personal Action. I hope he will
not alledge, that the <hi>Old Separatists</hi> were of that principle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. But this, to wit, that we are of the same principles with
the <hi>Old Separatists,</hi> the Dr. will <hi>make manifest:</hi> And that, 1. <hi>As
to the People. 2. As to the Ministers of the Church. As to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Sect.</hi> 4. he saith, <hi>We disown the Old Separation; and yet make
the Terms of Lay-communion for Persons, as Members of the Church
unlawful.</hi> This I own, save that I am not willing to contend with
him about the Term, <hi>Members of the Church;</hi> let the thing be
understood, to wit, that we think it unlawful to join in the <hi>Liturgy</hi>
and <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> and seeing we cannot have Gods Ordinances with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
these, with the <hi>Church;</hi> we think it our duty to serve God
without these apart among our selves: Yet are ready to worship
God with the <hi>Church,</hi> when they shall please to suffer us to do
it, without these <hi>Impositions:</hi> This, I say, being understood; we
matter not much, whether he call this a casting off of <hi>Membership</hi>
with the <hi>Church or not.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> he saith, calleth it <hi>Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
in the Church, to deny Baptism without the sign of the Cross,
and God-fathers; and the Communion without Kneeling; and that
People, in this case, may join with other Pastors, that will otherwise
Baptize, and give the Communion.</hi> And I say the same: <hi>What is this,</hi>
saith the Dr. <hi>but formal Separation. Ans.</hi> It is nothing else. And
what hath he gained by that Concession? For who ever questioned
but there is a <hi>Separation</hi> in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> between the rigid
<hi>Imposers</hi> and the <hi>Dissenters:</hi> But the Question is, Who is the culpable
cause of the <hi>formal Separation;</hi> and consequently who are the <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks?</hi>
whether the <hi>Imposers</hi> or the <hi>Scruplers?</hi> I know no way to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95366:57"/>
this question, but by falling upon the Merits of the Cause, and
deciding whether the things scrupled be lawful to be used, and fit to
be imposed on them, who conscienciously scruple them, so as no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
should be used in them, what ever may follow. If both
these can be proved (as I am sure neither of them can) we were the
<hi>Schismaticks:</hi> If not, unbyassed men will adjudge that Epithete
to the Dr. and his Party. If he had pleased to put the Matter to
this Issue, the far greatest part of his Book might have been spared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. Neither hath the Dr. any advantage, by what he next bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out of Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> to wit, <hi>It may be Schism to separate from a
Church, that hath some Schismatical Principles, Practices, and Persons.
If these be not such, and so great, as to necessitate our departure from
them,</hi> for there is such a Case supposeable; yet we affirm, That the
<hi>Schismatical</hi> Principles, and Practices, and Persons in the <hi>Church
of England,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Clergy imposing</hi> the <hi>Ceremonies, as Terms of
our Communion</hi> with them, are such as Necessitate our departure:
Or rather, they do by these drive us away. The <hi>Old Separatists,</hi>
saith he, <hi>did not renounce total Communion with our Church; but held
Communion in Faith with us Lawful</hi> (so do we with all the sound
Christians in the World, tho' we hold no <hi>Church</hi> Communion with
them for want of opportunity) and <hi>private Christian Communion</hi>
(neither is this in the Question) <hi>and in some Acts of Worship, as
hearing and joining in Prayer, and yet were charged with Separation by
the Old Non-conformists. Ans.</hi> They were justly charged with <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi>
because their Principles would <hi>separate</hi> them from a <hi>Church,</hi>
that gave no just cause by unlawful <hi>Impositions;</hi> which ours do not.
The <hi>Separation Materially</hi> is the same; that is, here are two Parties
gone asunder, as were there: But not <hi>Formally;</hi> for their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was, The <hi>Church</hi> was no true <hi>Church,</hi> and Ministry and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
were Nullities. Ours is, <hi>Vnlawful Terms of Communion</hi> are
required; and for our Non-submission to these, we are expelled
by force. He saith, We must hold a Necessity of <hi>Separation. Ans.</hi> So
we do, as things now stand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But this Necessity is not of our mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but of our Brethrens making, and therefore they must bear
the blame of it. It no way followeth, which he inferreth, that
<hi>we must be Separatists:</hi> For it is an uncontroverted Truth, That they
only are <hi>Separatists,</hi> who <hi>separate</hi> without just cause, which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to be imputable to us. The <hi>medium</hi> that he insisteth so much
on, p. 104. is but a Quibble; to wit, either we are <hi>Members of
the Church of</hi> England, or of no <hi>Church,</hi> or of another <hi>Church:</hi> If
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95366:57"/>
the first we must Communicate as Members: If the Second, we are
no good Christians: If the Third, we own as <hi>formal a Separation,</hi>
as ever any did. All this hath been before answered, but the Dr's
repeated Importunity forceth Repetitions from us. I say then,
there is here <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. If we own our selves as <hi>Members</hi> of the
<hi>Church of</hi> England, it will not follow that we are obliged to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
with her in corrupted Ordinances, that is, her Sin to impose,
and were our Sin to yield to. There were <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Jewish
Church</hi> in her degenerate times, who sinned not in abstaining from
<hi>Baal</hi>'s worship, and the Groves, and High Places. If we should
say the <hi>2d.</hi> That we are at present Members of no <hi>Church,</hi> that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood

if a Man be cast into a place where there are no Christians to join
with, or none that will let him join with them, without he sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, he is not to be blamed if he Worship God by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
Every good Christian is a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Vniversal Church;</hi>
and ought to join himself to some particular <hi>Church</hi> if he can: But
it doth not always derogate from a Mans Christianity, that his
Circumstances are such, that he is not <hi>Actually</hi> in Communion with
any particular <hi>Church.</hi> If we should say the <hi>3d.</hi> it is true, we
own a <hi>Formal Separation;</hi> but the Culpable Cause of it is not in
us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. If any ask, which of these three we do indeed own? I
might answer as above, <hi>Section</hi> 7. that the Question is not very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,
and but about words. Yet seeing the Dr. seemeth to lay
such weight on the Word, <hi>Members of the Church,</hi> I shall open this
a little further. And <hi>1st.</hi> I say <hi>ad hominem</hi> by the Dr's Doctrine
we are not, nor never were (most of us) <hi>Members of the Church
of</hi> England; and therefore not capable of Culpable <hi>Separation</hi> from
her; on what ever accompt we <hi>separate:</hi> For he asserteth, <hi>part</hi> 3. p.
350, 351<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Minister in using the <hi>Sign of the Cross</hi> after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
and saying, <hi>we receive him into the Congregation of Christ's Flock,
and do sign him with the Sign of the Cross,</hi> &amp;c. doth speak in the name
of the <hi>Church;</hi> and so as Baptism is a rite of Admission into the
<hi>Catholick Church:</hi> So the <hi>Sign of the Cross</hi> is into our <hi>Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
I leave the Examination of the Truth of what he here asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to its due place. I only now consider, seeing this Learned
Author taketh this <hi>crossing</hi> to be the admitting rite into the <hi>Church
of</hi> England, how he can look on us as <hi>Members</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi>
who were never so admitted into it: And if we never were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95366:58"/>
in it, how can we be blamed for <hi>separating</hi> from it? But I am
not so fond of this notion of the Dr's coining as to excuse our <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
by it; I make no other use of it but <hi>ad hominem:</hi> And I think
it will be hard for him to Answer it. But I come <hi>ad rem:</hi> The
Term <hi>Church-member</hi> is a relative Term; it importeth a Relation
between a Person and a <hi>Church.</hi> Now in all Relatives, there are
the two <hi>termini,</hi> the Things or Persons related, and the <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
Relationis:</hi> That which maketh them so to be related one to
another; which must be something so particular to them, that it
is not common to them with all other persons or things. And
this is that we here enquire after. That which maketh our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the <hi>Vniversal Church</hi> is Baptism, and our visible owning
of our <hi>Baptismal Covenant.</hi> That which foundeth ones relation to
a <hi>particular Church,</hi> is the Obligation that he hath to join with that
<hi>Church;</hi> and the right he hath to be reeeived into its Fellowsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>p,
or admitted to the Ordinances in it. This Right and Obligation
is either <hi>remote,</hi> or <hi>proximate:</hi> A <hi>Remote</hi> right and obligation to
Communicate with every particular <hi>Church</hi> as occasion serveth,
every visible Believer hath; this is a part of the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi>
that they should join with one another, and receive one another as
providence giveth opportunity; and thus every visible Believer
is <hi>Aptitudinally,</hi> a Member of all the <hi>Churches</hi> of Christ. But the
<hi>Proximate</hi> Right that one hath, and the <hi>Proximate</hi> Obligation that
he is under <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> to join with, and be admitted to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
in a particular <hi>Church,</hi> is that which doth actually make
him a <hi>Member</hi> of it. And the Foundation of this is not the rite of
Admission, whether it be the Dr's <hi>Crossing,</hi> or the <hi>Independents</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
their Assent to the <hi>Church-Covenant,</hi> or whatever other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Expression men do pitch on for that end; for these are but
the external declarative Signs, not the effecting cause of such Right
or Obligation: and therefore these are but the Tokens, not the
Foundation of <hi>Actual Membership.</hi> But the true Foundation of the
Obligation mentioned, is ones being so Circumstantiated, that he
may conveniently wait on the Ordinances here rather than else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
which is determined by his place of residence (not that I
think the Division of Parishes a Divine, but a Civil Constitution;
yet it hath its use for shunning confusion.) And the true Foundation
of his right to be admitted, is his being a Visible Believer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. This Obligation to join with a <hi>particular Church,</hi> may
be suspended by that <hi>Church's</hi> refusing the Ordinances to the Man,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95366:58"/>
unless he will submit to their unlawful Impositions; and his right
may also be superseded, and the <hi>Church</hi> not obliged to admit him
to Ordinances, by his contradicting his profession by <hi>Heresie</hi> or
<hi>Scandal.</hi> Wherefore as every one that liveth within the Precinct
of a Parish, is not to be owned as a <hi>Member</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
willful Deserters</hi> of the <hi>Church, Atheists,</hi> &amp;c. So every one
that liveth in a Parish, is not to act as a Member of that <hi>Church</hi> in
all things: As they who cannot with a good Conscience submit to
these <hi>Terms of Communion,</hi> which that <hi>Church</hi> doth sinfully require:
To clear this a little further, consider; that to make Actually and
Compleatly a <hi>Member</hi> of a <hi>particular Church;</hi> beside his residence,
there is required a mutual consent of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Person;</hi> and
that either <hi>Explicite,</hi> or <hi>Implicite:</hi> The <hi>Implicite</hi> consent of the
<hi>Church</hi> lies in ordinary giving the Ordinances to such a Person,
Word, Sacraments, Discipline: The <hi>Implicite</hi> consent of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
lyeth, in ordinary using of, or submission to these. Now where
the <hi>Church</hi> is willing, and the Person is not, and his unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is from no allowable cause, the Person may be charged with
<hi>sinful Separation,</hi> where the Person is willing, but the <hi>Church</hi> is
not. And this unwillingness may be expressed either by absolute
refusal, or by refusal, unless the Person will submit to sinful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
the Person is no <hi>Separatist;</hi> but the <hi>Church</hi> doth sinfully
cause a Separation. In this last case (which is our case) the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is a Member <hi>affectu,</hi> but not <hi>effectu.</hi> This is (to apply this
whole discourse to the case in hand) we are Members of the <hi>Church
of</hi> England <hi>affectu, i. e.</hi> Being by providence fixed in <hi>England,</hi>
where Christ's Truth is professed, and his Ordinances administred;
we are willing to join with his people in the ordinary Assemblies
of that <hi>Church</hi> in the waiting upon all his Ordinances; yet we are
not Members of that <hi>Church Effectu;</hi> because the <hi>Church</hi> will not
suffer us to Answer that Obligation that we are under, to join in the
Ordinances, without submitting to sinful <hi>Terms:</hi> And therefore

we meet privately in little occasional Assemblies, for the present
distress, where we have Christ's Ordinances purely Administred;

about their opinion, how far they reckon Communion with
the <hi>Church of England</hi> lawful. I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in this (and I hope <hi>Presbyterians</hi> will generally say the same things,

to interpose in that debate; especially some positions of <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists</hi>
whom he citeth, I will not defend. He taketh up part
of p. 107, 108, 109. in proving that <hi>Occasional Communion</hi> with the
<hi>Church of England</hi> doth not make them who ordinarily join in other
Assemblies, to be <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> nor excuse them from
<hi>Separation.</hi> I have nothing to say either against his Assertion or
Proofs: For it is not <hi>Occasional Communion</hi> alone, but that with
a readiness for <hi>constant Communion</hi> with her, when her unlawful
Bars from it shall be removed, that both doth answer that Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is on us to join with her, and so maketh us <hi>Members</hi> so
far as we can; and doth also excuse us from a Culpable <hi>Separation.</hi>

with the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and that notwithstanding of
some <hi>defective modes of Worship,</hi> because holding Communion with
one <hi>Church</hi> exclusively of others is contrary to <hi>Catholick principles.</hi>
This he highly derideth, and laboriously refuseth, p. 110, 111,
112, 113. What is Argumentative I shall touch. <hi>It is not their</hi>
(saith he) <hi>Obligation to Peace and Vnity with the Church, as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it, that moveth, but a certain</hi> Romantick fancy <hi>of Catholick
Vnity. Ans.</hi> That respect to Peace and Unity inclineth us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Communion with the <hi>Church;</hi> but unlawful <hi>Impositions</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the effect of these Inclinations: And therefore by the fault of
the <hi>Imposers,</hi> we have no other way to shew our owning the <hi>Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
as a true Church, but this <hi>Occasional Communion:</hi> Let him call it a

<hi>Church,</hi> and much less fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m that where we live, but so far
as we needs must to shun sinning against God. Again, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
from a supposition, That <hi>if we were at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>where there
is occasion of Communion with all sorts of the Eastern Churches; and
one should ask us what Church we were Members of. If we should
Answer, we are fixed Members of no Church, but can have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
occasionally with all tolerable Churches. Would they take such a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95366:59"/>
Man for a Christian? Ans.</hi> We are under no Obligation to make
such an Answer, as he feigneth for us, for his own advantage. I
should in that case join my self to the purest <hi>Church</hi> that I could
there meet with (being at Liberty to choose, and not prelimitted
by my habitation) if I could do it without sinful <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:</hi>
And then should Answer to the Question, I am here free to
join with you, or any <hi>tolerable Church,</hi> but do Actually join with
you as the purest, during my abode here. When I am at home
I would join with the Publick Assembly, in the True Protestant
<hi>Church of</hi> England; but that her Rulers impose <hi>unlawful Terms
of Communion,</hi> which forceth me and others to join together in
Worshipping God apart, and in that Assembly I am a Member,
till I can find a sinless access to the Publick Assembly; where I desire
to be a Member. I suppose the <hi>Eastern Christians,</hi> such as are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and serious of them, and are duly informed of the State of our
Debates, would not think me no Christian for this Answer, nor
deny me <hi>Occasional Communion</hi> for it. I am sure if they did, they
should not then walk by the Rules of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. Another argumentative Consideration is, p. 111. <hi>We
were baptized in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and received as Members of
it: If then we communicate with it only occasionally, we renounce our
membership. Ans.</hi> Whereever one be baptized, that Baptism ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
him only a Member of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> If an Inhabitant
of <hi>England</hi> be occasionally in <hi>France,</hi> and have his Child there ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized
in the <hi>English</hi> way, or in the <hi>French</hi> way, Doth that make it
a Member of the <hi>Church of France,</hi> tho' the Child in Infancy be
brought to <hi>England,</hi> and there have Education, and continue?
The Dr. had not, it seems, when his Book had come this length,
hatched his fine Notion of the <hi>Sign of the Cross</hi> being the Rite of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
as a Member of the Church of <hi>England. Ans.</hi> 2. We are
obliged to <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>constant communion,</hi> though not by our being
baptized in this Church, yet by our residence in it, and owning the
same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aith with it, and are willing to own that <hi>Membership</hi> and
Obligation: But the <hi>Church</hi>'s sinful Impositions do take off this
Obligation; for we cannot by any means or case be obliged to sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and therefore we do not renounce our <hi>Membership;</hi> but the <hi>Church</hi>
hindereth our answering that Obligation that our <hi>Membership</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on us. The Dr. despiseth this our yielding to <hi>occasional com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
and it is no wonder, for his Party (forasmuch as they talk
against us for withdrawing) desire none of our communion, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95366:60"/>
in excluding us, by imposing such <hi>terms</hi> as they themselves
count needless, and we judge unlawful. But whatever he think of
it, it is all that we can do: We would bid more frankly in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining
about our own matters, but in God's matters dare not go
one Ace beyond his Warrant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. The next thing he bringeth against this <hi>Occasional
Communion,</hi> p. 111, 112. is pure Trifling, unworthy of so learned an
Author; That <hi>this Occasional Communion cannot be lawful above once
or twice in a Man's Life: That there will arise a difficult case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
concerning the lawfulness of not constant cleaving to the purer
Occasions, and leaving purer Administrations to join with a defective
Church.</hi> For a man may occasionally have Communion in publick,
when he cannot have it in private, and that often: And these Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
we may embrace in a true Church, which we would not do
in a false Church, but rather be without the Ordinances for that
time. Again, We do not speak of <hi>Occasional Communion</hi> with the
Church, in any of Her corruptions; we should alwaies abstain from
and reprove those, as he speaketh. These things being considered,
the difficult Case of Conscience, that he fansies, hath an easie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
That when we can enjoy God's Ordinances in the Society
to which we are joined, to shun the sinful Impositions that are in
publick, we should wait on them there, rather than elsewhere; but
when that occasion is not offered, we may join with a Church in
some things corrupted, in such Ordinances that are not corrupted
in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. His next Argument is, That <hi>here are no Bounds to the
peoples Fancies of purer Administrations, and less defective ways of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
so that there can be no stop to separation in this way.</hi> This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Dr. prosecuteth with facetious Scoffs, more than with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Reasons, which he (but undeservedly) most severely had taxed
Mr. <hi>A.</hi> for; he telleth us of <hi>Deserting our Meetings when the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
is over; and going to Anabaptists, and thence to the Quakers; and
that they are bound to forsake us on the same Reasons that we left the</hi>
Church, <hi>unless they be secure, that the perfection of our way is so gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly
visible to all Mankind, that it is impossible for them either to find
or fansy any defect in it.</hi> No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hing here that hath a shadow of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but it is already objected and answered; but the Dr. falleth
into frequent repetitions. I answer; It is not only for purer Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations,
that we withdraw, but to shun sinful Impositions,
which, I am sure, neither <hi>Anabaptists</hi> nor <hi>Quakers</hi> can justly alledge.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95366:60"/>
Neither is it the <hi>glaring visibility,</hi> but the real Scripture-warrant
for our way, that condemneth them for departing from us: Nor
will <hi>Fansied Defects</hi> in our way excuse them, but real sinful <hi>Terms</hi> in
our <hi>Communion.</hi> But that some will without cause separate from us, is
no reason why we should not on just cause withdraw from you. Such
a way of reasoning, from the ill use that some will make of our doing
our Duty, is too vulgar to come from so Learned a Pen. The Dr.
when he wrote this, had forgotten, it seems, what he had said <hi>Iren.</hi>
p. 109. where he saith, <hi>A Christian is bound to adhere to that Church
which appeareth most to retain the Evangelical Purity.</hi> Which Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I no further improve than <hi>ad hominem,</hi> counting it the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Extreme to what he here pleadeth for: It is incident even to
wise men, <hi>Dum vitant vitia;</hi> that, <hi>in contraria currunt,</hi> it is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
for us, and against himself. What he hath <hi>Iren.</hi> p. 116. <hi>A
Christian is bound to break off from that Society that injoineth some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
as to practice.</hi> What he citeth out of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> is a good
and sound Reproof to them that causelesly divide the <hi>Church,</hi> if he
intended it against any others, let him answer it. The sad effects
of <hi>R. William</hi>'s Separation in <hi>New-England,</hi> do not concern us fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than to lament them, unless the Dr. can prove, that we have
no better Reason for what we do than he had.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. His Refutation of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Answer to this Objection,
that he had made, I insist not on, save that I observe his usual way
here also, his representing his Adversaries, as if they held, That
<hi>Peoples apprehension of a less defective way of Worship, is sufficient ground
for them to break the Church in pieces.</hi> We think, the less defective
that Worship be, it is the better; but it may be the Dr. as well as
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> writeth sometimes in haste: Neither do we think <hi>Defective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
but <hi>real Sinfulness,</hi> and that <hi>imposed</hi> on us as the <hi>Terms</hi> of our
<hi>Communion,</hi> a sufficient ground of Separation: Far less do we think,
that the Peoples <hi>apprehension</hi> of <hi>Defectiveness</hi> in Worship is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ground, unless that apprehension be founded on Scripture, or
found Reason: And least of all do we think that such apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
can warrant us to break the Church in pieces. The best groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Scruples can only warrant our peaceable withdrawing and
worshipping God apart, which may consist with the <hi>Church</hi>'s being
whole and sound. He doth exceedingly wrong Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and others,
in that he imputeth to them an opinion, That <hi>better means of Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is, by it self, a sufficient ground of separating from a Church.</hi> If
any have ever asserted that, let them bear their blame. It may be some
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95366:61"/>
might mention this as a cumulative inducement to join with other
Societies; but none of us ever held, that this alone could warrant a
Separation. And yet the Dr. is at a great deal of pains to prove,
that neither the <hi>old Separatists,</hi> nor the <hi>New-England-men</hi> ever held
such an Opinion, which he might have got us to yield to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his spending five Pages in the proof of it; but some men labour
most in that which is least necessary. I know not what name to give
to the Dr's Assertion, p. 117. That <hi>this (greater means of Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
is now the main support of the present Separation.</hi> Nothing can
be spoken with less semblance of Truth.</p>

that is grounded on the Church's want of true or rightly
qualified Ministers. Here I shall have but little Debate with him;
I shall, to cut off Debates, as much as may be, lay down mine own
thoughts (which, I think, are not different from those of most sober
<hi>Non-conformists,</hi> especially <hi>Presbyterians)</hi> in a few particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. We look on some of the <hi>Conforming Ministers</hi> as Persons of
great worth, and excellent Ministerial Qualifications, and could live
with great satisfaction under their Ministry, if it were permitted
to us, without our Sin. 2. Others of them we know to be very
bad men, and ill qualified for the Work that they undertake; they
are Strangers in <hi>England,</hi> who have not seen this. 3. We are
dissatisfied with some things in the Calling and Practice of all the
present Clergy; we think the very Office of some of them unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as <hi>Bishops, Deans, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ch-Deacons, &amp;c.</hi> and their Ordination by
a <hi>Bishop</hi> alone not warrantable; their Call by Patrons, we judge
such also; and their using the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> we look on as
sinful. These things I now only assert, and shall debate them with
the Dr. as they fall in. 4. Yet we deny not any of them, on any or
all of these accounts, to be true Ministers, nor to have the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of a lawful Calling: Let this be understood of <hi>Bishops</hi> and
<hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ns, &amp;c.</hi> as Ministers, not as in these superiour offices. 5. Tho'
we think a better and more edifying Ministry than that which most
of the People of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95366:61"/>
think, that any defect that is in their Ministerial Call, or in the
Truth of their Ministry is a sufficient ground for <hi>separating</hi> from
the <hi>Church.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. These things being premised, I am resolved not to take
the defence of all that some have written of the defects of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
as a ground of <hi>Separation,</hi> tho' I find many things cited by the
Dr. that at first view may seem to have that tendency, (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth
them with all the advantage that he can) and yet were not
so meant. In the very entrance of this discourse, I meet with a
most unjust Imputation laid on us by the Dr. <hi>In general</hi> (saith he)
<hi>they declare, that they only look on those as true Churches, which have
such Pastors as they approve;</hi> and for this, citeth not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> Is this fair dealing? Did ever the <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi>
make Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> their general Representative? or, Hath he
so much as pretended to write in the Name of them all? Were it
candid in us, if we should pick out some passages out of Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>'s
Book of <hi>The Knowledge of Christ,</hi> and impute those opinions
to the <hi>Conformists,</hi> as their Doctrine in general? Beside, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
nor no <hi>Non-conformist</hi> never made their Approbation the Rule, by
which Ministers are to be judged, the having of whom maketh a
true Church: But the Dr. looketh on us as a Company of silly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
Men, and is pleased often so to expose us. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
Notion about true <hi>Pastors,</hi> and true <hi>Churches,</hi> I know he himself
can best defend: And therefore I leave him and the Dr. to debate
that Case.</p>

                        </gap>m Liberty to withdraw, and
to separate from them;</hi> and promiseth to prove it from many passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
in several Books of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s and others Still he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
us as making the Peoples Judgment the Rule; and that
this Judgment is sufficient ground of <hi>Separation,</hi> not considering
whether their Judgment be right or wrong; or that there is a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Rule, by which all Judgment, whether of people or others,
is to be governed. All this we disown; neither can the Dr. prove
that any of us ever owned it Yea, we further deny, that we own
a Power in the People to withdraw and <hi>separate</hi> from every Pastor,
who is really unworthy and incompetent. But what he asserteth,
he endeavoureth to prove by three Arguments. 1. Saith he, p.
122. <hi>They leave it to the Peoples Power, notwithstanding all Legal Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishments,
to own, or disown whom they judge fit.</hi> This we deny.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95366:62"/>
And the Proof he bringeth of it, is, Mr. <hi>B. speaketh against the right
of Patronage, and the Power of Magistrates in these cases, for the unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
right of the People. Mr.</hi> A. <hi>saith every particular Church hath
power to chuse its own Pastors. Dr.</hi> Owen <hi>maketh the depriving the
people of this Right, a Ground of Separation.</hi> If Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath done so,
let it pass for a part of the <hi>Independent</hi> Judgment, which was the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
of that Eminent Servant of God; others are not of that
mind. For Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>A's</hi> words no such consequence can be
drawn from them. The People (and neither Patron nor any
other) by the Laws of the Gospel, have the right of Election of their
Pastors; but it doth not follow, that they ought not to bear with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hindred the Exercise of this right, for the sake of Peace and Unity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. The <hi>2d.</hi> Argument is, <hi>The People are made Judges of the
Worthyness and Competency of their Ministers. This,</hi> saith he, <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
from the former. Ans.</hi> I have disowned the former; and
therefore this falleth with it. Yet I here distinguish: The
the people have a discretive power of judging the fitness of
the Man that is to be set over them with respect to their Souls;
so as he ought not to be obtruded on them, without their being
satisfied with him. But the Peoples power of judging is not <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative,</hi>
nor <hi>Supreme,</hi> much less <hi>absolute,</hi> in this matter; but
<hi>Subordinate</hi> to the Pastors of the <hi>Church,</hi> who have power of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Person Elected by the People, and rejecting him if unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified:
For <hi>the Spirit of the Prophets is subject to the Prophets;</hi> not to
the <hi>People.</hi> As for Pastors not now to be Elected, but obtruded on

not say, that it is the Peoples part to separate meerly for the Insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of the Minister, if the Ordinances be Administred, so as
they can partake of them without Sin. That which can warrant
withdrawing, must be a Depravation of the Ordinances; and that
such as importeth my personal Action, in partaking of that depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Ordinance, and not every defect or fault, either of
the Minister or the Ordinance. What Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith of <hi>peoples Duty
to get the best supply they can,</hi> which the Dr. taxeth him for, is not
meant of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Occasional Communion</hi> with a better supplied Society; which if the
Dr. do altogether condemn, he should Preach against the Throngs
that resort to him, and leave others under whose particular charge
they are. Or, when withdrawing is founded on other good Grounds,

the latter for any defect, save that which doth so vitiate the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,

not allow them this Judgment (as he seemeth to deny it, by his
Sarcasm, <hi>of which,</hi> saith he, (to wit, <hi>utter Insufficiency, and Heresie)
the People are admirable Judges)</hi> he must introduce implicite Faith
and Obedience: And by this Doctrine, it had been a Sin in the

should take heed of giving ground for such a Reflection to be made

this Spirit of <hi>discerning</hi> to the People of God, is to make them

I see not such Inconsistency in Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Words, as the Dr. would
make us believe; while he speaketh, p. 123. of withdrawing from
the utterly Insufficient and Heretical; and p. 124. that people
are not warranted to withdraw for a Ministers personal Faults, nor
for his ministerial Faults, while his ministration is not utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable;
if the Dr. can shew either the Falshood, or Inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

                     </gap>sonally: From
such we will not withdraw. He bringeth Four Qualities that Mr.
<hi>B.</hi> required in Ministers; the want of which may warrant to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from them: <hi>Tolerable Knowledge: That they be not Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical:
That they be not opposers of serious Godliness: That they be not
so vicious in their Lives as to do more hurt than good.</hi> If these quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were to be considered by a People about to Elect a Minister, it
is not difficult to determine what Obligation lieth on people to
shun the man that wanteth them: But it is another case, when
the Qualities of a Minister under whom we are, come to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in order to warrant casting off his ministery. A general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of this I have already given; to wit, that no other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the Minister doth warrant withdrawing, but such as so
vitiate the Ordinances, as my personal Concurrence with them is
Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. But to consider these Four Ministerial Qualities in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to this Case: Two things I shall say of them in general.
1. It is either supposed, that all the Ministers of a Nation are so
ill qualified; or that some one, or a few, or most of them: In
the first case there is more need of <hi>separate Meetings:</hi> In the last
some less need; in the Third yet less; and in the Fourth least of
all; because peoples wants are more easily supplied by Neighbour
Ministers in the one case, than in the other: tho the need to the Soul
under that one bad Minister to shun him, is as great as that of others
to shun many. 2. These bad ministerial qualities may no doubt
arrive at that height, and have those Aggravations and Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that they may warrant withdrawing from such Ministers; and
when people cannot otherwise have God's Ordinances, may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>separate Meetings.</hi> The reason of this, <hi>a priori,</hi> is, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cause
they may so pervert the Ordinances of God, as to make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to be used: This may without difficulty be supposed to be
possible: <hi>Ignorance</hi> may be such as neither Word nor Sacraments
are so much as right for the Substance. It is so clear in <hi>Heresie,</hi>
that none can doubt it, as in <hi>Papists, Socinians,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>opposing serious
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95366:64"/>
Religion</hi> may be the all of some mens Preaching. And even <hi>personal
wickedness</hi> of Ministers (which seemeth to be more remote from
this Hazard than the rest) may affect the Ordinances, as is exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified
in <hi>Eli</hi>'s Son, the Priest of the Lord; their intemperance
and covetousness made <hi>Non-conformists</hi> in <hi>Israel,</hi> that were not
chargeable for their withdrawing: For their taking the Flesh by
violence from the People, before the Fat was burnt, was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Institution of that Ordinance; in which first the Blood
was to be sprinkled, then after the slaying and opening, the Fat was
to be burnt: And after that the Priest was to have his part; as
may be seen, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And before the burning of the
Fat to the Lord, the Flesh was not Holy, and so not the Priests
Portion, saith <hi>J. Martyr, in locum.</hi> This was so observed among
the very Heathens (who imitated in many things the Jewish Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafices;
That <hi>haud immolata sacra devorare,</hi> was proverbial, to
express a Belly-god; such as <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons were. This was their Sin,
whereby they did pervert Divine Ordinances from the Institution,
1 <hi>Sam. 2. 14, 15, 16;</hi> and it is said <hi>ver.</hi> 17. That <hi>Men abhorred the
Offerring of the Lord.</hi> Some Translate it, <hi>Retrah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Avarice of the Priests, and when they saw that the
wonted rites of Sacrificing were not observed, saith <hi>Menochius:</hi>
And it yet further appeareth from <hi>ver.</hi> 24. that this their Fact did
affect the Ordinances, and made people withdraw from them; <hi>You
make the People of the Lord Transgress,</hi> saith <hi>Eli.</hi> There is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to restrict this to their uncleanness mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. For <hi>Eli</hi>
heard beside that, <hi>of all that they did to Israel;</hi> and no doubt his
Reproof had respect to all. Some Translate <hi>ver. 24. Abigitis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum
Domini,</hi> i. e. <hi>efficitis ne huc veniat populus ad Sacrificandum.</hi> So
<hi>vatablus.</hi> All this considered, we must not think it absurd, to
say that people may see such things in their Ministers, as may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
deserting of them.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. If this should be denied, the Clergy should be <hi>Lords
over God's Heritage,</hi> to all ends and purposes, and might teach what
they would, and do what they would, and bring into the Church
what they would, instead of Christ's Ordinances; and the People
be still oblig'd to hear them, and join with them in all these abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations;
they might lead the People in the way to Hell, who
were still obliged to follow them. 3. The People have a Right of
discerning and judging, in reference to their own practice, whether
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95366:64"/>
their Ministers be so qualified, as that they may safely live under
their Ministry: This doth neither import, that they may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
in this what they will; nor that they are not to blame, if they
judge amiss; nor that they have Authority to pass a Sentence on
their Ministers (that belongeth to the Pastors); nor that all of
them are so qualified for this Judging, as were to be wished; yet,
that they have such a Right, cannot be denied, without obliging
them to blind obedience, and regardlesness of their own Souls;
and Scripture alloweth it, when it alloweth People to admonish
Ministe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Colossians</hi> could not obey, if they had no power of discretive judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whether <hi>Archippus</hi> fulfilled his Ministry, or not. Without this,
people were obliged to cast themselves into Temptation and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of Soul-ruine by a Deceiver or Soul-murderer. This was
both the Principle of the <hi>Primitive Church, Cyprian, Ep. 68. Plebs
obsequens praeceptis Domini a peccatore praeposito separare se debet.</hi> And
it was their common practice, (tho' I confes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

grounds) they <hi>separated</hi> every where from the <hi>Arian Bishops</hi>
and Pastors. The <hi>Magdeburgenses, Cent. 4. 1, 10. p.</hi> 746. tell us
out of <hi>Ruffinus, Theodoret, Sozomen,</hi> that when <hi>Foelix</hi> B. of <hi>Rome</hi> had
communicated with the <hi>Arians,</hi> the People of <hi>Rome separated</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from him; and that when he taught, none of them came

I may here put the Dr. in mind (using it only as <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum

<hi>Bishop Jewel,</hi> giving reasons why the <hi>English Bishops</hi> went not to

matter of so much weight and consequence: And the Sin of it (on
whatever side it lieth) of so deep a Die, and so great Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that the greatest caution is to be used, that we do not <hi>separate</hi>
for imagined, but real; for small, but very great; for uncertain,
but very Evident want; not of every ministerial quality that is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>sirable, but of such as is necessary for the Ordinances being so
Administred, as we may partake of them without Sin. If People
do mistake in any of these, and run into <hi>Separation</hi> without suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95366:65"/>
grounds, thinking that fault of a Minister true, or great, or
evident, or intolerable, which is not so; we do not plead for this
practice: But we must not, to shun that inconvenience, say, that
it is in no case lawful. I know no Truth but it may be abused by
men of Corrupt minds, as well as this. I know there are faults in
Ministers, which render them in the secret Judgment of God, and
to the Jealousie of good Men, no Ministers of Christ, but of Satan;
which yet will not warrant <hi>Separation</hi> from them, while they have
Ordination unrepealed by a <hi>Church</hi> Sentence of Deprivation, and
Administer God's Ordinances, so as the partaker of them is not
involved in Sin. <hi>Gildas</hi> said of some Pastors in his time; <hi>Apparet
cum quem vos sacerdotes—sciens ex corde dicit, non esse eximium Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianum:</hi>
And <hi>O inimici Dei, &amp; non Sacerdotes: O li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

&amp; non pontifices traditores, &amp; non sanctorum Apostolorum successores;
Impugnatores &amp; non Christi Ministri.</hi> When we can apply all this
to a Minister, the Church ought to cast him out, as unsavoury Salt:
But till that be done, private Persons ought to withdraw from his
evil Deeds; but not from the Ordinances while they are pure. I
know this hath been, and is, a Controversie in our Neighbour
<hi>Church of Scotland,</hi> and hath given rise to much disquiet, much
Confusion, and many Persecutions there: I shall not much dip in
it; our Case being more clearly Stated: and our withdrawing
from the publick Assemblies, being founded not on personal faults
of Ministers, but on sinful Impositions in Worship. I have not
met with one judicious Writer of that Nation; nor one Minister
that I remember of in private discourse, who denieth, <hi>in thesi,</hi> that
it is lawful to partake of the Ordinances from a Minister, meerly
on Accompt of his personal faults, where the Ordinances that
we are to partake of are incorrupted; but they state the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
upon some Specialities in their Case. One or Two little
Manuscr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pts I have seen, that <hi>in Thesi</hi> and with as much Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as little Reason, deny the lawfulness of hearing a scandalous
Minister. To these, I only oppose this one Argument; Our Lord
Commanded the Jews to receive the Ordinances from the Priests
of that time, who were most of them very bad men, <hi>Matth. 8. 4.
Luk.</hi> 17. 14. and what Christ bid them do, we may lawfully do in
the like case. The Exceptions made against this Argument (that
I have met with) are very Light, as that the Priests were not so
bad as ours. 1. This is said without all Colour of Reason. 2. Let
them shew what degree of Scandal in a Minister will warrant such
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95366:65"/>
withdrawing, and what not. Again, they object, That the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
could not be had, but from these Priests. <hi>Ans.</hi> If it had
been unlawful to partake with them, Christ would rather have had
no Sacrifice offered, than that People should sin in going about it.
He that preferreth Mercy to Sacrifice, would never preferr Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to shunning of Sin. And, beside this, if the hazard of want of
Ordinances could inferr the necessity of joining with these Priests,
so may the hazard of a sinful rending of the <hi>Church,</hi> perswade to
join in the Case in hand. And further, where the Ordinances can,
without any sinful circumstance, be had from better hands, I am
far from advising any to attend the Administrations of bad men:
But in that Nation they had better grounds of their practice, to
wit, Subjection to <hi>Prelacy,</hi> required of them; and that their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Pastors were turned out, and others put in their Place. But I
leave this Debate, as not being my present Work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. I now come to say a word of each of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
four Ministerial Qualities; in particular, 1. <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:</hi>
The Ordainers are the Authoritative Judges of these; and
the People are not without very great and manifest cause to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what is in this done, by the Guides of the <hi>Church;</hi> yet must they
see with their own Eyes, and lament the defects of this kind, that
they evidently see, but not <hi>separate,</hi> while the Ordinances are not
intolerably depraved, tho' there be considerable defects. The Dr.
<hi>never heard, that the Apostle bid People turn away from their Minister
for want of Vtterance;</hi> neither was such a Command needful, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Reason injoining, That if a man cannot speak audibly and
intelligible, People should not come to hear a noise, so that they
cannot tell what is uttered. His declamation against Peoples judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Minister's Knowledge, is out of the way; we do not make
them <hi>Triers,</hi> as he supposeth, neither give them Authority; and
we think, (for all his scorn) that tho' many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>annot well discern a
Minister's Knowledge in Controverise, yet most can tell whether he
understandeth the plain Truths of the Gospel, when they hear him
discourse of them. If men, by prejudices, or want of due applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their minds, (as the Dr. speaketh) mistake about these, I
shall hardly call them <hi>very good men;</hi> as he supposeth they may be.
The Second Quality is, <hi>That a Minister be not Heretical.</hi> Except
Taunts and personal Reflections on Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I see not what the Dr.
answereth to this. We do not say, That <hi>Peoples thinking a man
Heretical, when he crosseth their humours,</hi> is a good ground to <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:95366:66"/>
on, as the Dr. would have it thought; neither is it needful for
discerning this, that all the People be <hi>Learned Divines,</hi> or have read
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Binnius,</hi> as he talketh; but we think, they that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
read the Scripture, and pray for spiritual Understanding,
may discern when manifest Errour against the Foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Doctrine is taught; and where they find this to be the way
of a Minister, may withdraw from him. I wish the Dr. would speak
more plain, that we might see his mind more clearly than we can
do by these jeers: Doth he think there are none Learned among the
People? or, Doth he think that none of them that want Literature
can discern Truth from Errour, in any Case? or, Doth he think,
dangerous Errour being discerned to be ordinarily preached, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
should attend on that Preaching, instead of the wholsome Food
of their Souls, and not seek better means, unless the <hi>Bishops</hi> will give
leave? If he be not positive in all these, he saith nothing against
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> nor Us, in this matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. The Third Quality is, That <hi>Ministers be not Opposers
of Godliness.</hi> That is not to be understood of what people will call
so without cause; nor of suspected malignity; nor of open oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of it in the mans private actings, by word or deed; nor of
close hints in Sermons against it; nor breaking out sometimes
into more open maligning of it: But when this is manifestly the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
strain of his preaching; we say, in that Case people may
withdraw from a man; for here the Ordinance of Preaching is
wholly inverted and turned against that which it was appointed to
promote. There is as good ground in this case to desert a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
as there is in a besieged Garrison, for the Souldiers to desert
their Commander, when he turneth the Guns that are on the
Walls, from the Enemy, upon the Town. The <hi>Dr.</hi> rejecteth this,
as before, by tart Reflection on Mr. <hi>B.</hi> which whatever it may be,
<hi>ad hominem,</hi> is nothing <hi>ad rem.</hi> If Mr <hi>B.</hi> hath sharply reproved some
for Censoriousness, Pride, Divisions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and these will count this
opposing of Godliness, Doth this peevish mistake of theirs prove,
that there can be no such thing really committed by a Minister; or
if it be, that it should not be resented by the Hearers? Or, if Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
sometimes speak at this rate, is this his ordinary Doctrine? or,
when men make Railing their ordinary Doctrine, Should people sit
and hear that, as God's Ordinance for their Souls edification?
The Fourth Quality; <hi>That Ministers be not of a scandalous Life.</hi>
Of this the Dr. saith nothing, and I shall say little more than is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95366:66"/>
said. We do not hold, That personal faults in a Minister,
where the Ordinances are incorrupted, is a sufficient ground of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
from him. But it cannot but be a sad Grievance, and make
people wait on the Ministry of such a person with less comfort and
satisfaction, and may warrant people that regard the advantage of
their Souls, to lay hold on the first opportunity that they can get,
to live under a Ministry that is more like to be blessed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. He chargeth the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> (without exception)
<hi>Sect.</hi> 10. with <hi>insinuating, that the whole body of the conforming Clergy
is guilty of such faults as the people may lawfully separate:</hi> A most false
Assertion, and unjust Charge. Not one <hi>Non-conformist</hi> that ever I
read or met with, hath said or written this, or words to this effect,
but they do generally disclaim it: But the Dr. undertaketh to prove
it by some particulars. 1. <hi>They make Conformity it self to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
scandalous thing, and then tell the people over and over again, That it
is no sin to separate from scandalous Priests, especially where the Scandal
is so notorious.</hi> I am astonished to read this, from the Pen of one
whom I am loath to have an harsh thought against. We do indeed
think <hi>Conformity</hi> a Sin, and being open, it cannot but be a <hi>Scandal;</hi>
and we think, that in some it arising from a regardlesness of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is right, becometh yet more scandalous; but none of us
ever thought, that a mistake of this nature in men, otherwise sober
and conscientious, was a very scandalous thing; or, that it was
such a scandal, as by it self could warrant <hi>Separation.</hi> But let the
Dr. tell us of any one of our way, that ever held this general <hi>Thesis,</hi>
That it is no Sin to <hi>separate</hi> from scandalous Priests, when the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
is notorious. I am sure Mr. <hi>B.</hi> (whom he only citeth on this
occasion) teacheth the contrary oftner than once, particularly
<hi>Christ. Direct.</hi> p. 718. and his looking on <hi>Conformity</hi> as Sin, and an
aggravated Sin, and the pressing of it as that Sin which they charge
us with, to wit, <hi>Schismaticalness,</hi> do no way prove what the Dr. as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serteth.
When Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith, p. 133. <hi>Can you wonder if the people chuse
more faithful Pastors?</hi> It doth not make the Clergy's <hi>Conformity</hi> the
true Reason (nor the main Reason neither) of <hi>Separation;</hi> yea, nor
doth it import an Approbation of <hi>Separation,</hi> (tho' he doth else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
shew his Approbation of it) but only sheweth how you
tempt the people to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. Another Argument to prove his charge, is <hi>Sect. 11.
That we count most of the present Ministers of the Church of</hi> England
<hi>Vsurpers, and that from such we may lawfully separate. Ans.</hi> We
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95366:67"/>
deny both parts of his Assertion, whatever Usurpation some of
them may be guilty of. We know most of them have the <hi>(tacite</hi>
at least) consent of the people, <hi>a post facto;</hi> and therefore, however
they might be guilty of intrusion in their entry, in their continuing
in their places they are no Usurpers. Neither do we own it to be
lawful to <hi>separate</hi> from every Minister that is an Usurper, meerly
on the account of his Usurpation. To clear this, I shall lay down
our opinion about this, in these few Assertions. 1. The regular
way of entring into the Ministry, is by the <hi>Election</hi> or Call of the
People over whom he is to have charge, and the <hi>potestative Mission</hi>
or <hi>Ordination</hi> of the Pastors of the <hi>Church:</hi> This will fall in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to be debated. 2. It is consequential to this, That whoever
do not enter this way into the Ministry, are in some degree or other
Intruders into that Work. 3. Though the express Call of the
people, and their free consent, be needful to the more orderly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of a Minister among them; yet if they implicitely shew their
consent, and they being prelimitted by the Presentation of a Patron,
or Commands of the Magistrate, if they consent, that is enough to
the substance of a Call, and maketh the Minister that so entereth no
Usurper. The reason is, because he is only to consider the Will
and Consent sufficiently declared, not the motives nor considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that influence their will. Indeed, if the man had any hand
by undue means, to influence them to consent against their Duty
and right Reason, he is, in so far, guilty before God: But this doth
not nullifie his Call, which consisteth in the peoples consent.
4. There are three sorts of Usurpers of the Ministerial Office or
Work. 1. Such as fall upon that Work, without a Call from a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or Ordination by Ministers. 2. Such as do it upon a peoples
Call, but have no Ordination or potestative Mission by those in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
the <hi>Church</hi> for that end. 3. Such as have Ordination, but
take the Charge of a particular Flock, wholly without consent, or
against their will. The two former sorts usurp the Office; the
third usurpeth that particular Charge that he hath no right to.
5. The Presentation of a Patron to the Living; the Civil Laws of
men, injoining or owning a mans entrance into a place; due Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
Institution, and Induction, and what else men please to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise,
can never make him the Pastor of such a particular people,
without their consent some way had; but without it he is still an
Usurper. This doth follow, from the peoples right of chusing their
Pastors, which is to be afterward discoursed. 6. It is lawful to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95366:67"/>
                     <hi>Separate</hi> from usurping Ministers of the first and second sort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are no Ministers; they have only the name of Ministers,
like those that <hi>called themselves Apostles, and were not,</hi> Rev. 2. 2.
I hope the Dr. will not deny this. 7. When a Minister is obtruded
on a People against their will; and so is an Usurper of the <hi>3d.</hi> Sort;
if there be no other cause of <hi>separating</hi> from him but that, I think
(under correction of the more Wise and Learned) that they should
rather cede of their right (with a <hi>Salvo</hi>) than break the Peace and
Unity of the <hi>Church,</hi> or disoblige the Magistrate; and therefore
they ought to give their consent. By this means, their right that
Christ hath given them is not alienated; it being by them on
that occasion Asserted; and the Rending of the <hi>Church</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. Let us now hear what the Dr. will say, to make good
against us his charge of our <hi>separating</hi> on this Head. He saith,
<hi>They have a Legal Establishment, and Law and Vsurpation are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Ans.</hi> Establishment by a Civil Law, and Usurpation of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Office are contrary. Also Establishment by the Gospel, and
Usurpation of a Church-Office are inconsistent; but Establishment
by a Civil Law, and Usurpation of an Office in the <hi>Church,</hi> are
very consistent one with another: Because the Office of the Ministry
is no institution of Man, but of Christ; and he giveth Laws to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
that, and other affairs in his House; and hath not left these
to be ordered by the Laws of men. I thought the Dr. had been
for <hi>Episcopal Government</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> not for <hi>Erastianism.</hi> Mr.
<hi>B.</hi> is cited, p. 134. asserting, That <hi>all that come into the places of
Ejected Ministers, the people not consenting, are Vsurpers; that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate's
Imposition maketh not such true Pastors of that Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
or before the Peoples consent; nor will it always oblige the People to
consent, and forsake their former Pastors; nor prove them Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
because they do it not:</hi> For disproving of this, the Dr. first <hi>leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it to others, to judge of the dangerous Consequences of this; an
Act being passed by King and Parliament for removing of some Pastors,
and putting in others.</hi> And I desire that these others, who judge of
this matter, may consider, that the ordering of the Ministerial Call,
and the fixing a Religion between Pastor and People, do fall direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under the Cognizance, and Laws of him who is the Head and
Lawgiver in his <hi>Church,</hi> even <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and under the Laws of
men only, as the Civil Peace may be concerned therein; and let
them also consider, that we by owning or disowning a Pastoral
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95366:68"/>
Relation, which the Magistrate hath passed an Act for or against, do
manage our principle, and order our practice with that peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and caution, that the Magistrate may as little as possible either
know it, or be offended at it; and if we be Convicted of a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of the Magistrate's Law, we patiently suffer the Penalties:
Let them, I say, Consider these things; and withal Consider, that
to differ from the Magistrate in Principle and Practice of Religion,
was the Lot of the Primitive Christians; and then let them judge
(if they be Impartial Men) whether any such dismal consequences
as the Dr. insinuateth, are like to follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. He objecteth next, <hi>On those Grounds when</hi> Solomon <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived</hi>
Abiathar, <hi>and put</hi> Zadock <hi>is his room; any part of the People
might have pleaded they never consented to</hi> Zadock's <hi>coming in—The
Question is, whether it belonged to the King or the People. Ans.</hi> There is
so little shadow of Reason, or affinity to the question in Hand in this
Argument, that it is no small Derogation from the understanding
of so Learned a Man, once to mention it; for the chusing of a
High-Priest belonged neither to King nor People; but the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
was fixed in one Family by the Lord; and it was neither
in the Power of the King nor People to chuse any, but the
nearest Heir of that Lin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Wherefore what <hi>Solomon</hi> did in
this Case, was no more but to inflict a Civil Punishment on <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar,</hi>
to wit, Exile from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (where only the Office of High-Priest
could be Exercised) and Confinement to <hi>Anathoth:</hi> And this
was done for his Accession to Treason against <hi>Solomon:</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
putting <hi>Zadock</hi> in his place, was no more but obeying the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of God, who had promised the Priest-hood to <hi>Phinehas;</hi>
whose nearest Heir <hi>Zadock</hi> was: And it is the opinion of many
Divines, that <hi>Abiathar</hi>'s right to the Priesthood was not so good as
<hi>Zadock</hi>'s. Another Argument like the rest he hath, p. 135. is, <hi>That
it follows that a smaller part of the People may disown the Publick Acts
of Parliament, and chuse other Governours in opposition to those Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by Law, and they may do it in one case as well as in another. Which
makes me wonder</hi> (saith he) <hi>at those who dare call them Vsurpers, who
enjoy their places by the same Laws, that any men do enjoy their Estates.</hi>
This is a Confounding of things most disparate one from another,
a taking away all distinction of Civil and Church power. We ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
deny his consequence, That because people, notwithstanding of
an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> may adhere to their Pastors; therefore they
may chuse other civil Governours (for of these he must speak, or
speak nothing to the purpose.) They may not do it in the one case
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95366:68"/>
as in the other; because the one case is regulated by Christ's Law,
the other by Mens Law. But I now smell out a mistake in the Dr. that
maketh such Choler and Zeal against us, That we count them Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of their places, that is their Benefices: Let him no more fear
that; we own their Title to these, to be as good as Men have to their
Estates, both being disposable by the same Law: But all that we
have said, is about their Usurping the Charge of Souls: Of which
we Assert two things, 1. That there is no necessary Connexion <hi>de facto</hi>
between a good Title to the one, and to the other, though <hi>de jure</hi>
(I mean, <hi>divino) beneficium sequitur officium.</hi> 2. That the same
Law may give a Title to an Ecclesiastick Estate, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
Title to other Estates; but another Law and not that,
must give a Title to having the charge of Souls, and must
make a Relation between Pastor and People: And the reason of this
Difference I bring from that famous saying of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great,
to the Church-men, that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. He hath yet another Argument; to wit, That <hi>this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth
the Reformation, for the Papists had the very same Plea, that
these Men have now, to wit, that the Magistrate had no Power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the Relation between them, and their former Church-guides. Ans.</hi>
If the Dr. will say, that the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy had no otherwise forfeited
their Title to the charge of Souls, than by the Magistrates Law, then
their Plea, and ours were the same. But I suppose he, as well as
we, will fix that forfeiture on another Foundation; to wit, their
<hi>Heresy</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that they led the People into, warranted the
People to withdraw from them, as none of Christ's Ministers, and
disobliged the People from owning any further Relation to them,
as their Pastors: And this not only warranted the Magistrate to
protect those that did break off from them; but to suppress them,
who should have done so, and would not, If he will not own this,
he doth more to over-throw the <hi>Reformation,</hi> than all that he can
charge <hi>Non-conformists</hi> with can amount to. We are far from que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning
the Magistrates Power over Ministers, to inflict civil Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
on them; if he do it on good Grounds, he is approved of
God; if otherwise he must answer to him for it: But our Magistrates
do not own any power of inflicting <hi>Church-censures</hi> by themselves;
whatever some Flatters do on their behalf. The Objection from
the <hi>Old Non-conformists,</hi> I have answered above. By what hath been
said it will appear, whether he saith truly, p. 137. <hi>That not one
word of our Plea, but might equally serve the Papists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95366:69"/>
Power of chusing their Pastors, and the Nullity of their Title to
that Charge without the Peoples Consentt, he Dr. it seems thinks
that <hi>Recitasse</hi> is <hi>Refutasse,</hi> for he saith no more to disprove it, but
Asserteth, That <hi>it layeth a Foundation for all imaginable Disorders,
and Separations;</hi> which we deny: And enough I have said above
to evince the contrary. He maketh another of our Grounds of
<hi>Separation</hi> to be, the Persecution of the <hi>Prelatists,</hi> and their having
a Hand in silencing of Ministers: This we disown. Indeed their
Persecution for our not submitting to their Impositions, is a Barr
by which we are forcibly kept out of the <hi>Church;</hi> but it is not the
motive that determineth us to leave the <hi>Church;</hi> we are willing to
wait on Gods Ordinances even Administred by them that persecute
us, if they will suffer us to do it on sinless Terms. And if Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
(whom he only citeth in this matter) mean any thing else, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
answer for him.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. Of the Terms of Communion imposed by the Church.</head>
                  <p>AFter Examination of other Pleas for <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> the Dr.
cometh <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. to examine that which he confesseth to be
<hi>the most colourable Plea that hath yet been used; to wit, their imposing
of unlawful Terms of Communion with them.</hi> And this I look on as
not only the most colourable Plea; but is the <hi>causa sine quo non,</hi>
that without which no <hi>Separation</hi> can be made from a <hi>True
Church,</hi> which is sound in the Faith, without Sin; and as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Foundation of that Cause that I now plead: and if the Dr. can
beat us out of this Hold, we shall become his willing Proselites.
Let us hear then how he taketh this Plea from us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. His first assault is by a distinction, which is really true, but
very ill managed, tho' by amost Learned hand; but the Dr. being
Master of so much Learning, as few men are, doth, I suppose, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
make him consider less what he writeth, than they find need
to do, who move in an inferiour Orb. His distinction is, between
<hi>terms of Communion plainly and in themselves sinful;</hi> and <hi>such as are only
fansied to be so through Prejudice and wilful Ignorance, or Error of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>
That there are some <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> with a <hi>Church</hi>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:95366:69"/>
really sinful, and others that are not so, tho' they be fansied by
some to be so, I think none ever doubted; and therefore the Dr.
might have better imployed his pains (to say nothing of his Ink and
Paper) that he hath taken to prove this by a multitude of instances.
And I grant, that when the sinfulness of the <hi>Terms</hi> is only fansied,
the Sin of <hi>Schism,</hi> that followeth on that apprehension, lieth not on
the <hi>Imposers,</hi> but on those that <hi>separate:</hi> Only I must add an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of a Case in which it may lie on both; that is, when the
thing imposed is unnecessary, and is made a ground of <hi>Separation</hi> by
the mistake of persons otherwise orthodox and sober, and who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to no other cause of <hi>Separation:</hi> If the Imposers will not yield
in that case, (that is the wiser to the more wilful) they shew not
that moderation, nor love to Peace that they should. If the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
could be gained by forbearing preaching by an Hour-glass,
(the Dr's. instance) I would think it hard to lose them for that, for
whom Christ lost his Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. As the Dr. manageth this distinction, it is hard to tell
what to make of it; for he confoundeth two things that are most
distinct, yea, different; to wit, <hi>Terms of Communion plainly sinful,</hi>
and <hi>Terms of Communion in themselves sinful:</hi> And in the other <hi>Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
of the distinct on, he hath set nothing in opposition to <hi>plainly;</hi>
for <hi>fansied</hi> to be sinful through Prejudice, wilful Ignorance, Error
of Conscience, are all opposite to those that are sinful in themselves.
He should then have told us, if <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> imposed be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in themselves, but not plainly, but only obscurely so; what
censure he would pass on them that could not comply with them;
also what degree of plainness he would require about the sinfulness
of imposed <hi>Terms of Communion,</hi> that it might be lawful to <hi>Separate,</hi>
rather than yield to them. My opinion is, that if <hi>Terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
be imposed, that are in themselves, and really sinful, and if the
sinfulness of them can be known by diligent searching of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and depending upon God for Light and Guidance, tho' there
be not such plainness as the Dr. had above called <hi>glaring Evidence,</hi>
that all the world may see, they that are consciencious ought to
withdraw from any <hi>Church</hi> whatsoever, rather than submit to
those <hi>Terms.</hi> There is an Ambiguity in the Term that he useth,
<hi>In themselves sinful;</hi> for I know, that it is their usual Plea for the
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi> (the imposed <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> now under debate)
that they are things <hi>in themselves</hi> indifferent. This may either be
understood, that they are in their general nature such; which we
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95366:70"/>
grant; Habits, and Postures, and Gestures importing neither good
nor evil, as such: Or as considered under the circumstances that
they are cloathed with, as they fall under our debate; and so we
think them sinful. Now, the Dr. should have told us whether he
meaneth of <hi>Terms of Communion,</hi> that are things imposed, which are
really evil, under the circumstances with which they are imposed;
or <hi>Terms of Communion,</hi> which are things in their general nature
evil: We think the sinfulness of <hi>Terms of Communion,</hi> even in the
former, and not only in the latter sence, may warrant our with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. He telleth us, That the <hi>Magistrate</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> may lawfully
determine and impose Time and Place, and such-like circumstances
of Worship; which we grant, (tho' we think it inconvenient to be
rigorous in these Impositions, or too frequent and universal in them;
but about these, our Question is not conversant:) <hi>Therefore, if any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from these Impositions,</hi> he saith, <hi>the Sin of Separation is on their
part:</hi> This we do not deny. We also grant his Hypothetick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that followeth; to wit, <hi>If other things be as much in the
Magistrate or Church's Power, they sin who separate, because of imposing
of them.</hi> His reason of this is not so clear; to wit, <hi>Where there is
no plain prohibition, men may with ordinary Care and Judgment satisfie
themselves of the lawfulness of the things required: And there is no
plain prohibition,</hi> he saith, <hi>of the Liturgy and Ceremonies.</hi> We deny
the imposing the <hi>Liturgy and Ceremonies</hi> to be as much in mens po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
as is the determining of Circumstances of Time and Place, and
such-like. We deny also, that men, with the best Care and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
can see the lawfulness of every thing imposed in the Worship
of God, (for of such things we now discourse) that is not plainly
prohibited: For, What if they be prohibited, tho' not plainly?
It is too great peremptoriness, to take upon us to teach the Spirit
of God how to speak in Scripture; if He expects Obedience from
us (the Dr. was in this strain also in his <hi>Ir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hint of His Will, tho' never so obscurely, so as we can understand
that it is the Mind of God, we are obliged to obey it. Again, we
deny, that want of either obscure or plain Prohibition is good
ground to satisfie us about <hi>Religious Ceremonies,</hi> that they are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
though imposed by men: It is enough, that they are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
nor instituted. <hi>Will Worship</hi> is condemned in Scripture;
and, Can it be denied, that what is not commanded, tho' it be not
<hi>plainly forbidd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n,</hi> is <hi>Will-Worship?</hi> And, What Argument will the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95366:70"/>
Dr. bring against most of the <hi>Popish Ceremonies,</hi> but that they are
not commanded? Where is the plain Prohibition of them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. Further, we say, That the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are
plainly enough forbidden, tho not in particular, yet in general
terms. The Traditions of men in Gods Worship, are plainly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
<hi>Mat. 15. 7, 8, 9. Mark 7. 6, 7, 8. Gal. 4. 9, 10, 11. Col.</hi>
2. 20.—which Scriptures, and other Arguments proving them to
be forbidden by God, have been so fully managed against his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
without any Answer, as may let the world see, that neither <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Care</hi> nor <hi>Judgment</hi> hath been wanting to find<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of such Impositions; and yet we cannot find it. I shall not
now repeat what I have elsewhere said to this purpose, but intend
to answer what the Dr. will please to say in defence of these his
<hi>Lawful Impositions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. The Dr. is at some pains to prove, that the prohibition
of these is not in the Second Commandment: But if he would have
convinced us of our Error, he should have proved, that they are
neither forbidden there, nor elsewhere, by giving satisfying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to all our other Arguments; but he is pleased to insist only
on our Argument from the <hi>Second Commandment,</hi> and to that as he
is pleased to frame it, he giveth an Answer, such as it is. I observe
some mistakes in his treating of this Argument; 1. That he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
that the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> should have been forbidden in
words, if they be forbidden; that is, that they should have been
expresly named. Will he forbear no Sin, but what is named in one
of the Ten Commandments? What will he say of <hi>Fornication, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest,
Rebellion against Kings, &amp;c.</hi> May be he will say these are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
expresly in other parts of Scripture. <hi>Ans.</hi> So are <hi>humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions</hi>
in God's Worship; as hath been shewed: And beside, it
were impertinent to deny <hi>Fornication</hi> to be forbidden in the Seventh
Commandment, because it is not named there, tho' it be in other
Scriptures: Even so it is here; yea, I suppose the Dr. will not
think, that whatever is not named in Scripture as a Sin, is no Sin;
mispending the Sabbath day in <hi>sleep, idleness, play, &amp;c.</hi> advising or
commanding one man to murder another, and many things of that
nature, are not named in Scripture, and yet comprehended under
general prohibitions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. 2. His Question is very absurd, <hi>How shall we come by
the sence, but by the words?</hi> He must mean the words of the <hi>second
Commandment.</hi> And then I answer, That we could never by this
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95366:71"/>
way know the sence of the <hi>seventh Commandment,</hi> Fornication is a
Sin: Nor by the words of the sixth Commandment could we know
it is a Sin, to say to our Brother, <hi>Thou fool.</hi> Wherefore hath the
Spirit of God written so much more Scripture holding forth Sins
and Duties, if we are only to look to the bare words of the Ten
Commandments, for learning the preceptive or directive part of
His revealed Will? <hi>His Commands are exceeding broad, Ps.</hi> 119. 96. and
therefore we are to look for more understanding from them, than
the words by themselves can afford us. <hi>Ezra</hi> and the <hi>Levites</hi> read
the words to the People, and <hi>gave the Sence, Neh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 8. 8. It is our
Duty also to read it, and enquire into the sence of it. One useful
means of coming by the sence of the Commandments, is, to consider
how they were expounded by Christ, enlarged on by the Prophets
and Apostles injoining and forbidding things of the same nature,
with what the words of the Commands do express; and in general,
we must compare Scripture with Scripture, if we would understand
the meaning of the several parts of it. It is strange, that the Dr. and
his Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty should deal so unequally; they take a great deal of Liberty
to impose things on the <hi>Church</hi> of God, from a very general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<hi>Let all things be done decently and in order:</hi> Which words
they practise upon at their pleasure, devising <hi>Rites</hi> for the Worship
of God, and bringing This to warrant them, tho' they can bring
no such sence out of the words, as that <hi>Crossing, Kneeling, &amp;c.</hi> are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
But if we scruple any of their Inventions, we must be obliged
to give words of Scripture, where they are expresly forbidden.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. In the Third place; When his opposites alledge cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rules for interpreting the Commandments, he asketh, <hi>Whether
they be divine or humane?</hi> I again ask him, Whether doth he own
them as sound, or reject them as fallacious? But to his question I
answer; They are by men collected out of the Scripture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have Divine Authority, tho' the frame of them be Humane; as
the Dr's Sermons (I do not mean that at <hi>Guild-hall)</hi> are divine.
Truths, and of divine Authority, tho' of humane frame and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure.
4. One of these Rules is, <hi>That where any thing is forbidden, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is commanded.</hi> We chuse, after the generality of Divines, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to express it thus; That in every Negative Precept the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Duty is commanded: And in the Affirmative Precept, the
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntrary Sin is forbidden. His Answer is, <hi>There is here a Command to
worship God without an Image.</hi> A Logician would say, this is still a
Negative Command, for here the matter of this Precept is expressed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95366:71"/>
                     <hi>Negative.</hi> All Protestant Divines agree, that the matter of the
<hi>Second Command</hi> is the <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dus</hi> of Divine Worship, Divine Worship
it self being commanded, and what is contrary to it forbidden in
the <hi>First Commandment.</hi> Now, though this preceptive proposition
of the Dr's, <hi>Worship God,</hi> be set down <hi>affirmative,</hi> yet the manner
how God is to be worshipped, is set down <hi>negative;</hi> and therefore
he hath yet given us no Duty commanded in the <hi>second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but only the way of worshipping God by an Image forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
(which he shunneth to say) or we must seek for some other
way to express the affirmative part of this Commandment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. We may then conclude, that it is injoined in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
That we should worship God in the way that He hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to us in His Word. This is elsewhere commanded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.
9, 40. and the contrary is severely reproved, <hi>Isa. 66. 3. Ier.</hi> 7. 31.
From all these places it is evident, that God is to be worshipped ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own Institution, and no otherwise: And I hope the
Dr. will not dissent from the generality of Divines, who hold, that
all Sins and Duties held forth in other places of Scripture, are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
to one of the Commandments. And to which of them can this
duty of worshipping God by the prescript of His VVord, be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
if not to the <hi>second?</hi> Hence we conclude, that the affirmative
part of the <hi>second Commandment</hi> is, that we ought to worship God in
the way that He himself hath prescribed in the Word. And if the
<hi>Dr.</hi> can make it appear, that the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
there, whether plainly or obscurely, directly or by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
we shall own them. 5. Whereas we say, that it is a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
comprehended in the <hi>second Commandment,</hi> That we must
worship God by our own Inventions. He saith, <hi>No Inventions are
condemned in the Worship of God, but such as God Himself hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
forbidden; but He hath no where forbidden the Liturgy and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</hi>
The meaning of this must be, a general prohibition of
humane Inven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ions is not sufficient; but notwithstanding, that they
are generally forbidden, Men may devise, and bring into God's
worship, and impose on others what they please, if that in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
be not forbidden by a particular precept wherein
it is named, or otherwise particularized. VVhat a mad
exposition of the <hi>second Commandment</hi> is this? He might as
well say, when it is said, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> I may, for all that, kill
any man I please, if there be not a particular command not to kill
such a man. Are there particular prohibitions of the several <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>
that were used in <hi>Popery?</hi> or, Must the Bible have been made
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95366:72"/>
so voluminous, as to mention every circumstantiate Case, otherwise
we will take no notice of its general Precepts? Is not this <hi>stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and forcing of Scripture to defend a bad Cause,</hi> which he below
chargeth us with?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. The <hi>Dr.</hi> (as conscious to the insufficiency of this shift)
cometh in the Fifth place to excuse the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> from falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>second Command,</hi> by telling us of two sorts of humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
forbidden in it, and no other. 1. <hi>Such as go about to represent
God, and so to disparage Him:</hi> For, he saith, the reason of the law, to
wit, <hi>the spiritual and invisible nature of God,</hi> extendeth only to these.
<hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It seems then, worshipping God by or before a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> is
not here forbidden, for that doth not go about to represent or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparage
God, but only to represent CHRIST as Man. The same
may be said of all the use of the Images of Saints in the worship of
God that is among the <hi>Papists;</hi> that is, they are all innocent by
this Doctrine: For, if these be not forbidden in the <hi>second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
the Dr. will find it hard to refute these practices from
Scripture. If such a passage had dropt from the Pen of a <hi>Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist,</hi>
how would the Dr. have improved it against the whole
Party, as doing the <hi>Papists</hi> work for them; as he hath charged them
on far less grounds than this is? <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. Seeing other waies of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded
VVorship are condemned in Scripture, as hath been
shewed, what reason is there to say, that this way of it alone is here
meant? This is to expound Scripture <hi>ad libitum,</hi> and amplifie or
restrain it as our fancy or interest leadeth us. <hi>Ans.</hi> 3. I deny not
the spiritual and invi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ble nature of God to be a good Reason of
this Law; but I deny it to be either the sole reason of it, or the
reason of it that is exprest in the Law it self; which is, that <hi>He is
a jealous God, and will punish the corrupters of His Worship.</hi> Now this
Reason of the Law doth evidently extend to all waies of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Him that He hath not injoined, making bold to worship Him
in any of these ways, being a derogation from that soveraignty that
He hath over Men, especially in His own VVorship, which hath a
nearer dependance on His Institution than other thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gs have.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. The other sort of humane Inventions that he will
exempt from the scope and sence of this Commandment, is, <hi>Such
as relate to the manner and form of Worship, supposing the Worship it
self to be performed in a way agreeable to the Divine Nature and Law.
Ans.</hi> 1. I desire to know of the Dr. what difference he maketh
between the <hi>manner</hi> or <hi>form</hi> of Worship, and the <hi>way</hi> of Worship;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95366:72"/>
when he supposeth the <hi>way</hi> of it to be agreeable to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Law; while yet the Controversie is, whether the <hi>manner</hi>
and <hi>form</hi> of it be so. This is a subtilty that I cannot reach; but
Words must serve to palliate a bad Cause when Reason cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it. Will then the Dr. say, that the <hi>way</hi> of Divine Worship is
injoined in this Command, but not the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of it? I
hope he will not deny; that the object of worship is fixed in the <hi>first
Commandment,</hi> and also the way of it, so far as by that word is
expressed, the duties of natural worship, the inward affections and
actings of the Soul on God, that are requisite in His Worship.
Wherefore, if he will (with all Divines, except <hi>Papists</hi> and some
<hi>Lutherans)</hi> allow this to be another Precept, and not a part or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the first; he must say, that here is appointed all insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
worship; that is, all the <hi>means, manner, external forms and
ways,</hi> by which the Lord will have us to worship him; to wit, that
we should make nor devise none of them to our selves: And this
he was pleased to express by the most absurd and most common
way that Men had devised to themselves to worship God by, to
wit, <hi>Images;</hi> as, in the rest of the Negative Precepts, he useth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
all the sins included in it, by one that is more notable than the
rest. <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. I hope the Dr. will not deny, that most of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Ceremonies,</hi> as <hi>Oil, Salt, Spittle, &amp;c.</hi> are forbidden in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
(or, if he do deny it, let him tell us where they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
or whether they be forbidden any where, or not) but they
perta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n to the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of worshipping God, as well as our
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> do. Further, let him tell us whether it is possible there
should be any <hi>Superstition</hi> in the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of worship; and if
there be, where is it forbidden, but in this Commandment? Or,
let him give us any reason why <hi>Humane Inventions,</hi> relating to the
<hi>manner</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of worship, are not forbidden, as well as these
that relate to the <hi>way</hi> of it. A Reason indeed he pretendeth to
give, <hi>Otherwise</hi> (saith he) <hi>all Vse of Mens inventions, as to preaching,
reading, interpreting Scripture, would be forbidden; and then this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the second Command would be unlawful, because it is a
meer invention of Man, as much as Liturgies and Ceremonies.</hi> If this
be to reason like a Divine, or to quibble like a Sophister, let the
Reader judge; for the Invention that men make use of in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the act or exercise of their faculties, whereby they find
out the mind of God: The <hi>inventions</hi> in God's worship, that we
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ow debate about, are Objects found out by Men, not commanded
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95366:73"/>
by God. If Men devise unrevealed Objects in Reading, Preaching,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> we condemn them in that, as well as in devising ways of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
God: And if the Dr. mean, that this exposition of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Commandment</hi> is an <hi>invention</hi> of Man, that is, the exercise of his
<hi>inventive Faculty,</hi> whereby he findeth out the Mind of God; he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
wide from the purpose, when he compareth that with things
that men devise to worship God by: If he mean, That the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
is only devised, not warranted; let him prove that, and
we shall reject it.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. I hope, by this time, the impartial Reader may judge
whether we <hi>stretch and force Scripture</hi> to condemn <hi>Liturgies</hi> and
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as the Dr. saith; or he doth so to defend them. That he
imputeth to us, <hi>blinding and fettering our minds by Education, and
reading but one sort of Books, and taking things for granted, which we
ought not,</hi> we resolve to bear patiently, and must accept of these,
instead of better Arguments, to refute our Principle. His instance
of the deniers of Infant-Baptism, proveth fully, that the <hi>Schism</hi>
doth not alwaies lie on the Imposer's side, (tho' they <hi>separate</hi> from
us, because of our using it, without considering imposing it on them.
VVho of them have been excommunicated for not using it, as we are
for forbearing the <hi>Ceremonies?)</hi> If men will <hi>separate,</hi> because the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances

through mistake, they that <hi>separate</hi> on that scruple do sin. And we
yield also to him, that not the pretence of Conscience, but sufficient
proof of the unlawfulness of the <hi>Terms of Communion,</hi> is a good
ground of <hi>Separation;</hi> and we still desire that the matter may be

                     </gap>
the Dr. now proceedeth to state the Question about <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Some think this should have been done before examining of
the Principles on which men <hi>separate;</hi> but the Dr. must use his
own method, and we must follow him, in examining what he saith.
He giveth us, <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. his Concessions, which I shall say little of,
save to make a Remark on one or two of them. And, 1. His third
Concession is, <hi>He can allow different modes of Worship in Cathedral and
Parochial Churches, in publick and private Administrations (these being
allowed by the Church in whose Communion we live:) but, What is this,</hi>
saith he, <hi>to the denying of constant Communion with our Churches, to the
chusing of new Pastors?</hi> It is true, these are two different things;
the difference is, the one is allowed by the <hi>Church,</hi> the other not so.
But consider the things in themselves, and abstracted from the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
pleasure,</hi> and there will appear to be as little <hi>Vniformity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Cathedral and Parochial Worship, as between their Parochial
Worship, and that used in the Meetings of the <hi>Dissenters.</hi> Now we
gladly would know of the Dr. or any of his Party, seeing the
<hi>Church</hi> can yield so far to Parochial Assemblies, as not to tie them
to the same Modes with Cathedral Assemblies, because they cannot
go to the expence of it: And seeing the Church dispenseth with
<hi>crossing</hi> in pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vate Baptism, why may She not condescend so far to
the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> who cannot for their Consciences use these things,
and so shun this Breach in the <hi>Church,</hi> this denying of Communion
with their Churches, and chusing of new Pastors? Are the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men so little to be regarded? or, Is it fit the Church should
be so imperious over her Members, as that She will indulge Mens
Purses, but not their Consciences; She will dispense with the sign
of the <hi>Cross</hi> for Her pleasure, but not for peoples consciences, when
they can shew good reason for what they think and make conscience
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95366:74"/>
of? This is wholly unaccountable, and very inconsistent with
those high pretentions, that our Brethren make of regard to Peace
and Unity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Another remark I make of his <hi>4th.</hi> Concession, That <hi>the
Church alloweth a different mode of Worship to Foreign Churches set up
in</hi> England, <hi>because they break not off Communion with the Church of</hi>
England, <hi>as they do who were Baptized in it.</hi> But why may not
the <hi>Church</hi> be as kind to her own Members as to Strangers; if the
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> be necessary, why should the neglect of them be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to any? If unnecessary; why should they be forced on mens
Consciences, to the Rending of the <hi>Church?</hi> The breaking off of
Communion that he talketh of, may be prevented by this Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendency;
and therefore it is most unreasonable to charge us with
that as a Sin, which we are under a Necessity to do for shunning the
wounding of our Consciences, and sinning against God; and which
they might as easily prevent by shewing us that Favour that they
shew to others. I take notice also of his <hi>6th.</hi> Concession, <hi>That it
was no sinful Separation to keep up the Exercise of True Religion under</hi>
Arians, <hi>against the will of the Magistrate: But what is this to our
Case, where true Doctrine is taught?</hi> It is very much to our Case;
for the reason why the Orthodox might Worship God apart from
the <hi>Arians</hi>—was because it had been their sin to join in corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
Worship; though we do not equal the owning of the <hi>Arian</hi>
Doctrine, and using the <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> yet we reckon the one to be
Sin, as really as the other; and we may not commit a smaller Sin
to enjoy Communion with a <hi>Church,</hi> more than we may commit a
greater Sin for that end. And we are not obliged to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Ordinances of God, when we cannot have them with the
<hi>Church</hi> without Sin, more than the Oxthodox were, who lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Arians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. Tho' the Dr. it seems had designed this Section for stating
of the Question, upon which his whole Book is founded: I see no
formal Stating of it (Concessions are but preparatory to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of a Controversie) except that, he saith, <hi>he had told Mr.</hi> B.
<hi>that all our dispute was, whether the upholding separate Meetings for
Divine Worship, where the Doctrine Established, and the substantial
parts of Worship are acknowledged to be agreeable to the Word of God, be
a sinful Separation or not?</hi> This is no sufficient stating of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
between the <hi>Prelatists</hi> and <hi>Dissenters</hi> about <hi>Separation.</hi>
Two things in it are not sufficiently clear; and some things needful
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95366:74"/>
to be minded in our present Controversy are left out. The First
thing that is not clear, is, That he will not allow any fault in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to justifie <hi>Separation,</hi> but what is in the <hi>Established Doctrine;</hi>
that is, either that which is contained in the <hi>Churches confession of
Faith,</hi> or is setled by Law. But it is evident there may be such
faults in Doctrine, as may make them that regard their Souls Health,
withdraw from a <hi>Church</hi> which are not here comprehended; that
is, when gross Errors are commonly taught, contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
contained in the Publick Confession of Faith, and which is
Established by Law: That this is a Case supposeable; yea, that
it ought to have been supposed with reference to our Controversy,
appeareth in that it is most common in <hi>England,</hi> for Ministers who
have subscribed the 39. <hi>Articles,</hi> to teach Doctrines quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to them; as I observed above: It is no rarity for unconscientious
men, to subscribe to whatever is imposed, rather than lose a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
and mean while to Hold and Teach what they please notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of such Subscription. Now if a <hi>Church</hi> should become so
corrupt, that Heresie is commonly taught, though the Orthodox
Faith be Established; ought not People to withdraw from that
<hi>Church?</hi> Or if many teach dangerous Doctrine contrary to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Truth; ought not People withdraw from such Teachers?
Especially when there is no way to get this unsound teaching re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
or restrained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. Another thing in the Dr's State of the Question is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clear;
to wit, That where the substantial parts of Worship are
acknowledged to be right, there should be no <hi>Separation.</hi> What
he meaneth by these is a Controversy it self; and he is at a great deal
of Pains to clear what he meaneth by this Term, <hi>Part.</hi> 3. p. 334.
whither I referr the Debate with him about it. But, what if any
part of Worship be unlawful; call it <hi>Substantial,</hi> or <hi>Circumstantial,</hi>
or what he will? Or what if something be Annexed to the True
Worship of God; which is sinful; but yet so peremptorily imposed,
as none shall worship God without it? I ask the Dr. whether in
this case we may <hi>separate,</hi> though we scruple not any part of that
worship that he is pleased to call <hi>Substantial Worship?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. Some things are also left out by the Dr. in his Stating of
the Controversy, which were needful to have been minded. As,
<hi>1st.</hi> To clear what he meaneth by <hi>Separation.</hi> I have above shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that sometimes they that are charged with <hi>Separation,</hi> are
meerly Passive in it; sometimes they are Active: The First is when
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95366:75"/>
the <hi>Church</hi> casteth them out, because they cannot submit to her Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.
The Second, when they take offence at something in
the <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore leave her; but are not cast out by her, but
have free and peaceable Access to all her Ordinances: In the first
Case (which is ours) if they causlesly scruple at the Impositions,
they may be charged with Ignorance, or Errour of Conscience, or
Peevishness, and Willfulness; but how they can be charged with <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi>
I know not, more than a Banished Man can be blamed as
a Fugitive from his Country. And if they have good cause to scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the Impositions; I see not how any blame can be fixed on them
at all. 2. He should have shewed whether by <hi>Separation</hi> he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
casting off all ties to have Communion with that <hi>Church,</hi> more
than with another <hi>Church</hi> that professeth the true Faith; as a Man,
or Company that live in <hi>Holland,</hi> have no more Tie to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
in <hi>England</hi> than in <hi>France, &amp;c.</hi> or a present forbearing of
Communion, because of sinful <hi>Terms,</hi> with owning an Obligation
to communicate with this <hi>Church,</hi> when these Bars shall be removed.
In the one case all relation to that <hi>Church</hi> in particular is cast off;
in the other not so: It is but a suspending the Exercise of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
as a Church-member; not a disowning it, or casting it
off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. He is defective in mentioning no other alledged grounds
of <hi>Separation,</hi> but false Doctrine Established, or wrong substantial
parts (as he calleth them) of Worship. He knoweth little of the
Controversy that he manageth, if he knew not that other grounds
are alledged; and therefore it had been fair to have fixed the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
on them; whether it be lawful to <hi>separate</hi> on such and such
grounds. It is true, his question may include all the grounds that
can be alledged, beside the two mentioned; but that which is the
main Hinge of our Controversy, should have been mentioned, in
stating of the Question. 4. It being confessed on both Hands,
that there is a sinful <hi>Separation;</hi> it should have been one part of his
question, where the Sin of this <hi>Separation</hi> is chargeable; whether
on the Imposers, or the Scruplers of those things that cause the <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?</hi>
But he is willing to set his <hi>Church</hi> beyond all imaginable
blame, and to put the Question only, whether the <hi>Dissenters</hi> have
any blame, or not? 5. It should not have been omitted; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
whether the Grounds alledged for <hi>Separation</hi> lie in things
really Evil, or only fan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ied to be such? And again, whether the
Evil of them be such as will bear the weight of <hi>Separation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:95366:75"/>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. I shall then endeavour to state the Question more fully
and clearly than the Dr. hath done. There are indeed divers questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
on which this question about <hi>Separation</hi> doth depend; and
therefore our Controversy cannot be represented in one single que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
to which an Affirmative or Negative Answer will suffice. It
is then, 1. A great part of our Controversy, seeing the <hi>Liturgy</hi> as
to the Frame of it, and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are by the Clergy thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
and so unnecessary, That God may be acceptably Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
without them, and the Dissenters think them unlawful to be
used, and are able to make it appear by good reason, that it is not
Humour but Conscience that moveth them so to think; whether
they should impose these on the Dissenters, and so force them either
to <hi>separate</hi> or sin against their Consciences. 2. It is a part of our
Controversie, and that indeed on which it mainly hangeth; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to worship God by the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and with the <hi>Seremonies,</hi> be a
Worship acceptable to him; or such as he will reject. If he will
approve them to be acceptable Worship; yea, lawful to be used;
all our other questions will cease. 3. Supposing them to be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
worship, as the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> believe; and supposing
them to be so imposed by the <hi>Church,</hi> as we cannot enjoy God's
Ordinances without them with the <hi>Church:</hi> The question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we should chuse to use them, or forbear the Ordinances with
the <hi>Church?</hi> 4. It is yet another question; supposing the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of using them, and impossibility of joining with the <hi>Church</hi>
without them; whether we ought to live without the Ordinances
of God; or keep <hi>separate Meetings,</hi> where we may enjoy God's
Ordinances without sinful mixtures of Man's inventions? I deny
not but several other questions may fall in, while we are debating
these; but these are the main points in difference between our
Brethren and Us. Some have not unfitly, though not so fully,
comprized all the Controversie in this question; whether we ought
to worship God, only according to the Prescript of his Word, or
may do it by the Traditions of Men?</p>

                  <head>SECT. V The Dr's Arguments examined for Occasional Communion.</head>
                  <p>HAving Stated the Question, he is resolved to make the charge
of <hi>Separation</hi> against all the <hi>Dissenters:</hi> And <hi>1st.</hi> against those
that deny <hi>constant Communion</hi> to be a Duty, where-ever <hi>Occasional
Communion</hi> is lawful. 2. Against them that hold all <hi>Communion</hi>
with the <hi>Church of England</hi> unlawful. He insisteth on the <hi>1st. Sect.
16. &amp;c.</hi> There was here also need of clear stating of this question;
which I have done above; and here resume it briefly: <hi>Occasion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l
Communion</hi> is either in some Duties, or in all Duties; and so is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Communion.</hi> I hope he doth not mean, that they who think
it lawful to communicate with the <hi>Church</hi> in some Ordinances,
as Preaching, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are consequently to that obliged to
think it lawful to Communicate with them in all Ordinances; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have annexed unlawful <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> to some Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
and not to others. The Question then is, whether they
who because they cannot enjoy all the Ordinances without Sin in
the Publick Assembly, and yet think they may enjoy some of
them without Sin; and have for enjoying all God's Ordinances
without Sin, set up a Meeting apart from the <hi>Church</hi> for that end:
whether I say such are obliged constantly to attend these Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the Publick Assembly, where there is no Sin in their joining
in. To make the thing plainer by Instances; we may lawfully
hear Sermons by the <hi>Conformists;</hi> and do not shun to do it occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally;
but they have annexed such unlawful <hi>Terms of Communion</hi>
to the <hi>Sacraments;</hi> and sometimes even to their Preaching, by
their <hi>second Service</hi> at the end, as well as the first at the beginning,
that we cannot at all enjoy the <hi>Sacraments;</hi> and but seldom other
Ordinances, in purity; and therefore are forced to have Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
where we may enjoy all the Ordinances in purity. Now the
Question is, whether in that case we are obliged constantly to
wait on Preaching in the Publick Assembly, rather than in our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Meetings. The Dr. is for the Affirmative; we are for the
Negative.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Before I examine what the Dr. saith for his opinion; I
shall in a few words lay down the Grounds on which we deny any
such obligation to lie on us. 1. We are cast out of their <hi>Church</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:95366:76"/>
by <hi>Excommunication;</hi> all of us being <hi>Excommunicated ipso facto,</hi> on
our <hi>Non-conformity</hi> by the Canon as the Dr. confesseth; though he
labour to palliate the Matter, <hi>Praef.</hi> P. 74. and <hi>Part. 3. P.</hi> 367.
And many of us; yea, most of us in many places <hi>Excommunicated</hi>
by Name; and Prosecuted with such Severities, that we may not
be seen in Publick: It is strange that they should cast us out of their
Communion, and at the same time blame us for forbearing their
Communion. 2. This partial Communion that the Dr. would
have us constantly use, can neither satisfie the Laws of the State
(which he layeth so much stress on in <hi>Church-matters)</hi> nor of the
<hi>Church:</hi> There is no Law for hearing of Sermons; but only for
waiting on the <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>Sacraments;</hi> from which they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
us by their Impositions. Why then should they blame us for
forbearing that Communion with them, which themselves lay so
little weight on, while they have excluded us from that which they
count <hi>Church-Communion,</hi> so as the Dr. himself reckoneth hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Sermon not to be? 3. Being by their unlawful Impositions
necessitated to have Meetings and Pastors for Administration of all
God's Ordinances; we think our selves more obliged to wait con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
on hearing of the VVord in those Meetings, and from
those Pastors; than in the Assembles, which we are so necessitated
to leave, or rather are driven from, for a time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. In order to proving his opinion about <hi>Occasional Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
the Dr. undertaketh to make out. 1. That <hi>bare Occasional
Communion doth not excuse from the Guilt of Separation. 2. That as
far as Occasional Communion with our Church is allowed to be lawful,
constant Communion is a Duty.</hi> The First of these we are little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to dispute with him; we bring other Grounds to clear our
selves of the Guilt of <hi>Separation,</hi> that he layeth on us: Neither do
I see how that by it self could do it. If we have no cause to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
constant Communion, we cannot satisfie the Obligation that
lieth on us to the Unity of the <hi>Church,</hi> by Communion with her
now and then. It is no wonder that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> (as he saith)
<hi>were not satisfied with Occasional Communion granted to them by the
Dissenting Brethren,</hi> because they saw no just cause of their denying
<hi>constant. Communion;</hi> which if we cannot shew in our case, we are
indeed faulty. I have above shewed how we are Members of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and how not: And do not plead that <hi>Occasional Communion</hi>
maketh one a <hi>Member,</hi> but I hope it will not be denied, but that,
with protestation of the Grounds on which we own it, will shew
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95366:77"/>
that we do not cast off all sort of <hi>Membership</hi> with the <hi>Church;</hi> and it
may excuse from the <hi>tantum,</hi> though not from the <hi>totum</hi> of <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as I believe it did in the <hi>Independants,</hi> compared with the
<hi>Brownists,</hi> in reference to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> which the Dr. instanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
For his discourse against Mr. <hi>B.</hi> for being Eighteen years
without Administring or receiving the Sacrament, and yet Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
What Evil is in it, or in other instances of this nature, will
be charged on his Party, who deprive us of the Ordinances of the
Lord with them, by their sinful <hi>Impositions;</hi> and do what they can
to hinder us from having them otherwise, by their <hi>Persecutions;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things of that nature are our Affliction, and their Sin; but all
this cannot oblige us to Communicate with them in their Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God's Worship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. I leave our Author to make the best he can of his first
undertaking, and come to attend him in his second; to wit, That
<hi>constant Communion is a Duty, where Occasional Communion is lawful.</hi>
This he manageth, <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>A.</hi> had given good
instances to disprove this, as it is here set down; to wit, joining
with other Parishes in a Journey, at a Lecture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to understand it, with the Dr. of Communion with a <hi>Church,</hi>
whereof we have been or should be <hi>Members;</hi> and of withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from a Church for some Corruptions; where yet I may <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally</hi>
join in some duties; for his opinion in this, he bringeth
two Arguments; the first he taketh from <hi>the general Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christians to use all lawful means for preserving the Peace and Vnity
of the Church.</hi> This he inforceth, by proving this Obligation;
which none of us ever denied; but do with more reason retort all
that can be said, on that he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, on themselves, who will not do what
they can for this Peace and Unity; they will not quit so much as
one of their needless <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or our part we are ready to do
what we can without Sin for Peace and Unity; but the Dr. should
have proved, 1. That our coming to their Sermons, as often as
there was no Let by the <hi>Liturgy</hi> joined with it, and when they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to suffer us without Excommunication, and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ndo</hi>'s, would
preserve that which he calleth <hi>Peace and Vnity.</hi> 2. That we being
necessitated to have other Meetings for the pure Ordinances of God;
it was a lawful means for Peace and Unity with that <hi>Church</hi> that
had driven us away, to desert these Meetings, and wait on so much
of their Administrations, as they should be pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to allow us.
Our Hearts do not reproach us, as this Learned Author doth, <hi>That
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95366:77"/>
it is one of the provoking Sins of the Non-conformists, that they have
been so backward in doing what they were convinced they might have done,
with a good Conscience:</hi> He meaneth toward Communion with the
<hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. But I perceive all the Strength of his Argument, and
the Zeal with which he prosecuteth it, is built on a mistake; to wit,
<hi>That we hold it lawful to Communicate with the Church in the Liturgy
and Sacraments.</hi> If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or any other, are of that opinion, I
know not why they should be <hi>Non-conformists:</hi> If I were convinced
of it, I should not deny <hi>constant Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

need not talk so highly against his Opposites as he doth, p. 159.
when they speak of some cases, where joining with the <hi>Church,</hi> would
do more harm than good. <hi>Was ever Schism,</hi> saith he, <hi>made so light
of? And the Peace and Vnity of Christianity valued at so low a rate? Ans.</hi>
Yes, to wit, by them who will not part with a Trifling <hi>Ceremony,</hi>
for the Peace that they so much talk of; but will impose these on
scrupling Consciences by force, to the dividing of the <hi>Church,</hi> the
laying aside of thousands of well qualified Ministers, and the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
and Ruin of many Souls. Did ever men in the World make
lighter of the Peace of Christians, than these men do, if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their deeds, and yet value it more highly, if ye regard their
words? He asketh, p. 161. Which <hi>of them readeth what they think
lawful in their own Assemblies? Ans.</hi> We read part of that <hi>Service-Book</hi>
daily in our Assemblies; to wit, the Scriptures therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
we read them out of the Bible; but for using the Book,
or any part of it, as in that composure, we find no obligation on
us to that; both because that would be very insignificant toward
Unity with the <hi>Church,</hi> more than Preaching of the same Doctrine,
and praying for the same things, is counted by them; also, we
look on the whole Frame and Model of that <hi>Service,</hi> as a humane
device, that we ought to give no Countenance to in God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. All his Arguments, <hi>Sect.</hi> 18. do proceed on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
mistake; to wit, that we count Communion with them
in all their Ordinances lawful: If that were true, Communion
with them sometimes for peace, might well inferr constant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95366:78"/>
for the same good design. Neither do I say, that <hi>better
means of Edification</hi> will warrant constant <hi>separate</hi> Assemblies; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it may warrant <hi>Occasional Communion</hi> elsewhere, then where we
are Members of a <hi>Church.</hi> I look not on our Lords Communion
with the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> as only <hi>Occasional,</hi> but <hi>Constant,</hi> so far as
the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k that he was sent into the World for, did permit; but I
am far from thinking that ever he did communicate with the <hi>Jews</hi>
in any part of their uninstituted worship, as the Dr. alledgeth, p.
162. <hi>His presence at the Feast of Dedication, as other Jews were,</hi> is
asserted by the Dr. without all Ground; and he knoweth our
Writers do constantly deny it; and therefore his bare asserting it,
should not have been thought enough to set it off. All that the
Scripture saith of this, is, That <hi>he walked in</hi> Solomon's <hi>Porch,</hi>
Joh. 10. 22, 23. Did none of the <hi>Jews</hi> more than this, at that Feast?
Is it not to be thought, that he who did so sharply reprove their
uninstituted <hi>Washings,</hi> and other religious <hi>Observations,</hi> on account
of the want of Institution; and defended the <hi>Non-conformity</hi> of his
Disciples to these Observations; would himself observe a Religious
Solemnity, that had no other warrant nor foundation, but what
those other things had, which he condemneth? It is then rational
to think, that he walked there to get opportunity to speak to the
People at that concourse; as the Apostles after did, when they
knew these <hi>Jewish</hi> Feasts to be abrogated, and not fit to be observed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. He bringeth a Second Argument, <hi>Sect.</hi> 19. from <hi>Phil.
3. 16. As far as we have already attained, let us walk by the same
Rule; let us mind the same things:</hi> To prove that where <hi>Occasional
Communion</hi> with a <hi>Church</hi> is lawful, <hi>constant Communion</hi> is a Duty;
for, saith he, <hi>from hence appeareth evident, that Men ought to go as far
as they can toward Vniformity, and not to forbear doing any thing which
they lawfully may do towards Peace and Vnity.</hi> This Argument is but
lamely proposed, and this Scripture but weakly improved (by
what the Dr. saith) to prove his design. Two things, it seems,
he would inferr from it; to wit, <hi>Vniformity,</hi> and <hi>Study of Peace.</hi>
I first ask him, whether he thinketh these two to be necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined;
so as to study the one, is to study the other also; and
neglecting the one, is, to neglect the other? If he say they are
not, why doth he here conjoin them? Will not the study of Peace
answer this injunction of the Apostle, without Uniformity? If he
say they are, it is easie to prove the contrary; for not only we have
Peace and Unity with other <hi>Churches,</hi> though not <hi>Vniformity;</hi> but
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95366:78"/>
the <hi>Church of England</hi> alloweth a <hi>Difformity</hi> within her self; to wit,
between Cathedral and Parochial <hi>Service;</hi> and yet I hope she allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no <hi>Schism,</hi> nor breach of Unity; or, will the Dr. say, that
the Apostle here injoineth <hi>Vniformity</hi> among all particular Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
in a <hi>Church,</hi> except in Cathedrals? I confess it is like he did
not mind their <hi>Vniformity,</hi> for he knew no such distinction of
Churches, or Officers, on whom it dependeth, under the New
Testament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. I ask, Secondly, what sort of <hi>Vniformity</hi> doth he think
the Apostle doth here injoin; if in Doctrine, instituted Worship,
Holy Conversation, and such like: I grant it to be our Duty to
study it; But if in the same Forms and Words of Prayer, in the
same religious instituted <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> yea, or in all the same Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
let him prove that the Apostle meant any such thing;
for we deny it: And it is generally held, that the Ancient <hi>Church</hi>
(which the Dr. thinks could not possibly so soon degenerate from
Apostolick practice) was very various, and not Uniform in her
Rites and Customs; as may be seen in <hi>Daillie</hi>'s <hi>right use of the Fathers,</hi>
Lib. 2. p. 148.—but much more fully in the Dr's own <hi>Irenicum,</hi>
p. 65, 66. <hi>He must be a great Stranger to the Primitive Church, that
takes not notice of the great Diversity of Rites and Customs used in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Churches, without any censuring of those that differed from them,
or if any, by inconsiderate Zeal did proceed so far</hi> (as the Dr. and
others now doth) <hi>how ill it was resented by other Christians.</hi> A
great deal more to that purpose is excellently there said: But, <hi>O
quantum mutatus ab illo</hi>—We deny that <hi>Vniformity</hi> (such as that
our Breth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en use to plead so hotly for) was any part of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
meaning; and therefore it ought to be no part of the Dr's
Argument from this Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. I do, in the Third place, readily acknowledge, that
the Apostle here designeth to engage Christians, as far as they can
attain, by their understanding of what is their Duty; and as far as
they can lawfully do, to study Peace and Unity, as with all men;
so with the <hi>Church</hi> of which they are Members. But how doth this
prove <hi>constant Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> to be our duty; for if he
mean <hi>constant Communion</hi> in the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> we have
not attained so far: We see not the lawfulness of the use of these,
much less of the constant use of them; and therefore the Apostle doth
not enjoin us to study Peace and Unity that way. I should rather
think that a concludent Argument might be brought from this Text,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95366:79"/>
to perswade our Brethren to study the Peace and Unity of the
<hi>Church,</hi> by not pressing us with these things, nor forcing us to
withdraw from the <hi>Church,</hi> because of them; for they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
so far, they know them to be indifferent, and so unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
They and we agree in this Attaintment; why then do we not
<hi>walk by the same Rule,</hi> in laying them aside, and <hi>minding the same
things;</hi> to wit, the Unity of the <hi>Church,</hi> and not our own Enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Grandeur, and Dominion over our Brethren? But if he mean
<hi>constant Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> in the Orninance of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
1. That themselves hinder, by their Excommunication.
2. That is not Duty in the Circumstances, that their Violence
hath placed us in, as hath been shewed. 3. That could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to Peace and Unity, while we are necessitated to keep <hi>separate</hi>
Meetings on other accounts. So that the Apostle's command in
this Text, doth not at all reach our case, and how far it reacheth
the Imposers, let them look to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. Having thus defended our cause from his Argument
built on this Text, even supposing his own Exposition of the Text,
I shall not need to be concerned in what Exposition others give of
it; nor in his Refutations of them; yet I shall take notice of a few
things in his discourse on this Text, which may seem to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our cause. And, 1. this Refutation of Dr. <hi>O.</hi> who saith, <hi>That
the Apostle understandeth the different Attainments of Christians in
knowledge; supposing which, they should jointly practise what they know;
and bear with one another in what they differed about.</hi> To confirm
this, (if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> be not a Crime to make use of Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s Criticks, which
the Dr. objecteth to Mr. <hi>A.</hi> the poor <hi>Non-conformists</hi> not having

                        </gap>ies</hi> to furnish them with vast Libraries) this seemeth to be
the general opinion of Interpreters, <hi>gradum illum cognitionis rerum
divinarum &amp; perfectioris vitae,</hi> say <hi>Menochius, Estius</hi> and <hi>Tirinus.
In eo quod revelavit Deus;</hi> saith <hi>Zanchius:</hi> Who, though he apply it
by way of Consequence against Dissentions in the <hi>Church,</hi> as the
Dr. a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>geth, p. 176. yet doth down-right make the Apostle to
mean of Degrees of Knowledge; and his applying it against Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions
doth not say, that he presseth Unity in Mens Devices; but
in God's Truth, and Institutions, which no doubt the Apostle doth
also recommend. Also <hi>Bullinger in loc.</hi> (not cited by Mr. <hi>Pool)
Idem sentientes, &amp; concordibus votis, calculis, &amp; studiis progrediamur,
agnitaque veritate provehamur.</hi> Let the Dr. shew us one Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that expoundeth this passage of Studying the <hi>Churches</hi> Peace
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95366:79"/>
by <hi>Vniformity</hi> in <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Liturgy:</hi> I think himself is the first
that hatcht that Opinion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. The Dr. here, against Dr. <hi>O.</hi> discusseth three Points;
the first is, Whether the Apostle speaketh here of different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
or of different Practices. He endeavoureth to prove the
latter, because <hi>the Apostle beginneth with a Caution against them that
were for Circumcision, and maketh a digression concerning himself; he
adviseth People to agree in pursuing their main end; and then bringeth
in the Case of them that were not satisfied about the Law, that People
should not listen to them, because they made Divisions among them, and
divided them by different Observations.</hi> This is to expound Scripture
by our fancy. It is evident, that the Apostle is speaking of <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
which the <hi>Concision</hi> Thought must be, by the Works of the
Law: And this he refuteth from his own practice of looking after
another Righteousness; but he would have them to deal tenderly
with those that had not yet learned the Truth, even in that great
point, waiting till God should instruct them. I see nothing that
he saith to prove, that it was meant of <hi>different Practices,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of different <hi>Opinions,</hi> that divided the <hi>Church:</hi> But whether
the one or the other, it proveth not, that we should go over the
Belly of our Light to keep Peace, but rather bear with one another
for that end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. Next he enquireth, <hi>Whether the Rule here mentioned
was the Rule of mutual Forbearance.</hi> I think the Question should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be, Whether it was a Rule of God's making, or of Man's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king?
Whatever the Rule were in particular. <hi>Tirinus</hi> saith, <hi>Regulam

If the Dr. can prove this Rule to be a humane Rule, he will gain
much by this Scripture, otherwise nothing at all. We are content
to follow a Divine Rule, for attaining Peace in the <hi>Church;</hi> it doth
indeed forbid peevish dividing of the <hi>Church,</hi> by injoining to hold to
the same Rule; but the Dividers are not they that are content to
follow all Christ's Rules, but they that make Rules of their own,
and will tear the <hi>Church</hi> in pieces, rather than these should not be
observed. The Third thing he enquireth into is, What influence
this Rule hath on our Case. He saith, <hi>It obligeth to go as far as we
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95366:80"/>
can:</hi> This is confessed. But then we say, It is a Divine, and not
Humane Rule that must shew how far we can, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ought to go.
He saith, <hi>When we can go no further, we must sit down quietly, and wait
for further Instruction, and not divide the Church. Ans.</hi> When the
Apostle speaketh, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. of God's further instructing them that
mistake, I suppose it expresseth rather the hope that the sound part
should have of them that are short in Knowledge, which should
make them not over-drive them, (as our Brethren would do with
us) than what is their Duty. I am far from saying, that it is mens
Duty to break the Peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> but I am sure, two things
are far from being the Apostle's Scope, to injoin such doubting
Christians; 1. That they should go over the belly of their Light,
to join with them that they differ from, either in the Principles or
the Practices that they scruple. 2. That if they cannot have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in Ordinances with them, unless they thus sin against Light,
that they should live without the Ordinances. None of these we
have any Rule for in the Gospel; and therefore doing of these
were not walking by any Rule that the Apostle here meaneth.
The Dr. saith, p. 171. <hi>This Rule, in order to Peace, requireth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
of such things, which although they be not particularly appointed
by God, yet are injoined by lawful Authority, and not repugnant to the
Word.</hi> I wish the Dr. had proved, that the Apostle giveth any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to observe such things in the Worship of God; we deny it.
It is fallacious to propose his distinction of things <hi>not particularly
appointed</hi> by God, but appointed by <hi>Lawful Authority;</hi> but let us see
a general Rule from the Word, for what we scruple, and that will
satisfie us: Or, let us see what Authority Men have to appoint any
thing that is <hi>in statu cultus,</hi> or <hi>religioso,</hi> that God hath not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
It is most falsly asserted, p. 172. that <hi>Because the Apostles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
against a plausible pretence of Conscience, about abstaining from
Blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Governours of the Church,</hi> (he hath now changed the
stile; it used to be, the Magistrate) <hi>by parity of Reason, may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
those things which they think conduce most to the peace and welfare
of the Church which they are bound to preserve:</hi> For to give any colour
of Truth to this Assertion, he must prove, 1. That ordinary
Church-Governours have as much Power as the Apostles in such
Cases. 2. That there is a parity of Reason for the things determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by our Church-Guides, and those by the Apostles; these were
necessary, and the Apostles Decree found them so, and had its Rise
from this <hi>necessity.</hi> The <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are confessed to be <hi>indifferent,</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:95366:80"/>
and to have no <hi>necessity,</hi> but what it pleaseth the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi>
to give them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. He saith, p. 173, in answer to another of his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
That <hi>the Apostle gave binding Rules to particular Churches, which
are not extant in Scripture, as appears by</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 17. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This
Rule is expresly said to be given in all <hi>Churches,</hi> not to any <hi>Church</hi>
in particular. 2. That this Rule is not extant in Scripture, is
false; for it is extant in this place. 3. This Rule that a man should
keep within his station, is no prudential Rule of Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as the Dr. hinteth, but a Principle of the Moral Law.
4. We are content to submit to all Rules that can be justly proved
out of, or inferred from Scripture, tho' they be not, <hi>in terminis,</hi>
extant there. But the Rules for <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are none
of these.</p>

Differences between our withdrawing from the <hi>Church,</hi>
and that of the <hi>Independents.</hi> 1. They have more grounds on which
they <hi>separate</hi> than we; and consequently, more is required to bring
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95366:81"/>
them back to Communion with the <hi>Church,</hi> than is to bring us to
it; for we withdraw, as they also do, because of the <hi>Liturgy, Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in Baptism, Kneeling</hi> in the Act of receiving the Lord's Supper,
observing of <hi>Holidaies:</hi> If the <hi>Church</hi> will either remove these, or

                        </gap>parate,</hi> because of the wrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the <hi>Church</hi> in her Members, want of a right Discipline,
faults in the election and ordination of Ministers: Tho' the <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi>
and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were not, they would still <hi>separate,</hi> as they do from
the <hi>Presbyterian Churches,</hi> where these are not. 2. They <hi>separate,</hi>
because these are used; We only because they are imposed as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
terms of our being admitted to Communion. They <hi>separate,</hi>
because the <hi>Church</hi> is polluted with these; We only because we
dare not pollute our own Consciences with them. If we may have
leave but to forbear personal concurrence in these, we think the
fault of other men (I mean in things of that nature) no ground for
us to withdraw from the Ordinances in and with the <hi>Church;</hi> so

Reformation.</hi> This he undertaketh to prove by the testimony of
some <hi>French Divines,</hi> and he beginneth with <hi>Calvin,</hi> whose words
(too long here to be transcribed) do prove indeed <hi>Separation</hi> from a
<hi>Church</hi> to be unlawful, because of lesser Impurities or great
Faults, while the Doctrine and Worship are not greatly corrupted.
But he speaketh not one word of the Case of them who are driven
away from a <hi>Church,</hi> because they cannot submit to sinful <hi>Terms of
Communion</hi> with Her: yea; he speaketh more in favour of such a
Case than against it; for he maketh Corruption in Christ's Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
(even in the words cited by the Dr. p. 181, 182.) and being
<hi>anathematized,</hi> for not complying with these Corruptions, a ground
of <hi>Separation</hi> from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is parallel to our case.
<hi>But</hi> (saith the Dr.) <hi>he doth not mean indifferent Rites. Ans.</hi> Neither
do we scruple <hi>indifferent Rites,</hi> but <hi>sinful Ceremonies.</hi> And tho' I

some of her Members, because they will not sin with her,
and will force her Impositions on their Consciences; and so doth
the other. Another Author he citeth is <hi>Daillie,</hi> giving most substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95366:81"/>
Reasons for <hi>Separation</hi> from <hi>Rome;</hi> and he doth not mention
our <hi>Ceremonies</hi> among them. And, what need was there to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
them, when there were such weighty Reasons beside to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on? But Monsieur <hi>Daillie</hi> saith expresly, <hi>if the differences had
been such, as we might safely have yielded to, then Separation had been
rash and unjust.</hi> So say we, for we cannot yield to the lesser sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>superstitious Worship,</hi> as we cannot to that which is greater,

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. Next he citeth <hi>Amyraldus,</hi> who saith, <hi>If there had been
no other faults in the Roman Church, beside their unprofitable Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in Baptism, and other things beyond the measure and</hi> genius <hi>of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, they had still continued in Her Communion. Ans.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should we refuse Communion with the <hi>Church of England,</hi> for
these and such-like faults: We refuse the use of these, and because
of that, the <hi>Church</hi> casteth us out of Her Communion. And if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myrald
us</hi> say, That he would have used these rather than have fallen
under <hi>Rome's anathema,</hi> we leave him to his own Sentiments in that,
but are of another opinion. It is no wonder these men think little
or next to nothing of the Evil of our <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> when they are
compared with these <hi>Romish Abominations;</hi> but when we consider
them by themselves, and compare them with Scripture, we cannot
think so of them. The Dr. further urgeth us, with the Answers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by <hi>Claude, Paion,</hi> and <hi>Turretine,</hi> to the Book entituled, <hi>Prejudes
legitimes contre les Calvinustes:</hi> That they do not defend the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
by the unlawfulness of the <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> this is both false and
inconcludent: It is false; for Monsieur <hi>Claude</hi> spendeth a good
part of the Third Chapter of his First Part in defending the ground
and right that the <hi>Reformers</hi> had, to depart from the Communion
of the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> because of their <hi>Ceremonies. One of the chief
Objects</hi> (saith he) <hi>that presented it self to our Fathers, was that of the
great number of the Ceremonies;</hi> which he setteth forth as defacing
God's Worship, making it look partly like <hi>Judaism,</hi> and partly
like <hi>Heathenism:</hi> He saith, <hi>It was, without doubt, a character very
opposite to the Gospel of Jesus Christ;</hi> and much more to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
What the other two Answerers of that Book say on this
Head, I know not, for I have not seen them. This Argument is
also inconcludent, because the <hi>Reformation</hi> is abundantly defended
by weightier Objections against <hi>Popery.</hi>

them on others: They that are left to their liberty, may well <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate</hi>

<hi>Superstition</hi> imposed is <hi>tolerable</hi> to a tender Conscience; for <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi>
is Sin, and no Sin is <hi>tolerable</hi> in that case. To the Dr's <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis</hi>
I answer, That it is absolutely false; and I wonder that he
should assert it so confidently without proof; for, (that I may not
deny, as he asserteth, without reason) 1. A <hi>Superstitious Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

If this Doctrine were true, men might impose what they will in

and these long Citations, home to his purpose, which every
Reader could hitherto hardly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would make over us, if we had nothing else to justifie our <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

us, how we would be laughed at, all over the Christian world,
and how the <hi>Papists</hi> are hardened, seeing no end of <hi>Schism.</hi> To
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95366:82"/>
all this I answer, 1. I know <hi>Rome,</hi> and some others too, will triumph
when there is no cause for their so doing; but as long as we can
shew Scripture-warrant for what we hold and do, we are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in their censures. 2. That there is no cause, for their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing,
appeareth, because the Dr. and his Party, (who have the
same cause of Triumph that the <hi>Papists</hi> could have on this occasion)
have as yet had no such victory in their Debates with us, as to make
them triumph. 3. If by the Christian World, he mean the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
part of Christianity, (for the rest, we are less m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ved by their
Judgments) I hope they will not laugh at us, who scruple nothing,
but what most of them have condemned, as Additions to the Word
of God, and Corruptions of His Worship; for so all the <hi>Calvinist-Churches</hi>
and Divines have done. 4. If the <hi>Papists</hi> be hardened, as
seeing no end of <hi>Schism,</hi> they are to be blamed; for we can shew
them, and others, a good end of it; to wit, ordering the worship of
God by his Institution; or, at least, imposing nothing uninstituted
as <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church.</hi>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. His Second Argument is, <hi>Sect.</hi> 24. That <hi>this Separation
maketh Vnion among the Protestant Churches impossible, supposing them
to remain as they are.</hi> This he proveth, because <hi>the Lutheran Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
have these and more Ceremonies, yet these Churches are thought
true, and fit to be united with, by a Synod of the Reformed at</hi> Charen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
1631. <hi>The</hi> Helvetian <hi>Churches declare against separating for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Rites and Ceremonies. So doth the Confession of</hi> Poland, <hi>and
that of</hi> Ausburg, <hi>and</hi> Strasburg; <hi>also</hi> Crecius, <hi>and the</hi> Transilvanian
<hi>Divines.</hi> Nothing of all this cometh up the point as above sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
We allow no <hi>Separation</hi> for these Rites; and none of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
or Confessions mentioned, disalloweth forbearing of them in
our own persons, nor injoineth using of them. We do not <hi>separate</hi>
because the <hi>Church</hi> useth them; but She driveth us away because we
cannot use them. What he citeth out of <hi>Amyraldus,</hi> p. 189. that
the nature of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> is to be taken from the Doctrine that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
along with them, I have said somewhat to above. I deny not,
but a bad Doctrine may infect an indifferent <hi>Ceremo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y,</hi> that is built
on it; but I cannot assent, That the best Doctrine can justifie an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instituted
<hi>Ceremony</hi> in God's Worship. He citeth <hi>Davenant,</hi> giving
three Reasons that may hinder Union; and the first is, <hi>Tyranny over
Mens Faith and Conscience;</hi> let but this be removed, and our <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
is at an end; for I think the Dr. will hardly clear imposing of
needless <hi>Ceremonies</hi> on them that are convinced of, and can prove
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95366:83"/>
their sinfulness of this blame. That Protestant Churches abroad
have harder <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> than we, he supposeth, p. 198. but
doth not prove; the <hi>Calvinist Churches</hi> have not; and if the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran
Churches</hi> have, that is, impose them with such rigour, we
cannot but, <hi>eatenus,</hi> condemn them: Yet we shut not out the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran
Churches</hi> from all possibility of Union with them, as he insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates;
we can have Union with them as <hi>Sister Churches,</hi> but we
cannot partake in their instituted parts of Worship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. His third Argument is, that <hi>this will justifie the ancient
Schisms that have alwaies been condemned in the Christian Church; and
he instanceth in the Schism of the</hi> Novatians <hi>and others:</hi> But the Dr.
hath done us <hi>Presbyterians</hi> the favour, to free us of the trouble of
this Debate with him, by setting aside (from their Pleas for <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
Ceremonies, Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>Holidays,</hi> which are the things we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon. I say no more on this Argument, but take notice of the
Dr's wonderful but most groundless confidence in a <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting,
That <hi>these are common to our Church, with all other Christian
Churches, for many hundred years before the great degeneracy of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church, and are continued by an universal consent in all parts of the
Christian World.</hi> The first part of his Assertion is absolutely false,
for all the cunning used in inserting the Epithete, <hi>great degeneracy</hi>
of the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> I know not where he will fix this <hi>great dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy,</hi>
whether in <hi>Boniface</hi>'s usurping the Title of <hi>Vniversal Bishop,</hi>
or, may be, in the <hi>Council of Trent:</hi> But he shall never prove, that
these were used in the Church before a notable <hi>degeneracy</hi> of the
<hi>Church;</hi> nor that they were used by all Christians, even before the
<hi>greatest deg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>neracy.</hi> For the Second Part of his Assertion, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
comprehension what he can mean by it; for he cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
that these are not continued in all, nor most of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches,</hi> but disowned in their Confessions, and by their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
But some mens confidence, or pretence to it, runs highest,
when Truth and Reason is with them at the lowest ebb.</p>

I shall pass by, as not against the cause that I maintain, and only
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95366:83"/>
briefly answer his Argument, (if either his Party, or any pretended
to be on our side, will not keep within that Boundary, let them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it) That Separation will soon be at an end, if the <hi>Church</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
nothing but what is warranted by Scripture, and if People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
nothing, so as to <hi>separate</hi> for it, but what they can shew Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-ground,
that it were their Sin to own it or do it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. His Fifth Argument is taken from <hi>the Obligation that
lieth on all Christians to preserve the Peace and Vnity of the Church.</hi> To
enforce this Argument, the Dr. doth well prove several sound truths,
but such as none of them, nor all of them, conclude against with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
from the <hi>Church,</hi> when sinful <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
as, 1. That the Study of Unity is a Duty. 2. That this
Unity doth not lie in bare Communion in Faith and Love. 3. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can discharge us from this Obligation to study Unity, but
what is allowed by Christ or his Apostles, as a sufficient reason for
it. What is all this, to make up an Obligation to sin against God,
rather than <hi>separate</hi> from the <hi>Church?</hi> But a fourth thing he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
on, may be, will help him better. He telleth us of three ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
wherein Scripture alloweth of <hi>Separation;</hi> to wit, <hi>Idolatrous
Worship, False Doctrine, mens making indifferent things necessary to
Salvation.</hi> That this is not a sufficient enumeration, I prove;
1. Because there may be sinful <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> imposed where
none of these are. May not men make owning Traditions of Men
necessary to their Communion, tho' they make it not necessary to
Salvation? and where-ever we must sin or <hi>separate, Separation</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the Scripture, which tieth us to <hi>live peaceably with all men,
if possible,</hi> and <hi>so far as in us lieth:</hi> It is not in our power to sin, for
<hi>Illud tantum possumus quod jure possumus.</hi> 2. The Apostle speaketh of
using <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that the Dr. calleth indifferent, as so dangerous
to the Soul, that <hi>Separation</hi> is, no doubt, rather to be
chosen than the use of them; and yet he doth not take notice of
their being lookt on as necessary to Salvation: Therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
against the Dr's Conclusion of this Second Part of his Book,
that we are not obliged to prove against his Party, either Idolatry
or false Worship, or making the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> necessary to Salvation.
It is enough, if we prove, that ye make them necessary to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
with you, and that it is unlawful for us to use them;
for hence it plainly followeth, that we must either live without
the Ordinances, which were our Sin; or meet apart, for worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
God, which is our Duty, as your Impositions and Severities
have stated us.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y of Power that Christ hath
given to the ordinary Ministers of his Church. This we cannot
approve, and therefore Ministers ought rather to suffer deprivation
of the publick Exercise of their Ministry, than own it. And peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95366:84"/>
also ought not to own that their lordly Authority that they
exercise; yet, because this is not required to be acknowledged as a
lawful Power in the Church, by the people, I see not that we should
withdraw from the publick Assemblies, meerly because there are
<hi>Diocesan Bishops</hi> set over the <hi>Church;</hi> except our owning them, by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to their Jurisdiction, is required as one of the <hi>Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
with the <hi>Church.</hi> 2. Depriving people of their Right of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their own <hi>Church-Officers,</hi> is also matter of complaint; but we
must bear it, rather than <hi>separate</hi> for that, from a <hi>Church.</hi> 3. The
gross Abuses that are in the Discipline of the <hi>Church,</hi> or rather the
want of any thing that looketh like Gospel Discipline, we lament;
but it not being peoples work to mend it, nor the Abuses their
personal action, it is no just ground of <hi>Separation. 4. Godfathers</hi> and
<hi>Godmothers</hi> in Baptism are an abuse; but being extrinsick to the
Ordinance, we should not <hi>separate</hi> for that neither. 5. The defects
and faults that are in the Call of the Ministers, and in their personal
Conversation, their Pluralities and Non-residences, and several
things of that nature we complain of, and the insufficiency of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, but do not <hi>separate</hi> for these, while the Ordinances are
not corrupted that we partake of. 6. The <hi>Surplice,</hi> and other <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Habits,</hi> worshipping toward the <hi>East,</hi> bowing to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and such-like, we dare not approve nor practise; yet these
not being imposed as <hi>Terms of our Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church,</hi> we
do not <hi>separate</hi> on account of them. The lawfulness of these I do not
now debate; nor is it needful at all to do it, in reference to the
point of <hi>Separation,</hi> that the Dr. chargeth us with; yet they being
things wherein we dissent from our Brethren, I shall not shun to
dispute such of them with the Dr. as his following Discourse shall
give occasion for.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. There are a third sort of things that we dislike in the
<hi>Episcopal Church of England,</hi> which not only are matter of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
but do necessitate us (and justifie us in it) to depart from her
Communion till these Letts be removed; and they are of two sorts:
1. The unlawful <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> with Her, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> She requireth
of us; without which she will not suffer us to partake with Her in
the Ordinances of God; as that we must worship God by the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,</hi>
that our Children, when baptized, must be signed with the
<hi>Cross;</hi> that we must <hi>Kne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l</hi> in the Act of receiving the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
that we must observe the <hi>Holidays</hi> that She hath appointed,
out Christ never instituted. These things we think unlawful to be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95366:85"/>
done; and the <hi>Church,</hi> tho' She thinketh them indifferent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
in themselves, yet have made them necessary by Her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
them, and <hi>excommunicateth</hi> and persecuteth us, if we will not
use them; and therefore a parting from Her on these accounts, doth
necessarily follow; not only because we ought not to live without
God's Ordinances, which we cannot have with our Brethren, but
because, if we would do so, they would still persecute us, if we come
not to the <hi>Liturgy;</hi> if we have not our Children baptized; if we
do not receive the Lord's Supper thrice a Year, and especially at
<hi>Easter;</hi> if we do not observe the <hi>Holidays.</hi> A second thing that
layeth a necessity on us, to have Meetings apart from them, is, their
restraining of a considerable part of the Ministers, whom Christ
had sent to his <hi>Church,</hi> and fitted by his Gifts for Gospel-Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
(upward of Two Thousand of them being put out in one
day.) We think it is the Duty of these men to preach the Gospel,
and administer the Ordinances of God, and the Duty of the People
to wait on their Administrations, and to own their relation to
them. It is true, this by it self considered, need not hinder our
Communion, and that ordinarily with the publick Assemblies, for
things might be so managed, as no clashing needed be; but this put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
us under a necessity of meeting by our selves, and the sinful
<hi>Terms of Communion</hi> imposed, putteth us out of capacity to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with our Brethren in publick. These I now but propose, but
intend to dispute them as they fall in, in the Doctor's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

                  <p>IN the beginning of this third Part, the Reverend Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
the Pleas for <hi>Separation,</hi> to Four Heads, 1. <hi>Such as relate
to the constitution of our Church. 2. To the Terms of Communion with it.
3. To the Consciences of Dissenters. 4. To the parity of Reason, as to
our Separation from</hi> Rome: Under the First he ranketh, 1. <hi>That the
Parish Churches are not of Christ's Institution. 2. That Diocesan Churches
are unlawful. 3. That the National Church hath no Foundation. 4. That
the People are deprived of their Rights in the choice of their Pastors.</hi>
About these Four last mentioned, he spendeth the far greatest part
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95366:85"/>
of this third part of his Book; and a very small part of it upon
the Second Head; which is that which he knoweth his Antagonists
do most generally insist on, and lay most weight on; but it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest

from those, that is most Conspicuous.</hi> He saith, <hi>the Non-conformists
at first kept Communion with them.</hi> I have before dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Truth of this, and also given reasons, why the practice of
them who did so, is not binding to us. He saith, <hi>Since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational
way prevailed in</hi> England, <hi>the present Dissenters are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
fallen into it; at least so far as concerns Communion with our Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Churches. Ans.</hi> There was a withdrawing from the Parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Churches, because of unlawful <hi>Terms of Communion,</hi> before the
present <hi>Congregational way</hi> was either known, or prevailed; and
to say that Dissenters are generally fallen into the Congregational
way (I suppose that he meaneth by it) is a mistake; it is true,
indeed, the restraint (he will be angry if I say Persecution) that
they are under, maketh <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Meetings <hi>de facto</hi> in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>Independant;</hi> because they cannot associate for Discipline;

Authors Ingenuity, in acknowledging p. 221. That <hi>Tyranny
over Mens Consciences is a good Ground of Separation;</hi> which is our
great Plea for withdrawing from their Assemblies: They impose

we cannot yield to them: If this be not <hi>Tyranny over the

                     </gap>ed divers
<hi>Churches.</hi> This Question is stiffly debated on both sides, between
the <hi>Congregational</hi> and <hi>Episcopal</hi> Brethren; the reason of their so
much concern in it, is, the one ascribeth all <hi>Church</hi> Power to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Congregation that ordinarily meeteth for worship; and so
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95366:86"/>
maketh that the highest ruling <hi>Church:</hi> The other placeth ruling
<hi>Church</hi>-power only in the <hi>Bishop;</hi> and so maketh a <hi>Diocesan Church,</hi>
to be the lowest ruling <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> go a middle way;

called a <hi>Church,</hi> or only the Combination of more Congregations,
for the Exercise of Discipline; they find the word used both ways
in Scripture (and the Word it self, <gap reason="foreign">

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. it is supposed that there were several Meetings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them ordinarily, that might bear each of them that name,

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he must mean the <hi>Churches</hi> in
<hi>Corinth;</hi> for it is not to be thought, that he would particularly have
mentioned their Women, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, if he had not meant the
<hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> where they were likest to usurp that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
The Dr. saith, p. 235. That <hi>it doth not once fail, that where
Churches are spoken of in the Plural Number, they are the Churches of
a Province:</hi> Here it faileth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. But leaving the Word, let us understand the thing;
which I shall set down in a few Assertions, 1. All visible Christians are
Members of one Great Body; whereof Christ is the head; to wit,
his <hi>Vniversal Church;</hi> which if it could so meet together as to be
taught, and ruled, ordinarily, by the same Officers, there
needed be no distinction of <hi>Churches</hi> in the World. And it is
probable it was so in the beginning of the Gospel; till the encrease
of Believers made it needful to divide into several Compani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,
that might be ordinarily taught and ruled by their several Officers.
2. The several Companies of Believers, with their several Officers
(each of which in Scripture-sence, may be called a <hi>Church)</hi> are
to be such as may commonly meet together in one place, for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of God's Ordinances. We read of the Apostles ordaining
Elders in every City, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> sure then they had respect to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of Peoples living together, that so they might usually
meet together. 3. These single Congregations being furnished with
one or more Pastors, and Elders have ruling Power within
themselves; for Christ hath given ruling power to all the Pastors
and Elders, and not placed it single in a <hi>Diocesan Bishop;</hi> for at
<hi>Philippi, Phil.</hi> 2. 1. all <hi>Church-Officers</hi> are divided into <hi>Bishops</hi> and
<hi>Deacons;</hi> a plurality of which were in that <hi>Church,</hi> tho' in one Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95366:86"/>
where our Brethren acknowledge, that more <hi>Diocesans</hi> than
one could not be. 4. The <hi>Church</hi> power in single Congregations,
is not <hi>Independant,</hi> but is to be subordinate to the power of them,
associate together. This may be gathered from the <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
being there also called a <hi>Church:</hi> If there were not divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Assemblies, ordinarily they could not be called <hi>Churches;</hi>
if they were not Associate, they could not be called a <hi>Church;</hi>
and wherein they could be Ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ciate, except in the Exercise of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
is not easy to guess. 5. The Association of <hi>Churches</hi>
for Government may be divers, as their Convenience of meeting
together for that end, giveth them opportunity: Hence particular
Assemblies, lesser and greater Associations, have their <hi>Congregational,
Classical, Provincial,</hi> and <hi>National Presbyteries,</hi> or <hi>Assemblies,</hi> for
the Government of the <hi>Church;</hi> the Lesser in Subordination to the
Greater And if Oecumenical Synods could as conveniently, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assemble, all the rest should be subordinate to them, seeing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them should make a part of these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. But because the diversity of Civil Powers, and frequent
clashings of them, in divers Nations maketh this hardly practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
therefore the highest <hi>Church-power</hi> is usually in <hi>National As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.</hi>
And tho' I am far from the opinion of them, who think that
Church <hi>Government</hi> should be modelled according to the civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Nation; the contrary of which I have asserted else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
against the Learned Author (whom I now dispute with) yet
in this particular, it not only may, but must be suited to the extent
of the Civil Government: This being no essential part of <hi>Church-Government,</hi>
nor instituted; but a Circumstance of it, determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by necessity and conveniency. On the same Score, where a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
could have no other to Associate with, it might act In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently,
and be blameless. 6. Tho' Christians should so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
themselves into particular <hi>Churches,</hi> as they may attend the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
together ordinarily; yet is not this meeting together, but
their being under the particular Inspection of the same Officers,
that maketh one particular <hi>Church:</hi> For, 1. One Congregation
may encrease to that number, that one place cannot contain them;
and yet continue one Congregation, till they be regularly divided:
Thus it was in some of the Ancient <hi>Churches.</hi> 2. Where Parochial
Bounds are so large, as all the People cannot always travel to one
place; the Pastor or Pastors of the <hi>Church,</hi> may well have places
more convenient for some of them, where he or they may Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95366:87"/>
the Ordinances to them, sometimes; as in <hi>Chapels of Ease;</hi> and
yet they all continue one particular <hi>Church.</hi> 3. It is a frequent
case with Families, that but a part of them at one time, can leave
the House, to wait on publick Ordinances; and the rest at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time; yet are they one Congregation. 4. In a time of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
where the Flock is but small, and might easily be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in one House, the Danger of numerous Meetings may be such,
as it may be needful, that but a part of them should come together
at once, and that by turns; as we are necessitated at this time to do:
This doth not make divers Congregations. All this considered we are
little concerned; whether in the Primitive Times there were but one
<hi>Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ch</hi> in a City, or more? Whether those called <hi>Churches</hi> did meet
in one place, or not; as long as the one Party cannot prove, that
each Meeting was ruled Independantly by it self; nor the other,
that a <hi>Diocesan Bishop</hi> ruled over more <hi>Churches</hi> than one, and over
their <hi>Presbyters.</hi>

they (this is not to justifie them, but to take off mens wonder at

this) and Men of higher parts and Spirits might easily, by degrees,
wrest Power out of the Hands of as good men as themselves, who
were not so fore-seeing as they should have been; nor so tinctured
with Ambition as they; though other ways good, and eminent
Men. And we need the less wonder at this, when we consider, that
this thing was not done suddenly; but by insensible steps, in the
space of three or four Hundred Years. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (whom the Dr.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95366:88"/>
Dr. disproveth, p. 242, 243.) being singular, himself can best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it; wherefore I leave it, and shall attend the Dr's proof of the
three particulars above mentioned, first asserting a few things that
may clear our way. 1. That it is not the Name of <hi>Bishop</hi> that we
quarrel, it being applied in Scripture to all the ordinary ruling Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
in the <hi>Church,</hi> as distinguished from her Servants, the <hi>Deacons,
Phil.</hi> 1. 1. and the Exercise of it called a good Work, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1.
and applied to all the Elders of <hi>Ephesus, Act.</hi> 20. 28. 2. We med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
not with their Titles and Revenues; those are the Magistrates
Gifts, and do not cross Christ's Institution, whatever inconvenience
may be in them. 3. Nor do we deny the Lawfulness of a <hi>Presiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
among Presbyters in the Person of one of them. Nature maketh
it necessary, that one should preside in a Meeting to shun Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and Christ hath not instituted the duration of one man's <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidency,</hi>
whether for one meeting, for a Month, or Year, or during
his life, and therefore the <hi>Church</hi> may determine in that: Yet we
must add, That the perpetuating of a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or making a <hi>modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
constant,</hi> having been, of old and late, the means of bringing in
a <hi>Lordly Prelacy,</hi> and corruption of ambitious men being so apt to
improve it that way; so that the <hi>Papal</hi> Chair hath arisen from this
low and blameless Foundation, we think it highly inconvenient.
4. Neither do we deny, that among Ministers, the wiser, graver,
and men of more Holiness and Experience, should by their reason
prevail over those that are not so well qualified: It is Superiority
of Power that is in question between us and our Brethren; yea,
we deny not, but some of Opinion for parity of Power, have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
their Brethren, through their loftiness of Spirit; an <hi>Episcopal
Temper</hi> may be in a <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> it is not mens Corruptions, but
their Principles that our debate is about. 5. We deny not, but
the Name, <hi>Bishop,</hi> that in the Apostles times was common to all El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s
of the <hi>Church,</hi> began very early to be appropriated to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator,
who also was called <hi>Primus Presbyter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and that this priority,
for as small as it was, was too much affected and taken notice of,
even in the Apostles times. <hi>Diotrephes</hi> (who is said, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>Jo. 3. 9. i. e.</hi> affected to be <hi>Primus Presbyter)</hi> had a great mind to
that dignity; but this was, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ew of the Apostles were now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.
It is neither the <hi>Presidency</hi> nor the <hi>Precedency</hi> that we debate
about, but the Imparity of Church-Power or Authority. 6. We
deny not that prelatical Usurpation obtained in some places, and
was s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>atched at in other places; while yet the ancient Order of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95366:88"/>
                     <hi>Parity,</hi> among the Pastors of the <hi>Church,</hi> was in most places retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
7. Though we deny, that <hi>Diocesan Episcopacy</hi> prevailed in
the <hi>Church,</hi> for the first Three Hundred Years, or that it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
in the fourth Century, and are willing to enter the Lists with
our Brethren in this debate about the first and purest Antiquity of
<hi>Church-Government;</hi> yet it is not mens Authority, but divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
that we are determiend by, and lay the stress of our Cause
upon; and will admit of no absolute Rule of judging in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
but the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. It might have been expected, that the Dr. when he
would charge us with so great blame, as he doth, in not submitting
to the Authority of <hi>Prelates,</hi> should have proved the Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
or at least, the lawfulness of that Office, and answered the
Arguments that our Writers bring against it. This were the way
to satisfie Mens Consciences; but the Dr. is pleased to take an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,
though not so perswasive a way, to wit; to refute Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions
about <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and to prove some things that are short
of the main thing that is in question; as I hope shall appear in our
Progress. And I have often observed, that the confidence of our
Brethrens Assertions in this Controversie is too big for the strength
and concludency of their Arguments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. It will contribute to our clear, and sure procedure in
this Controversie, if we consider the difference and inconsistency
that is among our <hi>Prelatical</hi> Brethren about the <hi>Episcopacy</hi> that they
assert; and the Foundation on which they build it, as to the thing;
some of them do so restrain the Power of <hi>Bishops,</hi> denying both sole
Ordination and sole Jurisdiction to them, that they make it little
or no more, but a <hi>Presidency:</hi> So the learned and Pious <hi>Vsher,</hi> who
is followed by many of the more sober and learned of that party.
<hi>Grotius</hi> also goeth this way, <hi>de Imper. sum. potest. circa sacra,</hi> p. 337.
others allow them <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> over other Pastors of the <hi>Church,</hi> and
exempt them from being liable to the Censures of their Brethren;
yet so as they ought not to rule by themselves, but with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Pastors of the <hi>Church,</hi> who are to be their Counsel. Our
Author, <hi>Iren.</hi> p. 309. saith, that <hi>both</hi> Jerom, <hi>and</hi> Ignatius <hi>agree, that
the Counsel of Presbyters was of Divine Institution.</hi> Others are for
their <hi>Monarchial</hi> power in their several Diocesses; neither being
obliged to take the Counsel of the <hi>Presbyters;</hi> nor being liable to
their censures: So the generality of our <hi>High Church-men.</hi> Some
make the <hi>Bishop</hi> the sole Pastor of the Diocess; and all the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95366:89"/>
Clergy to be but his <hi>Curates;</hi> others think the Parochial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
to be substitute, or delegate to none but Christ; some think
the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s work is to preach the Gospel, and administer Sacraments
in his own Person, and that this, he should be constantly exercised
in: Others, that his Work is to rule, and that he need not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
himself with other Work, unless he please. Some allow the
<hi>Bishop</hi> a Power of delegating his Authority; not of dispensing the
Word and Sacraments only, but of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> to
others; yea, to Lay-men; that by them he may <hi>Excommunicate,</hi>
and judge Ministers and People: Others think that he hath no power
to do so; so me think that it is inconsistent with the Office of a <hi>Bishop</hi>
to be imployed in Civil Government, others allow it. Some think
a <hi>Bishop</hi> should be chosen by the <hi>Church,</hi> and that really, and not
seemingly only, as when the Magistrate nominateth the Person to
the Chapter (who yet are not the <hi>Church)</hi> of whom they must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to a Mock election; others think those that come in this way,
to be none of Christs <hi>Bishops.</hi> Some own <hi>Diocesan Bishops,</hi> who yet
see no warrant for the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> as it is stated among us, in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans,
Primates, Arch-bishops, Deans, Arch-deacons, Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,</hi>
&amp;c. Some hold the Office of <hi>Bishop</hi> to be distinct from that
of <hi>Presbyter;</hi> others deny this; many School men are on both sides;
it was debated at the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> In all these things, I observe
very much Confusion, and want of a distinct Idea of that Office,
that is debated about in the Writings of our <hi>Prelatical</hi> Brethren.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. There is as little agreement, or distinctness among
them about the Foundation, on which the Office of a <hi>Diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
standeth: Some of them are for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s <hi>divine Right,</hi> as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by Christ: But this Plea they find so hard to be managed,
and to have so ill success, and to be so little the way to preferment,
(as derogating from the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the Magistrate) that most have
laid it aside; others, that it is of <hi>Apostolick institution;</hi> being not
commanded by Christ, but prudently setled by the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
Others, that it is <hi>juris ecclesiastici</hi> brought in by the <hi>Primitive
Church,</hi> af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er the decease of all the Apostles. Others, that it
is wholly indifferent, and may be received, or not, as is thought
most expedient in several times and places; and some of these say,
this is to be determined by the <hi>Church:</hi> Others, by the <hi>Magistrate.</hi>
This Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> in his <hi>Irenicum</hi> asserteth; but is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
whether the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Magistrate</hi> is to determine in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
One of the most Learned of our Adversaries, Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:95366:89"/>
holdeth the Divine Right of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> but goeth away different
from all the rest in managing of that Opinion; to wit, that all
the ordinary Pastors of the <hi>Church,</hi> appointed by Christ, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by the Apostles, were <hi>Diocesan Bishops,</hi> and that <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
are a sort of Men unheard of in the New Testament, and
their Office but a device of Men, or a constitution of the <hi>Church.</hi>
This fancy is solidly refuted by learned Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> on <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.
p. 230. Where the Reader may see abundant ground of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
about the absurdity and inconsistency of this Notion,
from Scripture, Reason, and Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. The question between us and our brethren, being about
the lawfulness of the prelacy now exercised in <hi>England,</hi> the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which is required of us; that we may judge aright of it,
we must have a true Idea of it, and then consider whether such
an <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was instituted by Christ, practised in the primitive
Church with general approbation; or whether it hath any rational
Foundation to stand upon. The true Idea of our <hi>English Episcopacy</hi>
is visible in these Lineaments of it; First, The <hi>Bishop</hi> is one of a
Superior Order to, and distinct Office from, other <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
as appeareth not only from the power he hath, and they have not,
and acts of <hi>Church</hi>-power reserved only to him; but also because
he is put into that Office by an ordination distinct from that by
which he is made a <hi>Presbyter.</hi> And yet further, because the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi>
are owned but as his Delegates, or Curates, and he is own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as the sole Pastor of all the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> People and Flocks in the
Diocess. Secondly, The <hi>Bishops</hi> have jurisdiction over other <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</hi>
Thirdly, He hath the sole Power of Ordination of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
Fourthly, He may delegate this Power to whom he will,
whether Men Ordained to the Ministry, or any of the people;
so that by this Delegation, a Man that is no <hi>Church-Officer</hi> may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<hi>Church-Power</hi> over both Ministers and People. Fifthly, This
power is exercised in the name of the Magistrate; the Courts in
which it is exercised being owned as the <hi>Kings Ecclesiastical Court.</hi>
Sixthly, They are not chosen to this Office by the <hi>Church,</hi> but by
the <hi>Magistrate;</hi> and they are not Preaching but Ruling Bishops.
Now if our Brethren cannot shew us such a <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>shop</hi> as this in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
or Antiquity, all that they say from either for an <hi>Episcopacy,</hi>
is short of the thing in question, and our scruple cannot be taken
away by their proofs for <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> unless they prove this <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:95366:90"/>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Though our Writers have brought Arguments against
the lawfulness of this Office in the <hi>Church</hi> that have never yet been
answered, and I think never shall; and tho' I can promise no new
nor better Arguments than have been already adduced by others;
yet that the Reader may see that our Scruples against <hi>Episcopacy</hi>
are not without good ground, I shall briefly set down some Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against it. The first shall be, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> against our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Author: By this Author's Doctrine, there is no ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that such an <hi>Episcopacy</hi> as consisteth in a Superiority of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
above Presbyters, was Instituted, Allowed, or Exercised in the
<hi>Church; Ergo,</hi> according to him, it hath no Foundation at all
that can satisfie ones Conscience about the lawfulness of it. The
<hi>Antithesis</hi> I prove, If such a ground there be, it must lie in one of
these three (if any asserters of it can add a fourth, we shall quit
this Argument) either Christs appointing it in Scripture, or his
allowing Men to appoint such an Office, or the practice of the
<hi>Church,</hi> shewing us what was Christs allowance. But none of these
yield us a Warrant for <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> all the three being denyed by
this Author to be able to satisfie the Conscience in this matter.
For the first, he denyeth such an Institution, asserting expresly
that Christ gave equal power to all the Ordinary Ministers of the
Gospel; this is the basis of his <hi>Irenicum.</hi> The second, he never
had the confidence to assert, neither is the least hint in all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
that Christ hath allowed Men to take away that power from
his Servants that He hath given them, and to put it into the
hand of others to whom He never gave such eminency of power.
For the third, he proveth at length that the primitive form of
<hi>Church-Government</hi> is uncertain, from the Defectiveness, Ambiguity,
Partiality, and Repugnancy of the Records of the Ages that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the Apostles times, <hi>Iren.</hi> c. 6. p. 294. Let him tell us
then what ground we have to belive that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was Instituted
by Christ, practised by the <hi>Church</hi> in Her uncorrupted times, or
any way allowed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. Our second Argument is, There is no foot-step of any
inequality of power among these Ordinary Pastors of the <hi>Church,</hi>
that are mentioned in the Bible, neither in their Name, nor Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
nor Power, nor Work, nor Qualifications, nor Respect or
Obedience due to them, nor any thing else from which any distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
can be rationally gathered; whence I thus Argue: If the
Lord had allowed a distinction between <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:95366:90"/>
his <hi>Church,</hi> he would have hinted some thing about this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but this he hath not done, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The first proposition I
prove, first, Because this was needful for these distinct Officers,
that each might know his work: And for the <hi>Church-Guides</hi> that
they might know how to chuse and ordain qualified Men for so
different Imployments: And for the people that they might know
how to carry toward these Officers respect according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of their Stations, that they might obey the <hi>Bishop</hi> rather
than the <hi>Presbyter,</hi>—and submit to the Teaching of the
<hi>Presbyter</hi> and ruling of the <hi>Bishop;</hi> that they might not come to
a <hi>Presbyter</hi> for <hi>Confirmation,</hi> nor call <hi>Presbyters</hi> to ordain a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
for them, nor delegate a person that deserveth <hi>Excommunication</hi>
to the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> all these belonging to the <hi>Bishop.</hi> 2. Our Lord
hath made a clear distinction in Scripture, among the other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Officers in the <hi>Church,</hi> in their Names, Qualifications,
Work, and Office, as between <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons, Phil.
1. 1. 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 2, 9. Also between <hi>Preaching Elders,</hi> and those
that are only <hi>Ruling Elders, 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 17. If our Brethren can
shew us as much for a distinction between <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> let
them do it: I hope none of them will say, that by <hi>Ruleing Elders</hi> is
here meant the <hi>Bishop,</hi> least it follow that the Preaching <hi>Presbyter</hi>
should rather be honoured than he, either by affording him more
respect or maintenance: I suppose our <hi>Bishops</hi> will rather part
with the Patrimony of this Text, then with their Titles, Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
and Revenues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. The second Proposition is evident in the several Branches
mentioned before, for our Adversaries can produce no hint of any
such distinction in Scripture, and we can shew an identity in them;
And first, for the name it is clear from <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. where the
Apostle calleth all the Elders of <hi>Ephesus, Bishops.</hi> It is a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
fancy of some, that these <hi>Elders</hi> were the <hi>Diocesan Bishops</hi> of
<hi>Asia;</hi> for this is said without any shew of proof, to serve a turn.
Besides that, they are called the <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> not <hi>Churches,</hi>
as (even in the prelatical Stile) Diocesan districts should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
And it is called the <hi>Flock,</hi> not <hi>Flocks,</hi> and the <hi>Church of God,</hi>
not the <hi>Churches of God,</hi> that they were to take heed to; and the
haste that the Apostle then was in, considering the short time, and
long journey that he had before him, was inconsistent with his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
such an Assembly from so remote parts. This identity of
name is also clear from <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. for no reason can be assigned
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95366:91"/>
why <hi>Deacons</hi> should be mentioned, as concerned in what was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in that Epistle and not <hi>Presbyters.</hi> Also it is most clear, <hi>Tit.</hi>
1. 5. with 7. where shewing how <hi>Elders</hi> must be qualified, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is given why they must have such Qualifications, <hi>for a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>shop
must be Blameless;</hi> if they were not one, this reason should have
neither force nor sence, which were Blasphemy to averr, it being
the Holy Ghosts reasoning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. In the next place, Scripture maketh no distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Office of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> many of our brethren de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a distinction of Office betwixt them (how consistently with
their other principles I enquire not) and they that assert such a
distinction cannot shew the least foot-step of it from Scripture.
Thirdly, for their power, if <hi>Bishops</hi> ordained, so did <hi>Presbyters,
1 Tim.</hi> 4. 14. If any alledge that the ordainers of <hi>Timothy</hi> were
<hi>Diocesan Bishops,</hi> they must prove it: If <hi>Bishops had rule over the
people, were over them,</hi> so were <hi>Presbyters, 1 Thes. 5. 12. Heb.</hi> 13.
17. For none question but <hi>Presbyters</hi> are they who mainly labour
among the people, admonish them, and watch for their Souls; (I
am sure this is not the work that our <hi>Bishops</hi> are exercised in) and
the same persons in both places are the peoples Rulers, and are
over them. Fourthly, Their Work is the same, as is clear both
from the places last cited, and <hi>Act. 20. 28. 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2. Where
taking heed to, feeding, and over-seeing, in the Greek, acting the
part of <hi>Bishops,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, are made the work of all the Pastors
of the <hi>Church.</hi> 5. The same qualifications are required in all the
guides of the <hi>Church</hi> without any distinction, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 2. Tit.</hi> 1.
5. And the qualification of <hi>Deacons,</hi> they being a distinct sort of
Officers in the <hi>Church,</hi> are set down by themselves, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 8.
Sixthly, for Obedience, Reverence, Maintenance, or any thing
else, that concerneth a <hi>Bishop</hi> as distinct from a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> there is
not the least hint in Scripture from which any such thing can be
gathered; a Man must then put force upon his reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or be
strangely swa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed by prejudice, who can perswade himself that
there is an ordinary Officer mentioned or allowed in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
that is above the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the Church, or hath juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
over them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. Argument third. The Apostle doth thrice set down a
list of the several Officers of the <hi>Gospel-Church,</hi> without mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>Diocesan Bishop,</hi> or any Officer to which this Office can be
rationally reduced; <hi>Ergo,</hi> no such Officer ought to be allowed in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95366:91"/>
the <hi>Church.</hi> The consequence I prove, first, Because this should
have been a defect not imputable to the Apostle, infallibly guided
by the Spirit, to teach us designedly the several <hi>Church-Officers</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by Christ, and not tell us of them all: Let our brethren,
if they can, give us an instance of a defectiveness in any Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instruction
of this moment that can be parallelled with this. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
The consequence can yet less be questioned, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r
that not only an Officer is left out, and the <hi>Church</hi> left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a hint concerning him; but the chief ordinary Officer in the
<hi>Church,</hi> that should make the greatest Figure in the <hi>Church</hi> to the
end of the World, and on whose management the weightiest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the <hi>Church</hi> should depend: He who can believe this, his
Judgment must be under the power of so strong a Byass, that I
know not what will be too hard for him to Swallow; the <hi>Antithesis</hi>
I prove out of 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 28. Eph. 4. 11. Rom.</hi> 12. 6, 7, 8. Not
any of these Offices agreeth to the <hi>Diocesan Bishop;</hi> some say, they
are reducible to Apostles. With what face can wise men alledge
this? Was not the Office of an Apostle extraordinary, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,
appointed for the first dispersing the Gospel, and planting
<hi>Churches;</hi> and besides every Apostle was an Universal Officer:
Diocesans have their limitted charges: Some alledge they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
to Apostles, not as being absolutely such, but because
they have power over inferior Ministers as the Apostles had. But
these men should prove that Christ instituted such an Office, or
that the Apostle meant not only extraordinary Apostl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, but
these <hi>Semi-Apostles</hi> as ordinary Officers to continue in the Church.
Secondly, They should prove that Christs instituting Apostles, did
warrant the Church to set up an Office made up of as much of the
Apostles Office, as should be afterward thought convenient. What
may not men devise in the <hi>Church,</hi> that take on them thus to add
to, or diminish from Christs Institutions, and thus to wrest Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to make it comply with their fancies and interests?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. Others make the <hi>Doctors</hi> or <hi>Teachers, Eph.</hi> 4. 11. to
be the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and this with as little ground as the former, though
some learned Men have so dreamed, as <hi>Estius,</hi> and <hi>Doctor Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
Grotius</hi> thinks <hi>Metropolitans</hi> also are here meant, but the
absurdity of this fancy will appear, First, If we consider that they
are named after the <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which is an indecency un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uitable
to the Apostles Exactness, if my <hi>Lord Bishop</hi> we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e here
meant. I find many Interpreters argue that <hi>Prophets</hi> are the next
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95366:92"/>
in Dignity to <hi>Apostles,</hi> and are extraordinary Officers, because
they are named alwaies next after the Apostles, which Argument
will as well hold here. Secondly, The work of the <hi>Bishop</hi> that we
speak of, which discriminateth him from the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> is not to
Teach but to Rule: Therefore others, as <hi>Calvin,</hi> by <hi>Teacher</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth
him that educateth Ministers, and instructeth them
and others in the truth, and defendeth it against Heresies; such as
are <hi>Divinity Professors</hi> in Universities; others understand <hi>Catechists:</hi>
But it is evident that it cannot, with any kind of Congruity be
applied to the <hi>Diocesan Bishop,</hi> who is least imployed in Teaching
of any part of <hi>Church-Work;</hi> some find the <hi>Diocesan Bishop</hi> under
the name of <hi>Helps, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 28. As <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Hammond;</hi> both
of them also make him to be meant by <hi>Government;</hi> and the same
two Authors, in the same verse by <hi>Teachers</hi> understand the same
Officer. They would be sure to find him somewhere, but this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uncertainty where to fix him is a token that he is no where to
be found. Is it imaginable that the Apostle in a list of <hi>Church-Officers</hi>
set down in so few words, would use such repetition? When
so Learned Men are put to such shifts, it is a sign the cause is so
weak, that it affordeth no better reason to defend it by. That they
are not meant by <hi>Teachers,</hi> I have already shewed; neither are
they meant by <hi>Helps.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> saith <hi>Grotius, significat, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
rei alicujus gerere:</hi> This is said without Book (be it spoken
with due respect to that great Critick.) I find Authors cited for
its signifying, to take hold, undertake, uphold, help, correct; but
none for its signifying, to take charge of a thing. The place he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
to, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 54. can bear no signification of the word so well
as that of helping; and among all Criticks and other Interpreters,
he cannot produce one that so expoundeth the word, either here
or in that place: but Men will say any thing to serve a turn. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can the <hi>Diocesan</hi> be meant by <hi>Government,</hi> not only because
they are among the last, and so the most inferior of <hi>Church-Officers;</hi>
but also because our Brethren will not say that the <hi>Bishop</hi> should
only Rule, and not Teach (though it is too much their practice,
yet they will not averr this to be according to Institution) as
this Officer must do, he being a distinct Officer from the <hi>Teacher.</hi>
I conclude, If the Apostle had intended to set forth to us such an
Eminent Officer of the <hi>Church,</hi> we might have expected he should
have, if not clearly, yet to the Satisfaction of an inquisitive mind,
set him down in some of these Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>logues, which is not done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:95366:92"/>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. Argument fourth. The power that we read of in the
New Testament, was never exercised by any ordinary Officers
alone, but by the <hi>Church-Guides</hi> in <hi>Common; Ergo,</hi> there was
no <hi>Diocesan Bishop</hi> in the New Testament, and if we have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
there, our scrupling to own such a one is not unreasonable.
That <hi>Church-Power</hi> was so exercised I prove by Instances, leaving
to our Brethren, if they can, to bring Instances to the contrary.
First, Ordination was performed by <hi>Presbyters</hi> in <hi>Common, 1 Tim.</hi>
4. 14. It is a groundless Notion that some Men of great Name
and Worth have on this place, that <hi>Presbytery</hi> is meant of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
for both it is a harsh phrase, the hands of the Office; and
further the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is often used in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet is never used for the Office, but for the College of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;</hi>
the Office is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> saith <hi>Camerarius;</hi> others
say, That by the <hi>Presbytery</hi> here is meant the Company of the
Apostles, who are called <hi>Presbyters:</hi> This cannot be, for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
ascribeth to himself a special concern above others in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
of <hi>Timothy, 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 6. Which he would not have done
if the rest of the Apostles, equal in Authority with himself, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred,
but might well do it, when, he as chief, and the ordinary
Pastors as sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rdinate, did join in this Action, for (it is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of <hi>Camerarius</hi> on this Text) the Apostles did not use
their extraordinary power often, but when the <hi>Church</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d,
acted in Conjunction with the ordinary Pastors; and there
was good reason for this, to wit, both that the <hi>Church-Guides</hi>
might know that Apostolick power was not always to continue
among them, and that they might learn the way of <hi>Church-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations,</hi>
which they behoved to exercise by themselves when the
Apostles were gone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. Another Instance is in <hi>Excommunication,</hi> which the
Apostle injoineth the ordinary <hi>Eld<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rs</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> to
exercise against the incestuous Man; he directeth his Injunctions
not to a single <hi>Bishop,</hi> but to a Company of Men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. That
<hi>they being gathered together should deliver him to Satan,</hi> vers. 4, 5.
That <hi>they should purge out that old leaven,</hi> vers. 7. That it was their
part (not a single persons part) to <hi>Judge the Members of the
Church,</hi> vers. 12. That <hi>they should put away the wicked person,</hi> vers.
13. and sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aking of this Sentence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. He expresly saith
it was done by many, and ascribeth the power of forgiving (i. e.
absolving from the sentence of <hi>Excommunication)</hi> to them, not to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95366:93"/>
one Man. What ever different thoughts men may have about
this <hi>delivering to Satan,</hi> or about the Apostles Interest in this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it is evident that here is <hi>Church-Power</hi> adjudging (which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
Authority) exercised by a Community. A Third, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this is, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 14. Where a Community not a
single person is commanded <hi>to Note them that were Disobedient</hi> to
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Admonition in his Epistle. This is not to be understood as
some take it, of <hi>Noteing</hi> the Disobedient Person in an <hi>Epistle,</hi> that
they should write to <hi>Paul;</hi> For First, The emphatick particle <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
put before <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> denoteth that <hi>Epistle,</hi> to wit, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
now wrote not an Epistle that they should write. Secondly,
The Greek word will not bear that signification <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> here
used, is <hi>Note,</hi> or set a mark on him; to <hi>Signifie,</hi> or give <hi>Notice,</hi> is
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which word had surely been used if the Apostle had
intended that they should give Notice to him by an Epistle of the
Disobedient. Thirdly, He telleth them what should follow on this
<hi>Note<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> set on the Man, and how they should carry towards him
when thus <hi>Noted;</hi> to wit, that <hi>they should have no company with
him;</hi> this would not follow on their Writing about him to the
Apostle, while no Sentence was as yet passed against him, but
might rationally follow upon their setting the ignominious mark of
<hi>Excommunication</hi> upon him. If then <hi>Church-Discipline,</hi> in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
and best times of the <hi>Church,</hi> and especially while the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
being yet alive, might have exercised it by themselves or their
Delegates, the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> was yet exercised usually in Common,
and not by a single <hi>Bishop;</hi> we have cause to scruple the owning of
such an Officer in the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. Other Arguments from Scripture may be brought, but
I shall not now insist on them, having maintained some of them
against this learned Author, in my <hi>Animadversions on his Irenicum.</hi>
Wherefore I shall only add a fifth Argument, as a ground of our
scruple from some Testimonies of the Judgment and Practice of
the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> that succeeded to the Apostles. This may the
more heighten our scruple, that our brethren lay the stress of their
cause on the <hi>Ancient Church;</hi> if we cannot find there sufficient ground
for a <hi>Diocesan Bishop,</hi> but much to the contrary, they ought not to
blame us if we cannot with them own such an Office in the <hi>Church.</hi>
The first Testimony that I bring, is that of <hi>Jerome,</hi> who giveth
his Judgment of this matter, not <hi>Obi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that which was his setled Opinion, and that oftner than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

In his <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Euagrius,</hi> where he sharply reproveth some as

saith, <hi>toto orbe decretum est,</hi> is not to be understood of the Decree
of an <hi>Oecumenick Council,</hi> for no such Decree can be produced; but
that this Remedy of Schism in many places, began then to be
thought on; and it was no wonder that this Corruption began then
to creep in; it being then about the end of the Fourth Century, when
<hi>Jerom</hi> wrote. And this remedy <hi>Jerom</hi> declareth was not of God's,
but of Mans inventing; and accordingly it succeeded; for it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
worse than the Disease, bringing in Tyranny, and overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ's Institution; and at last setting up the <hi>Man of Sin.</hi>

therefore either we must make <hi>Jerom</hi> say, That the practice
in his days was a direct overturning of Christ's Institution,
and contrary to Apostolick practice, which will make the way
of the Primitive <hi>Church,</hi> and Writings of the Fathers to be
no good Commentary upon the institution and way of the Apostles
times; and so destroy the Argument that our Brethren insist most
upon for <hi>Episcopacy;</hi> or we must expound this <hi>omnis cura</hi> of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of it to the whole <hi>Church,</hi> not of the solitude of it in one
Man, excluding the rest of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> that he had a special

then he is not for sole jurisdiction of a Bishop. And this he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of the principle and practice of his time; which confirmeth
what I said before of the meaning of <hi>Omnis cura ecclesiae.</hi> There is
yet another place in <hi>Jerom</hi> that is plain to this purpose, <hi>Ep. ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.

Episcoporum &amp; Clericorum censura desaevit;</hi> which clearly
putteth the Censures of the <hi>Church</hi> in his days, into the Hands of
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> and not into the Hands of <hi>Bishops</hi> only, whatever Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
they had above the other. It is worth our Observation, that
several <hi>Popish</hi> Writers (as zealous for <hi>Prelacy</hi> as ours are) confess
such light in the Writings of <hi>Jerom</hi> to this purpose, that they find
no way to Answer, but to Condemn him of Error in this matter.

the <hi>Church</hi> was much changed) called the <hi>Presbyters, Compresbyteri,</hi>
but never called the <hi>Deacons, Condiaconi, Presbyter</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> being
the same Office, but <hi>Deacons</hi> being distinct from them both. The
last Testimony shall be that of <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> in 1 Tim. 3. homil. 11.
<hi>Inter Episco um atque Presbyterum interest fere nihil; quippe &amp; Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteris

saith that <hi>Primasius, Theophilactus,</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> on that Text,
teach the same things, and almost in the same words: And the
Second of these lived in the end of the Ninth Century; the last in
the Tenth or Eleventh. The Answer that <hi>Bellarm.</hi> giveth to this,
is not worth taking notice of; to wit, <hi>Chrysost.</hi> meaneth, that <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi>
have jurisdiction, as <hi>Bishops</hi> have, but only by Commission
from the <hi>Bishop:</hi> This is directly contrary to the Scope of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
which is to shew an Identity of them, as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
What he alledgeth out of this Citation; that a <hi>Bishop</hi> may
ordain, not a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> the learned Father's expression will not bear;
for <hi>Ordination</hi> must signifie either the <hi>Ordination</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi>
have, whereby they are put in their Office, to be different;
which he doth not alledge; or that the difference between them
was only in order, or precedency, not in Power or any Authority;
or that it was by the <hi>Ordination,</hi> or appointment of the <hi>Church</hi> not
Christ's Institution; but it can never signifie the power of ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for then Christ (who was sufficiently a Master of words) would
have said, <hi>potestate ordinandi,</hi> not <hi>Ordinatione.</hi>

<hi>Episcopacy</hi> with 3 Considerations; which tho they be not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oncludent
in themselves, being but humane Testimonies; yet may abate a
little of our brethrens confidence in asserting their Opinion about
<hi>Bishops,</hi> to have always been the sentiments of the <hi>Catholick
Church.</hi> The, 1 is, That <hi>Lombard</hi> and most of the School-Men deny
the distinction of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> lib. 4. dist. 24. liter. <hi>I.</hi> He
telleth us that the Canons do only mention the orders of <hi>Presbyters</hi>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:95366:95"/>
and <hi>Deacons;</hi> because the primitive <hi>Church</hi> had only these; and of
these only we have the Apostles Commandment; the rest were after
appointed by the <hi>Church.</hi> And <hi>ibid. litera</hi> M. he sheweth that the
orders of <hi>Bishop, Arch-Bishop,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Church</hi> borrowed from the
distinction of the Heathen <hi>Flamins, Horum autem disoretio</hi> (saith
he) <hi>a gentilibus introducta videtur.</hi> Both <hi>Cajetan</hi> on <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. and <hi>Estius</hi>
on the place of <hi>Lombard</hi> now cited, deny the Divine Right of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy.</hi>
The 2 Consideration, is, That the <hi>Waldenses, Albigenses,
Wickliff</hi> and his Followers, and all they that under the darkness of
<hi>Popery</hi> maintained the same Doctrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s that the <hi>Protestants</hi> now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
were of a Parity among Presbyters, and disallowed of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan
Bishops.</hi> This is confessed by <hi>Medina,</hi> and is not denyed by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm.</hi>
and any that read what is written of their Opinions will
acknowledge this; it is among <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Errors imputed to him by
<hi>Tho. Waldensis,</hi> that in the Apostles times there were only 2 Orders,
<hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> and that a <hi>Bishop</hi> doth not differ from a <hi>Priest,
Fuller Ch. Hist. lib. 4. cent.</hi> 14. p. 132. Let not any impute this to
their persecuted State; for we know <hi>Papists</hi> have always had their
<hi>Titular Bishops,</hi> where their Religion was suppressed. The third
thing that I offer to be considered, is, The observation of <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemius,</hi>

                  <head>SECT. IV. The Dr's Arguments for Episcopacy Answered.</head>
                  <p>I Return now to the reverend Dr. to hear what he will say for
this <hi>Episcopacy</hi> that we scruple, on the forementioned grounds.
I begin with his first undertaking above mentioned; to wit, to
shew <hi>That our Diocesan Episcopacy is the same in substance which
was in the Primitive Church.</hi> And this he laboureth to prove con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>African Churches,</hi> in the times of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi>
and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the time of <hi>Athanasius</hi> and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95366:96"/>
of the Church of <hi>Cyprus</hi> in the days of <hi>Theodoret.</hi> Concerning all
this in general; I make two observations before I come to examine
his particular Allegations, 1. That his phrase is ambiguous, that
their <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was the same in <hi>Substance</hi> with ours: I wish he had
shewed what is that <hi>Substance</hi> of <hi>Diocesan Episcopacy</hi> that he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in both. I think the <hi>Substance</hi> of our <hi>English Episcopacy</hi> is,
that one Man hath sole <hi>Power of Ordination and Jurisdiction</hi> over all
the <hi>Church-Officers</hi> and Members in many Congregations; if he will
shew us that in the Primitive Times, let him rejoice in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from Antiquity. 2. The <hi>Antiquity</hi> that the Dr. here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
to, is far short of that which himself and others do boast
of with a great deal of Confidence; some of them tell us of a
clear Deduction that they can make of it down from the Apostles
in all ages without Interruption, some make it of more than 1500
years standing; but the <hi>Dr.</hi> here is not pleased to pretend to that.
<hi>Cyprian</hi> lived in the Third Century, <hi>Athanasius</hi> in the Fourth, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
and <hi>Theodoret</hi> in the Fifth, and it may easily be granted
that there was a great degeneracy in <hi>Church</hi>-Discipline and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by that time; yet that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was arrived at that
heighth that is now in <hi>England,</hi> even at that time, we deny.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. To prove what he had undertaken, he layeth down two
Observations. 1. That <hi>it was an inviolable rule among them, that but
one Bishop was to be in one Church.</hi> I am little concerned in this,
though I see no rule for it, except a Canon of <hi>Concil. Cabilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens.</hi>
which was but Provincial, and very late, under <hi>Pope Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
about <hi>Ann.</hi> 654, yet I think it was generally and rationally pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
for taking a <hi>Bishop</hi> for the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> among the <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
(which I affirm to have been the Dialect of those times.) What
needed more <hi>Bishops</hi> than one, seeing all the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of one City
might conveniently meet ordinarily for the Exercise of Discipline.
When Mr. <hi>B.</hi> proveth the contrary, he taketh <hi>Bishop</hi> in the
Apostles sence, and then I affirm with him that there were more
<hi>Bishops</hi> in one City, that every Assembly for worship had one, if
not more. The <hi>Dr</hi>'s. Argument that he seemeth to glory in, p. 246.
is of no value; it is, That <hi>if more Bishops than one could be in a City,
the Schism of the</hi> Donatists <hi>and</hi> Novatians <hi>might have been preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi>
this is either a great mistake, or somewhat else; for taking
<hi>Bishops</hi> for <hi>Moderators</hi> of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> the bare setting up of two
<hi>Presbyteries,</hi> and two <hi>Moderators</hi> could not have prevented these
Schisms; and if the <hi>Church</hi> had found it convenient to divide them,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:95366:96"/>
retaining the same Principles of Faith, and about Church-Order
and Discipline, there had been no Schism: It is most false that
these Schisms were meerly about the plurality of <hi>Bishops</hi> in a City.
The Schism of the <hi>Donatists</hi> had its rise at <hi>Carthage</hi> from the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of <hi>Donatus,</hi> who opposed the election of <hi>Cecilianus;</hi> the
pretence was, that he had been ordained by a <hi>Proditor,</hi> and that
he had admitted another <hi>Proditor</hi> to Ecclesiastical Office; <hi>Cecili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi>
being Tried, and Acquitted, both by the <hi>Emperor</hi> and the
<hi>Church</hi> in several Councils, <hi>Donatus</hi> and his party set up another
<hi>Church,</hi> an Eldership, and People, in opposition to <hi>Cecilianus,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
the discipline of <hi>Cecilianus,</hi> and his Party, in admiting
the lapsed upon repentance, and admitting the wicked as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to the Sacraments. So that it is plain, that the Schism lay
in this, That they set up another <hi>Church-way</hi> and Order, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentially
to that, set up another <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbytery,</hi> not beside,
but in opposition to that which was before, and that without suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
reason; upon the very like occasion did <hi>Novatus separate</hi>
from <hi>Cornelius Bishop</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and set up a new <hi>Church</hi> on the
foresaid grounds. <hi>Cyprian</hi> indeed condemneth <hi>Novatus,</hi> and nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth
his <hi>Church-Power,</hi> because <hi>post primum secundus esse non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test;</hi>
but this is still to be understood of setting up another <hi>Bishop,</hi>
or meeting of <hi>Presbyters</hi> under a <hi>President</hi> without the Authority
of the <hi>Church,</hi> or good cause for so doing. It is evident then, that
these Schisms were built on another Foundation than what the
<hi>Dr.</hi> supposeth, and that they could not have been prevented if
forty <hi>Bishops</hi> had been allowed in a City; as long as <hi>Donatus</hi> and
<hi>Novatus</hi> retained their Principles, they would have separated
from all <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> that were not of their way; all that
followeth in this his first Observation is easily Answered in one
Word, to wit, that all these Citations prove no more than this,
that where a <hi>Church</hi> was setled, and sufficiently furnished (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you take it for a single Congregation, or more Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
associate for Discipline with <hi>a President)</hi> it was not fit for
any to disturb that Unity by setting up another <hi>Church,</hi> whether
of the one, or the other sort mentioned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. His second Observation is, <hi>That in Cities and Diocesses which
were under the care of one Bishop, there were several Congregations
and Altars, and distant places.</hi> I contend not about the word <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,</hi>
supposing that one <hi>President</hi> of an Assembly of <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
with these <hi>Presbyters</hi> might have ruling power over many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95366:97"/>
                     <hi>Churches;</hi> call that District by what name he will, the matter
is not great: Our question is not about the Name, but the Power
by which that District was ruled, whether it were in one Man
or in the body of <hi>Presbyters.</hi> But it is well known that <hi>Diocess,</hi>
which now signifieth a <hi>Church Division,</hi> did in those days signifie
a <hi>Civil Division</hi> of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> made by <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great,
who divided the hundred Provinces of the <hi>Empire</hi> into 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Diocesses,</hi>
where all <hi>Africk</hi> was but one; see for this <hi>Heylin, Cosmogr. lib.</hi> 1
p. 54. And it is as well known that <hi>Diocess</hi> did often Signifie a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
or people of a Parish; neither do I contend about the word
<hi>Altar,</hi> supposing the <hi>Dr.</hi> meaneth, places where the Lords Supper
was Celebrated. Both <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Arnobius</hi> affirm that 200 years
after Christ, the Christians were blamed by the Heathens, because
they had no <hi>Altars;</hi> the name of <hi>Altar</hi> was not used in the <hi>Church</hi>
till the Third Century, and not then neither, but figuratively:
But the <hi>Dr.</hi> loveth to speak of <hi>Ancient things</hi> in his <hi>Modern Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi>

over the <hi>Presbyters</hi> in that District which he calleth a <hi>Diocess.</hi>
What he saith that seemeth to be Argumentative to this purpose, I
shall mind, and no more: The multitude and distance of places
that he instanceth (tho' all were true, the contrary of which the
forecited Author maketh appear) will not prove Superiority of
power in one Man; neither <hi>Augustine</hi>'s care for Neighbouring
Places that wanted Ministers, either to provide Ministers for them,
or to Baptize them, or do other Church Acts for them in their
need. This proveth neither Extension, nor Solitude of Power;
far less doth <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s nameing <hi>Provincia nostra,</hi> in which were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Bishops,</hi> prove him to have been a <hi>Metropolitan;</hi> the <hi>Empire</hi>
was divided into Provinces. If a Minister in <hi>England</hi> should say
there are many Ministers in our Country, it will not prove that
they were under his Charge. <hi>Vuler</hi> mentioneth <hi>Cresceus</hi> who had
120 Bishops under him; the <hi>Dr.</hi> should have proved that he had
sole jurisdiction over them, and all their <hi>Churches,</hi> or that he could
act any thing in <hi>Church</hi> matters without them; and so that he was
more than president in their meeting, when they came together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

Parishes that were destitute, and yet never pretended to
Episcopal Power over them; That this was an Act of Charity,

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95366:98"/>
should have said 80) <hi>Churches, and that so many Parishes were in his
Diocess.</hi> The <hi>Dr.</hi> insulteth much on this Testimony, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause; for 1. <hi>Theodoret</hi> lived in the fifth century, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
not but by that time Episcopal Ambition had in some places
encroached on the Government instituted by Christ, and which
had been kept more intire in former Ages. 2. It is much suspected
by learned Men, that <hi>Theodorets</hi> Epistles are not genuine, and the
<hi>Dr.</hi> doth not deny that Hereticks had feigned Epistles in <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets</hi>
name, as <hi>Leontius</hi> saith, which doth darogate much from the
credit of these that cannot be well proved to be true. 3. <hi>Theodoret</hi>
doth not say that he had the Pastoral charge of these <hi>Churches,</hi>
but that he had been Pastor in them; the former Expression look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
like a sole power in him, and therefore the <hi>Dr.</hi> thought fit
so to vary the phrase; the other hinteth no more power then is
consistant with a party, every Minister being a Pastor in the
<hi>Churches</hi> to whose Association he belongeth. 4. But whatever be in
that, this sheweth the extent of <hi>Theodorets</hi> Power, as to place or
bounds, but doth not prove that he alone exercised that power,
and therefore is no proof of a <hi>Diocesan Bishop.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Before I proceed, I shall return to examine the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s
Allegations for <hi>Diocesan</hi> Power, <hi>p.</hi> 230. which I above referred to
this place. He asserteth, <hi>That the Presbyters and whole Church
were under the particular Care and Government of</hi> Cyprian: This
Assertion is too big for the <hi>Proofs</hi> that he bringeth for it; <hi>to wit,</hi>
That <hi>Cyprian</hi> reproveth some of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> for receiving Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
without consulting him, and complaineth of the Affront done
to his Place, as Bishop, and dischargeth the like to be done for the
future. <hi>Lucian</hi> saith, that the Martyrs had agreed that the Lapsed
should be received on Repentance; but their Cause was to be heard
before the Bishop, and several Passages to this purpose. To all
which, <hi>I. A.</hi> by denying the Consequence; <hi>Cyprian</hi> as I cited above,
did not take on him to receive the Lapsed without the <hi>Presbyters:</hi>
Will it thence follow that he had no Power at all? But it was
solely in them; even so, that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> (especially that some
of them, as the <hi>Dr.</hi> himself states the Case) might not do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> doth not prove that the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and whole <hi>Church,</hi>
were under his Government. It amounteth to no more but this,
that in a <hi>Presbytery</hi> regularly constituted, especially, where they
have devolved the Power of calling, and presiding in their Meetings
on a fixed, and constant Moderator, it is very irregular that a part
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95366:98"/>
should meet about Discipline, without the rest, and particularly,
without Consulting him whom they have so chosen. Beside, I will
not deny but <hi>Cyprian</hi> sheweth too much Zeal in this Cause, and
might possibly attempt to stretch his Power a little too far, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
many did: He was a holy and meek Man, but such may be
a little too high. To this same purpose are his other Citations of
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> commending <hi>Cyprian</hi> for not being wanting to
his Office. <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Epistle to the Clergy of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that the
<hi>Dr.</hi> citeth, sheweth there were Disorders committed in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of receiving the Lapsed; in that not only some <hi>Presbyters</hi> took
it on them, without a regular Meeting of the whole, but even Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
medled with it, which was out of their way. His Citation
of the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi> commending the Martyrs for not taking on
them the Discipline of the <hi>Church,</hi> is wholly out of the way; for
none ever supposed that every Martyr had <hi>Church</hi>-Power. That
they delayed some parts of Discipline till they had a new <hi>Bishop,</hi>
proveth as little as the rest; for it is fit one should moderate in their
Meetings, and Custom had obtained that he should be fixed in that
Office, which was not from the beginning. <hi>Cyprians</hi> appointing
some to visit, when he could not do it by reason of Persecution,
neither is a precedent for our <hi>Bishops</hi> doing their Work by Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
when they are at ease; nor doth it prove that these did any
thing without the <hi>Presbyters;</hi> that <hi>Cyprian</hi> citeth <hi>tu es Petrus;</hi> and
whatsoever you shall bind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was to very good purpose, when
some Martyrs invaded the Discipline of the <hi>Church;</hi> and i pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
that as <hi>Christ</hi> gave the power of the Keys to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the
rest of the Apostles, not to the People; so he had given it to <hi>Cyprian</hi>
and the rest of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> not to the Martyrs. It had been well
if <hi>tu es Petrus</hi> had never been more abused. He saith indeed, that
the <hi>Church</hi> hath ever been governed by Bishops, but the <hi>Dr.</hi> must prove
that he meaneth, by Bishops alone, as they are distinct and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from the other <hi>Presbyters:</hi> The rest that followeth, that the
<hi>Bishop</hi> is to govern, and give Account to God, that he is in the
place of Christ; that a <hi>Church</hi> is a People united to a <hi>Bishop,</hi> do all
agree very well, either with a Congregational <hi>Bishop,</hi> or Minister;
or a Presbyterian Moderator, acting in parity with other <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi>
and yet these are the <hi>Herculean</hi> Arguments from Antiquity,
that men make such a noise with.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. I now proceed with the <hi>Dr.</hi> to the third Thing, that he
had undertaken; <hi>to wit,</hi> to prove, <hi>That such an Episcopacy as is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95366:99"/>
here, and was so in the Primitive Church,</hi> (this Last he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that he hath proved) <hi>is no devisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>g a new species of Churches, nor
repugnant to any Institution of Christ.</hi> To prove which, <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. he
bringeth some of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Concessions, which I neither yield, nor
will vindicate. He bringeth also some Arguments of Mr. <hi>B's</hi> to
prove that the ordinary governing part of the Apostolick Office
was setled in all Ages: Wherefore, I must, for a little, leave the
<hi>Dr.</hi> and Answer these Arguments of Mr. <hi>B's:</hi> But first, I take
notice, that it is a Mistake in the <hi>Dr.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> too, to call the
governing part of the Apostle's Office ordinary: For 1. That is,
to suppose the Thing in question; <hi>to wit,</hi> that it was continued in
the <hi>Church;</hi> that they governed, and preached, is true; but that
Officers that after were imployed in governing, or preaching, can
claim that power as succeeding to the Apostles in any part of their
Office; and without other warrant we deny. The Apostles gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and preached by another Commission from Christ, than men
now do; and that both, as to the manner of it, the one being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate,
the other mediate; and as to the matter of it, their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
warranted them to do many Acts in governing, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
that others have no power to do, as giving Authoritative rules
to all <hi>Churches</hi> where they came; ordaining, and censureing every
where, going up and down to Preach every where, without a call
from any <hi>Church,</hi> without being fixed any where; this power no
Man can now pretend to: Wherefore I say, that Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sters Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch
and Rule the <hi>Church</hi> not by vertue of Apostolick Office, or any
part of it committed to them, but by vertue of ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her Office,
distinct from that of the Apostles which they receive by their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.
2. It is evident that the Apostles governing Power was
not ordinary, because there was an ordinary governing Power in
the <hi>Church</hi> even in the Apostles times, distinct from that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and exercised by other Men; tho' in subordination to the
Apostles governing Power. The <hi>Presbytery</hi> did then Ordain, they
did also Excommunicate, as was above shewed, and the Apostles
directed them so to do; and sometimes concurred with them, and
sometimes they acted without them.</p>

form</hi> (viz. general Officers as well as particular) <hi>but we never

1. If this Argument have any force, it will pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ve the continuance

of all the extraordinary Offices that ever were in the <hi>Church, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Evangelists, Workers of Miracles,</hi> &amp;c. For we read not that
ever they were discharged. <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. It is enough to Abolish and
Discharge that Institution, that this Office was setled in the persons
of some Men, immediately by Jesus Christ himself; and after
their decease, He neither put others in their room immediately by
himself, nor gave the <hi>Church</hi> any hint that such a thing should be
done; but instead of that, he hath given sufficient direction for
propogating other Officers in the <hi>Church</hi> in all Ages. Argument
2. <hi>If we affirm a Cessation without proof, we seem to accuse God of
Mutabillity, as setling one form of Government for one Age only, and
no longer. Ans.</hi> I hope Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will not say that a change in Gods
Works, yea, or Institutions, doth argue mutability in God, are
not all the Old Testament Institutions now changed? Were not
Prophets, Evangelists, Men gifted with divers tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His
Institutions, and yet now ceased, and no other proof can be given
for their Cessation then what we give for the ceasing of Apostles.
Neither do we say they are ceased without proof, that they were
by immediate Commission from God; that that now cannot be
pretended to, and that the Lord hath hinted no other way of
continuing such an Office in his House, nor that it should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
is abundant proof of this Cessation. Argument 3. <hi>We
leave room for audacious Wits, accordingly to question other Gospel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
as Pastors, Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and to say that they were but
for an Age. Ans.</hi> There is not the least shew of reason for this: for
their Gospel Institutions have more abiding Warrant then Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Commission given by Christ to some to Administer them.
Argument. 4. <hi>It was General Officers that Christ promised to be with

                     </gap>h. 28. 20. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If this Argument
prove any thing, it proveth too much; to wit, that only General
Officers have that promise which I hope Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will not say. <hi>Ans.</hi>
2. It was spoken to General Officers, but the promise is not made
to them alone, but to all that should be Imployed in the work of
Teaching, and Baptizing. And these being particularly here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
will prove that there shall be Teachers and Baptizers to the
end of the World; but not that there shall be General Officers, as
the <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> &amp;c. that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> dreameth of to the end of the

the Apostles that the Apostles did leave successors in the care of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Churches. Aus.</hi> Who doubteth of that; but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is, to whom did the Apostles commit this care? we say to
the Pastors in Common, he saith to <hi>Diocesan Bishops,</hi> this we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that it can be proved, either from any Writing or Deed of the
Apostles, or from the consent of the Ages next after them; that
the <hi>Bishops</hi> were looked on as succeeding to the Appostles in the
Government of <hi>Churches;</hi> we deny not (tho' we deny that they
had that Office, or any part of it) but then the question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they alone who in the 2. or 3. Century began to get the name
of <hi>Bishops</hi> appropriate to them, had that Government by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or in Common with the rest of the Presbyters, unless the

doth not take away the whole Power of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
And that therefore it maketh no new Species of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from what Christ Instituted, or was read in the Ancient <hi>Church.</hi>
We do not alledge that it taketh away the whole power of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi>
for that were to reduce them into the same order with the
rest of the people; but we say it usurpeth an undue power over
them, that neither Christ nor the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> ever allowed,
in taking out of their hand that power of Governing the <hi>Church</hi>
that they have equal with the <hi>Bishop;</hi> and in other things to be
observed in our progess. In order to makeing out what he alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
he proposeth two things to be enquired into, <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. First,
<hi>What power is left to Presbyters in our Church. 2. What Authority
the Bishops have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ver them.</hi> For the first, <hi>he asserteth their power in
reference to the whole body of the Church, and that because they have
a place in the convocation, where rules of Discipline, Articles of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and forms of Service are determined.</hi> How small a matter
this is (tho' the <hi>Dr.</hi> aggravateth it) I do with him appeal to any
Man of understanding who is unbyassed, and who knoweth the
constitution of an <hi>English Convocation;</hi> it consisteth of two Houses,
in the upper House are only <hi>Bishops,</hi> and let the lower House never
so unanimously vote for a thing, they can reject it; that is, 25
Men who by the Laws of the Gospel, have no more power then
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95366:100"/>
any other 25 of near 9000 (so many <hi>Churchs</hi> are reckoned in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi>
take to themselves as much power as all these. Then for
the lower House of the Convocation, it is made up of Presbyters
indeed, as the <hi>Dr.</hi> saith; but many, if not most of them, such as
by no Law of Christ have more power to sit there than any others
have, as <hi>Deans, Arch-deacons,</hi> and other Cathedral Officers; here
also the <hi>Presbyters</hi> are bereaved of that party of power that is
their due; besides that few of the inferior <hi>Presbyters</hi> are admitted,
often not above two or four in a Diocess. If then their power be
not swallowed up by the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and their Creatures in the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
let any judge: He next proveth the power by the hand that
they have in <hi>Ordination,</hi> or giving <hi>Orders,</hi> as he calleth it, to wit,
<hi>That by the Rules of this Church; four Presbyters are to asist the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and are to examine the persons to be ordained (or the Bishop in
their presence) and to join the Imposition of hands.</hi> Here also their power
is swallowed up, for all the rest have equal power with these four,
yea, with the <hi>Bishop</hi> himself, which is wholly taken out of their
hands, and managed at the <hi>Bishops</hi> pleasure, who chuseth these
four, beside, that this is really, if ever practised, the person is
usually examined, or said to be so by the <hi>Bishops</hi> Chaplain, and the
<hi>Bishop</hi> layeth his hands on him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. Next he telleth us what power <hi>Presbyters</hi> have in their
particular Charges, p. 267. which he leaveth us to gather from
3 topicks. The Epistle that is read at the Ordination of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to wit, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. or 1 <hi>Tim. 3. What an impertinency</hi> (saith
the <hi>Dr.) had both these been, if the Presbyters power had been swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by the Bishop.</hi> A goodly Argument, some think it a great
Impertinency, and Boldness too, in the face of these Scriptures to
make a distinction, as to any part of <hi>Church</hi> Power, between a
<hi>Presbyter</hi> and a <hi>Bishop.</hi> His next topick is, the <hi>Bishops</hi> Exhortation
at the Ordination, where <hi>he telleth them of the dignity of the Office,
and greatness of the Charge, calleth them Pastors, that they are to
Teach, Premonish and Feed, and provide for the Lords Family,</hi> &amp;c.
This indeed implyeth their Preaching Power, but there is not a
word of Ruling Power, which the Lord joyned with it, but the <hi>Bishops</hi>
do separate them; and for all this saying over their cold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esson
at the Solemnity, the <hi>Bishops</hi> will not suffer the <hi>Presbyter</hi> to Preach
by vertue of this Ordination without <hi>License;</hi> so that their Rule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Power is taken away, and their Preaching Power restraine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
at the <hi>Bishops</hi> pleasure. This is a crossing of Christs Institution,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95366:101"/>
who made them equal; neither is it any more wonder that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
practice should cross his own Exhortation, then that he should
cross the Scripture, read on that occasion. His third Topick, is
the ordained Persons Oath, <hi>to mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Discipline, as this Realm hath received the same.</hi> Here Discipline is
<hi>pro forma</hi> mentioned; but the following words shew the meaning,
for this Realm hath not received Christ's Discipline to be exercised
by the Officers, into whose hands he put it, but the <hi>Dr.</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
little less then I say, when he saith, <hi>That the general care
of Government and Discipline is committed to the Bishop;</hi> I hope the
Reader will by this time see, that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> have not all that power left to them that Christ gave to
his Ministers; and therefore the <hi>English Episcopacy</hi> is another kind
of <hi>Church Government,</hi> than that which Christ Instituted, or the
purer primitive times knew.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. The other thing he proposeth, is, <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. to shew
<hi>what Authority the Bishop hath by his Consecration,</hi> which he plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in <hi>Government, Ordination,</hi> and <hi>Censures;</hi> and he saith, <hi>the
Church of</hi> England <hi>did believe that Bishops did succeed the Apostles in
these parts of their Office.</hi> This I deny not, but the <hi>Dr.</hi> should have
proved that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had ground to believe so. Mr.
<hi>Bs.</hi> concession will not oblige us to be of the same mind; that she
did believe so, I am not convinced from what he bringeth in proof
of it, but the contrary I have proved above, wherefore I shall
take no further notice of this Section except to examine his noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
p. 269. on which he seemeth to value himself very highly;
it is that <hi>in the Apostles times they managed the Government of the
Church themselves, and therefore there was no Bishop, but Bish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ps, and
Presbyters were one; but as the Apostles went off, Bishops came to be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the several Churchs, whom the Apostles setled some sooner, some
later; if which</hi> (saith he) <hi>we have an incontrouleable evidence in</hi>
Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus. And by this he would reconcile the different
Testimonies of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> the Succession of <hi>Bishops</hi> from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
time being hereby secured, for which <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian</hi> and
<hi>Cyprian</hi> stand, and with this consisteth all that <hi>Jerom,</hi> and <hi>Epiphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
say of the different settlement of <hi>Churches</hi> at first; to all this I
repone these few things. 1. Is is most false that the Apostles ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
<hi>Church Government</hi> by themselves while they lived; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
I have proved, as to Ordination, and Excommunication in

                        </gap>a,</hi> that these were in the Hands of ordinary
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:95366:101"/>
Officers, tho superintended by the Apostles. 2. That they setled <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
any where, either in their own time, or left order for it to
be done after their decease, is also false. The incontroullable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of it that the <hi>Dr.</hi> talketh of is asserted <hi>duro ore;</hi> for he
knoweth it is controulled beyond what he or any man can refute,
to wit, that <hi>Tim.</hi> and <hi>Tit.</hi> were no <hi>Diocesan Bishops</hi> is proved by
our Writers; and all the Arguments that are brought for their
being such, fully answered. This confidence without Argument
is unbecoming so learned a Man, he hinteth an Argument for his
Assertion, to wit, that <hi>the care of Government was a distinct thing
from the Office of an Evangelist.</hi> This we deny, the Office of an
<hi>Evangelist</hi> was to Teach, or Govern by a deputation from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
he saith, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ir removes do not invalidate this, because while
the Apostles lived there were no fixed Bishops, or but few:</hi> I wish he
had instanced in one, He confesseth by this <hi>Tim.</hi> and <hi>Tit.</hi> were not
such, and for unfixed <hi>Bishops,</hi> we read of none such either in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or <hi>Antiquity,</hi> 3. Neither can this reconcile the Testimonies of
Antiquity as he would have it; for it doth not answer what <hi>Jerom,
Augustine, Chrisostom,</hi> and others say of the Divine institution of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
neither is it true that <hi>Irenaeus, Tertulian,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> are for
<hi>Diocesan Bishops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. The <hi>Dr.</hi> proceedeth now, <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. to the third thing
that he had undertaken to prove, p. 244, to wit, that <hi>the restraint
of Discipline in our Parochial Churchs doth not overthrow their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</hi>
In this I shall not oppose him, and therefore I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consider this matter as a grievance, and consider what he saith
in Justification of it, and not as a ground of <hi>Separation,</hi> and shall pass
over what he saith, that is of that tendency. <hi>He saith Presbyters
have power in admission to the Lords Supper, because none are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
but such as are confirmed, or be ready and desirous to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>med,
and Presbyters are judges in that, because they are to send a
list of the Names of the persons to be Confirmed to the Bishop, who is to
confirm them; and this,</hi> he saith, <hi>would (if rightly observed) keep as
much purity in that Ordinance as is pretended to in the separate Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.
Ans.</hi> This is a poor fence for the Table of the Lord, for
if one be ready to be confirmed, the <hi>Presbyter</hi> cannot keep him
back, tho' he was not listed by the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> nor Confirmed by
the <hi>Bistop;</hi> and we know many of the worst of men are ready for it:
Again, when one is Confirmed by the <hi>Presbyters</hi> consent, if he prove
never so profane or careless, the <hi>Presbyter</hi> cannot debar him; the
<hi>Bishops</hi> Confirmation admiteth him, let him do what he will. I
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:95366:102"/>
hope <hi>Separate</hi> Meetings will not admit every one to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that is a <hi>Church Member,</hi> when they fall into gross Sins. 2.
It is no good way of defending the <hi>Presbyters</hi> Power in manageing
of Christs Ordinances, to say that his Testimonie is to be taken
about admitting persons to an Ordinance that Christ never insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted;
to wit, <hi>Confirmation.</hi> 3. This is no great evidence of <hi>Church</hi>
Authority in the <hi>Presbyter</hi> that his Testimony is taken by the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
in order to Admission; it is the <hi>Bishop</hi> not the <hi>Presbyter</hi> that
Authoritatively admitteth. 4. It is an odd way of Admission to
Gods Ordinances, not precedented in Scripture, nor purer Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
that one man should judge of the fitness of a person to be
admitted, and another should admitt him; the <hi>Bishop</hi> must act im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly,
and the <hi>Presbyter</hi> is only his informer, where this way of
Discipline had its use we know; the <hi>Dr.</hi> hath yet said nothing to
vindicate the power that Christ gave to his Ministers, or to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Discipline of the <hi>Church of</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. Next, <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. He speaketh of the <hi>Presbytes</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in rejecting these for scandal that have been <hi>Church Members,</hi>
and sheweth out of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> before the Communion, that <hi>the
Parochial Ministers may advertise a scandalous sinner not to come to
the Lords Table till he repent and amend, and if he continue obstinate,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e may repel him from the Communion, yet so as within fourteen days he
give account to the Ordinary. Ans.</hi> This is far from amounting to the
power that Christ gave to his Minsters, for 1. By what Law of
Christ is the <hi>Presbyter</hi> accountable to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> more then the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
is accountable to him? Christ made them equal. 2. I see no
reason why a <hi>Presbyter</hi> by himself should have power to debar any,
it should be done by <hi>Presbyters</hi> in Common; the New Testament
knoweth no such thing as Excommunication, either greater or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
by a single person, except it were by an Apostle. But our <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
think they have such a plenitude of power, that they may
delegate as much of it as they please to any other person. 3. I
see the <hi>Dr.</hi> is at a stand, what sort of censure this Act of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Ministers is, it is not the greater Excommunication; and
he confesseth p. 277. that it is not the lesser Excommunication used in
this <hi>Church.</hi> I deny it not to be a <hi>Church censure,</hi> but it is not
such as argueth that Power of Discipline in the inflicter of it, that
Christ hath given to all his Ministers, to be exercised by them in
Common. The <hi>Dr.</hi> infereth p. 278. from the power of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi>
that <hi>our Church doth not deprive them of all the necessary and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95366:102"/>
Essential parts of Church Discipline.</hi> But if it deprive them of any
such part in which they may not medle, it taketh away that
power that Christ hath given them; it is a fine Apology for <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
Vsurpation,</hi> that they suffer a <hi>Presbyter</hi> as their delegate,
and as he will be accountable to them to do some Acts that they
themselves cannot attend; whereas Christ gave no more power
to a <hi>Bishop,</hi> than to any of the <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. Mr. B. objecteth to the Dr. that it is Actionable by
Law, if a Parish Minister admonish a person by name, not censur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nary; to which the Dr. hath two sorry answers. 1.
<hi>What need publick Admonition by name? Doth the nature of Church
Discipline lie in that? It is enough it be done privately,</hi> and sheweth
that <hi>Augustine bid people examine themselves, and abstain if they saw
cause; and the same</hi> Augustine <hi>saith, that Church Discipline may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
in some cases in a true Church.</hi> To this I reply, 1. How
will the Dr. reconcile this with what he citeth out of the <hi>Rubrick;</hi>
will private dealing with the offender amount to repelling of him
from the Communion? 2. Discipline is a publick and Authoritative
Act; and another thing then, private dealing with a person, the
Apostle calleth it a <hi>rebuking before all, 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 20. And it differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from Preaching, in that by Discipline reproofs are applyed to
the person, in Preaching they are in more general Terms: Now
how this should be without publick nameing the Man, I know not.
3. Who doubteth that <hi>Augustine</hi> did well in what the Dr. alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
it must be our practice when Discipline is most strictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d,
because Discipline cannot reach the secret sins of Men: But
<hi>Augustine</hi> never thought that therefore Discipline was not to be
publickly, and personally inflicted on Offenders; and sure Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
may in some cases be forborn, <hi>hic &amp; num,</hi> without fault,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d where it is f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ily forborn, it doth nullifie the being of a
<hi>Church;</hi> yet it must not always be forborn. His 2. answer is, <hi>If
a restraint be laid on Ministers by Law, whether the Minister ought to
admonish publickly, and debar in that Case?</hi> Reply; why doth the
Dr. make the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> and the Law thus to clash, especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Common Prayers</hi> and its <hi>Rubri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>k</hi> are setled by Law?
And he doth by this fairly yield, that by the constitution of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> now Established by Law, a Parish Minister hath
no power to keep back any from the Lords Table that hath a mind
to come. Why then hath he taken so much pains to prove they
can do something, and at last conclude that this same thing is just
nothing, <hi>parturiunt montes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:95366:103"/>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. He frameth an objection to himself, <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. that <hi>the
neglects, and abuse of Discipline among us, are too great to be justified,
and too notorious to be concealed.</hi> To this he hath several Answers.
The 1. is, <hi>That the question is, whether this destroyeth the being of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Churches;</hi> this I pass, for I think it doth not. The 2. is, <hi>It
is easier to complain of this, or separate, then find out a way to remedy
it.</hi> We propose the Scripture remedy; to wit, to put it into the
hands of the Pastors of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Common.</hi> The 3. is, That
<hi>ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> is not that necessity of Church Discipline, as in the primitive
times, the Christian Magistrate taking care to punish scandalous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and so to vindicate the honour of the Church:</hi> And to confirm
this, he citeth a passage of <hi>King</hi> Charles <hi>the First</hi> to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Thus the Drs. zeal for <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is swallowed up in the
Gulf of <hi>Erastianism;</hi> to what purpose doth he cite <hi>Cyprians Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es
petrus,</hi> and why hath he pleaded so much for <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> even
out of these Fathers that lived under Christian Emperors, as
<hi>Augustine, Theodoret,</hi> &amp;c. if Church Discipline be at the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
disposal. But I see Men will say any thing <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>;
let the Dr. answer what our Divines have written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Erastus,</hi> and his followers, proving that the Church and
Republick, are distinct Societies, tho made up of the same Persons;
that Christ hath a visible Mediatory Kingdom in the World; that
the Rules, Laws, Punishments, and immediate ends of <hi>Church-State</hi>
are different. Let him no more tell us of the <hi>Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
but of the <hi>Civil Laws of</hi> England; as that which the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Christ are to be dispensed, and ordered by. I shall not
digress to refute this Assertion; but Men will be apt to think that
this principle doth foully reflect upon Christ, and his Apostles,
who gave all their directions about <hi>Chruch</hi> Affairs, to <hi>Church-men,</hi>
and not to the <hi>Magistrate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sict.</hi> 18. His Fourth Answer, is, that <hi>Excommunication by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Divines, is not left to a Parochial Church;</hi> I do not plead for
that; but against putting it into the Hand of one Man. Neither
will it hence follow, <hi>a Parish Minister and his Elders may exercise no
Discipline:</hi> The Protestant Divines abroad are not of that mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d.
It is false, That <hi>among us a Minister</hi> (I mean with his Elders) <hi>can
only admonish, not repel from the Lords Supper. Why,</hi> (saith he) <hi>may
not our Ministers be obliged to certifie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he Bishop, as well as theirs to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the Presbytery. Ans.</hi> Because Christ gave no power to a <hi>Bishop</hi>
above other <hi>Presbyters;</hi> and Discipline in the Apostolick and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95366:103"/>
Church, was exercised by a single person. If the Dr's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
be true; I think it is fitter to certifie the <hi>Justice of Peace,</hi> than
either of both. What he saith of the <hi>Affrican Churches,</hi> is answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above. Let him prove that a <hi>Bishop</hi> by himself exercised disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
in them. The <hi>Bishop</hi> is often named as the Speaker in the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
by the declining of him, is meant declining of them. The
Inconveniences that he allegeth, by putting <hi>Excommunication</hi> into
the Hands of a single Congregation; we shun by a prudent reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of that dreadful Ordinance, to a meeting of Pastors. But if
it were done by the meanest Congregational Elder-ship, it could
hardly be so ill managed, and made so ridiculous and contemptible,
as it is now in the Hands of <hi>Bishops,</hi> or rather their Servants, in
<hi>England.</hi> It is well known how solemn, and terrible it is, as pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed
(which is seldom) in <hi>Presbyterian Churches;</hi> and how it
hath tamed some stout-hearted Sinners, without a <hi>Capias</hi> or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratical

Arguments, as he doth against Parochial Discipline; to wit, That
<hi>there are no certain Rules to proceed by; no Determination what faults
deserve Excommunication; no method of Tryal; no security against false

of other Inconveniences.</hi> Sure this Author thinketh the Bible of
little use to the <hi>Church,</hi> without a <hi>Book of Canons;</hi> such reflections
on the Word of God, are very unbecoming; a part of which is
written on purpose to teach Ministers, how to behave themselves
in the House of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. I hope the Dr's more sober
thoughts will satisfie him in all these; and therefore I shall give no
more particular Answer. But he might have considered, if the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
have directions for all these in the Bible (and if he have not,
his Will must be his Law) why may not the <hi>Classical</hi> and <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Presbytery, respective</hi> take the help of them. He thinketh a
Parochial Court of Judicature (so he is pleased to speak in the <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal</hi>
Stile) would prove more Tyranical, than any <hi>Bishops Court.</hi>
It may be so, if managed by bad men; but if they keep within the
Rules they profess to go by, it will seem Tyrannical to none but
stubborn Sinners, whose galled Necks cannot bear Christ's Yoke,
And it could never be so grievous to Mens Persons and Estates, as
the <hi>Bishops Courts;</hi> for these we medle not with. His fifth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

                  <p>HAving now examined what the Dr. saith for <hi>Diocesan Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi>
I proceed to consider the next ground for <hi>Separation</hi>

Though I think every organized Congregation hath a governing

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The First thing that I take notice of, is, p. 289. Where
the Dr. maketh the institution of the Apostolick Function in the
Hands of twelve Men, to be an Argument against <hi>Churches</hi> Power
of governing themselves. This proveth nothing; for the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Government of the <hi>Church</hi> must be regulated by what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:95366:104"/>
appointed, which is an abiding thing; not by their own go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
the <hi>Church,</hi> which ceased with them. Next, p. 290. he
saith, the Succession of <hi>Bishops</hi> from the Apostles, is, <hi>Matter of Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t,
attested by the most early, knowing, honest, and impartial Witnesses;</hi>
which I deny and have disproved. The next remark shall be upon,
p. 291. where he pleadeth for <hi>Bishops</hi> joining together, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one <hi>National Church</hi> (he shuneth mentioning a <hi>Primate</hi> under,
and in whom they unite) and this he seemeth to vindicate from
making way for <hi>Papal Vsurpation,</hi> and and Universal Head of the
<hi>Christian Church;</hi> by <hi>its being intended for the good of the whole so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and no ways repugnant to the design of the Institution, and not
usurping the rights of others, nor assuming more than can be managed.
This,</hi> he saith, <hi>an Vniversal Pastor must do; and he therefore menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth
this, that any one may see that the force of this reasoning will never
justifie the Papal Vsurpation.</hi> I cannot, for all this, see, that it is
more justifiable, or consistent with Christ's Institution, to unite a
<hi>National Church</hi> under a <hi>Primate,</hi> than to unite the Universal <hi>Church</hi>
under a <hi>Pope:</hi> Save that the one is a further remove from Parity
that Christ instituted, and so a greater Evil, than the other; but
<hi>magis &amp; minus non variant speciem,</hi> To clear this, I shall run over
these Four qualities that he mentioneth, in their uniting under a
<hi>Primate;</hi> and consider whether they do agree better to him, than
to a <hi>Pope.</hi> The First is, <hi>it is intended for the good of the Whole, so
Vnited.</hi> If we judge by Intentions; no doubt this intention will
be pretended to by the <hi>Papists</hi> also; and is <hi>de facto</hi> as much pleaded
by them, and with as specious pretences. And if we consider the
reallity of the thing; sad experience sheweth, that neither the one
nor the other doth conduce to the good of the whole; but is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
to Tyrannizing over mens Consciences; and Rending, and
Harassing the <hi>Church,</hi> for the sake of superstitious Concepts of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. The Second, <hi>This Vnion is no way repugnant to Institution.</hi>
This he should have proved; we deny it: Let him shew us more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
or warrant for a <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> than for a <hi>Pope.</hi> If we should
own. <hi>Bishops</hi> as Successors to the Apostles; yet an <hi>Arch-bishop,</hi> a <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan,</hi>
a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> a <hi>Pope,</hi> must still be beside Institution, except the
Dr. will own an Imparity among the Apostles, and so be for <hi>Peters
Supremacy.</hi> The Third is, That <hi>in this Vnion there is no usurping the
Rights of others.</hi> I say, there is, as really as there is in the <hi>Papacy;</hi>
for it is the Right of every one of Christ's Ministers, to govern
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95366:105"/>
the <hi>Church</hi> in equallity of power with the rest; this is taken from
them, and put into the hand of a Bishop; and that right that the
<hi>Bishop</hi> hath usurped from the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> the <hi>Primate</hi> usurpeth from
him, and the <hi>Pope</hi> doth no more but usurp the same from all the
<hi>Metropolitans,</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> that they had usurped from these
under them. The <hi>4th.</hi> is, <hi>not assuming more than can be managed.</hi>
Nothing but prejudice could hinder a man of the <hi>Doctors</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
to see, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> assumeth more power than he can
manage, as really as the <hi>Primate</hi> or the <hi>Patriarch;</hi> yea, or the <hi>Pope</hi>
doth. For as the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot administer the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Discipline of the <hi>Church</hi> to all Christians in his own
person, no more can a <hi>Primate</hi> to a whole Nation, nor a <hi>Bishop</hi> to a
Diocess consisting of many thousands of People, and hundreds of
Congregations. And as the <hi>Bishop</hi> can do all this by the <hi>Parochial
Clergy,</hi> for Word, and Sacraments, and by his <hi>Chancellors, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons,</hi>
&amp;c. for his Discipline, such as it is: And as the <hi>Primate</hi>
can rule a whole <hi>National Church,</hi> by his and the <hi>Bishops Courts:</hi>
So can the <hi>Pope</hi> rule all Christian people <hi>(ut cunque)</hi> by <hi>Cardinals,
Patriarchs, Metropolitans, Bishops,</hi> by his <hi>Legate,</hi> or other Officers
of his appointment. I challenge the Doctor, or any man, to shew
such a difference between a <hi>National Officer,</hi> and an <hi>Oecumenick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer</hi>
in the <hi>Church,</hi> as maketh one lawful, and the other unlawful.
The <hi>Pope</hi>'s usurping a Plenitude of <hi>Civil Power,</hi> and more gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abusing his pretended <hi>Church Power,</hi> will not make this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
For we speak of a <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Primate</hi> as such, abstracted
from all Accidents of such an Officer in the <hi>Church.</hi>

too much, to the reason, or rather fansie, of Men; when
he saith, That <hi>Vnion being the best way to preserve the Church, (the
preservation of which Christ designeth by his Institution) we may reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
infer, that whatever tendeth to promote this union, and to prevent
notable inconveniences, is within the design of the first Institution, tho'
it be not contained in express words.</hi> The <hi>Papists</hi> are dull if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
out of this principle hammer out a <hi>Pope,</hi> as well as the <hi>Doctor</hi>
can frame a <hi>Bishop,</hi> or <hi>Arch-Bishop:</hi> This Inference as thus loosly
set down, is no way to be admitted; because Christ hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for the unity, and preservation of his Church, by leaving it
to Mens will, or wholly to their reason either; but by his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
to be wisely managed by the Officers, that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in his house. Unity is then to be preserved, Divisions and
Heresies to be prevented by the painful and faithful preaching of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95366:105"/>
the Gospel by Christs Ministers in their several particular Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
by private, and publick Instructions, and Admonitions: By
their joynt Concurrence in censuring, and drawing out the Sword
of Discipline against stubborn Offenders: These are Christs Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
and will be effectual when he is pleased to bless them;
and this blessing we are to expect on his own appointed means, not
on mens Devices: But we deny that Unity in the Church is to be
preserved in any way that men in their Wisdom think fit, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
that it is to be preserved by setting up <hi>Arch-Bishops,</hi> and
<hi>Bishops</hi> in the <hi>Church:</hi> These being none of Christ's means appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for that end. It is often seen that means thus devised of Men,
by Crossing of Christ's Institution, either fail of their end, or by
mending one evil make a worse: Peace, and Unity is sometim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>National Church of</hi> England <hi>diffusive,</hi> p. 299. to wit, he saith,
<hi>It is the whole Body of Christians in this Nation, consisting of pastors,
and people, agreeing in that Faith, Government, and Worship which
are established by the Laws of this Realm.</hi> Had he put the word of

to this description. But against that Particle I have two Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
1. The <hi>Civil Law</hi> is accidental to the Church, and is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a constituent part of its essence, nor a necessary adjunct of it:
The <hi>Church</hi> hath been without it, and I hope he will not say, That
if the Laws were taken away, the <hi>Church</hi> is unchurched for that.
2. This make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thing, as the Laws of men are, for if <hi>Presbytery,</hi> if <hi>Anabaptism,</hi>
If <hi>Independency, Popery, Socinianism,</hi> and what sort of Religion
you can name, either as to Faith, or Worship, or Government,
were established by Law: They that are of that way should then
be the <hi>Church of</hi> England; which is not only absurd, but a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
notion in such a critical time as this (I hope the <hi>Doctor</hi> did not
design a fair retreat by this) if <hi>Popery</hi> (which God forbid) should
come to be establi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and all the <hi>True Sons of the Church</hi> must turn with the Law, as the

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95366:106"/>
new notion is, To <hi>let men see how easily the</hi> Church of <hi>England is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from</hi> Papists <hi>on the one side, and</hi> Dissenters <hi>on the other;</hi>
which makes him <hi>wonder at them who cannot tell what is meant by the</hi>
Church of <hi>England.</hi> If Men wondred much before, they may
wonder far more now, what is meant by the <hi>Church of</hi> England,
when they see her painted in so changeable colours, as that she may
be one thing now, and another next year, and another the third
year, and so on. The Scripture placeth the Moon under the <hi>Churches</hi>
Feet, and the Twelve Stars, Apostolick Doctrine, on her Head,
as her cognizance and Glory, but the <hi>Doctor</hi> hath advanced the
Moon to her Head, that she must be known by it; what he will do
with the Twelve Stars I know not. He is more favourable to the
<hi>Papists,</hi> and <hi>Dissenters,</hi> they are to be known by their Conformity,
or Nonconformity to Scripture; not to the Laws of the Land: But
if <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Dissenters</hi> should happen to get the Law on their side,
what will that party be that is now the <hi>Church of</hi> England? It seems
the <hi>Doctor</hi> is fond of this notion, for he hath it up again, <hi>p.</hi> 300.
to the question, how comes it to be one <hi>National Church:</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth,
<hi>because it was received by the Common consent of the whole
Nation in Parliament, as other Laws of the Nation are, and is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
received by all that obey these Laws.</hi> And thus he <hi>cleareth our
Mists about the Church of</hi> England. He had debated much with
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> owning a <hi>Christian Kingdom,</hi> but not a <hi>National Church;</hi>
but here he homologateth all that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had said, for the <hi>Parliament</hi>
owning the Faith, maketh a <hi>Christian Kingdom,</hi> but it is some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing that maketh a <hi>National Church,</hi> to wit, the Collective
Body of all the Congregations of a Nation agreeing in the same
Faith, and Worship, and Government, as it is held forth in the
Word of God. If the <hi>Doctor</hi> say, thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on their side. I answer, This is not to be denied; for till the Lord
cure our Divisions about truth, and about his Ordinances, we are
not like to come to a decision of that question, <hi>Who is the Church?</hi>
For all Congregations are parts of the <hi>Church;</hi> and these that are
nearest to the Scripture rule are the truest part of the <hi>Church:</hi> The

This is saith not of the <hi>Convocation at Westminster;</hi> but
<hi>of the Consent of both Convocations.</hi> Here I observe, 1. That the
<hi>Law of the Land</hi> is so constitutive of a <hi>Church</hi> to this Author, that
without it there is neither <hi>diffusive,</hi> nor <hi>representative Church.</hi> Then
what becometh of the <hi>Apostolick Church,</hi> and that of the first 300

The Church is founded on a Divine Rule; but requireth a conformity to
the rules that she hath appointed, as agreeable to the Word of God.</hi>
This, I conceive is not to answer the question; he should have told
us in which of the two rules their unity lieth: We know that all
<hi>Churches</hi> as well as these of <hi>New-England,</hi> (which he mentioneth)
if the Magistrate own them, have civil Priviledges annexed to
<hi>Church</hi> Orders, but that is still wide from the question, whether
these Orders be Divine, or Humane. Doth the <hi>Church,</hi> or do the
<hi>Churches of</hi> New-England <hi>make Orders for observing Ceremonies</hi> in
God's Worship, devised by Man, and place their unity in that?
It remaineth then still, that if the National Unity of the <hi>Church of</hi>
England, be made by Divine Rules that either are expresly, or by
Consequence in Scripture we are members of it, and will in all these
joyn with it; but if they place their unity in observing rules that
have no Warrant from Scripture; if we cannot joyn with them in
so doing, we do not <hi>separate</hi> from them, but they in so far <hi>separate</hi>
from us, and from all the pure <hi>Churches</hi> of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. He maintaineth, <hi>p.</hi> 305. against one of his Opponents, who
had objected, That the Church had no power to make Laws about
<hi>Foederal Rules, teaching Signs, and Symbols,</hi> &amp;c. That <hi>such a Church
hath power to appoint Rules of Order, and Decency not repugnant to the
Word of God, and that all setled Churches are for this,</hi> I reply.
1. He doth not answer to the Objection: I hope all Rules for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and Decency are not about <hi>Foederal Rites,</hi> and <hi>teaching Symbols:</hi>
Ordering the natural Circumstances of Worship comprehendeth
the one, but not the other. 2. It is false. that all setled Churches
appoint Rules for such Order, and Decency as consisteth in <hi>Religious
Ceremonies, teaching Symbols,</hi> and such like. 3. It is also false that
all setled <hi>Churches</hi> appoint Rules of Order, and Decency even in the
Circumstantials of Religion; so as to exclude all from their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
and to incite the Magistrate to punish them, who do not
conform to these Rules (as he alledgeth) other Churches use to rule
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95366:107"/>
by holding forth light, and Perswasives, not to impose with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and force on the Consciences of men: Nor do they concern
the Magistrate, but where some notable violations of the Law of
God, otherwise not to be restrained, doth require it. 4. It is a
false supposition, that our Imposed Rules about Ceremones, are
not repugnant to the Word of God; but this is not the place of
that Debate.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VI. The Peoples Right of Electing their Pastors.</head>
                  <p>THe last of these four Pleas, that the Reverend Author ranketh
under the first Head, and which he alledgeth, some make use
of for <hi>separation,</hi> is, That the people are deprived of their right
in the choice of their own Pastors: This he proceedeth to <hi>Sect.</hi>
24. I do not make the depriving the people of this power a cause of
<hi>separation;</hi> though I reckon it a notable Grievance, and earnestly
desire a redress of it, and pray that the Lord may move the Hearts
of Rulers to defend the people in this their Right, against them
that take it from them. But our work is now to defend this Right
of the Members of the <hi>Church,</hi> against the Doctor's Assaults. But
before I come to this, I shall shew 1. What this Right is that
they have in Electing their Pastors. 2. From whom they Derive
it. 3. What ground we have to think that they have such a
Right.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. To shew what this Right is, I assert, 1. That the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have no Right to bestow the Benefice on their Pastor; nor to
elect him to it, unless either it be their own gift, or the giver of it
hath transferred that power on them. It is <hi>Election</hi> to the Office,
not to the Benefice, that we debate about; which if the Doctor
had considered, he might have spared a great deal of his following
Discourse. It is true, the Magistrate ought to provide for the
<hi>Church,</hi> so as the person, regularly chosen, may enjoy the Benefice;
but if the Magistrate please to reserve it to his own disposing, there
is no Remedy; the people must either chuse the man that may have
the maintenance, if he be tollerably qualified, or they must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95366:108"/>
for him themselves. And so when a Patron giveth a Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
on these terms, That he have the chusing of the person who
shall enjoy it, the <hi>Church</hi> should either reject it, and provide for
their Minister another way, or chuse the person that the Patron
presenteth. But this Patronage is a sad Grievance to the <hi>Church,
devised in</hi> Satan's <hi>Kitchen,</hi> saith <hi>Beza, confess. fid.</hi> c. 35. it is an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
of people in their Spiritual Rights, and in that which
concerneth their Souls: A greater bondage than if the whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
were obliged to eat nothing but what the Patron pleaseth. And
it had been less blame-worthy, if these Donors of <hi>Church Livings</hi>
had kept their Gift to themselves, than thus to prelimit the people
in that which so nearly concerns their Souls; and to make that but
an Accessory (to wit, the charge of Souls) which should be the
thing principally minded: As now the Living is. 2. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
or Patrons electing of a Minister, may give him a Title to
the Living; but it can never make him the Pastor of such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
nor fix a Relation between him, and them, of Pastor, and Flock:
For it is wholly Forreign to the <hi>Church</hi> as a <hi>Church;</hi> it is a thing of
Worldly concern, and therefore can never found that Relation,
which is an Institution of Christ in his <hi>Church.</hi> 3. We do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but when the people have chosen a Pastor, and the <hi>Presbytery</hi>
hath ordained him also, the Magistrate may Imprison, Banish, or
otherwise punish him, so as he is consequentially restrained from
the exercise of his Ministry among that people; if the man be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a civil crime (of which the Magistrate is Judge) but we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that this Act doth dissolve the ministerial relation between that
Pastor, and People; that cannot be done but by the <hi>Church</hi> 4. We
do not so put <hi>Election</hi> into the hand of the multitude, as either to
exclude the <hi>Eldership</hi> that is among them; or to exempt the people
from their guidance in this: The <hi>Eldership</hi> ought to regulate this
Action; yet so, as it be not done without the consent of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.
5. We are far from saying, That the People by their <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
doth make the <hi>Elected</hi> person a Minister; that is done by <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
which is in the Hands of the <hi>Presbytery.</hi> 6. We do not say,
That this <hi>Elective power</hi> of the people is Arbitrary, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
they are to be bounded in it by the Rules of the Gospel,
that set forth the qualifications of Ministers; and if they chuse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to these, the <hi>Presbytery</hi> may reject the person, and refuse to
<hi>ordain</hi> him. 7. We deny not but a part of a <hi>Church,</hi> or the whole
<hi>Church,</hi> may forfeit this Right, as to the present exercise of it, by
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:95366:108"/>
Ignorance, Scandal, Irreconcileable Contentions about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and such like; in which case the power of <hi>Election</hi> devolveth
into the hands of the Pastors of the <hi>Churches</hi> associated; I mean the
<hi>Presbytery.</hi> Yet, the peoples satisfaction should be endeavoured as
much as is possible. 8. It is the Right of the people, which they
ought not to be deprived of, nor restrain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d from exercising, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,
nor without singularly weighty cause, to chuse their own
Pastors, and other <hi>Church Officers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. As to the Author of this Right in the people, I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that it is neither from the <hi>Churches</hi> Determination, nor from
any grant from the <hi>Magistrate;</hi> neither do I plead any Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for it: For by Divine Institution (which is never contrary to
the Law of Nature) it was otherwise in the <hi>Jewish Church.</hi> And
though there be abundant reason for it, it being the priviledge of
Free Corporations, and other Societies, to chuse these that are to
govern them; and it being rational, that a Corporation, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
may chuse the Lawyer that they will intrust their Estates to;
and the Physician in whose hand they put their life; so men should
not be imposed upon to entrust the Conduct of their Souls to a
person that they have not confidence in, and whom they cannot
chuse for that end. Yet, I say, we do not lay the stress of the
matter on <hi>Humane Reason,</hi> but on <hi>Gospel Institution:</hi> I affirm then,
that this is the Institution of Christ; that it is the order that he
hath appointed in the Gospel, that people should have liberty to
chuse their own Pastors, and other <hi>Church</hi> Officers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. I am next to shew the grounds that we have to think so.
I shall prove this by shewing that it was the constant practice in the
<hi>Church,</hi> while the Apostles managed the Affairs of it, that <hi>Church</hi>
Officers were chosen by the suffrages of the people; and I hope it
will not be denied, that such practice is declarative of Christ's
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
The first Argument for it, is from <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. where
though <hi>Ordination,</hi> or appointing, be expressed in our Translation,
yet the Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ignifieth a chusing by Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
as the manner of the <hi>Grecians</hi> was, by stretching out or lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the hand (for that is the force of the Word) to declare their
Votes. I deny not that this Word is sometimes used figuratively,
for potestative mission, the effect, or consequent of <hi>Election;</hi> and
that by one person, withot Suffrages, as <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 14. yet it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rare that the Word is so used: And it is evident, that the Word
is most commonly us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d in this sence; of all the Instances that <hi>Scapula</hi>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:95366:109"/>
in his <hi>Lexicon,</hi> giveth of the use of this Word, not one of them
is to the contrary. And it cannot be Instanced, that ever this word
is used for laying on of hands; lifting up (which is the force of
the Word) and laying them down, being so opposite, it is not to
be imagined that the one should be put for the other. Neither is
it fit to seek for the Figurative signification of the Word, when
the proper signification may be admitted. It is objected against
this use of the Word here, that they ordained <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> not
<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> to <hi>them,</hi> not <hi>to themselves,</hi> that is, the Apostles to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ordained Elders. <hi>Answ.</hi> It cannot be denied, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is
used indifferently for <hi>them,</hi> or <hi>themselves;</hi> and why it may not
here be understood of themselves, I see not; so as that here is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted
the Action of appointing Elders for the people, in which
the people had a hand by <hi>Election,</hi> as the Word here importeth,
and the Apostles had a hand by <hi>Ordination,</hi> as can be proved by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scriptures? But if we should turn <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>them,</hi> the sense may
run plainly thus; the Apostles appointed by <hi>Ordination,</hi> Elders
for the people, upon their <hi>Electing</hi> them by Suffrages. It is no strange
thing in Scripture to see divers Actions expressed by the same
Word, where one is the consequent of the other, as <hi>Is. 38. 17.
Thou hast Loved my Soul out of the pit of corruption,</hi> i.e. delivered it,
because thou loved it: Also <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 9. The Patriarchs are said to
sell <hi>Joseph</hi> to <hi>Egypt;</hi> where both their Actions, and the Actions of
the <hi>Midianites</hi> who carried him to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and there sold him, are
included in one Word. Many Instances of this kind of Synthesis
may be seen in <hi>Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ss. Philol. Sacr. lib. 3. tract. 3. p.</hi> 229—It is also
objected, that these are said to <hi>Ordain</hi> who commended the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to the Lord; that is, the Apostles, and that the Apostles are
spoken of all along in the Nominative Case, and not the people;
and therefore they must be the Actors meant by this word. <hi>Answ.</hi>
We deny not the Apostles to be Actors meant in this Word, as the
Patriarchs were in the Word, <hi>Selling to Egypt,</hi> Act. 7. 9. but we
say the peoples action is also included, in the force of the Word;
to wit, their Voteing by lifting up their hands; which in no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
can be applied to the Apostles, being but two men, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
needed not such a way of Voteing between them. I conclude,
this being done <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>in every</hi> Church, the people <hi>respective</hi>
chusing their Pastors, and the Apostles <hi>Ordaining</hi> them, it is clear
to have been generally the practice of these times, and so the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Chirst.</p>

the Lord was so careful, to preserve this right in <hi>Election</hi> or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Officers; that when Men for extraordinary Work were to be
sent forth, the Peoples choice was not neglected. Hence two were
chosen by the Multitude, and presented to the Lord; that by Lot
the Lord might chuse one of them to be an Apostle Successor to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,
Act.</hi> 1. 23. and <hi>Matthias</hi> being chosen by <hi>Lot,</hi> it is said of him,

                     </gap> he was reckoned by Votes, among the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 1, 2. the Lord chused <hi>Barnabus,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> for a
special Service; but he would have the Votes of the <hi>Church</hi> for it.
If the Lord thus condescended to take the present consent in such a
matter; is it fit for <hi>Bishops</hi> or Patrons to neglect them, and obtrude
Men upon them, whether they will or not? Argument <hi>3d.</hi> When
ever any extraordinary piece of work (I mean such as was not
daily exercise) was to be put into the Hands of Ministers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a special Revelation; they were chosen to it by the Suffrages of
the People, as appeareth by. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 22. where <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi>
are sent to <hi>Antiech,</hi> about carrying the Decrees of the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
and backing them with their Doctrine. So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 19. 23.
Some are chosen by the <hi>Churches</hi> to accompany <hi>Paul</hi> in carrying a
Collection to the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Judea;</hi> and are called the <hi>Messengers of the
Churches.</hi> Argument <hi>4th.</hi> The <hi>Deacons</hi> were appointed to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen

6. 2, 3. It is a frivolous Answer; that it doth not follow, that they
should chuse their Pastors, because they may chuse the Distributers of
their Benevolence. For, 1. both are <hi>Church</hi> Officers, instituted
by Christ: In this then they are alike. 2. It were a less matter, that
people were imposed on in this lesser concern; than in that of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

be satisfied about the one, much more that they should be satis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the purer primitive times; which we the rather use, because
our Brethren lay so much weight on this for the Power of <hi>Bishops,</hi>

Ground to resume it.</hi> One would think, that if this Power be from
Christ; his other two parts of his discourse migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For who then could take it from them? And they always had
a Right to resume it, being unjustly deprived of it. As to the first
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:95366:111"/>
of these, his debate with Dr. <hi>O.</hi> about the Peoples <hi>Church-Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,</hi>

But he cometh, <hi>Sect.</hi> 25. to this power of <hi>Election;</hi> for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
of which, he undertaketh to make out six things: I shall
examine them in order. But I think it had been more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to have answered the Scriptures, and Testimonies out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
alledged by the opposites, which he hath not done. The
First of these is, <hi>That the main ground of the Peoples Interest was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the Apostles Canon; that a Bishop must be blameless, and of good
report,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 2, 7. <hi>Ans.</hi> I have produced other grounds, and
not made this either the main, or any ground of this Right of the
People; for indeed that passage of Scripture doth direct the <hi>Electors;</hi>
but doth not determine who should <hi>Elect.</hi> I deny not but some of
the Ancients made use of that Scripture to this purpose, but they
made use of others also; and having established the Truth on other
Grounds, they might well apply this place as spoken to the People,
to direct them how to manage that power of <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ction,</hi> that the Lord
had given them. This is a sorry Shift to shun the Dint of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to pitch on that which is either no Argument, or a weak
one, and to set up that as the only Argument; and so by beating it
down, to Triumph.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. He bringeth a passage out of <hi>Clem.</hi> on which he taketh
a great deal of pains, to make it speak for him contrary to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
design of it. The passage is, <hi>The Apostles, Preaching through
Cities, and Countries, did appoint the first Fruites; having made a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Tryal of them, to be Bishops, and Deacons.—The Apostles fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
the Contentions that would be about the Name of Episcopacy</hi> (i. e.
saith the Dr. <hi>about the choice of Bishops) therefore they appointed the
Persons mentioned, and left the Distribution of their Office with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
that as some dyed, other approved Men should be chosen into
their Office: These therefore who were appointed by them, or other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Men; the Church being therewith all pleased, discharging their
Office with Humility—cannot be justly put out of their Office.</hi> A Man
of less learning than the Dr. might easily draw the quite contrary
Conclusion, from these words of <hi>Clement;</hi> but it will require all
his Skill, and more too; to conclude from them against popular
<hi>Election.</hi> But thus he argueth; <hi>They were to be appointed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
therefore not of the Peoples choice.</hi> Ans. <hi>Non sequitur:</hi> The
Deacons were appointed by the Apostles, <hi>Act</hi> 6. 3. yet the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95366:111"/>
are <hi>to look out from among them, i. e.</hi> to chuse; and the Apostles to
appoint them, <hi>i. e.</hi> set them apart for their work. Many other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
may be given; yet this Argumentation the Dr. useth again,
pag. 315. as if it were a mighty Argument. He saith, <hi>it seems some
of the People were Contentious, and endeavoured to throw out some of
their Officers, which occasioned this Ep. Ans.</hi> This <hi>Ep.</hi> is clear, that
the People may not cast out their Officers, doing their Work in
Humility—but not a Word in it against their <hi>Electing</hi> of them, but
clearly to the contrary; in these words, <hi>the whole Church being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
well pleased,</hi> implyeth, that it is not to be done without them;
and what Hand they can have in placing their Officers, that doth
not amount to <hi>Election,</hi> I know not. He saith, <hi>they took this course
of Purpose to avoid Contentions.</hi> What course doth he mean? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be meant of Obtruding Officers on the <hi>Church;</hi> for he saith,
<hi>they must be well pleased.</hi> Therefore the Course must be appointing
Officers Authoritatively by <hi>Ordination;</hi> who being so appointed,
could not be ejected again, <hi>quemdiu se bene gesserunt,</hi> as appeareth
by <hi>Clem.</hi> instancing the <hi>Blossoming of</hi> Arons <hi>Rod,</hi> to put an end to
the Emulation among the Tribes; which was a Strife not about
<hi>Election,</hi> but about changing of the setled Officers of the <hi>Church.</hi> He
saith, <hi>all that the People had to do, was to give their Testimony. Clem.</hi>
saith, <hi>they must be well pleased.</hi> And it is clear, that that exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
obtruding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>astors on people, either by Patrons, or the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
or <hi>Bishop.</hi> He saith, <hi>it seems probable to him, that the reason
of the Faction among them was, that some represented it as a Grievance,
that those Officers were appointed by others, not chosen by them.</hi> Why
this should seem to him, I know not; except that prejudice repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
things otherwise than they are; as coloured Spectacles do.
It seemeth to me there could be no such thought among the People,
because <hi>Clement</hi> supposeth the Officers to have been chosen by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
the whole Church being well pleased. That these Factious
Men had no Objection against the <hi>Presbyters</hi> themselves; the Dr.
Asserts, but he doth not prove: It is true, <hi>Clem.</hi> supposeth there
was no Ground for Objection; and therefore they could not be cast
out, while they were humble, quiet, ready, and blamless; but for all
that, Factious Men will find fault, and pick quarrels, with the most
innocent men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. He next bringeth <hi>Cyprian</hi> to plead against <hi>popular Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi>
that is, to plead against himself. For he saith, <hi>p. 316. That
he requireth no more but their Testimony, that it be done,</hi> sub populi.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95366:112"/>
Assistentis conscientia; <hi>that by their presence, either their Faults
might be published, or their good Acts commended, that so it might appear
to be a just, and lawful Ordination, which hath been examined by the
Suffrages of all:</hi> And after <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, <hi>It came down from Divine
Tradition, and Apostolick practice that a Bishop should be chosen,</hi> ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
presente <hi>(not by the Votes of the people,</hi> (says the <hi>Doctor.)</hi> One
would think all this time, the <hi>Doctor</hi> is secretly undermining his
own cause; and yet will out-face plain light to defend it. Doth
not <hi>Cyprian</hi> mention the Suffrages of all, and yet the Doctor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
him deny them Votes; if their presence, their Testimony,
commending or publishing the faults of the Candidate, their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and assistance, can consist with Patronage, and obtruding
of Ministers on the people, as a Master of a Flock setteth a Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
over his Sheep (it is one of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Arguments for the
Doctor's Conclusion.) If these do not import the peoples consent
to be required; and so amount to <hi>Election;</hi> let any indifferent
Reader judge. It is plain that <hi>Cyprian</hi> not only alloweth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
this power, but maketh it a Divine Right; and maketh <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
without it to be unjust, and unlawful: Wherefore if we
should adhere to <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s judgment, there would be few Ministers
in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and so more cause for <hi>separation</hi> than he
is aware of; but I do not improve his Testimony to that end. The
Doctor, <hi>p.</hi> 317. bringeth <hi>Cyprians</hi> Testimony, <hi>That it belongeth
chiefly to the people to refuse the bad, and chuse the good;</hi> and yet hath
the Brow to say, That this is no more then their Testimony; but
if Testimony be chusing, we require no more but Testimony; It is
nothing to the purpose that <hi>Lampridius</hi> says Severus, <hi>proposed the
Names of Governors of Provinces to the people, to see what they had to
say against them; and that this will not infer popular Election of these
Governors.</hi> For 1. This was never declared to be necessary, and
appointing Governours unjust or unlawful without it, as it is in
our case. 2. We have proved, that the people have power of
Suffrage, and of <hi>chusing:</hi> which was not granted by <hi>Severus.</hi> That
<hi>Origen</hi> saith a <hi>Bishop</hi> must be <hi>Ordained</hi> Astante populo, is such an
Argument against us, as sheweth a very weak cause, especially when
so Learned a Man thought better to use it then say nothing. For it
is <hi>Election</hi> we speak of, not <hi>Ordination;</hi> in which we confess, the
people have no hand, neither doth <hi>Origen</hi> say, That this <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
could proceed without the peoples being more concerned about
the person, than standing by while he was Ordained; and yet even
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95366:112"/>
this favour is not granted to the people in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> will
not be at the pains to come to the several Parishes to ordain the
Ministers before the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. The 2. thing that the Dr. insisteth on is, <hi>p. 318. That the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
upon this, Assuming the power of Elections, caused great Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
and disorders in the Church.</hi> To this I answer in general,
1. I desire to know on what the people assumed the power of <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
whether on Christ's Institution, or any subsequent ground; if
the latter let him shew it, if the former, it is improper to say they
assumed, what was ever their due: The Doctor seemeth to speak
of it as an act of the people, after that priviledge had been out of
their hand for some time. 2. There is no Institution of Christ,
but inconveniences may follow on it, as long as sinful men have the
managing of it: Hath none followed on <hi>Church Power</hi> in the hands
of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters?</hi> Yea, of civil power in the hands of
Magistrates; yea, of power of <hi>Election,</hi> in the hands of <hi>Patrons.</hi>
It were easie to fill a Volume with Histories to this purpose: Will
the Doctor thence conclude, that all these should be abolished? 3.
As few inconveniences can be instanced, as following on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<hi>Election</hi> of their Pastors, as of most other things. The Doctor
instanceth but four in the space of 1000 years, that this power of
the people lasted unviolated; and that through all the Christian
<hi>Churches.</hi> I do not deny but more there might be; but when so
few occurr as observable to a man of so great reading, it saith more
against the Doctors design, than all these Instances say for it. 4.
Most of these disturbances fell out by the Ambition of <hi>Bishops</hi> influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing
the people, and leading them into Factions; and were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by the worldly advantage of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> in the degenerate
State of the <hi>Church;</hi> and were not to be seen where <hi>Bishops</hi> kept
within due bounds, and were in a mean condition; so that indeed
this Consideration is more against <hi>Episcopal</hi> grandeur, and impari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than against popular <hi>Elections.</hi> As is evident from <hi>Ammian.
Marcellin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> whom the Doctor citeth, as the Author of that Story
of a Bloody <hi>Election</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Contest was about <hi>Damasus,</hi>
where he sheweth, That <hi>they aspired to that Bishoprick with all their
might, considering how the Bishop was enriched,</hi> Oblationibus Matro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum,
<hi>rode in Chariots, were Gorgeously attired, fared sumptuously;</hi>
and saith, <hi>They might have shuned these inconveniences, had they despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
this grandeur, and imitated the Bishops in the Provinces, whose
humble carriage, poor fare, and mean habit, commended them to God
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95366:113"/>
and good men.</hi> 5. It is worth our Observation, that not one of
these Disorders fell out for 300 years after Christ, when the Church
was in her Integrity, and had not degenerated, as she did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
6. There is a better means of preventing these disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to wit, the Magistrate ought to suppress them; and the Rulers
of the <hi>Church</hi> ought to regulate <hi>Elections,</hi> and take away the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of that power from the unruly, as they take the <hi>Sacraments,</hi>
though peoples priviledge, from them that walk unworthy of them.
When inconveniences fall in, we must take God's way not our own,
to set things right again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. This might suffice for Answer to all, the Doctors Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeances
on this head; but further there is not so fair a represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
made of matters of fact as need were. For the <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st.</hi> Instance,
the Disorder at <hi>Antioch,</hi> it was not as he representeth it, about
the chusing of a new <hi>Bishop</hi> to a vacant place; but about putting
an <hi>Arian Bishop</hi> (at least supposed to be so) into the place of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stathius,</hi>
who had long been peaceably in that place, and regularly
chosen; but was injuriously deposed by the <hi>Arians.</hi> Neither was
<hi>Eustathius</hi> chosen at last (as the Doctor saith) but rid out the
Storm; and kept his place against the violent attempts of these
<hi>Hereticks.</hi> And therefore this Instance is wide from the purpose.
The next Instance is at <hi>Caesarea:</hi> The person that carried the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
was <hi>Basil,</hi> the Magistrates, and the worst of the people op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
him. Of this <hi>Nazianzen</hi> justly complaineth; and it cannot
be justified; but cannot infer, that popular <hi>Elections</hi> should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away. <hi>Gregorius Nazianzenus</hi>'s wish to that purpose, is unduly
represented; it was, That the <hi>Election might be in the hands of the
Clergy, and the more holy part of the people,</hi> and that not only, but
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Chiefly.</hi> This doth evince that he looketh on the right
of <hi>Election</hi> to be in them; and only wished, that bad men might
be deprived of the use of that priviledge; and so do we, when
they abuse it: So it be taken from them orderly. The <hi>3d.</hi> Instance
is at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where <hi>Dioseurus</hi> was chosen, and <hi>Proterius</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
This is a gross mistake, or misrepresentation. It was not
at the <hi>Election;</hi> but long after, yea, <hi>Proterius</hi>'s Murder was 5 or 6
years after; beside, it was done, and the Sedition raised by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks:</hi>
Shall not the <hi>Church</hi> chuse her Pastors now, because <hi>Papists</hi>
would oppose it, if they be not curbed? Of the <hi>4th</hi> Instance I
have already spoken; to wit, that at <hi>Rome</hi> about <hi>Damasus.</hi> What
he saith of <hi>Chrysostom, Jerom,</hi> and others, complaining of peoples
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95366:113"/>
unfitness to Judge, doth not prove his point: For all these Men
were for popular <hi>Election,</hi> as I have shewed above. Beside, that the
Pastor's fitness is to be judged by the <hi>Ordainers,</hi> after the <hi>Electors</hi>
have done their part.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. His third thing is, <hi>p.</hi> 320. That to prevent these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
many <hi>Bishops</hi> were appointed without the <hi>choice</hi> of the
people, and <hi>Canons</hi> were made for regulation of <hi>Elections.</hi> For
proof of this, he telleth us, that at <hi>Alexandria</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> was not
only to be chosen out of the twelve <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but by them, and
citeth for this <hi>Jerome, Ep. ad Enagrium, Severus,</hi> and <hi>Almacintus,</hi>

and had no power over the people, more than the rest had;
as hath been shewed above: If he can prove that he was chosen to
be Pastor of his particular Flock without their consent, that were to
the purpose. 2. This can make nothing for <hi>Patronages,</hi> or the
Magistrate obtruding a pastor on the people, or a single <hi>Bishop</hi>
doing it. 3. <hi>Jerom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

What is said by <hi>Hilarius</hi> of the altering of the custom, is not
who should <hi>Elect;</hi> but that he might be <hi>Elected</hi> either from among
the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or from any place else. What is all this against <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular

<hi>A.</hi> A negative Testimony in this case signifieth nothing. The

needed not be mentioned. That <hi>Severus</hi> of <hi>Milevis,</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi>
named, their Successors is no proof, unless he prove that they were
obtruded on the People without their consent: No doubt any man,
more the Great <hi>Augustine,</hi> may name a Minister to the People; but
this taketh not away the Peoples free consent or choice; which
the <hi>Dr.</hi> doth not deny to have been had in both these Cases. Yea,

consecrated in his <hi>Church.</hi> I deny not, that such abuses were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
The <hi>Council</hi> doth not approve of such a thing; nor doth
it hence follow, that it was ordinary, but rather the contrary; it
is pitty to see the <hi>Dr.</hi> put to such shifts, as to instance <hi>Gregorius,</hi>
being made <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> before he went thither; seeing this
was done by the <hi>Arians,</hi> and he took possession by military Force,
and it was disliked by the rest of the eminent Persons of the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi>
But the main thing that maketh this instance to be inimitable,
is, that <hi>Anastasius</hi> was in the place, and by this means expelled.
The next Instance of <hi>Basil</hi> ordaining <hi>Euphronius</hi> before the peoples
consent, was irregular; but that he behoved to have the peoples
consent before he setled there, maketh it wholly impertinent to
the thing in hand. Nothing can be less to the purpose, than
what followeth, of the peoples pititioning the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain</hi>
their <hi>Bishop;</hi> for this supposeth their <hi>Election</hi> of him; and

                     </gap>n he telleth us of a <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Council of Laodicea,</hi>
that a <hi>Bishop</hi> chosen by the people, taking possession without the
Provincial Synod, was to be turned out: We say the same; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the people may <hi>Elect;</hi> but the Pastors must <hi>Ordain.</hi> This
doth not shew (as he alledgeth) that the business of <hi>Election</hi> was
in the <hi>East,</hi> brought into the <hi>Bishops</hi> power, but only that the

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:95366:114"/>
Dr. inferreth, that the common People were excluded from the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction.
Ans. 1. Justinians</hi> Law cannot make void the Law of God
and they that have not given their Names to <hi>Erastus,</hi> do think that
Christ's Laws, which are to be declared by his <hi>Church,</hi> and not <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinians</hi>
Laws should take place in the <hi>Church</hi> of God. 2. It is not
said they must present Three; but they might do it; but they might
also present two, or but one. 3. It is not said, that the Clergy
and better Citizens were to <hi>Elect;</hi> but they were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
that is, to draw up the Decrees, as they were then called, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Election</hi> was contained. 4. In another Law of <hi>Justini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n,</hi> it
is appointed that the <hi>Election</hi> be made by the Inhabitants of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And I hope he will not impute Contradictions to <hi>Justinian</hi>'s
Laws. He next objecteth <hi>Concil. Laodic. can.</hi> 13. He doth not cite
the Words, and I meet only with the Title in these Words, <hi>Deo
quod non sit populis concedendum electionent facere eorum quam altaris
Ministerio sit applicandi. Ans.</hi> If this be meant of excluding the
People wholly, it is inconsistent with other <hi>Canons</hi> above cited, and
therefore not to be minded. Therefore the meaning must rather
be, that the <hi>Election</hi> is not to be left to the Rable; but they are to
be assisted, and directed in that Action by the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
of the People. The Second <hi>Council of</hi> Nice, is next cited;
but much amiss; for it is <hi>Ordination,</hi> not <hi>Election</hi> that is restrained
to <hi>Bishops, i. e.</hi> not to be done without them; and <hi>Election</hi> is only
taken out of the Hand of the Magistrate. That Second Council cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for Conformation of their Decree, the Fourth <hi>Can.</hi> of <hi>Concil.
Nice.</hi> 1. Where there is not a Word of <hi>Election</hi> by <hi>Bishops,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

28. Carazanze</hi> hath it, 22. Whereas the <hi>Greek Church</hi> owned but
Fourteen of these <hi>Canons;</hi> and the rest are look'd on as a Forgery.
Beside, That <hi>Council</hi> was in the end of the Ninth Century; when
the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had got very high; and therefore less to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. The Fourth thing the Dr. considereth, is, p. 323. That
<hi>the Magistrate, when Christian, did interpose in this, as he judged ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.
Ans.</hi> We are not against the Magistrates interposing; to
repress Tumults, assist the Oppressed, oppose unpeaceable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the question is, Whether the Magistrate did take
away the <hi>Election</hi> from the People, and did interpose generally; and
when there was no special necessity for his interposing. 2. We
deny not but some Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>strates did interpose against Right, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95366:115"/>
but <hi>quo jure</hi> did they do so. But let us hear his Instances; the
first is, <hi>Constantine recommended to the</hi> Synod, <hi>two Men to chuse ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them, or whom they should judge fit, without taking notice of the
Interest of the People. Ans.</hi> 1. This is far from taking away the
Peoples right, to deprive them of the present use of it, on occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their dissension. 2. How doth he prove, that no notice was
taken of the Peoples Interest: That it is not mentioned, is no proof;
it was so universally owned in those days, that it might well be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
without mention. 3, Yea, the Emperour in his <hi>Ep.</hi> to the
People of <hi>Antioch,</hi> doth mention it several times, as <hi>Eus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ch;</hi> but
to chuse one according to the Custom of the <hi>Church,</hi> as our Saviour
had d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rected them. His next instance is, in a Dissension at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
about <hi>Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Macedonius.</hi> The <hi>Emperour Constantius</hi>
put them both by; and put in <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> And after
his Death, when the Oxthodox party chused <hi>Paulus,</hi> the Emperour
put him out by force, and put in <hi>Macedonius. Ans.</hi> Such Instances
will be little to the Credit of his cause; for all this was done by a
persecuting <hi>Emperour Constantius,</hi> for r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and planting <hi>Arianism;</hi> and was complained of by all the <hi>Orthodox,</hi>
as an Encroachment on the Liberties of the <hi>Church.</hi> What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
is far short of the point; to wit, the <hi>Emperours</hi> restoring
<hi>Athenasius,</hi> and several other <hi>Bishops,</hi> who had been duly <hi>Elected</hi> and
<hi>Ordained,</hi> and by him thrust from their plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s. Next, <hi>Theodosius</hi>
would have <hi>Nectarius</hi> made <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> when many of
the <hi>Bishops</hi> opposed it. <hi>Ans.</hi> This maketh more against <hi>Episcopal
Ordination,</hi> than against <hi>Popular Election.</hi> But that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

peoples Votes; and <hi>Palladius,</hi> whom the Dr. in this leaneth to, doth
not deny them. Next, he saith, the Emperour would have none
of the Clergy of <hi>Constantinople</hi> chosen to succeed <hi>Sinsinnius;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Nestorius</hi> was brought from <hi>Antioch. Ans.</hi> It doth not follow
that he was not chos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n by the People; and the <hi>Emperour</hi> laying this

disturbance: Such pretences have often given occasion to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.
His last instance is, <hi>Proctus</hi> was made <hi>Bishop</hi> by the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi>
order, before the Burial of his Successor. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is not
proved that the People did not chuse him, yea, the People had
chosen him before <hi>Maximanus</hi> his predecessor got the place, and
he being now dead, he might enter in without the Formality of a
new choice. Let the Reader now judge, whether any Orthodox
<hi>Emperour</hi> did ever disown this priviledge of the People, either by
declaring that the power was not in them, but in himself, or by
interposing ordinarily, or without hazard of the Civil Peace, in
the <hi>Elections</hi> of the Pastors of the <hi>Church;</hi> wherefore the Dr. in all
this hath said nothing, that can conclude against this power of the

out of it; which fell out in the latter, and very corrupt times
of the <hi>Church:</hi> Himself dateth it from the endowment of <hi>Churches,</hi>
by the liberality of the <hi>Northern Princes.</hi> Against this I argue,
1. This practice being so long after the <hi>Churches</hi> purity began to
decay; and when Christian Religion was almost destroy'd by the
encrease of Apostacies, and when <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> had, as it were
divided the spoiles of the <hi>Church</hi> between them; and robbed the
People both of their Rights, and many of the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God,

for <hi>Princes</hi> to interpose so in the <hi>Election</hi> of the Pastors of the
<hi>Church,</hi> as to take it out of the peoples Hand. That there was no
greater reason then before I prove, both because he cannot shew us
such reason; and also because before this, there were Tumults, and
Confusions, which might require the Magistrates interposition;
and also because the Christian <hi>Emperours</hi> had as much power over the
<hi>Church</hi> in their large Dominions, as Christian Kings could pretend
to in their lesser Kingdoms. No difference in this can be assigned,
either from any grant of Christ to the one, more then to the other;
nor from sound reason. That which the <hi>Dr.</hi> bringeth for a
Reason, is none at all; to wit, The <hi>Northern Princes endowing
Churches liberally:</hi> For, 1. Did not the <hi>Emperours</hi> so too. <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it was Christ's Legacy to them, and not alienable by them. It doth

are not at Mens disposal. 2. I deny that this was done; people
never gave away this Right; it was partly by violence, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Fraud, wrested out of their Hands; what he saith of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi>
giving it away, wherein the People are represented; is a
mistake; for the people are represented in <hi>Parliament,</hi> as they are
Members of the Body Politick; and they instrust all their worldly
Interests, and Lives, and Estates, to them whom they chuse; and
they may dispose of these, by making Laws to secure them; and
also to take them away when the publick good doth so require;
but they are not there represented, as they are Members of the
<hi>Church;</hi> neither do they, or can they, entrust the <hi>Parliament</hi> with
the concerns of their Souls, or the <hi>Church</hi> Rights, and Priviledges:
These Christ hath made Laws about, and no Man can make Laws
about them; all that men can do in reference to these is Ministerial,
not Magisterial, as Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> are; it is to declare Christ's
Laws, and to put them in Execution; and Christ hath not entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted

Souls, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> cannot dispose of peoples Souls. The

the people be humersome and factious, they may run after whom
they please in opposition to Laws. This is <hi>ad populum f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hath given people power to chuse sound Pastors, not whom they
will. The Doctor asketh, Whether all must have equal Votes?
then the worst, who are the most part will chuse one like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
<hi>Answ.</hi> This is to be regulated by the Guides of the <hi>Church,</hi>
the worst are to be instructed; yea, and censured, if need be, and
if they chuse a bad man, the Pastors are not to ordain him. He
alledgeth, few are competent Judges. <hi>Answ.</hi> Many can judge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably,

strifs in popular <hi>Elections:</hi> This hath been abundantly answered
above. That the matter is devolved, on a few, doth not take away
the right of others, who are willing to be advised by these few. The
Doctor is as certain that Christ never gave people such an unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
right, as he is, that he designed Peace and Unity in the <hi>Church.</hi>
This certainty is built on no good grounds, and therefore amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to no more but <hi>fancy.</hi> I have shewed ground for a contrary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
and a way that Christ hath laid down for peace consistent
with this right.</p>

Prayer; they may be used when that work cannot be tollerably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
without them; neither do we condemn joyning in such a
way of praying even when the man that chuseth that way might and
ought to do otherwise: Neither do we scruple joyning in the use of
the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> meerly because it is imposed by Authority. I know we
are misrepresented in all these. But 1. We condemn using of set
Forms of Prayer, either in private, or publick, without such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
as that duty cannot be tollerably performed without that
help. 2. We think it unlawful for the Church, or any other, to
impose on the Ministers of the Gospel the use of a set Form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
where there is not absolute necessity. 3. We think in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case of the <hi>Church,</hi> there is no such absolute necessity of that
imposition, seeing Ministers may be had, who are tollerably gifted
for their Work: And seeing it is Christ's Institution that none but
such should be in the Ministery; and seeing any Escapes, or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies
that can be observed in a Ministers Administrations, are to
be Corrected by the Discipline of the <hi>Church;</hi> which is Christ's way,
not by imposing a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which is Mans way. 4. We think it
unlawful for Ministers, who are tollerably gifted for their Work,
(and if they be not such, in the judgment of the <hi>Church,</hi> they should
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95366:120"/>
lay aside that Work, and betake themselves to other Callings.) To
submit to such Impositions, or to use such Forms of Prayer. 5. What
is said of Forms of Prayers, let it be also understood of Forms of
Preaching, Administration of Sacraments, and Exhortations at
them, and of other parts of the Service of God: Here we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
except Forms of singing praise unto God, and that on two
Grounds. 1. The Scripture hath furnished the <hi>Church</hi> with such
Forms for all cases of a Soul, and of the <hi>Church,</hi> in the Book of
<hi>Psalms,</hi> which is not done in Prayer, and other Admin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>strations.
So that these Forms are not humane, as other Forms must be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 2.
The Gift of composing Spiritual Songs, fit to be sung in the <hi>Church,</hi>
is not to be expected that it should be Commonly given to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
of the <hi>Church,</hi> as the Gifts of Preaching and Praying are given.
6. We think it unlawful for people to joyn in Worshipping God,
by a frame of Service, not instituted, nor warranted in the Word
of God; both as to the matter, and as to the manner of it. 7. The
<hi>English Service Book</hi> is such a frame of Service as is not warranted,
nor instituted in the Word; and so it is unlawful for us to joyn in
Worshipping God by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. If we can give good reason for the <hi>2d, 4th, 6th,</hi> and <hi>7th,</hi>
of these Assertions, sufficient ground will appear for our scrupling
the use of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> imposed as one of the <hi>Terms of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
with the <hi>Church of England.</hi> For the First of these, That Men
may not impose set Forms on Gifted Ministers. Arguments for this
are, 1. There is no warrant for such practice; if there be, it
must be either Christ's Command, or his Permission, or the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of it: The first nor second is not alledged, because no such
thing can be proved from the Word. Nor the third, for such a
necessity is contrary to our supposition, that the men, so imposed
on, are gifted. If it be said, the best gifted may slip into unfit
expressions. <hi>Reply,</hi> This unfitness is either tolerable, and so no
necessity can arise from that hazard; or into<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erable, and then it is
to be cured by Christ's means, <hi>Church Discipline,</hi> not by the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man. 2. No such imposition, nor usage was ever heard of
in the <hi>Apostolick Church,</hi> nor in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> for 300 years
and more; and yet there were Ministers subject to Infirmities, as
Men now are; and the Worship of God was by them fitly mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
May not the means of securing Worship from abuse, serve us
that served them? Or will we be wiser and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re wary than they?
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:95366:121"/>
That there was any Forms used or imposed in the Apostles times,
we need not prove, the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> is no Instance to the contrary,
it cannot be made appear, that ever it was intended to be a form of
words, or used as such. And for the Primitive times, it is evident
that when <hi>Constantine</hi> would help his Souldiers, newly come out of
<hi>Heathenism,</hi> with a Form he behoved to get some composed, which
needed not, had they then been in the <hi>Church. Justin Martyr,</hi>
Apol. 2. p. 98. <hi>Edition. Paris.</hi> giving account of their publick Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

                     </gap>.
That is, the Minister sendeth up Prayers and Thanksgivings, as he
is able; then not by Book, but his Ability as the Lord furnished
him. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> Apol. <hi>c.</hi> 30. saith, <hi>They prayed in their Assemblies,
sine monitore, quum de pectore;</hi> and in his Book <hi>de Oratiore,</hi> he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that there are many things to be asked according to every ones
occasions; the Lord's Prayer being laid as a Foundation: where the
true use of the Lord's prayer (note that by the way) is hinted;
to wit, to be a <hi>Directory,</hi> not a <hi>Form. Socrates</hi> Hist. Eccles. <hi>lib. 5.

that is generally and every where,
in all Religions, in Prayer, there are not two to be found that
agree in one; which surely must be meant of Agreement in the
same words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. A third Argument for this is, such imposing doth thwart
one great design of Prayer in publick, which is to lay out before the
Lord all the several cases of the people, or the <hi>Church;</hi> their sins,
and wants; which do so vary, that no Book can suit them all; I
am sure ours doth not. If it be answer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>berty doth frustrate
the design of set prayer, which is to prevent venting of error, and
indecency, is not that hazard in permitting prayer after Sermon,
as well as at other times: Wherefore either this imposing must shut
out all Prayer; or it is a needless thing, and so unlawful in the
<hi>Church. Argument</hi> 4. Imposing set Forms on the Ministers of the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:95366:121"/>
Gospel, is a restraining, if not making void the <hi>Charismata,</hi> the
Gifts of the Spirit that the Lord hath furnished his Ministers with,
for the benefit of the Church. For clearing and confirming this
Argument, I offer these Considerations. 1. The Lord hath furnished
his Church with Gifts that are needful for her edification. There
was a large pouring out of the Spirit at first, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 1. and tho'
that degree and manner, and some of the uses of it, be ceased;
yet the thing it self shall never cease, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 21. for without the
Gifts of the Spirit, the Church could not subsist, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. It is
by the Holy Ghost that we must profess Christ, preach him, pray
in his Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence Christ sent the Spirit in his own room,
when he left off to manage the Affairs of the Church in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as he had done on earth in the days of his humiliation; and
the Spirit is on this account called by the Ancients <hi>Vicarius Christs.</hi>
2. The Gifts of the Spirit are particularly given to the Ministers
of the Gospel, for assisting them to manage their work for the
Churches advantage: For these Gifts are mentioned with reference
to them, and their work, and the fruit of their work; as is clear,
<hi>Eph. 4. 8, 11, 12. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 28. with 1.—having discussed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Gifts, the Apostle there sheweth to whom especially they
are given. 3. The ordinary Ministers of the Gospel, have their
interest in these Gifts, and a share of them (tho' differently) as
well as the extraordinary: For both sorts are mentioned in both the
places last cited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. 4. The Spirit is given to Ministers, and people; as for
other supplies, so to assist them in right managing the work of
Prayer; and that not only to assist as to the manner of praying,
or praying Graces, and Affections; but as to the matter of Prayer,
to furnish the mind with fit and pertinent P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tions, <hi>Rom. 8. 26. The
Spirit</hi> not only <hi>helpeth our Infirmities by making intercession with Groans,</hi>
but on account that <hi>we know not what to Pray for as we ought.</hi> The
Spirit also giveth utterance, <hi>Act. 2. 4. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 5. 5. It is the
will of Jesus Christ, that his Ministers should make use of the Gifts
that he hath given for their proper ends; to wit, the Edification
of the <hi>Church,</hi> that they should pray for them, improve them, and
use them; yea, lean to the help of the Spirit, not to the Book for
helping their Infirmities. This is clear from, <hi>Rom. 12. 6. 2 Tim.</hi>
1. 6. Ministers must give account to their Master, of the Use and
Improvement of their Gifts: this is clear, not only from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:95366:122"/>
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 19. Tho' <hi>Theologica Parabolica</hi> is said not to be <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentativa;</hi>
yet none denyeth, that an Argument may be brought
from the Scope of a Parable; which here is to shew, that God will
reckon with men about their using, and improving what he entrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them with. But the thing is evident of it self; for this giving
of Gifts to Men, cannot be imagined to be, that men may use them
or not, as they will; or as other men will; but for the ends they
were given for. 7. It is Christ's appointment, that none should
be in the Ministery, but Gifted Men: they must be apt to teach,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. That is fit for their work, in all the parts of it. 8. The
Imposing of set Forms doth hinder the exercise of the Gifts that
Ministers have received, and so hindereth that Edification, that the
Church should receive by that means. This cannot be denyed, when
ever they use set Forms; there is no use of these Gifts. All these
put together, may warrant us to conclude, that imposing of set
Forms on Ministers of the Gospel, is a restraining; yea, in a great
measure, a making void, of these Gifts that are given them to
profit with all. I conclude this with the opinion of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> that
<hi>to bind men to Set and Prescript Forms of Prayers, doth derogate from
that liberty that Christ hath given them. Full. Ch. Hist. lib. 3. cent.

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. The Proof of the second thing that I undertake; to
wit, That it is unlawful for Ministers to submit to such a restraining
of their Gifts by such Impositions as was mentioned. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from what hath been already discoursed; all the Arguments
for the former Assertion do also prove this, for they ought not to
worship God in a manner, that is neither warranted by any neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
nor by Christ's allowance, that were to worship God by the
Prescript of Mans Will alone. Neither is it lawful to serve God
in the way, that the <hi>Apostate used</hi> used; but was never used by the
<hi>Church</hi> in her best times: Nor ought we to cross the design of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by our way of praying; nor to make void the Gifts given to
profit the <hi>Church</hi> by. All which, this way of being Tied up to set
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orms, hath been proved to be guilty of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. The next thing to be proved, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur sixth Proposition; to
wit, That it is unlawful to worship God by a Frame of Service,
that is not warranted in the word, both as to its matter, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
This I prove, 1. From Christ's condemning the <hi>Traditions of
Men</hi> as <hi>vain Worship, Mat.</hi> 15. 9. They taught these <hi>Traditions,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95366:122"/>
e. i.</hi> saith <hi>Lucas Burgensis, in locum;</hi> they followed them, and taught
others to follow them. The same Author calleth these <hi>Mens Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi>
that, are so of men; that they are not of God; or are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised,
by Man, <hi>ibid.</hi> So also <hi>Vat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>blus, Erasmus, Maldonate, Tirinus,
Piscator, Calvin</hi> and <hi>Chemintius</hi> say, here is meant, whatever is
brought into Religion without the Word. Now it is mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>est, that
a Frame of Divine Service, not warranted in the word, falleth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this general head. 2. The Lord condemneth all Worship of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
up to him, that he hath not commanded, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 31. where
not being commanded, but devised by Men, is made the Ground on
which that practice (though otherwise evil also) is condemned.
And <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Frame and way of Service is condemned, because
<hi>devised (Heb.</hi> created) <hi>of his own Heart,</hi> 1 King. 12. 33. 3. Even
Reason teacheth that God ought to chuse how He will be Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or Worshipped by his Creatures. He best knoweth what will
please him; and His Soveraignty in all things must especially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in this, that Himself is so nearly concerned in. This is a
Principle so rooted in Nature, that among the Heathens, they that
contrived their Liturgies, or ways of Worship, behoved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Revelation from their Gods, to guide them in this. It was
never heard of among the more religious <hi>Heathens,</hi> that Religion,
or the manner of worshipping their Gods, was injoined only by
mans Authority, and devised only by him. Yea, in the so much
magnified <hi>Rozary of the Virgin Mary;</hi> it is alledged, that St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us</hi>
had it revealed by the Virgin her self, that this form of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
was most acceptable to her; and it is added, That <hi>she was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to chuse what way she would be Worshipped:</hi> I hope they, and such
as Symbolize with them, in ordering of the Worship of God, will
give us leave to say the same of her Blessed Son. 4. For the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Worship, I think it will not be questioned, whether that
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st be appointed by God or not; otherwise the five Popish Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
that they have added to Christs wo, could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
and men might make an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> kind of Action, as Dancing,
Walking, Leaping, to be religious worship. And even the Frame,
Composure, or mode of Divine Worship should have Divine
Warrant; otherwise it is not Acceptable to God. The Lord hath
appointed in his House, as Acts of his Worship, Reading Scripture,
Preaching Praying, Praising, Baptism, and the Lords Supper; and
the Service that we offer up to him in our Assemblies; should be
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95366:123"/>
an orderly performance of these. But when Men devise a Frame of
Service, which is none of these, distinctly and orderly performed;
but all of them confusedly jumbled together, and some modes of their
own added to them. This Mode or Frame of divine worship the
Lord hath not warranted; there is no example of it in Scripture,
nor in the purest and first times of the Gospel; and therefore we
ought not to worship God in such a manner. I hope it will not be
asserted by our Brethren, that it is in the power of the <hi>Church</hi> to
cast the divine Offices (as they speak) into what Frame or Mould
they will; to make it look like a Theatrical Show, if they like that
way, and think some carnal minds will be taken with it; and if this
be granted; then it followeth, that there may be a Frame of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
unlawful as to the manner of it; which it may be a Sin for
people to join in. I do not say, that the order of religious Acts in
the publick Assemblies is fixed; so as we may not begin either with a
Psalm or Prayer, or Exhortation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but there is an order to
be observed; and there may be a sinful swerving from it, which we
are obliged to shun.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. The last thing to be proved, is, That the <hi>Liturgy</hi> now
under debate is unwarranted; and that it is unlawful to join in
worshipping God by it: For this I bring five Reasons, 1. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of God for reading the word in the Assembles of his people,
is by this Service much perverted; for the Scripture is read in a
very corrupt Translation; following the <hi>vulgar Latin</hi> Translation,
as the <hi>Papists</hi> do, as may be shewed in many instances, where the
Sense of the Hebrew or Greek Text, is either contradicted, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storted
Additions are made to the Scripture; as the <hi>5th. 6th.</hi> and
<hi>7th. verses</hi> of <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. are not in the Hebrew. Many Chapters of
the Bible are never read in the <hi>Church</hi> at all; and instead of them,
humane Writings: Yea, which contain fabulous things, as <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticus
44. Judith 9. Tobit</hi> 5. much more also of <hi>Apocripha</hi> is
read as the Word of God. Yea, with justling out the Word
of God. This we judge a depraving of God's Ordinance.
These <hi>Apocriphical</hi> writings, tho they be not said to be divine
Scripture; yet they are so placed with it, and in its stead,
and no hint given of their humane Original; that the people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but look on them as Scripture; yea, wise men have ground to
judge that they were so look'd on by the first contrivers of that
Frame of Service, I mean the <hi>Papists.</hi> Some Scriptures are so read,
as the reading of them with express reference to such occasion, as
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:95366:123"/>
they are in the Book, appropriate to, is an abusing and mis-apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them; as on the Festivity of <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Archangel,</hi> is read,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 7. as if <hi>Michael</hi> that fought with the Dragon, were not
Christ, but a created Angel. 2. It hath a great and scandalous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of superstition; if superstition it self can be separated from
its use in appropriating Scriptures to be read, to days, not only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
days, but such as they without warrant have separated from
other days, and made Holy, and restraining Ministers from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such portions of Scripture to the people, as suit the present
case of them, or of the <hi>Church,</hi> also the appointing one piece to be
said in the Desk, another at the Altar; one with the Ministers Face
to the people, another with his Face to the East, and his Back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the People; the many changes of postures, sitting, standing,
kneeling, bowing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we cannot perswade our selves, that such a
Mode of worship is appointed by Christ, Was ever practised in the
purer times of the <hi>Church,</hi> or is acceptable to God.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. The Frame or Composure of it is unwarranted, unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedented
in Scripture, and the purer Antiquity, and unsuitable to
so holy an Action, as is Gospel Worship; as appeareth, in the jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of Prayer, and reading Scripture together; so many short
Collects, two or three Lines, and then reading; then another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Prayer, and then of Scripture; also the <hi>Responds,</hi> tossing the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
between Minister and People, and the Clerk and Minister;
the mutual Salutations; the <hi>Letany,</hi> of Hethenish Original; like
<hi>O Baal hear us,</hi> reiterated so often; and other repeating of the same
things so often, as is nauseous to serious worshippers of God: We
dare not worship God in a way that is so unlike to any worship,
that we read of among his people; and that is so <hi>Theatrical</hi> and
<hi>Pompous.</hi> 4. Several passages in it are not sound; others have a
great appearance of unsoundness; and others are unwarrantable.
There is a Prayer, <hi>that We with this our Brother</hi> (the Man to be Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried)
<hi>and all our Brethren departed, may have perfect Consummation:</hi>
Where the Dead are prayed for; and it is supposed that every one
that dyeth is Saved: The words have that appearance; they pray
to be kept from all deadly Sin. It hath an hew at least, of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the distinction of <hi>Mortal</hi> and <hi>Venial</hi> Sins: They pray to be
delivered from several dangers and Afflictions, which there is no

that are ordinary.</p>

30, 31. I hope it will not be denyed by our Brethren, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
are <hi>Idolaters;</hi> and that this Service is a Symbolizing with them,
is too evident, which may appear, 1. If we consider the Manner
and Frame of this Service, and compare it with the <hi>Mass:</hi> It is
true, they differ in that this is in <hi>English,</hi> that in <hi>Latin;</hi> and that
some parts of the <hi>Mass</hi> are left out; but otherwise they are as like
to one another, as one thing can be to another; and this was not
denyed by our Reformers, who professed that their design in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
this <hi>Service,</hi> was to bring <hi>Papists</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> (tho' it
proved, after a while, rather a mean of carrying <hi>Protestants</hi> to the
<hi>Mass.)</hi> And King <hi>Edward 6th.</hi> with the Council, did affirm as much
in a Letter to the Rebels in the <hi>West,</hi> who had risen in defence of
<hi>Popery;</hi> saying, that the Service that now they had in <hi>English,</hi> was
almost the same that before they had in <hi>Latin.</hi> And any that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Bible, and the <hi>Mass,</hi> and this <hi>Service,</hi> may easily see that
there is a far greater Simitude between it and the <hi>Mass,</hi> than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
it and all the Worship of God, that the Scripture giveth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of, to have been practiced in the Apostolick <hi>Church.</hi> 2. This
may appear, if we consider the Original of this <hi>Service;</hi> it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of several <hi>Popish</hi> Books; the Prayers out of the <hi>Breviary,</hi>
the Sacraments, Burial, Matrimony, Visitation of the Sick, out of

of those Books, that were composed by the Orthodox Fathers of
the <hi>Church,</hi> and used in the primitive times. But this is no suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
defence; for, 1. Suppose that Frame of worship had so good
an Original; yet being now of late so grosly abused to <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
and being so like to the <hi>Idolatrous</hi> worship of the <hi>Papists,</hi> rather
than like Apostolick Worship; and we having departed from that
<hi>Church</hi> on good Grounds, why should we chuse their way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and in so doing, both differ from the primitive times, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
the Apostles times, and from all other <hi>Reformed Churches?</hi>
2. It is false, that this Frame of <hi>Service</hi> was composed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;

did compose this Frame, or any thing like it, is denyed; and I

                     </gap> other Terms of <hi>Communion,</hi> that his <hi>Church</hi> imposeth,

Answerers with remaining in Generals, and pretending that <hi>they
judge, they esteem,</hi> the <hi>Terms of Communion</hi> unlawful; but bring no
particular Arguments to prove the unlawfulness of them. He
saith, <hi>Protestants</hi> do not do so when they charge the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>
with unlawful <hi>Terms of Communion.</hi> The Answer to this is easie,
1. They were charged with <hi>Separation,</hi> and in answering the Dr's
Sermon, acted the part of Defendants; it was enough for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to plead that they did not <hi>Separate</hi> without good Ground, and

resume all the Controversie about the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
2. Our Party have given abundant proof of the reasonableness of
their scrupling at these things; the Books above mentioned against

our <hi>Separating;</hi> that there ought to be no <hi>Separation,</hi> where there
is agreement in Doctrine and Substantial parts of Worship; and
that this Agreement is acknowledged in our case. He saith Mr. <hi>A.</hi>
denyeth such Agreement both in Doctrine (of this I have given
my judgment above, <hi>Part 2. S. 1. Section,</hi> 2. also in Substantial
parts of Worship, and alledged the <hi>Cross</hi> in Baptism, to be a
Substantial part of Worship: Hence the <hi>Dr.</hi> undertaketh, <hi>p.</hi> 335.
1. To shew what he meaneth by Substantial parts of Worship.
2. That the <hi>Cross</hi> is not made such. The <hi>Dr.</hi> seemeth to lay some
weight on this distinction of parts of Worship, to wit; <hi>Substantial</hi>
and <hi>Circumstantial,</hi> or <hi>Accidental;</hi> and alledgeth that many of us
are misled, by not considering it. I much desire the clearing of
it, and therefore resolve carefully to observe what he saith, and
shall be ready to receive Light. He saith, that, <hi>The Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
great Principle is, That what ever was any ways intended or
designed for the Worship of God, was a Real and Substantial part of
his Worship; and when their Adversaries told them, that Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
was needful to make a part of Worship; they said, that made
True Worship, but without it an Act might be Worship, that is, False
Worship; and yet they allow'd the Application of common Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
to Acts of Worship.</hi> This Subject I have discoursed at large,
in the Book above cited, <hi>cap. 3. sect.</hi> 1, 3, 4. But shall now a
little consider, what representation the <hi>Dr.</hi> is pleased to make of
our Principles. 1. I know no <hi>Nonconformist</hi> that ever asserted
that all that was intended or designed for Worship, was Worship,
either Real or Substantial; for they well know, that the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place,
the Ministers Maintenance, the Pulpit, Communion-Table,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are designed for Worship, and yet are no Worship,
Real nor Imaginary, Substantial nor Accidental, True nor False.
If he mean by being designed for Worship; that the person doing
such an Act, intendeth to Worship God by so doing (which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
take to be his meaning); I hope himself will acknowledg
that though such a design is needful to make an act of Worship
acceptable; yet Worship may be without it, else the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
might have fallen down before the Image, keeping their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to themselves, without the guilt of the external act of
<hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. I observe here, 2. That the <hi>Dr.</hi> confoundeth his own
distinction, by jumbling together the terms of <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Substantial</hi>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:95366:126"/>
Worship: To <hi>real</hi> Worship, must be opposed that which is no
Worship, or but such in imagination: To <hi>substantial</hi> Worship,
must be opposed that which is <hi>circumstantial,</hi> or <hi>accidental</hi> Worship.
This is as if we should distinguish <hi>Eus in substantiam, &amp; accidens;</hi>
and speaking of the first Member of the Division, call it, <hi>substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi>
or <hi>eus reale,</hi> which comprehendeth both <hi>substantia</hi> and <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</hi>
Let the <hi>Dr.</hi> then tell us plainly, whether by <hi>substantial</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
he mean all that is <hi>really</hi> Worship, or is truly Worship, <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Metaphysica,</hi> though it be not so, <hi>Veritate Theologica.</hi> And if
this be his Meaning, what needed such a distinction of Worship?
Had it not been as easie to deny the Ceremonies, in debate, to be
Worship, or any part of Worship, as others of his Party do?
What needed he blame the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> for want of Clearness
and Distinction in this matter, when himself hath confounded it?
I see no use of this his clear Notion, but to confound the debate, and
hide the nakedness of his Cause. We say, the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are parts
of Worship, though false Worship; others of his Party say, they
are no Worship, but meer Circumstances of Worship: The <hi>Dr.</hi>
will clear the Matter, by telling us, That they are accidental Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
but not <hi>real</hi> nor <hi>substantial</hi> Worship: Let any, that hath a
cleer sight, judge, whether this be a clearing or a confounding of this
Matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. The <hi>Dr.</hi> will now <hi>(p. 336.) seriously consider this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
because he designeth not to confute, but to convince the</hi> Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists;
and his work for this end, is, <hi>To find out a plain discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Difference between substantial parts of Divine Worship, and meer
accidental Appendices; and this,</hi> he saith, <hi>may more disintangle scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Minds, than the multiplying of Arguments, to prove the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Ceremonies.</hi> I doubt not of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s good design, in
this debate, but he is not very like to attain it by such Methods, as
is this proposing a distinction to clear the Subject in dispute, and
then confound the Terms; and then at last, as he doth here, to
over-turn it wholly; for here he calleth the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> meer <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
Appendices</hi> of Worship; that is, no Worship, nor parts of
Worship at all. But let him call them what he will, we strive not
about Names; we maintain, that they are parts of Worship, (but
parts of false Worship) and in such a Religious State, as nothing
but the Institutions of <hi>Christ</hi> can lawfully have; in that they are
used in <hi>Religion appropriated</hi> to it, designed for the <hi>Honouring of
GOD</hi> by them, for the bettering of Religious Actions, and for
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:95366:126"/>
the Religious end of edifying the Souls of them that use them:
These Qualities are in the <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> and if these conjoined, do
not make an Action to be Religious, and a part of Worship,
(they belonging to no other part of Religion) I know not what
can make a thing to be an Act of Worship; for to say, that nothing
can be a Religious Act, but what hath Divine Institution, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that there can be such a thing as an <hi>external</hi> Act of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or
<hi>Superstition.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. In pursuance of this Enquiry, and to find out this plain
and discernable difference between <hi>substantial</hi> parts of Worship,
and <hi>accidental Appendices</hi> of it: The <hi>Dr.</hi> bringeth several things
agreed on both sides; they are five in number; I shall not repeat
them, nor except against them, save that I wish he had shewed in
the Second of them, how these things under the Law, that by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Institution, became parts of Worship, were of themselves <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi>
and <hi>Ceremonial:</hi> I rather think that without divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it was unlawful to use them as <hi>Rites</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in <hi>Gods</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
He cometh now, <hi>Sect. 27. To find out the Marks of Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to satisfie the Conscience of the Difference between Innocent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and superstitious parts of Divine Worship.</hi> Here is yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Face of our <hi>Proteus</hi>-like distinction, but I wave that, finding
that the <hi>Dr.</hi> cannot make it appear, that there is any part of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
that is not <hi>substantial</hi> and <hi>real</hi> Worship; and that all that is a
part of Worship, is, even by him, looked on as <hi>superstitious,</hi> if
it be not appointed by divine Authority: For his Notion of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Ceremonies,</hi> I apprehend not his Meaning by this Term, <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
Appendices</hi> of Worship he calleth them before, which also
needeth a Commentary. If he mean natural Circumstances, I
know these may be very innocent, and yet not instituted: But a
<hi>Ceremony</hi> (as I have shewed in the before cited <hi>Vindic. of Purit.</hi>
C. 3. <hi>Sect. 3.)</hi> is properly a thing in <hi>Statu Religioso,</hi> or appropriate
to Religion, but no natural part of Worship; and therefore I see
not how it can be innocent, unless instituted: For <hi>accidental Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendices</hi>
of Worship, if they be any thing beyond natural and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Circumstances determined by natural or civil Custome, I see
not how these either can be innocent, unless instituted. I humbly
conceive, the <hi>Dr.</hi> hath hitherto brought little light into this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
but rather Darkness and Confusion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. Seeing we cannot agree about these Notions, let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
if we can, to concert the thing. He telleth us of Two ways,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:95366:127"/>
by which Ceremonies may become parts of Worship; 1. <hi>By sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
them to be necessary, and pleasing to GOD, without a humane
Law imposing them. 2. By supposing them unalterable.</hi> We need
not debate with the <hi>Dr.</hi> whether things become parts of Worship,
and so superstitious, when not instituted by these two ways or not:
But all this Discourse is wide from the purpose, unless he make it
appear, that no uninstituted thing can be a part of Worship, nor su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,
but by one of these Two Means: Or if we can make
it appear, that without both these Opinions of men, about the
Things that they use in Worship, without Institution, they may
be guilty of false Worship, or Superstition; which I here do
briefly, because I have done it sufficiently, in the place cited against
Mr. <hi>Ritshell,</hi> who objected the same thing, in defence of the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi>
that the <hi>Dr.</hi> now doth. 1. If this were true, there could
be no external Act of false Worship, without an Erroneous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Mind; but that is absurd, for then a man, who, to shun
Persecution, should fall down before an <hi>Idol,</hi> and in Words and
Gestures, do all that <hi>Idolaters</hi> do, should not be guilty of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Act of <hi>Id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>latry;</hi> yea, it would follow, that is, the <hi>Church</hi>
should erect a Statue, and impose it as a necessary <hi>Term of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
with her, that her Members should once a week kneel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Statue, and pray to <hi>GOD,</hi> and then kiss that Statue,
with a reverend Bow, when, mean while, the <hi>Church</hi> declareth that
this is not commanded out of an Opinion that such kneeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
is antecedently pleasing to <hi>GOD;</hi> nor that this their Command is
unalterable, nor binding to all; nor that the things commanded,
are unalterable, and so binding; but only the Church judgeth this
decent and fit to adorn the other parts of Worship: I say in this
case, this bowing, should be innocent <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and no Act of
false Worship; which, I think, will hardly go down with the
greatest <hi>Ceremony</hi>-Mongers: And, in a word, let us but receive
this one Principle, that there is no false Worship without such
Opinion, as he mentioneth; and men may do what they will, and
the <hi>Church</hi> impose what she will, in the Worship of <hi>GOD,</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they keep a right Opinion about the nature of these things; so
that it is no more our concern to look to Scripture, that we may
learn how to order the external Worship of <hi>GOD,</hi> but to look to
our Opinion, that it be not faulty: And by this means, there are
few of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that ever <hi>Papists,</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> used, but a
<hi>Church</hi> sound in the Faith, and in opinion about Superstition,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:95366:127"/>
might bring them into the Worship of <hi>GOD,</hi> which is to open
the door for <hi>Ceremonial Worship</hi> a little too wide, in the opinion of
most sound Divines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Another Exception I make against the <hi>Dr.</hi> Two ways,
how an Act becometh superstitious, is, let them (especially the
first of them) be applyed to our <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and I doubt not, but
even what himself hath said, might condemn them; for however
the pliable People that use the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> because commanded by
the <hi>Church,</hi> and see no antecedent necessity, or goodness in them,
may by this means be acquitted from Superstition; the <hi>Church</hi> that
imposeth them, cannot be so innocent; for either the <hi>Church</hi> must
have reason for this Imposition, or none, but, <hi>sic volo, sic jubeo,
sit pro ratione Voluntas.</hi> The Latter, I hope, the <hi>Dr.</hi> will not say,
lest by purging his <hi>Church</hi> of Superstition, he make her guilty of
as great a Crime; <hi>to wit,</hi> being Lords over <hi>GOD</hi>'s Heritage,
and <hi>Church-Tyrants.</hi> If he say the Former, this Reason must be,
that these things are needful, that they please <hi>GOD:</hi> No, say
our Adversaries, the <hi>Churches</hi> Reason for imposing them, is, She
thinketh them decent, and edifying: But doth she not think this
<hi>Decency,</hi> and that <hi>Edification</hi> that is by them, to be antecedently
pleasing to <hi>GOD,</hi> and needful for the <hi>Church?</hi> If she do not, she
acteth by meer will; if she do, she is guilty of a superstitious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
in supposing uninstituted things in VVorship, to be pleasing
to <hi>GOD,</hi> antecedentally to a humane Law; for if the use of
them be pleasing to <hi>God,</hi> so must the things, out of which that
usefulness doth result. And indeed, it may abundantly appear,
to the Conviction of all unbyassed Men, what opinion of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of these <hi>Ceremonies</hi> our Bishops have, when they appoint them
by their Canons, impose them with Rigour and Severity, punish the
Neglect of them with such Violence; and when they force them
upon the Consciences of them, who agree with themselves in all
things else; and when they make such distractions and divisions in
the <hi>Church,</hi> rather than lay aside these things. Can any man of
common sense, whose reason is not fetter'd by Prejudice and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
judge, that men who act so, have no opinion of the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Goodness of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or that they do not think them
pleasing to <hi>God?</hi> He that thinketh otherwise, can think what he
will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. I come now to examine what the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> saith in defence of
these Two things, which he requireth to make an uncommanded Act in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:95366:128"/>
Worship to be superstitious. The <hi>1st.</hi> is, <hi>That it be supposed to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and pleasing to God, and the omission of it unpleasing to God, antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to a humane Law.</hi> All the proof that he bringeth of what he saith,
is, that <hi>the Observations that Christ condemned in the</hi> Pharisees, <hi>had no
other evil in them, nor were condemned on any other account, but because of
this Opinion that they had about them, (as</hi> Grocius <hi>observeth) that Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing unclean, by Law, did communicate uncleanness to Soul
and Body, and that Washing did cleanse both; on which supposition,
they thought this Washing pleasing to God.</hi> Three things I here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
before I come to answer the <hi>Drs.</hi> Proofs of this his Allegation.
1. All this is nothing to our purpose, unless it can be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that Christ condemneth only their erroneous Opinion, and
not the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Practise; or that they might Lawfully have added these
Religious observations, to these that the Lord had appointed in
his Law, provided they had no opinon of the antecedent necessity
of the things which is so far from being proved, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is evident, for our Lord doth expresly Condemn the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
of these things <hi>Mark, 7. 8. Ye hold the Tradition of men,
as the Washing of Pots and Cups, and many other such things do ye.</hi>
Their <hi>Doing,</hi> not their <hi>Thinking</hi> only, is condemned; Will any
man say, that if any of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> should have laid aside that
Opinion that the <hi>Dr.</hi> imputeth to them, and look'd on these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
as of no necessity, antecedent to the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
and yet observed them Carefully and Religiously, that such
a one had sufficiently complyed with Christ's Doctrine? no, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for the Controversy between the <hi>Disciples</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> was
not about Thinking, but about Doing; the Disciples not only were
not of their Opinion, but abstained from their Practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. It is evident from <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 9, 10. that the Apostle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
the observation of the old Jewish <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> though
it is clear, that he is mainly disputeing against their opinion of
Justification by works, and these among other works; yet this
doth not hinder the practice of these, abstracted from that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be evil, it being expresly condemned; wherefore it is not
enough that our practice, in Gods Worship, be not built on a
bad opinion; but it self must have warrant from God. 2. Christ
in that debate is mainly dealing with the Imposers of these <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi>
the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who continued that Yoak on the People, that
their Ancestors had laid on them; and therefore it is no wonder
that he took notice of a perverse opinion in them, which moved
them so to impose on the People, whereas the people that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
might be moved only by the authority of their Guides; hence
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95366:128"/>
he calleth them <hi>their Traditions,</hi> because they continued them,
and put new life in them, by their Authority. The parallel then still
holdeth between our Case and theirs, as they behoved to have some
undue esteem of these washings that made them Impose them with
the same (yea more) Zeal than that with which they enjoyned the
Ordinances of God; so there must be in our <hi>Church</hi>-Guides, some
apprehension of Good in the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> more than is meet, that
maketh them not only intermix them with Divine Worship, but
impose them with equal (if not superiour) Zeal, with the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God. 3. Any variation of their opinion about their
Washings, from our opinion about our <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
ariseth from the difference that is between their <hi>Church</hi> and
Ordinances, and ours; and so cannot make their imposition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
if ours be lawful; for God had appointed Washings, for
removing of <hi>Ceremonial</hi> uncleanness, which affected both Soul and
Body; <hi>to wit,</hi> at the touching of the Dead, or any unclean thing;
and all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Jews</hi> knew, that antecedently to the Command, no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ould be contracted by these Touches, nor removed by
these Washings. The <hi>Rabbies,</hi> in the Apostate State of that <hi>Church,</hi>
added such like observations to Gods, out of a desire of more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
strictness, and that their purity might be more conspicuous;
knowing well, that before the Command, these things were in the
same state, that the other things were in, before God's Command.
Just so doth our <hi>Church;</hi> God hath instituted some <hi>Ceremonies</hi> for
his own Honour, and Edification of his People; so as we all know,
that antecedently to his command, they were indifferent things,
as Water, Bread, and Wine; and the <hi>Church</hi> not content with
these, add some other <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> for further honouring of God;
<hi>to wit,</hi> making his Worship more decent, and further edification,
stirring up the dull minds of men; yet protesting, that antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to their command, these things are indifferent. Is not here
an exact parallel; if it be said, that the <hi>Rabbies</hi> thought the things
that they enjoyned, to be comprehended under God's commanded
Worship, before they enjoyned them; this is denyed, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is evident, from Christ's Reasoning with them; he all along
maketh a distinction between <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Command,</hi> and their <hi>Tradition:</hi>
which they might easily have objected against, if they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
a Command of God, for the things that they by Tradition
imposed.</p>

                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:95366:129"/>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. In order to the proving his Opinion in this matter, he saith,
<hi>p.</hi> 339. that, <hi>the Reason of Christ</hi>'s <hi>opposing the</hi> Pharisees <hi>was, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a thing in it self unnecessary was determined by their Superiors, but
because of the superstitious opinion that the</hi> Pharisees <hi>had about these
Washings.</hi> Here is a wrong state of the Question hinted; we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
quarrelled with superiours for determining a thing in it self
unnecessary; we know they may determine this Time, and that
Place of Worship, and yet neither of these in it self is necessary,
seeing another time or place may do as well. But the Question
is, whether Superiors may determine a thing, that is not at all
needful to be determined? as the Habit, Gesture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
this their determination to Religious Worship, that so it
shall be done in Worship, though it be not so done in other Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and this without warrant from the Lord, whom we Worship.
His Proofs, that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were condemned only because of
their superstitious opinion (and if this <hi>only</hi> be not understood by the
<hi>Dr.</hi> he speaketh not to the point in hand) are two. <hi>From the
force of our Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Reasoning:</hi> Thus then he argue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>

                     <hi>p. 340.
He proveth that they set up their Tradition above the Law of God;
as in the Vow Corban. (The force of which Argument extendeth to all
that they observed, because of the Tradition of their Ancestors) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they thought these things pleasing to God, and that mens Consciences
were strictly obliged to observe them.</hi> This is the sum of the <hi>Drs.</hi>
Argument. To which the Answer is obvious; <hi>to wit,</hi> that this doth
not at all prove, that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> thought these things obliging,
antecedently to their <hi>Tradition,</hi> which is the only thing in Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Christ's Reasoning proveth no more, but that they had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
esteem of their own Authority, and did (upon the matter)
equal it with, if not prefer it, to that of God; by laying such
stress on things that stood meerly on their Authority; but he doth
not so much as hint, that they thought these things antecedently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeing,
or that the omitting of them would have defiled the
Conscience, though there had been no such <hi>Tradition.</hi> Is not
our Case parallel to theirs in this? VVe say, the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
not, there is no Sin in not observing them, nor Indecency in
not using them, antecedently to the Law; so did the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of
their Washings; and if they were Zealous for their Washings,
are not ye so, to as great a degree, for your <hi>Ceremonies</hi> when
imposed? what disobedience, ungovernableness, contempt of the
Worship of God, and indecency in it, are we charged with? and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:95366:129"/>
we are prosecuted with more rigour for neglect of these, than
others are for the highest Immoralities. Is not this to prefer your
<hi>Tradition</hi> to God's Law? Do not ye make void the Law of God,
neglecting Love, studying Unity, Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for these your
<hi>Traditions?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. But saith the <hi>Dr. The Pharisees thought a mans Conscience
defiled, if he did not observe the</hi> Traditions, <hi>as appears by Christ's
subsequent Discourse, shewing what it is that defileth a man, and what
not. A.</hi> This they thought, only because they had put these things
in that state, by their <hi>Tradition,</hi> but never taught that these things
would have defiled the man if there had been no such <hi>Tradition;</hi>
and do not our Brethren think, that omitting the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
defileth a man? Do they not think the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> have
need of Repentance and Pardon for their <hi>Non-conformity:</hi> If they
think not so, why do they so blame, and prosecute them? The
<hi>Dr.</hi> concludeth, <hi>p.</hi> 341. That the main thing in question, was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this <hi>Ceremony</hi> of washing hands, could be omitted without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileing
the Conscience, otherwise, saith he, our Saviour's Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<hi>doth not reach the Question.</hi> This is a great Mistake (though it
were no hazard to our Cause to grant it) for this Question was
but consequential to another; <hi>to wit,</hi> Whether the <hi>Church</hi> had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to institute <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> such as Christ had not instituted; and
then charge People with sin, and not keeping a good Conscience,
for not observing them: This was the main Question, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by his reproving them for making such <hi>Traditions,</hi> and for
bringing the Commandments of men into God's Worship: Our
Saviours Conclusion that he speaketh of; <hi>to wit,</hi> his discourse about
what defileth a man, is not the thing he first intended to prove; <hi>to
wit,</hi> by his reproving them for their <hi>Traditions;</hi> for the Conclusion
of that Argument, is, <hi>That men ought not to teach for Doctrines, the
Comman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ments of men,</hi> i. e. institute in Worship, what Christ hath
not instituted: But this discourse, about what defileth a man, is
a Consequence drawn from that Conclusion; <hi>to wit,</hi> That things,
so forbidden, may be forborn without sin; and that it is transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of God's Command, not of mans, that defileth the Conscience;
wherefore there is no ground for what the <hi>Dr.</hi> saith, that Christ
condemned them, not meerly with respect to the Command of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
(understand a Command of Superiours bringing into
the Worship of God, what was not instituted by God; otherwise,
it reacheth not our Question) for condemning the <hi>Traditions</hi> of

<hi>p. 342. for this he sheweth, That Mr.</hi> A. <hi>himself quoteth several Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages

                        </gap>n as an indifferent</hi> Ceremony, <hi>but as a thing, whose omission brought
guilt on the Conscience.</hi> The former Answer doth fully take away
the force of all that he here discourseth; <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> thought
the Conscience defiled by such omission, after the thing was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the Authority of the <hi>Church,</hi> not before; so our <hi>Prelatists</hi>
in reference to the <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> Wherefore, Mr. <hi>A. is far from
overturning all the rest of his Discourse, by this one saying,</hi> as the <hi>Dr.</hi>
alleadgeth. I well know, what Sanctity the <hi>Rabbies</hi> placed in the
strict Observance of these things, and therefore I contradict none
of his Citations out of them: But all this Sanctity they founded,
not only natural, or antecedent goodness of the things observed,
but on the great duty of Obedience to the Orders of the <hi>Church,</hi> in
which our Brethren are not much inferiour to them. He telleth
us, that they said, <hi>Whosoever disesteemeth this Custom, deserveth not
only Excommunication, but Death too:</hi> and what less do the <hi>Prelatists</hi>
say of omitting the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> except that it is not yet made death
by the Law; though the cruel usage that many have met with on
this account, hath brought them to their death. I could tell you
of <hi>Rabbies</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

observing the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as ever the <hi>Jewish Rabbies</hi> did against not
observing their Washings. He admireth, <hi>p.</hi> 344. That Mr. <hi>A.</hi>
would make People believe, that this was no more but an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<hi>Ceremony</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and required for Order and Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as our <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are. <hi>A.</hi> He need not admire, for none of us
say so of that Washing, when imposed; and he cannot prove that
it was any other but indifferent to them before imposition, as our
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> are. That washing was not imposed for Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
as our <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are; a Reason of the difference is already
given; <hi>to wit,</hi> That it was an addition to Christ's <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> for
taking away Uncleanness: Ours are an addition to Christ's Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
for honouring Him, and edifying of Souls.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. He proceedeth, <hi>Sect.</hi> 28. to enlarge and enforce this
Truth, by considering the <hi>Popish Ceremonies,</hi> and their opinion of
washing away Sin, and Justification by them. And for this, he
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:95366:130"/>
citeth many Authors, all which pains might have been spared: For
this Argument doth not at all differ from what he hath said abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
the <hi>Jews</hi> opinion of their Washings, and needeth no other Answer.
All the Efficacy that <hi>Papists</hi> attribute to their <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
to, and dependent on, their being injoyned by the <hi>Church:</hi>
None of them say, that they have such Efficacy in themselves, and
that they attribute, taking away of sin, to them, ariseth from the
opinion they have of the Merit of good Works, which the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> doth not maintain. The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> maketh
them good Works, but denieth their Merit; because she denieth
that, even to the Works that God hath commanded: The <hi>Papists</hi>
do but make them good Works also, and that they think them me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious,
is from this their opinion, that all good Works are such,
and not from an opinion that they can do such Feats by any power
in themselves, without Institution. <hi>They ascribe spiritual Effects to
them,</hi> saith he; so do you to your <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> as, <hi>stirring up of dull
Minds, engaging the Soul to God,</hi> &amp;c. I think the <hi>Cross</hi> hath no
more Efficacy for this, without a Divine Institution, that it has to
drive away Devils, as the <hi>Papists</hi> alledge <hi>Amesius</hi> ought not to have
been charged with disingenuity, by the <hi>Doctor,</hi> on this ground. He
doth not equal the Evil of the <hi>English Ceremonies,</hi> with these of <hi>Rome,</hi>
but that this <hi>Church</hi> hath no more power to make them Religious
Rites, than that hath to make them Causes of Grace. He telleth
us, <hi>pag.</hi> 346. That our <hi>Church</hi> receiveth them no otherwise, than
as purged from <hi>Popish Superstition;</hi> and for this, citeth <hi>Praef.</hi> to
<hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Can. 30. Answer.</hi> Neither the <hi>Dr.</hi> nor his
<hi>Church</hi> will be condemned, if they may be their own Judges; it is
<hi>Amicum Testimonium.</hi> I confess they have purged out much <hi>Popish
Superstition</hi> out of them, but to purge out all, is impossible: The
things themselves, as stated in the Worship of God, without His
Institution, being such: Whatever the <hi>Dr.</hi> hath gained to his
Cause, by this Discourse, our Cause gaineth from it a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> viz. That these things (being unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in themselves) that have been so grosly abused to <hi>Idolatry</hi> and
<hi>Superstition,</hi> ought not to be brought into God's Worship, by them
who abhor that way; nor indeed, can they without much scandal:

Worship, he hath, <hi>pag.</hi> 347. viz. <hi>If they be supposed to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable,

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95366:131"/>
this he purgeth the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> from: What is already said,
doth abundantly refute this; for I have shewed that <hi>Ceremonies</hi> may
be parts (tho bad ones) of Worship, without this, and the former
too. And indeed, if this were necessary to make them parts of
Worship, none of the <hi>Popish Ceremonies</hi> were such; for the <hi>Pope</hi>
will not part with his Power of altering the Worship of God, as
he pleaseth, more than the <hi>English Convocation</hi> will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
there was never <hi>Church</hi> in the world, that held, That she

between the opinion of the <hi>Church</hi> about the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi>
and their Practice, in reference to them: If they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable,
why will ye rather ruine your Brethren, hazard Souls,

bind not all men, why is the Worship of other <hi>Churches</hi> so cryed
out upon, by many of your <hi>Church?</hi>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. The Reverend <hi>Dr. cometh now,</hi> Sect. 29. <hi>to examine the
Charge against the</hi> Church, and bringeth the Arguments of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
that tend to prove the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> to be parts of Worship,
and answereth them. It is here to be observed, that the Arguments
that he mentioneth, are but some of many, that we use against the
<hi>Ceremonies:</hi> And these, not they that are most directly against
them. Mr. <hi>A.</hi> Argueth thus: An outward visible Sign of inward
invisible Grace, whereby a Person is dedicated to a Profession of,
and Subjection to the Redeemer, is a substantial part of Worship.
The <hi>Dr.</hi> Answereth: <hi>An outward visible Sign, representing between
men, the duty or engagement of another, is no part, much less a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
part of Worship.</hi> I know not how this answereth the Argument,
or to what end it is brought; for the Argument speaketh of a Sign
dedicating us to the Redeemer, the answer of one mans duty to
another. I also wonder that the <hi>Dr.</hi> who a little above confounded
a real and substantial part of VVorship, should distinguish between
some part of it, which is all one with a real part, and a substantial
part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For further Answer, the</hi> Dr. <hi>distinguisheth a three-fold Sign:</hi>
1. Representing Gods Grace to us, as Sacraments. 2. Representing
mens subjection to God, these are parts of Worship. 3. Signs from men
to men, to repres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt some other thing, beside the bare Action, and these
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:95366:131"/>
are significant Ceremonies, such as is the Cross in Baptism, <hi>He saith
that,</hi> after the child is Baptised, the Cross is used in token that he
shall not be ashamed to confess the Faith of Christ Crucified. This
sign is made not to God, even as the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> used the
sign of the Cross as a declarative sign to man; it in Baptism repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
the Duty, not the Grace; that is ours, and we appoint the
sign for it; this God's, and he must appoint the sign for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. To this his Answer, I repone. 1. Sacraments do not
only represent Gods Grace to us, but our Duty to him; for they
are Seals of the Covenant, and the Covenant is mutual contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Promise of Grace from God, and our duty to Him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
a Sacrament, as it Sealeth both, doth also Represent both.
I wonder that the Learned <hi>Dr.</hi> for the sake of a few paultery <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi>
should thus mangle the use of the Sacraments of the <hi>New
Testament,</hi> when he cannot otherwise defend these <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> but
what will not men do or say to serve a design? 2. Signs repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
our Duty to God; are parts of Worship, he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
he meaneth representing to God that which is our Duty.
Now the <hi>Dr.</hi> should have told us what are these Signs that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
our Duty to God; it is like, he meaneth Prayer, Praises, and
such like; but these do not so much represent to God our Duty, as
offer it, or pay it to him: when I pay money to a man that I ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him; this is not a sign representing the mony to him which
is his due, but a giving of it to him: And indeed, we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a very unfit <hi>Catachresis</hi> be said to represent to God, by a sign,
what is our Duty. For, <hi>Signum</hi> (as <hi>Augustine</hi> defineth it) <hi>est res
praeter speciem quam sensibus ingerit aliud aliquid ex se faciens in cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem
venire.</hi> And all acknowledge, that it is essential to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a sign, to bring one to the knowledge of somewhat, which
cannot be applyed to God who knoweth all things actually, and
intuitively, at all times; beside, that a sign is a sensible thing,
and Senses are not to be ascribed to God, and therefore God
knoweth not any thing by signs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. 3. His thoughts seem to run very muddy in managing
this distinction; especially in explaining the third member of it,
<hi>Signs from men to men, representing some other thing than the bare
Action.</hi> VVhat meaneth he by this last Clause? do not all Signs
represent somewhat beside the bare Action, or beside themselves?
so that he here describeth his third Member of his distinction, by
the general notion of the thing distinguished, which is a great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:95366:132"/>
in <hi>Logick.</hi> 4. Signs are rather to be distinguished by their
Original, which giveth them a signification, or maketh them repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative,
than by the persons to whom they hold forth what
they signify; for every Sign doth represent the thing signified by
it, to all that can discern. Hence all who treat of Signs, use to
distinguish them in <hi>natural, customary</hi> and <hi>instituted,</hi> as having
their power to signify, or represent somewhat, either from their
<hi>nature,</hi> or from <hi>custom,</hi> or from <hi>institution,</hi> or they will of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser
of the signification; and this last sort they make to be <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi>
when they are appointed by God for their use of signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or representing somewhat, or <hi>Humane,</hi> when they are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by man. This distinction of Signs giveth some light, but I
know no use of the <hi>Drs.</hi> new Coined distinction, but to confound
the matter and serve a design. Now the <hi>Sacraments</hi> are Signs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by God to represent his Grace, and our Engagement, and
this is represented to our selves, and to all the world; the other
duties wherein we express our subjection to, and dependance on
God before all the world, and offer up our acknowledgments of
these to him; these are also appointed by him, and so are parts
of VVorship that are acceptable to him; for the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> they
are meerly humane Signs, appointed by man, and therefore they
are not acceptable VVorship; but that they are parts of VVorship, is
not from their Original, but from the Religious state that they are
placed in; they are Solemn Actions, done in and with the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
VVorship of God, and so appropriated to it, as that they
are not done but in it; they have all that could make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
act of VVorship, except Divine institution; they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for the same uses with true VVorship; <hi>viz.</hi> Honouring God,
and Edifying Men. On these Accounts they are to be accounted
parts of VVorship, and want of God's appointment doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that, otherwise there could be no false VVorship, neither can
their signifying to man, what they do signify, hinder it; for the
true VVorship of God doth that as hath been said.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 18. 5. The <hi>Dr.</hi> seemeth to lay some weight on this, that
the <hi>Cross</hi> is used after Baptism; but he will not deny; 1. That it
is used immediately after it, or rather conjoyned with it, as near
as two actions can be to one another. Nor, 2. VVill he deny that
it is included in, and not used after the complex action of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
which taketh in Instruction about the nature of Baptism,
Prayer and Thanksgiving; it is not after all this, and so it is sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:95366:132"/>
in, and mixed with this solemn piece of Religious VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and therefore must be a religious thing; it cannot possibly
be a civil right under such circumstances. 6. It was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to mention here the Antients use of the sign of the <hi>Cross,</hi> for
that was in War, or other civil Actions, which could have no
appearance of making it a <hi>Religious Ceremony.</hi> 7. That the
<hi>Cross</hi> in Baptism representeth the Duty, and not the Grace of
Subjection to the Redeemer, doth not hinder it to be a Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Sign; (though we never thought it a Sign of Grace, as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
are) for Sacraments represent, also our Duty, as hath
been shewed; and its being so conjoyned with the Sacrament;
maketh a shew as if men would by it represent that Grace by
which we must subject our selves to the Redeemer, which yet they
cannot do. VVhen men take upon them to add a new Sign to
the Sacramental Sign instituted by Christ, for representing the one
half of what is represented by Christ's Sign; <hi>viz.</hi> one part of the
Covenant there sealed which is subjection to, and owning of the
Redeemer, and put this their sign, in the same Religious state
with Christ's Sign, so as there is no difference between them, but
the Authority by which they are instituted; it may be warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
said that they make a Sacramental Sign, and that they make a
new Sacrament as far as man can make it. 8. That we may devise
a Sign to represent the Duty in Baptism, because the Duty is ours, as
God appointeth the Sign to represent the Grace, because that is his,
is a strange assertion; for that is to allow man an equal share with
God in instituting a Sacrament, in which both the Grace of God,
and the Duty of Man, or his engagement to his Duty, are sealed, and
represented. If <hi>Ceremonies</hi> must have such Divinity to defend them,
I shall be less in love with them than before.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 19. He denyeth, <hi>p.</hi> 349. that the <hi>Cross</hi> in Baptism, <hi>is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Church as a Sign of immediate Dedication to God, but of
Obligation on the person,</hi> and laboureth to clear the <hi>thirtieth Canon,</hi>
asserting the contrary, which saith, that <hi>by it the Infant is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the service of him who died on the Cross.</hi> VVhat he saith for
vindicating this Canon, is, that <hi>Baptism is compleat before Crossing,
and so it is no part of Baptismal dedication;</hi> and that, <hi>the Minister
Baptiseth in the Name of Christ, but signeth with the Cross in the name
of the Church, who by that Rite, receiveth the Infant into their number;</hi>
and thus understanding the use of the <hi>Cross,</hi> he saith, <hi>all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
about dedicating, covenanting Symbolical Sacramental Signs, will
appear to be of no force.</hi> Answer, 1. The <hi>Dr.</hi> would say something,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:95366:133"/>
by mentioning <hi>Immediate D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dication:</hi> and if what he intendeth by
it be to the purpose, it must be, that the <hi>Church</hi> may not institute
a Sign, whereby one is <hi>Immediately</hi> dedicated to God; but they
may institute one, whereby he is <hi>Immediately</hi> dedicated to God: Now
if the <hi>Dr.</hi> had given any hint of a ground for this distinction, or to
shew that the one is more lawful than the other, he would have obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
us; but that not being done his implyed distinction is to be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as without all ground. 2. <hi>A Sign of Obligation of the Person to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
himself to the Redeemer,</hi> used in a piece of Gods solemn Worship,
and appropriated to that Worship, is by its Signification, its End, its
concomitant Circumstances, so stated, as the using of that Sign cannot
but be a Religious Act, and so a part of God's VVorship, which (as
the <hi>Dr.</hi> himself confesseth) needeth Divine Institution, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lawfully be appointed by the Church. 3. I wonder why the
<hi>Dr.</hi> should endeavour to vindicate that <hi>Canon</hi> that he citeth, from
meaning what it expresly saith; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>by the sign of the Cross, the
Infant is dedicated to the service of him who Died on the Cross;</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to shun expounding this of a dedicating Sign without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the greatest violence Imaginable to the plain words, neither is
there the least shadow of ground, to think, that <hi>Immediate dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is not here meant, seeing the Infant is said to be dedicated by
this Sign, without the least hint of any intervenient dedicating sign,
or cause between the sign, and that which the <hi>Dr.</hi> will call <hi>Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Dedication.</hi> 4. VVhen he saith the <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ssing</hi> is no part of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal
dedication, the meaning must be, it is not a part of <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
by that Sign that Christ appointed; <hi>viz.</hi> Baptising in
the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, none doubteth
of that; but how doth this shew that it is no dedicating sign,
as the <hi>Canon</hi> saith; or no immediate dedicating sign, as the
<hi>Dr.</hi> alledgeth: It is a sign devised by men, to dedicate the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
added to the sign appointed by God for the same end. Now
our Question is, VVhat warrant have men for making such an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to so great an Ordinance of God? 5. The next thing for
vindicating the <hi>Canon</hi> is, that <hi>the Minister Baptiseth in the Name
of Christ; but Signeth in the Name of the Church,</hi> is as little for his
purpose: for who gave the <hi>Church</hi> Power to Institute a dedicating
Sign to be Administer'd in her name, and set it up by Christ's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating
Sign, to be Administer'd in his Name? This seemeth to
be an addition to Christ's Ordinance, and a reflection on it as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect;
as if the Child were not sufficiently dedicated to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
by Christ's Sign that he hath Instituted for that End.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:95366:133"/>
6. It doth least of all vindicate the <hi>Canon,</hi> which he addeth; to wit,
that by it (the sign of the <hi>Cross)</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> receiveth the Infant
into their number; for this is a quite other thing than the <hi>Canon</hi>
saith; and to make that the meaning of the <hi>Canon,</hi> is to take a liberty
to impose what meaning upon it he pleaseth. Let the Reader now
judge, whether by any thing that he hath said, all the difficulties
about Dedicating, Covenanting, Symbolical, Sacramental signs, do
appear to be of no force.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. He asketh, <hi>page 350. Why may not the Church appoint
such a rite of admission of one of her Members, declaring it to be no part
of Baptism? Answer.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> hath not appointed it as a rite
of admission of a Member, but a rite of dedicating the Person to
Christ as hath been shewed. And the reason why he may not do it,
is, because Christ hath already done it sufficiently: He hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Baptism both for dedicating the Person to himself, and for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
him into his <hi>Church:</hi> Therefore men ought not to contrive
their signs for that end, which he hath abundantly provided for, by
his own means. Another reason why this may not be done, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this sign is so stated in the Word of God, by being done in the
Solemn Exercise of it, for a Religious end; and appropriated to
this Religious Exercise, that it cannot be otherwise lookt on than as
a piece of Gods Worship. He parallelleth this with holding up the
hand, in an <hi>Independent-Church</hi> presently after Baptism, as a sign of
admission into that particular <hi>Church. Answer,</hi> 1. I know no warrant
for such an admitting rite, Baptism is sufficient to make one a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Christs <hi>Church,</hi> and that maketh one a Member of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Church,</hi> where Providence casteth his lot. 2. If <hi>Independents</hi>
should state this admitting rite in the very Solemnity of Baptism, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the complex action be finished, they were to be blamed, but they
do not so; they make an observable difference as to time, and other
circumstances, between these two actions. 3. Signing with the
<hi>Cross,</hi> is not a meer admitting sign into a particular <hi>Church,</hi> as shall
afterward be discoursed, but also a dedicating sign; as the <hi>Canon</hi>
expresly saith, and therefore this parallel is null.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 21. He next blameth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> for supposing, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
signing the Child, speaketh in the Name of Christ, or as his
Officer, and saith, it is evident that he doth it in the Name of the
<hi>Church;</hi> because he saith, <hi>We receive him into the Congregation of
Christs Flock, and do sign him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Answer,</hi> It is not material to
our debate, which of the Two be said; for the question is, Whether
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:95366:134"/>
the <hi>Church</hi> hath power to appoint a sign for dedicating a person to
Christ, when he hath already appointed a sign for that end? We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to see a warrant for the <hi>Churches</hi> appointing Dedication to Christ
by her sign, to be done in her name; after the person is already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
by Christs sign, and in His name. If he say the <hi>Church</hi> only
appoints him to be received by this sign into her number; and that
may be done in her name. I answer, by Christs sign that is also
done, by Baptism the person is admitted as a Member of <hi>Christs</hi>
Flock. But beside this, it is evident, that by the sign of the <hi>Cross</hi> is
not intended bare admission as a Member of the <hi>Church;</hi> but dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
of the person to Christ, not only from the plain words of the
<hi>Canon,</hi> of which already, but by what followeth in the words used
at the signing; which are, <hi>We receive him into the number of Christs
Flock, and do sign him with the sign of the Cross, in token that hereafter
he shall not be ashamed to confess the Faith of Christ Crucified, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to fight under his banner against Sin, the World, and the Devil, and
to continue Christs faithful Souldier</hi> and <hi>Servant, unto his lives end,
Amen.</hi> Will any man say that this is meer admission, as a Member
of the <hi>Church,</hi> or into the <hi>Church of England;</hi> and that no more is
intended by these words? Is it not made a sign of our Covenant,
or Engagement to the same duties that we are engaged to by Baptism?
To wit, all the duties that the Covenant of grace bringeth us under
the Obligation of. The absurdity of this notion; to wit, that <hi>Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
is meerly an admitting sign, will yet further appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that in the same office of Baptism, used by the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> the Minister having put the God-fathers in mind of
Christs promise to the Infant to be baptised, he is to say: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
after this promise made by Christ, these Infants must also faithfully
for their part promise by you that be their sureties, that they will forsake
the Devil, and all his works, and constantly believe Gods Holy Word, and
obediently keep his Commandments:</hi> This is the baptismal Dedication.
I hope that will not be denied: Now, is not the <hi>Cross</hi> used to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token
our obligation to the very same things? And therefore it
must be a dedicating Sign, as well as Baptism. And it may as well be
said, that Baptism is meerly a rite of admission into the <hi>Church,</hi> as
that is such.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. He telleth us, <hi>page</hi> 351. that <hi>all publick admissions into</hi>

not, and therefore Christ hath made Baptism the <hi>Ceremony</hi> for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
admitting the Members of his Church; which he having done,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95366:134"/>
how dare any take upon them to invent new rites for that end?
<hi>As Baptism</hi> (saith the <hi>Doctor) is a rite of admission into Christs Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, so is the sign of the Cross into our Church of</hi> England,
<hi>in which this Ceremony is used, with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>This now, is the fine new Notion, for the sake of which, all the
foregoing discourse is designed: The <hi>Dr.</hi> deserveth the honour of
inventing it; for I do not find that ever any had thought of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
But I doubt it will prove but a Mouse brought forth by the long
labour, and hard throws of a Mountain. I shall here remind the
Reader of what I have observed already, <hi>Part 2. Sect. 1. Sect.</hi> 9. that
by this one Notion, the <hi>Dr.</hi> destroyeth the great design of his Book;
which is to charge them with <hi>separation;</hi> most of whom he here doth
implicitely, and by necessary consequence, acknowledge never to have
been Members of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> they never having been
signed with the Cross: For if they never were Members, they were
not capable of <hi>separation,</hi> more than another Mans Leg can be said
to be cut off from my body, to which it never was united. 2. This to be
the use of the sign of the <hi>Cross</hi> was never declared by the <hi>Church,</hi> but
the quite contrary; as is evident from what is already cited, both out
of the Thirtieth <hi>Canon,</hi> and out of the Office of <hi>Baptism,</hi> both which
are the authentick Writings of the <hi>Church;</hi> wherefore this is to be
lookt on as but one <hi>Doctors</hi> Opinion; and we are to take the scope,
and meaning of the <hi>Churches Ceremonies</hi> from her own declaration,
and not from the thoughts of any one man, when he is streightned
in defending of these rites. 3. I ask the <hi>Dr.</hi> if we who never were
yet signed with the <hi>Cross,</hi> should be willing now to join as Members
of the <hi>Church;</hi> and to submit to all her <hi>terms of Communion,</hi> whether
must we be signed with the <hi>Cross</hi> at our admission? The same may
be enquired concerning any Baptized in <hi>France, Scotland,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Church.</hi> I suppose he will not own such <hi>Crossing,</hi> I am sure it was
never heard of; if he say, it is not to be done, How do these become
Members of the <hi>Church?</hi> The <hi>Independents</hi> will require some token
of owning their <hi>Church</hi>-Covenant, even where it is not joined with
Baptism, why then do not the <hi>Church of England,</hi> (for the <hi>Dr.</hi>
parallelleth these two admissions into the <hi>Church)</hi> require this
<hi>Crossing</hi> out of Baptism, if it be meerly a sign of admission into the
<hi>Church of England?</hi> 4. If the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Dr.</hi> too, and all the
Divines that Write in defence of the <hi>Church,</hi> would declare never so
often that this is the use, and the only use of <hi>Crossing,</hi> all this could
not satisfy, as long as the words used with it, and the Religious State
in which it is by their practice sixed, do make the contrary apparent.</p>

the use of the <hi>Cross</hi> as a dedicating, or common professing sign of

do not appoint other means beside Christs for all the ends that they
are appointed for; but they ought not to appoint other means for
any of these ends; because Christs means are sufficient for all the
ends that they are appointed for: Sacraments are not only sufficient
to signify Gods promise of giving grace, but also to signify our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
to perform duty: Wherefore we ought not to add new
signs for the one, more than for the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. The sign of the

signs of their own, for representing or conveying Grace, they make

Merit: Sacraments are for applying the Spirit of Christ, as well as
for applying the Merit of Christ; and therefore if men pretend to
make signs for the one, tho' not for the other, they make new
Sacraments. We do not say, that every significant Custom in
a <hi>Church</hi> is to pass for a new Sacrament, as the <hi>Dr.</hi> would make us
say: Sitting at the Sacrament, putting off the hat in Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
(which he paralleth with the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> are quite of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:95366:135"/>
the <hi>Cross,</hi> being a bare Rite of admission; that the obligation is to
the Common Duties of Christianity. The <hi>Dr.</hi> Answereth; <hi>And is
not every Church-Member bound to perform these?</hi> How this Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the Objection, I see not: For the Question, is not what <hi>Church</hi>-Members
are obliged to, but when Christ hath appointed a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
sign, to represent the common duties of Christianity; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Church</hi> may appoint another sign for the same end, and join
that sign with Christ's sign, to be performed with it, with the same
Solemnity, and in the same Office of divine worship? He saith that,
<hi>To shew that Crossing is a solemn Rite of Admission, the Church alloweth
it to be forborn in private Baptism. Answer,</hi> 1. This only sheweth it
to be a solemn action, not that it is a solemn rite of admission; for
all this, it may be a solemn Sacrament, or a solemn piece of other
worship. 2. This allowance of the <hi>Church</hi> doth quite cross the
<hi>Drs.</hi> Conceit of its being a Rite of admission into the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England;</hi> for if it were so look't on, the <hi>Church</hi> would rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join
it then, because without it, the person baptised, should not at
all be admitted into the <hi>Church,</hi> and so be no Member of it; and
surely the Rite of administration to the <hi>Church,</hi> is more needful,
where admission into the universal <hi>Church; to wit,</hi> Baptism is more
questionable, whether it hath been done or not, as in private Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
than where it is publick and known to all. To Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
That Christs Sacraments or Symbols are sufficient, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we need not devise more. He Answereth, <hi>If it be lawful, the</hi>
Church <hi>is to judge of the Expediency, and to appoint other Rites that do
not encroach on the Institutions of</hi> Christ, <hi>by challenging any effect pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to them, is no charging them with insufficiency.</hi> Reply, 1. Mr. <hi>B.</hi>
and others assert, and prove the unlawfulness of these Rites, as the
<hi>Dr.</hi> well knoweth; wherefore he might well have expounded, <hi>We
need not devise,</hi> by, <hi>We ought not devise.</hi> 2. There are other ways
how mens Rites may encroach on Christ's Institutions, than by chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
any effect peculiar to them, when as they are appropriated to
Religion, used in, or amidst Religious Exercises, and for Religious
Ends. 3. Dedicating a person to God, engaging the Soul to own
Christ, and such like, are effects peculiar to Christ's Institutions;
for they are instituted for these ends, and nothing else hath any effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
that way, being destitute of the promise of a Blessing: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

allow not. He pleadeth against Mr. <hi>B. pag.</hi> 355. that <hi>the sign of the
Cross, if it had</hi> Christ's <hi>Institution, would be a Sacrament; because
then it should have promises annexed, and the nature of it quite changed,
and the Minister should sing in</hi> Christ's <hi>Name not in the</hi> Church's. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi>
The Nature of it would be then changed, no doubt, because it
would be a true Sacrament, and have the annexed Blessing; but
there would be no other Change from what it now is, than what
dependeth upon the Authority, by which it is instituted. But that
doth not hinder it to be now a <hi>Mock Sacrament,</hi> and to have as much
of a Sacrament as is possible, without divine institution. The
Ministers signing now in the name of the <hi>Church,</hi> which he
then would do in the Name of Christ, saith no more, but that
in the one case it is Christ's Ordinance, but in the other
case it is Mans Ordinance, but doth not hinder it in that case, to
be a humane Sacrament. Whether Mr. <hi>B.</hi> do misrepresent the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Doctrine, about the efficacy of Sacraments, or not (which the
<hi>Doctor</hi> by many Testimonies endeavoureth to prove, <hi>pag. 357, 358.)</hi>
is not much to our business. The <hi>Doctor</hi> saith, <hi>That if by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Doctrine, the Sacraments do at all convey Grace, whatever way
it be done, it sheweth that the sign of the Cross-can never be advanced to
that Dignity; since, in no sence it is held to be an Instrument for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
of Grace. Answer.</hi> It is true, it is by this excluded from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a true Sacrament: But it may, for all that, be a false Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for though it be not their opinion, that it conveyeth Grace,
yet it is by them held to be a mean of stirring up the mind, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
the Soul to these Acts, to which, nothing but the Grace of
God can effectually help a person. I hope the <hi>Doctors</hi> Conclusion of
this debate with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> may now appear to be groundless; <hi>to wit,
That this Phrase of a new Sacrament is groundless, and only invented to
amuse People:</hi> Neither can I understand what sort of people these
should be, <hi>who have been satisfied against all the other Arguments</hi> (which
he calleth <hi>conveying their prejudices) and have so stuck at this stumbling
block;</hi> for we bring many Arguments against the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
that more weight is to be laid on, though this wanteth not its force.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 26. The <hi>Dr.</hi> is pleased, <hi>Sect.</hi> 32. to engage in a debate with
Mr. <hi>A.</hi> about <hi>bowing at the Name of Jesus,</hi> and counts opposing it; <hi>a
blow at the Church.</hi> If the <hi>Dr.</hi> would have defended this <hi>Ceremony,</hi> he
should have answered what is of purpose, learnedly and solidly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
against it by Mr <hi>William Wicken,</hi> and twelve arguments against it
by another hand; and not satisfied himself with answering some
occasional reflections made on it by Mr. <hi>A.:</hi> But this <hi>Ceremony</hi> being
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:95366:137"/>
imposed by the <hi>Church,</hi> as one of the terms of her Communion (which
I knew not till I find the <hi>Dr.</hi> here doth not deny it) I shall a little
consider it, by proposing our scruples against the use of it; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
off the edge of what the <hi>Dr.</hi> bringeth in defence of it. But we
must first consider the true state of the controversy; which is not,
whether all possible Honour be due to the Glorious Person who is so
Named? Nor whether it be unlawful at the hearing of that Name
or any other Name, whereby that Blessed Person, or either of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Persons of the God-head are designed, to have the heart raised
to adore that Majesty, whom Saints and Angels Worship? Yea, nor
thirdly, whether it be in it self, and always a sin to express our adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him by an outward sign of kneeling, as bowing, or lifting up
the eyes, when the heart is thus excited by the mention of his Name
or any of these other Names? All these we readily yield: And our
Brethren, on the other hand, grant, that no Worship, direct or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
mediate, nor immediate, (such as <hi>Papists</hi> give to their Images)
is due to the Name, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Word. 2. That there is no duty lying
upon People always, and every where to bow at the hearing of this
Name; for they appoint it only to be done in the time of Worship:
The 18 <hi>Canon</hi> prescribeth it only in time of divine Service; it is not
there restricted to the Lessons, and the Creed, as the <hi>Dr.</hi> alledgeth,
<hi>page</hi> 362. In the Injunctions of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Sermons are also ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in, &amp; a general clause <hi>(when otherwise in the Church mentioned)</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
it to all acts of Worship; which the <hi>Dr.</hi> without ground would
limit; to wit, when they are not imployed in any other act of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.
3. They make it no natural, but instituted piece of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
the <hi>Dr.</hi> all along speaketh of it only as lawful, never pleadeth
for the necessity of it, and defendeth it only so far as it is required
by the <hi>Church.</hi> It is true, some of them plead Scripture for it; to wit,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10. and by consequence must make it a duty, as naturally
necessary, as praying, and believing: But I do not find that the
learned among them do insist on this. The question then is,
1. Whether it be lawful for the <hi>Church</hi> to command People to use
outward signs of reverence, by bowing the head or knee, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
when ever they hear the Name of Jesus mentioned in Divine
Worship, when yet no such injunction is given in reference to any
other Name of Gods? 2. Whether it be lawful for People to obey
such commands? To both, our Brethren answer affirmatively; and
we answer negatively.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 27. The same reasons will serve for both parts of our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:95366:138"/>
They are 1. This Bowing is an uncommanded piece of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
<hi>Ergo,</hi> it is unlawful. The consequence dependeth on Christ's
condemning of <hi>Mens Traditions</hi> in his Worship, as vain, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that they are the Commands of Men, <hi>Math. 15. 9. Mark</hi> 7. 7.
of which before. And I think the <hi>Doctor</hi> will not deny it, who
owns that Acts of Worship must have divine Warrant, <hi>page,</hi> 348.
The Antecedent hath Two Parts; <hi>to wit,</hi> that this Act is uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and that it an Act of Worship. For the First: Few of
our Brethren alledge a Command for it; for then it should not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
as they make it, and they that plead a Command, found it
in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10. But that place doth no way injoin any such <hi>Rite:</hi> For
<hi>first,</hi> the Greek Text is plain, not <hi>at,</hi> but <hi>in,</hi> the Name of JESUS:
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; which to expound of Bowing at the hearing of the
Word, is the greatest Violence that can be done to plain Words:
For the plain sense, is, that subjection to his Dignity and Power,
shall be yielded by all Creatures. 2. This Text can no way be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricted
to the Reverence given in Divine Service, but must either
prove this a duty at all times, when this Name is uttered, or it
proveth no such expression of Reverence at all. 3. The Text
speaketh only of <hi>kneeling;</hi> and I know not that it is in the <hi>Churches</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
where the Lord commandeth kneeling, to change it into bowing
of the Head. 4. If this be injoined, so is confessing with the Tongue,
<hi>ver.</hi> 11. What power hath the <hi>Church,</hi> to pick and chuse Scripture-Commandments,
to injoin one, and neglect another of equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?
But why do I stay on this, many Episcopal men, and
even some <hi>Papists,</hi> look on this Text, as nothing to the purpose in
hand; for the Second Part of the Antecedent, that this Bowing is
an Act of Worship, I hope that will not be denyed, it being a direct
and solemn adoring of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> and the stating of it in Divine
Service, and appropriating it to that, doth constrain men to look so
upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 28. Argument 2. It is not reasonable Service; <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is not
acceptable Service. The Consequence, I hope, will not be denyed:
The Antecedent I prove, because no Reason can be given for
bowing at the hearing of this Word, rather than at the mention of
these other Names, by which, God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
or our Blessed Redeemer are called. It is not enough, that some
Reason can be pretended for this practice singly considered: For 1.
Whatever Reasons be given for it, do equally concern other Names
of GOD and CHRIST; and therefore, must either prove the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:95366:138"/>
                     <hi>Church</hi> faulty, in not instituting Worship to all these names, or
they prove nothing at all. 2. Our main scruple is at the discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
that is made by this <hi>Ceremony,</hi> between this name, and others
that are equally holy; therefore, they must either give a reason,
why adoration is fit in this case, rather than in the other cases, or
they do not reach the Question. The Reasons given by the learned
<hi>Hooker, Eccles. polic. lib. 5. Sect.</hi> 30. are not concludent; <hi>to wit,
1. It sheweth a reverend regard to the Son of God. Answer,</hi> 1. Let the
Father and Spirit have the same reverend regard. 2. Every way
of expressing our regard to him, is not warrantable: He hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
ways for it, and not left them to our devising. 2. He saith,
<hi>It maketh much against the</hi> Arians, <hi>who deny his God: head: Answer,</hi> 1.
His way of convincing gain-sayers, is by the Word; we must not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
ways of our own to convince Hereticks; <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
being God's way, are more powerful to convince, than if
one were sent from the dead; and therefore, much more than such
a foolish <hi>Ceremony.</hi> 3. If this Argument prove any thing, it would
make it our duty rather to bow to him, when his name is mentioned
in Blasphemy, or Swearing: Then such a Testimony is more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
than when all present are worshiping him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 29. Argument 3. It is superstitious Worship, not only on
the account of its not being commanded; but also because it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to make that use of a name, without ascribing more to it
than is due, to a word, or any external sign. I know our Brethren
will deny all respect to the word, and affirm that it is only the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Redeemer that they reverence: And I am obliged to
believe that they make not the name, the <hi>Objectum Terminans,</hi> of
any part of their Worship, yet the setting such a mark of discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
on that name, from others, and giving such Reverence on
that occasion, is such a violent presumption of some inward Respect
to that word, rather than to another of equal Excellency, that a
man ought not to believe himself, when he denyeth it of himself,
much less are others obliged to believe him: Especially, the <hi>Church</hi>-Guides,
who impose this, must either see some Reason for it, or
none; if none, it is <hi>Church</hi>-Tyranny, to impose so arbitrarily in the
Worship of God: If they see a Reason, that Reason cannot shun
to be superstitious; <hi>to wit,</hi> a making a difference in this name from
others, where there is no such difference: And if it were possible
to free the mind of superstitious Conceits in this matter, it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
impossible to free the action from a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>candalous appearance of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:95366:139"/>
superstition; for what other Construction can the Beholder put on
bowing so many times at the recurrent mention of a word, when no
such thing is done at the mention of other words of the same signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?
May not one rationally think, that it is not the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but the sound of the word that moveth men, when they see them
bow at that word, and not at another, that expresseth the same
thing? If I see a man frighted at the hearing the word <hi>Eusis,</hi> and
not moved at hearing <hi>Gladius,</hi> I have reason to think, that it is not
the apprehension of a Sword, which is signified by both words, that
doth so move him, but some Antipathy he hath at the sound of the
word <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sis:</hi> This is easily applyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 30. Argument 4. It is impossible to observe this usage pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
without having the mind diverted from that attention to
the other Acts of Religion, that is fit. Men may talk what they will,
but common Experience will convince the unbyassed, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to hear with serious attention, toward the matter read, or
otherwise spoken, to go along with it in the heart, and at the same
time to be ready at the sound of the word <hi>Jesus,</hi> to catch it, and
to use the Reverence required. I appeal to the Experience of them
who do seriously mind this bowing, whether their mind be not taken
up with thoughts about the word, waiting for it before they hear it,
so as they cannot at the same time, mind what else is spoken, as
they ought. Here we may apply that Adage; <hi>Vides aliquem de vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus
solicitum, scito animum in pusillis occupatum.</hi> The mind cannot
be intent on two things at once, such as are one single word, and
the matter of a coherent Discourse. Argument 5. It is an usage
unknown to the Apostolick &amp; purest Primitive Times of the <hi>Church;</hi>
yea, it is amongst the most novel Inventions of the later, and
more corrupted Times of the <hi>Church,</hi> under the Anti-Christian
Apostacy; no mention of it, till the middle of the <hi>13th.</hi> Century.
It was never injoined, till <hi>Concil. Lugdunens.</hi> 1273. and <hi>Basiliens.</hi>
1431. Argument <hi>6th.</hi> It hath been grosly abused to Superstition
and Idolatry, in the <hi>Popish Church,</hi> and therefore being confessed to
be an indifferent thing, it ought to be abolished. In a Council at
<hi>Auspurg,</hi> this bowing is injoined at the name of the body and blood
of Christ, of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and several others of their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>Concil. Lugdun.</hi> it is injoined chiefly in the Mass. It argueth a
strange respect to that way, thus to symbolize with them in their
usages, that have no warrant in the word; and by so doing, to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from all Protestant <hi>Churches.</hi>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 31. I come now to attend the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s debate with Mr. <hi>A.</hi>
about this matter, where I am troubled to find the <hi>Dr.</hi> treating his
Adversary with such Contempt, and indecent Reflections, on his
learning, which maketh him be honoured in the eyes of men, as able
to discern, as they who despise him; telleth us, <hi>He had before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenced
these things, as required by the</hi> Church, <hi>against Papists; and</hi>
Mr. A. <hi>borroweth their Weapons, but doth not so well manage them.</hi>
We give the Author his due Praise for his learned Labours against
the <hi>Papists,</hi> but are not thereby obliged to be silent, when he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
any of the Truths of God: But I cannot understand how Mr.
<hi>A.</hi> should borrow the <hi>Popish</hi> Weapons in this Controversy, seeing
the <hi>Papists,</hi> and the <hi>Doctor</hi> are in this matter <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and Mr. <hi>A.</hi>
doth oppose them both: It is true, a <hi>Non-conformist</hi> may say, that
<hi>Papists</hi> have as good reason for their <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as the <hi>Church of
England</hi> for hers: But this is not to use their Weapons; for we
think neither hath reason on their side. Mr. <hi>A.</hi> blameth the <hi>Doctor</hi>
in answering his <hi>Popish</hi> Adversary, for saying, <hi>That bowing at the
name of</hi> Jesus, <hi>is no more, than going to</hi> Church <hi>at tolling of a Bell.</hi>
To which Mr. <hi>A.</hi> replyeth, That it is <hi>Motivum cultus,</hi> at least;
and so more than the tolling of a Bell, to call people to Church; and
he addeth, that an Image may as well give warning to the eye, to
worship, as a Bell to the ear. Here Mr. <hi>A.</hi> is far from either plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for <hi>Popish</hi> Tenets, or using <hi>Popish</hi> Weapons; but sheweth the
absurdity of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s opinion, by a parallel opinion of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
which the <hi>Dr.</hi> condemneth; which is a good way of reasoning
<hi>ad hominem,</hi> and needed not be so cryed out against. The <hi>Dr.</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
some good Reasons, why Images are not to be used in worship,
but he doth not touch the Point in hand, between him and Mr. <hi>A.</hi>
who never intended to parallel a Bell and Images any further than
this; that a Bell in the Act of Worship (the sound of the word
<hi>Jesus</hi> is in the same quality) must be <hi>Motivum cultus,</hi> and so is an
Image. Therefore, if an Image not only on other accounts, that
the <hi>Dr.</hi> mentioneth, but even on account of this lower use of it,
its being <hi>motivum cultus,</hi> be evil; so is the sound of the word
<hi>Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 32. The <hi>Dr.</hi> exposeth Mr. <hi>A.</hi> as a crackt delirious man, for
saying, that <hi>the Papists go too far in preserring an Image higher than to
be</hi> motivum cultus, <hi>but the question is, whether they do not sin in applying
it to this lower use, to make it an ordinary stated motive to Worship.</hi> And
after, <hi>if men sin who make an Image an ordinary stated motive of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:95366:140"/>
yet how shall we excuse our own adorations?</hi> Sure the application of
all this to the present Controversy is not so hard to be understood;
but that a man, whose wit is not a wool-gathering, may see these
are not the words of a delirious man. He doth not charge the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> with using Images, but with using the sound
of a word to the same purpose, with the lower use that <hi>Papists</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to Images; and inferreth, that if the one be a sin, so is the
other; and the one may as lawfully be done as the other. The adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he speaketh of are worshipping God by the help of the sound of
that word, as <hi>a motivum cultus;</hi> and therefore there is no need of
proving that ye Worship any other beside God, before ye need
excuse your adorations. The <hi>Dr.</hi> confesseth, <hi>page</hi> 361. that <hi>their
Church never denied that men sin in making Images a stated motive of
Worship:</hi> Hence Mr. <hi>A.</hi> inferreth, that their <hi>Church</hi> sinneth in
making the sound of a word a stated motive of Worship; but this
the <hi>Dr.</hi> is not pleased to take notice of: But when Mr. <hi>A.</hi> asserteth,
that they may bring in Images with equal reason, the <hi>Dr.</hi> denieth
that we may worship Images on the same reason, that we perform
external adoration to <hi>Jesus</hi> at the mention of his Name; still he
will not take notice wherein the parallel, and consequently, the
strength of the reason lieth; to wit, in making Images a motive of
worship; and making a word such; but the <hi>Dr.</hi> parallelleth making
Images the object of Worship, and making the word <hi>Jesus,</hi> the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
only of it; which is to seek <hi>subterfuges;</hi> not to stand to the
argument insisted on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 33. Mr. <hi>A.</hi> giveth a difference between the tolling of a Bell
to call People to <hi>Church,</hi> and the word <hi>Jesus</hi> occasioning, our bowing,
that the one is out of worship, the other in it; when we should be
intent on devotion. In answering this the <hi>Dr.</hi> saith, <hi>They contend not
for the seasonableness of this bowing when they are in other acts of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and immediate application to God; but about the lawfulness of it
in repeating the Lessons or the Creed.</hi> Reply, 1. I have before shewed
that this is not the sense of the <hi>Church,</hi> which injoineth it in time of
<hi>Divine Service;</hi> which I hope taketh in prayer: yea, when ever
that <hi>Name</hi> is mentioned in the <hi>Church,</hi> wherefore the <hi>Dr.</hi> must be
sore put to it, when he must defend the <hi>Church</hi> by contradicting her,
and setting up his private opinion that he is forced upon, against her
Authentick and publick Records. 2. Here are two distinctions hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
equally useless to this design. The first is, he pleadeth not for the
seasonableness, but for the lawfulness of this usage; but if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:95366:140"/>
even at these times, that he will have it used, then it is also
unlawful; seeing duties acceptable to God must be done in their
season. 3. The other distinction is, it is not to be done in acts of
devotion, and immediate application to God; but in the Lessons and
Creed. I desire to know whether hearing the Word read, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Articles of our Faith rehearsed in a solemn manner, while we
are about Worshipping God, be not <hi>acts of Devotion,</hi> and <hi>immediate
Application to God,</hi> as well as prayer; which he seemeth to understand
by that expression. The word read, as well as preached, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2.
should be mixed with Faith, and so should the hearing the Articles of
our Faith; and is not Faith in its exercise <hi>Devotion,</hi> and an <hi>immediate
Application to God?</hi> At least it cannot be denied, that serious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of the whole Soul is requisite in these exercises, as well as in
that which he will call <hi>Devotion;</hi> and therefore it must be as unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to be diverted by waiting for the fall of a <hi>Word,</hi> in the one
exercise as in the other. 4. The <hi>Dr.</hi> taketh no notice of the main
strength of Mr. <hi>A</hi>'s. reason; to wit, that the toll of the Bell is out
of Worship; the sound of the Word in it. The one is <hi>in statu Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vili,</hi>
or <hi>Communi;</hi> the other in <hi>statu Religioso;:</hi> For I hope he will not
deny these exercises in which this bowing is to be used, to be Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
acts. He saith it signifieth nothing to this purpose whether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
be in the <hi>Church</hi> or out of if when the Bell rings; for in the
same <hi>page</hi> he (Mr. <hi>A.)</hi> mentioneth the Mass-bell, which ringeth
in Worship; and if the object of their Worship were right, it would
make him better understand the parallel. <hi>Reply,</hi> It is a rash assertion
to say there is no difference between the Bell ringing when People are
in the <hi>Church,</hi> and when they are out of it, (he must mean when
they are in the act of Worship, and when not; otherwise what he
saith is impertinent) for the one is <hi>motivum Cultus,</hi> and <hi>in status
Religioso,</hi> the other not: It is true, Mr. <hi>A.</hi> mentioneth the Mass-bell
in the next <hi>page,</hi> but he parallelleth it with the sound of the VVord
<hi>Jesus;</hi> both being a stated motive of Worship, and therefore that is
mentioned by the <hi>Dr.</hi> to no purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 34. He saith, when it is said in the <hi>Injunctions,</hi> that <hi>we must
bow at mentioning the Name</hi> Jesus <hi>in divine Service—or when it is
otherwise in the</hi> Church <hi>pronounced: Yet,</hi> saith he, <hi>by the manner of
shewing this reverence,</hi> viz. <hi>with lowliness of courtesy, and uncovering the
heads of mankind, it supposeth them at that time not to be imployed in any
other act of devotion. Answer,</hi> By this way of commenting he may
easily make the <hi>Church</hi> say whatever he pleaseth; for this is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:95366:141"/>
the Text by his Commentary. Let him tell us when is that
Name pronounced in the <hi>Church,</hi> and yet People at no other act of
Devotion: This manner of reverence required, proveth nothing;
for it is no wonder to hear them speak inconsistencies in requiring
low courtesy, and uncovering of the head in time of Devotion, when
the head is already uncovered; who injoin the same in the <hi>Church</hi>
out of that Devotion, when that VVord is mentioned, tho' heads be
already uncovered, as all must be in time of <hi>Divine Service;</hi> by
<hi>Can.</hi> 18. the same that injoineth this <hi>Bowing.</hi> He saith, <hi>it giveth no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
to Devotion:</hi> But doth it give none to other parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which he is not pleased to call Devotion? He will still have it
<hi>lawful, as long as the object of Worship is true; the mention of this
Name only expresseth the time as the Bell doth of going to</hi> Church.
<hi>Answer,</hi> It will then follow, that if <hi>Papists</hi> will only Worship God,
not the Image; and use it only as a stated motive of Worship, that
were lawful too. But he considereth not that the manner and mean
of Worship may be sinful; when the object to which it is directed is
true; and that this is so, is clear from what hath been said. I have
also shewed how irrational it is to parallel the Bell to call People to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with a sign stated in Worship to stirr up, or put in mind of it;
what Mr. <hi>A.</hi> objecteth, that there is more need of this reverence in
our ordinary converse, I have touched before: The <hi>Dr.</hi> maketh it a
strange crossness, to deny it in Worship, and then plead for it in
other cases. But Mr. <hi>A.</hi> doth not plead for it in any case, but useth
this as a good reason to shew the folly of their imposition: But
enough of this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 35. The rest of his debate with Mr. <hi>A.</hi> may soon be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched.
Mr. <hi>A.</hi> commendeth the moderation of the <hi>Canon</hi> 640.
not imposing Worship toward the <hi>East</hi> or <hi>Altar;</hi> but leaving it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
and pleadeth for the same Indulgence in other rites, as
little necessary in themselves; as <hi>Crossing, Kneeling, &amp;c.</hi> according
to the Apostles rule, that differing parties should not judge nor cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
one another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 3. The <hi>Dr.</hi> in his answer, bringeth two
reasons of this different practice; one is, the one sort of things
were settled at the Reformation, not so the other; another is, the
one is settled by Law, the other not. It is strange the <hi>Dr.</hi> should
lay weight on either or both of these reasons in opposition to the
Apostles command of forbearance; for the question still recurreth
on the first setler of these, either by Law or otherwise: Why did
they impose things so severely that the Apostle would have us bear
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:95366:141"/>
with one another in? And then it recoileth on the upholders of this
unwarantable settlement: Why do they continue such impositions
as may be for-born, and divide the <hi>Church</hi> by so doing? We do
prove these things unlawful as the <hi>Dr.</hi> requireth; but tho' we should
fail in that proof, their counting them indifferent is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
such severe imposing of them. He saith, <hi>page</hi> 364. that Mr.
<hi>A.</hi> thinketh the rule of forbearance <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. to be of equal force in
all ages, and as to all things about which Christians have different
apprehensions; and then <hi>Papists</hi> may come in for a share as to
worshipping the <hi>Host, Images, &amp;c.</hi> Had Mr. <hi>A.</hi> talked at this rate,
the <hi>Dr.</hi> would (as he doth on less ground) have said <hi>his fancy had
been disordered, and all things were not right somewhere.</hi> Did ever Mr.
<hi>A.</hi> or any of us say this, or words to that effect? We say this of
things indifferent, not of things about which Christians differ; and
so I hope the <hi>Papists</hi> are sufficiently shut out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 36. VVhen Mr. <hi>A.</hi> or any of us, blame the leading <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
for using these things that are not imposed, we make this no
grounds of <hi>Separation,</hi> as the <hi>Dr.</hi> would insinuate. VVhat Mr. <hi>A.</hi>
saith of disagreeing in a circustantial part of VVorship, is not the
conclusion of his discourse, to prove a disagreement in <hi>substantial</hi>
parts of Worship; but an <hi>Antithesis</hi> (sufficiently proved) to the <hi>Dr's.</hi>
assertion, that all our difference was about <hi>circumstances</hi> of VVorship;
and he makes it appear, that not only they with the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> but they
among themselves did so disagree; while some of them <hi>Bow</hi> to the
<hi>Altar,</hi> others not. If this be not a part of VVorship, I see not how
<hi>Bowing</hi> to an <hi>Image</hi> can be called such. He further blameth Mr.
<hi>A. page</hi> 365. at the end, for making a sort of middle things (able to
justify <hi>Separation)</hi> between <hi>Substantial</hi> parts of VVorship, and meer
<hi>Circumstantials.</hi> And the <hi>Dr.</hi> doth most unjustly inferr from thence,
that <hi>Separation</hi> is justified by things that are neither <hi>Substantial</hi> nor
<hi>Circumstantial</hi> parts of VVorship, and no part of it at all. For he
will not consider, that tho' Mr. <hi>A.</hi> doth not make the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> meer
<hi>Circumstantials,</hi> yet he maketh them <hi>Circumstantial</hi> parts of VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
that is, parts of VVorship without, which all that VVorship
that Christ hath instituted is confessed to be intire. And if Mr. <hi>A.</hi>
do also go about to prove that the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are made by the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
Substantial</hi> parts of VVorship, it is no incoherency in him, but in
them who talk so variously of these rites; sometimes as the veriest
trifles that can be, sometimes as so much conducing to the Glory and
Decency of Gospel-VVorship. The truth is, <hi>Substantial</hi> parts of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:95366:142"/>
VVorship, is a term of the <hi>Drs.</hi> (as Mr. <hi>A.</hi> telleth him) none of ours;
and therefore if we do not apply it sometimes to his mind, let him
blame himself for not making it more intelligible to us by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it.</p>

               <div n="9" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. IX. The other Pleas pretended for Separation.</head>
                  <p>VVE come now with the <hi>Dr.</hi> to the next Plea used for <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;</hi>
to wit, that the <hi>Dissenters</hi> are still unsatisfied in
their Consciences about the <hi>Churches terms of Communion,</hi> and
the <hi>Church</hi> excommunicateth them; and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
join. He is pleased to join these two, tho' very distinct, yet
he prosecuteth them severally. For the latter, which he speaketh first
of, the <hi>Dissenters</hi> Plea, that he is pleased to take off is, the <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
ipso facto</hi> by the <hi>Canon</hi> 6. that we all lye under. Before I
consider his answer to this, I must tell him of two things that have
more weight to justify our <hi>Separation</hi> than that <hi>Canonical Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</hi>
1. That many thousands of us are otherwise <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated</hi>
for our non-compliance with the <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> even by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
application, and publishing of the sentence against us; yea, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
may not go to <hi>Church</hi> if they would, being under the Writ <hi>de
capiendo Excommunicato,</hi> and daily watched for to be apprehended;
this putteth on us a forcible necessity of <hi>Non-communion,</hi> and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Worshipping God, and waiting on the means of Grace, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth
us to meet privately to enjoy these ordinances that we cannot
have publickly. The second thing is, even they who are not under
the sentence of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> yet are materially <hi>Excommunicated</hi>
by your <hi>Church</hi> if they will not comply with your <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> for we
can have none of the Sacraments without them; and your <hi>Canon</hi>
excludeth us out of the <hi>Church</hi> unless we <hi>Bow</hi> at the Name of <hi>Jesus.</hi>
So that we cannot, if we never so fain would, enjoy God's Ordinances
among you, without partaking your <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> Wherefore all the
blame that can be cast on us, is not using the <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> From which
we have sufficiently cleared our selves in the eyes of unby-assed Men;
all that followeth on this is not to be charged on us, but on the rigour
of your <hi>Church,</hi> which forceth us from among them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The <hi>Dr.</hi> answereth to the Plea from the <hi>Canonical Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
Sect. 33. page</hi> 367. that, that <hi>Excommunication</hi> is not against
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:95366:142"/>
such as modestly scruple the lawfulness of the things imposed, but
against those who obstinately affirm it; and he blameth Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as
misciting the words of the <hi>Canon.</hi> Wherefore I shall set down
the whole <hi>Canon,</hi> it is the <hi>Can.</hi> 6. of the Convocation, 1603. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall hereafter affirm, that the Rites and Ceremonies of the</hi> Church
<hi>of</hi> England, <hi>by Law Established, are wicked, anti-christian, or superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
or such as being commanded by lawful Authority, men who are zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously,
and godly affected, may not with any good conscience approve them,
use them, or as occasion requireth subscribe to them, let him be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated</hi>
ipso Facto, <hi>and not restored untill he repent, and publickly revoke
these his wicked Errours.</hi> The <hi>Dr.</hi> hath a subtile distinction here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween,
<hi>but affirm,</hi> which term Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had used, <hi>and affirm:</hi> One would
think that <hi>affirm,</hi> and no more added to it, signifieth no more than
<hi>but affirm:</hi> But the <hi>Dr.</hi> saith, that <hi>affirm, signifieth these circumstances,
which according to the common sense of mankind, do deserve Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
viz. <hi>that it be done publickly and obstinately.</hi> What ground the
<hi>Dr.</hi> hath for this criticism, I know not; I am sure his citation out of
<hi>Augustine,</hi> that a man is born with till he find an accuser, or obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defend his opinion, saith nothing of the sense of the word <hi>affirm.</hi>
Neither do I think that our Courts will be ruled by <hi>Augustine</hi> or the
<hi>Dr.</hi> either. If a man with the greatest modesty imaginable, being
asked, why he doth not Conform; shall say, he cannot do it with a
good conscience, he falleth under the plain letter of this Law, and
goeth against the express words of it; and this is the least that a
modest man can say, unless he will say, I will not do it, and that will
be called obstinacy; and so bring him under the Law, in the <hi>Dr</hi>'s. own
sense. But if the man (as a modest man may) give reasons for his
<hi>Non-conformity,</hi> when men require him to Conform, every word he
saith, will bring him under this Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. Another answer that the <hi>Dr.</hi> bringeth against this Plea, is
<hi>pag.</hi> 368, 369. where he tells us of <hi>the opinion of Canonists, that such an
excommunication is but a commination, and cannot affect the person till a
sentence be past, applying it to him; and that men under such excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
are not obliged to execute it against themselves, by withdrawing
from the Church.</hi> I shall not contend about this, though one would
think that such excommunication as he describeth, were rather <hi>ipso
Jure,</hi> than <hi>ipso Facto;</hi> and that excommunication <hi>ipso Facto,</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
one under the sentence as soon as the fact is committed. But to
let that pass, this excommunication declareth what we are to expect;
and the frequent, yea, general execution of it, putteth most part out
of capacity to come to <hi>Church,</hi> and may justly alarm the rest to seek
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:95366:143"/>
a retreat for themselves in time. It is as when an act of banishment
is passed by the Magistrate, the party is so far loosed from his Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to that Society, that he may with a good conscience withdraw
before he be violently transported; sure such excommunication,
and the fact, (which we neither deny, nor are ashamed of) are
enough to loose our tie that we had to the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. He answereth a question; <hi>Can these be called Schismaticks
who are first excommunicated by the Church?</hi> He saith, <hi>they may in
two cases. 1. When there is just cause for the sentence. Reply,</hi> I deny
not but such are to be condemned for their giving just cause for such
a sentence, and it may be on the same ground they may be called <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks;</hi>
but to call men <hi>Schismaticks</hi> for not joining with a Society
that hath cast them out, seemeth to be such a figure, as when men are
called <hi>Fugitives,</hi> who are justly banished; but I will not contend about
words: If the <hi>Dr.</hi> can prove our excommunication just, let him
call us what he will. The instances he giveth, make nothing for
that; none of these <hi>Churches</hi> require sinful <hi>terms of Communion,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
mens devises in the Worship of God, and then excommunicate
men for not submitting to them. His second case, in which excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
are <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> is, if they set up <hi>New Churches,</hi> which he
proveth from the instances of the <hi>Churches</hi> that he had before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
<hi>Reply,</hi> He now supposeth the excommunication to be unjust,
else this case were coincident with the former: And in that case I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
his assertion. The unjust excommunication is either for an
alledged personal fault, or for a principle of Religion unjustly called
false. Again, it is either past against one or few, or it is against a
great multitude, a considerable part of a <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Nation.</hi> If it be
for an alledged personal fault (where it is hardly supposed that a
great part of the <hi>Church</hi> can be concerned) I do not say that such
may set up new <hi>Churches.</hi> It is fit such should quietly wait till they
can be cleared; they having in that case no ground to charge the
<hi>Church</hi> with any fault in Doctrine, Worship, or Discipline; but in
the mis-application of a true and right way of Discipline. But
where the unjust excommunication is for a sound principle, falsly
called errour; and it also reacheth a great part of the <hi>Church,</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and People: I see no reason why they should not have the
Worship of God among themselves, let men call it setting up of new
<hi>Churches,</hi> or what they will. For, 1. It were strange if the half of a
<hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Nation,</hi> or near so many, should be obliged to live without
the Ordinances of God, for the Caprice of some ambitious <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
who excommunicate them, because they will not dance after
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:95366:143"/>
their Pipe. 2. In this case, the Orthodox had been <hi>Schismaticks,</hi>
when they were excommunicated by the <hi>Arians,</hi> and set up New
<hi>Churches.</hi> 3. Christ should oblige his People to live without his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
because of their love to the purity of them. What the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
objecteth out of <hi>Augustine</hi> is not to be understood of our cases,
but for private men excommunicated for falsly-imputed crimes; not
for any thing of their Faith, for he bids them keep the true Faith,
without <hi>Separate</hi> meetings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. Our Author proceedeth, in the end of page 371. and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
to consider another Plea, made for <hi>separation; to wit,</hi> scruple
of Conscience, which, I think, none do make the sole ground of <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;</hi>
but they have a ground for their scruple: If that ground
be good, it will warrant the scruple, and the <hi>separation</hi> too; if not,
it can do neither. And therefore I shall not insist on this as a plea,
distinct from what I have already defended. I suppose the Author
that mention it intend no more than I say; only they may rationally
maintain, that a scruple not sufficiently warranted, in a person other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
sober and sound, about a matter indifferent, or not intollerably
evil, tho' it doth not free the scrupler from all blame, yet may oblige
the <hi>Church</hi> not to impose with rigour the things so scrupled on such
a person. The <hi>Dr.</hi> here doth not act the part of a Disputant, nor a
Casuist; but of somewhat else that I shall not name. For when it
had been pleaded, that these scruples are great, of long standing,
not to be removed without very over-powering impressions on mens
minds: He answereth, by a harange full of contempt of his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that <hi>a little impartiality and consideration would do it, but that we
read, judge, and hear only on one side; think it a temptation to examin,
cry out, we are satisfied already, are not willing to be informed, nor glad
of light; fly out into rage at them who endeavour to remove our scruples,
&amp;c.</hi> If we be such men, why hath the Learned <hi>Dr.</hi> written so long a
Book to refute us; it is no wonder that he stirr up the Magistrate
against such, and the People too; to cry out, <hi>away with such fellows
from the Earth, it is not fit they should live.</hi> He asketh, <hi>where lyeth the
strength and evidence of our scruples?</hi> If I should speak in his dialect,
I should answer in the arguments by us produced, which he and all his
party are not able to answer, nor have ever answered; but I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-dispute
than scold: He saith, <hi>we may see light if we will:</hi> We
say, <hi>we would see it if we could, and think we could see it, if it were to be
seen.</hi> He telleth us how easy this dispute is. We assent, and wonder
that so Learned a Man should go about to darken so plain a truth.
He chargeth us with willful mistake; a mistake we deny, and make
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:95366:144"/>
the contrary of it appear; but if it be a mistake, that it is willful,
we also deny; and though we cannot in this, satisfy them who are
resolved to <hi>cast Iniquity upon us,</hi> &amp;c. yet we can make our appeal
the to Searcher of hearts, who will one day judge us, and our rash
judgers.</p>

of his that he alledgeth Mr. <hi>A.</hi> mistook; there is no need of
insisting on such debates: Brethren should study to understand one
another, and construe every thing to the best. But if the <hi>Dr.</hi> had
been as careful to vindicate his own cause as his own words, he
would have refuted Mr. <hi>A</hi>'s pertinent and weighty discourse, <hi>pag.</hi>
72, 73, 74. which he hath but lightly, or hardly at all touched.
He proceedeth, <hi>pag.</hi> 376. to deal with another of his Antagonists,
who objecteth, that these who cannot conquer their scruples, as to
Communion with our <hi>Church,</hi> must either return to the state of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism,
or set up new <hi>Churches,</hi> by joyning with the ejected Ministers.
The <hi>Dr</hi>'s. Answer is, <hi>that this is new Doctrine; the old</hi> Puritans
<hi>supposed men obliged to continue in the Communion of our</hi> Church, <hi>altho'
there were somethings that they scrupled at. Reply,</hi> I have formerly
shewed that there were old <hi>Puritans,</hi> that did both scruple and act as
we do; but I deny not that some did join with the <hi>Church,</hi> but then
their scruples and ours do differ: They thought the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were
inconvenient, yet might be used; we think them unlawful, and not
to be used: There was also another difference, they met with some
indulgence, and were suffered to Worship God with the <hi>Church,</hi>
and forbear the things that they scrupled; We meet with nothing
but rigour and severe imposing of these, and therefore, whatever they
did, we are under this unpleasing choice, either to sin against God
and our Consciences, or to set up <hi>Separate Meetings,</hi> or to return to
the state of <hi>Paganism; i. e.</hi> to live without the Ordinances of
God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. It is objected, that we scruple joining in the Sacraments,
and living under some of the Ministers. He answereth, that <hi>he never
heard this last alledged for a ground of Separation;</hi> neither do I insist
on it, as I have before declared; save, where they Preach false
Doctrine, or otherwise corrupt the Ordinances, so as we cannot join
in them without our personal sin: And this scruple hath been often
heard of. <hi>It is too vulgar a way of reasoning, it is a hard case if People
must fly into separation, because all their Ministers are not such as they
ought to be.</hi> Pray, who ever said so? <hi>But the</hi> Dr. <hi>would fain know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as often as men do scruple joining with others, their separation be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:95366:144"/>
This is easily known by a less knowing person than the Learned
Dr. <hi>St.</hi> for all men knows and acknowledge, that scrupling can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make <hi>Separation</hi> lawful; it is good ground for these scruples
that must do that. Wherefore all the instances that he heapeth up
of unjustifiable <hi>Separations,</hi> might have been spared, as wholly imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent;
O how easy is it to prove Learnedly that which no man
denieth. After one of his Historical instances of a <hi>Separation</hi> from
the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> he asketh, <hi>what is there in this case but is
every whit as justifiable, as the present</hi> Separation? <hi>Ans.</hi> There is in
it, that these <hi>Separatists</hi> could not with any reason object to the
<hi>Church</hi> from which they <hi>Separated,</hi> that she imposed on them any
Religious <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of mens devising, or other unlawful <hi>terms of
Communion,</hi> and then excommunicated them for not submitting to
these. He telleth us, <hi>page</hi> 378. that no setled <hi>Church</hi> doth allow
this liberty of <hi>Separation,</hi> because men cannot conquer their scruples.
It is true, neither is it fit they should allow it meerly on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
but withal he might have added, that few setled <hi>Churches</hi>
except that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that of <hi>England,</hi> do tempt, or rather force
men to scruple, and to <hi>Separate</hi> by imposing unnecessary <hi>terms of
Communion,</hi> which they know many count unlawful. What he saith
<hi>ibid.</hi> for <hi>Papists, Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> pleading for the same
liberty of <hi>Separating,</hi> doth no way come up to our case. Neither
are their scruples built on good grounds, nor are the things that they
scruple, known by the <hi>Church</hi> that imposeth them to be unnecessary
things. He wondereth that none hath taken care to put a stop to
<hi>Separation,</hi> by shewing what scruples are to be allowed, and what
not. Hath this never been done by <hi>Non-conformists?</hi> Have we
not also taught that the <hi>Church</hi> ought to bear with them who
soberly dissent in the lesser concerns of Religion; and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
unnecessary things on Peoples Consciences: If these were
attended to, a stop might soon be put to <hi>Separation;</hi> but if
<hi>Men</hi> will scruple without cause on the one hand, and the <hi>Church</hi>
will impose without cause on the other, there is no putting a
stop to <hi>Separations,</hi> till the Lord cure our Distempers. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and Persecution, if it succeed to root out the Dissenting
Party, is one way to put a stop to <hi>Separation,</hi> but it is none of
Gods way; and as it never had his approbation, so it seldom
hath had success.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. The Learned Author, <hi>Sect.</hi> 36. falleth on a new Subject;
to wit, the use of <hi>God-fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers</hi> in Baptism. I never
look't on this as a sufficient ground of <hi>Separation,</hi> and therefore might
wave this whole debate: But I think it is an abuse, and therefore
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:95366:145"/>
shall say a little on this Subject. Here we have not any institution
to guide us, there being nothing in Scripture, that I know of, about
<hi>Spo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sion</hi> for the party Baptized: And therefore, as on the one
hand, what the nature of the thing and reason make necessary,
should not be withstood; so on the other, what is beyond that,
should not be practised, and far less imposed. All the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is about the use of Sponsers in the Baptism of Infants, for
the adult are to undertake for themselves. Some make the use of
<hi>God-fathers,</hi> to be witnesses of the Childs-Baptism. That is
very needless, for the whole <hi>Church</hi> are witnesses of that. The true
use of them is to represent the Child as a party covenanting with
God, in this Solemn Sealing of the Covenant of Grace between God
and the Infant; and consequential to this, to undertake the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and education of the Child in the Christian Religion;
and endeavouring to engage him to a personal owning of the
Covenant. The original of other <hi>Sponsors</hi> beside the Parents
was, in the Primitive <hi>Church,</hi> many young ones, either born of
<hi>Heathen</hi>-Parents, or Orphans of <hi>Christian</hi>-Parents, falling into the
Tuition of <hi>Heathen</hi>-Relations, in reference to their worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
were in hazard by that means to be bred in Heathenism:
Wherefore it was judged needful that some faithful, and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Christian should undertake for their Religious Education.
This usage which reason had first brought in, ostentation did
afterward enlarge, by multiplying <hi>God-fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers;</hi>
and after that, Superstition did perver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it, by excluding the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and putting strangers in their room; till at last in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
it was quite depraved, by making a spiritual kindred
to result from this action. Wherefore, we do not deny the use
of <hi>Sponsors,</hi> but think the Parents the most proper <hi>Sponsors;</hi> both
on account of their opportunity, obligation and natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to do the office of a <hi>Sponsor</hi> for the Child, which may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
be thought to be more in them than in a stranger;
and we think it a gross abuse to admit of other <hi>Sponsors,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in the want of Parents, or their Inhability. I think also,
considering things as they are, not barely in the notions that
men have of things that they will defend; this practice is fallen
into such abuse, that even that should make it be laid aside;
for it is manifest and most common, that God-fathers and God-mothers
are chosen most unqualified for, and most unconcerned
in that which they make a solemn promise to God to perform,
which is a horrid mocking of Him and his Ordinances: Are not
Boys and Girls chosen, or Debauched and Ignorant Persons; or
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:95366:145"/>
Strangers, that may be, shall never see the Child again, nor mind
it, except it be to send it a new Coat?</p>

Protestant Churches approving of this. But will he say, that they
are for Excluding the Parents? which is the very thing that we
controvert; For as the <hi>Dr.</hi> confesseth, <hi>Can.</hi> 29. Ordaineth, <hi>That
Parents need not be Present, and that they shall not be admitted to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:</hi>
that is, they must not undertake for the instruction and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of their own Child. But saith he, <hi>The Parents are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
such as are Fit.</hi> I desire to know what Warrant is for this,
even from sound reason? Who can be so Fit, by his opportunity
and care, as the Parent? And if he be wholly unfit, as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and respect to true Religion, we are not against his
having a Deputy, in that Case; that it is done with the Parents
consent, is better so than otherwise; but that the Parent can trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his right to another, is without all reason, unless the Person
to whom such a Translation is made, do really take the educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Child; which though by a private compact between the
Parent and Sponsor, might be done; yet, what shadow of reason
can be for a <hi>Canon</hi> compelling every Parent to do it? <hi>It is</hi> (saith
he) <hi>but like an occasion of absence;</hi> to wit, <hi>of the Parent, in which
case all allow of a Sponsor. Ans.</hi> It is no way like it, for the one
hath necessity to warrant it; the other hath nothing but mens will,
or superstitious conceit. Is it alike for, the State to make a Law
that neighbours should feed and cloath the Orphans of poor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
and to make a Law that they shall feed and cloath the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of their rich Neighbours, who are alive? The case is just so
here. It is an injury to a man, to have his Child taken from him
without a cause, and given to another to be educated; so it is to
be obliged, yea, forced to transfer upon another all that right he
hath to represent his own child, and to engage for his education.
He saith, <hi>it is not the Churches intention to supersede the obligation of
the Parent, but to superinduce a further obligation upon other Persons.</hi>
Had the Parent been permitted to undertake for the Child joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the Sponsors, there had been some colour for this asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but that being expresly denied by the <hi>Canon,</hi> it is evident
that the <hi>Church</hi> doth what she can to make the Parent think that
no obligation at all lyeth on him. I meddle not with his debate
against Mr. <hi>B.</hi> about Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Argument against <hi>Sponsors,</hi> from the
Childs having right to Baptism, only from the Parents; many
learned men differ from Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in that, and I shall not digress to
dispute it.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. The Dr. <hi>pag.</hi> 386. saith, <hi>he findeth nothing particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
objected against Kneeling at the Communion, that deserveth conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which he hath not answered in another place;</hi> to wit, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
First Part,</hi> which Book I have not seen; wherefore I
shall in a few words lay down our Ground of Scrupling that
Practice, and so leave it. We do not scruple Kneeling at Prayer,
which is joyned with receiving of that Sacrament; nor do we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that all possible reverence should be used in going about that
Holy Ordinance; but we think the expression of that Reverence
should be of Gods appointing in his Word, or grounded on Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or civil Custom, and not instituted by mans Will. 1. Then
we scruple it, because it is an uncommanded Act of Worship;
that it is Worship, I think will not be denyed; Kneeling in Prayer
cannot be denyed to be an Act of external Worship, no more
than this: That it is uncommanded, we must believe, till they
shew us a Command for it. They alledge, that Kneeling, being
unquestionable a fit gesture to express Humility and Adoration;
it cannot be unfit, but needful in this Case where both are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
To this I reply, Humility is not fitly expressed by Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
though Adoration be, and therefore we think Kneeling in
the Act of Receiving to be no fit gesture, because Adoreing,
however needful it be in the complex Action of Communicating;
<hi>to wit,</hi> before and after Receiving the Elements; it is not the
Souls work in that Act, Believing or Covenanting with God, is
the proper Exercise of the Soul in that Act, which is a solemn
sealing of the Covenant, and this Covenanting is very unfitly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by Kneeling. He that is about solemn Prayer or Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(which might be well expressed by Kneeling) in the Act of
receiving that Sacrament, doth little know, or consider, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and use of it; whence I form our Argument thus; that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Gesture which is neither Commanded by God, nor neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
Connected with the Souls exercise in Worship by nature,
and dictated by it; nor is by civil custom made a fit expression of
the inward exercise of the Soul in that Worship; but is only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by the Will of man, is unlawful to be used in that Worship;
but Kneeling in the Act of receiving the Sacrament is such; <hi>Ergo,
&amp;c.</hi> The major is clear, for that must in that case be Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
the minor is proved by what is said, and the conclusion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. Another ground of our scruple is; this Practice is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precedented
in the Apostolick and purest Primitive <hi>Church;</hi> Christ
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:95366:146"/>
with his Disciples Sate or leaned; they used the table gesture, then
made decent by civil custom, and yet they used as much humility in
receiving, and knew as well what was fit and decent as we now do, or can.
In after Ages this Practice was not used, it is well known that in
<hi>Tertullians</hi> time, and till the beginning of the Fifth Century, they did not
use to Kneel on any Lords Day between <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Pentecost,</hi> so much
as at Prayer; and the <hi>Canon</hi> of the Famous First <hi>Council of Nice</hi> did
forbid it; how then did they make the Communion Kneeling? A third
ground is; this Kneeling is a Religious Adoration before a Creature,
with a Religious respect to the Creature; but this is unlawful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The first proposition is clear, for it is with respect to the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
Elements before them, that we Kneel; and it will not be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that we there adore God Religiously. The second proposition I prove,
because Protestants do generaly condemn Praying before an Image
(as on other accounts, so on this) because it is an adoring of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Creature, with a Religious respect to it; let our Brethren shew
us what the more moderate of the Papists give to their Images, that
we do not give to the Consecrated Elements. We use the one as a
a stated motive of Worship, as they do the other; they deny that
they give any Worship to the Image, as we do with reference to the
Elements. A fourth Ground is; this Practice, (as acknowledged by
its Patrons to be Indifferent,) hath been grosly abused to Idolatry, the
<hi>Papists</hi> in the same external way worshiping the Hoste. And it is
known that this Practice came in with the belief of Christs Bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in the Sacrament, and the <hi>Papists</hi> profess, that if they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that, they would not so Kneel; and is it fit that we should so sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize
with them? which by this Practice we do to that degree, that it
is not easy to distinguish our Adoration from theirs, by the spectators of
both. These grounds I have but hinted, being spoken to more largely
by others.</p>

neither Mr. <hi>A.</hi> nor any of us, did ever make that a ground of <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>

I join with him so far; that I know not, nor hear of one <hi>Non-conformist</hi>
of that opinion; but thus it seems we are, by our Brethren, represented

as witnesses against us. He also representeth us as if we condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:95366:147"/>
Reverend and Learned Author of it, to be an ingenious and sober Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but in some things misinformed by the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Party: He lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
our Divisions, so do we; he is for complyance with the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
being setled, but is far enough from approving of them. The former
part of this, I impute to his being less concern'd to consider these things,
than we are. He stateth our <hi>Separation</hi> mainly upon <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> which
we do not; and he, no doubt, doth it upon Misinformation: But it
is observable, that this good man, whom the <hi>Dr.</hi> bringeth as a Witness
on his side, doth as much blame the <hi>Church</hi> as us, whilst he is for their
quitting of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that occasion <hi>Separation;</hi> which he insisteth much
on, as the way to peace. A notable piece of Misinformation that this
worthy Person hath met with, is, That at a Conference held for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> a little after His Majesties Restauration, nothing
letted the Agreement but some of the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> the contrary of
which, and their great Condescendency for Peace, is known to all <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
and a lasting Monument of it to Posterity, is the Book called,
<hi>A Petition for Peace,</hi> containing the things that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
while the <hi>Prelatical</hi> Party would not part with, yea, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
their Brethren in the least <hi>Ceremony,</hi> or mode of their <hi>Service.</hi>

<hi>Monsieur Claude,</hi> who walketh by the same Spirit, and in the same
steps with his Reverend Colleague, <hi>Monsieur de l' Angle:</hi> He speaketh
of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> as tollerable; that one may, with a good Conscience,
live under it: This is not our Question; but it seems the Question
hath been so stated to him, by them who had a mind to procure his
Testimony to their Cause. He telleth us, they admit of Ministers
that had been Ordained by <hi>Bishops;</hi> so do we: He doth highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
Love and Concord: And we think it cannot be overvalued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where it can be had without Sin. He speaketh of Advantages, both
by <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and Parity; and of disadvantages by both, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by bad men. Nothing of which do we contradict. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of Extreams on both sides, we do the same: We never yet
thought all of our Party so moderate, as they should be: After a proof
of <hi>Independency,</hi> he comes to speak of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> with that decent
respect that becometh a man of his understanding and breeding, and
in a far other dialect than Dr. <hi>St.</hi> doth. He wisheth them to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in reference to the scandal that they think they have received from
the <hi>Episcopal Order,</hi> and to distinguish the persons from the Ministry;
this we refuse not. He doth indeed condemn our holding assemblies
apart, but stateth it on this ground, <hi>page</hi> 445. as if we did <hi>Separate</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the publick assembles are held under <hi>Episcopal</hi> Government; and
that we think our presence there were an approving of it, which is wide
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:95366:148"/>
from our case; but no doubt is according to his information, for which we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hank our
<hi>Episcopal Brethren,</hi> and commend their ingenuity. To the same purpose is what he
hath <hi>page</hi> 446. as if we thought we cannot with a good Conscience be present in the
Assemblies; but only when we do fully and generally approve all things in them:
which is far from our thoughts: These Principles he doth most solidly refute. He
saith, <hi>page</hi> 447. that he cannot believe that any of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us <hi>(Presbyterians)</hi> look on their
<hi>Episcopal Discipline,</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies</hi> as blots and capital errours that hinder a man from
Salvation. And doth in this truly judge, for we have always disowned such senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we judge them sinful evils, which we dare not own; but have much charity
to some who own them. He next adviseth the <hi>Bishops</hi> to moderation, and when the
dispute is about <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that are a stumbling-block, and nothing in comparison
of communion, they would make it be seen that they love the Spouse of Christ, better
than themselves. O that this advice were followed, how soon might Peace return to
our Land Now wherein hath Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> or his Colleague touched our controversy.
Alas! good Men, they are abused by mis-representations. Their Letters give
just ground to think, that if they were made Umpires between the two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<hi>Prelatical</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and heard the true state of our debate, and
true matters of fact: they would be of the same mind with us. And I am
sure the <hi>Church</hi> way that they practice is the same that we are for. Wherefore
the <hi>Dr.</hi> with no loss to his cause might have waved the producing of these Letters.
What acts are used by the <hi>Prelatical</hi> party to get foreign Divines to be on their side, or
at least to say nothing against them, may be gathered from a passage in the Life of the
Famous and great antiquary, <hi>Monsieur l' Arrogie;</hi> who having writ a Book,
wherein he sheweth the Conformity of the Discipline of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> (which all know to be <hi>Presbyterian)</hi> with that of the Primitive <hi>Church;</hi> And
another in defence of <hi>Monsieur Dialle,</hi> touching the Letters of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Constitutions,</hi> against Mr. <hi>Pearson</hi> and <hi>Beverige,</hi> and having designed a reply
to their answer that they had made to him, at the request of some that favoured

                        </gap>piscopacy,</hi> he did not finish his answer. These are pitiful shifts to support a tottering
cause; of the same kidney is their denying relief to the <hi>French Protestants,</hi> Ministers
and others, who do not Conform to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> being to
them of more value than the great Gosple Duty of charity. At <hi>Dublin</hi> 1685. a
<hi>French Minister</hi> who Preached to some of these Exiles, was suppressed because he did
not use the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> nor <hi>English Liturgy.</hi> Since I wrote this, I have met with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
