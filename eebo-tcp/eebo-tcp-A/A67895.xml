            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Can testifie thus far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Authour of
this Treatise, that upon
speech between Bishop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi>
and a Gentleman his neer
neighbour about the Ceremonies, the
Bishop a while after, and a quarter of a
year before his death, delivered this to
him as a collection of his own about
that subject, which he had not time (he
said) to polish and lick over. Had the
Authour intended it for the Presse, it
would no doubt have been more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb facs="tcp:119049:4"/>
but I thought it worthy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Authour and Argument
(which few have so generally handled)
to be published, though I do not thereby
avow and justifie superstitious and
needlesse Rites, as if the observation
of them was necessary when they are
imposed by Authority, nor every
thing else therein contained. If a word
be sometimes deficient, or the sense im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
I hope the judicious will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it either to the difficulty of supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such things in anothers work, or
to the speedy publication of it, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not sufficient time for viewing the
Authours here quoted, though some
things have been amended. That the
Bishop was a very Learned man, his
Works abundantly shew, <hi>Cui viro
utinam Ecclesia Dei plures simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
haberet praesules,</hi> saith <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabone,</hi>
Epist.<hi>189.</hi> I would the
<pb facs="tcp:119049:4"/>
Church of God had more such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
His admirable knowledge in
the learned Tongues (saith the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of his Funerall Sermon) Latine,
Greek, Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabick,
besides other modern Tongues to the
number of <hi>fifteen,</hi> was so rare, that
he may well be ranked in the first
place, to be one of the rarest <hi>Linguists</hi>
in Christendome. His great volume
of XCVI. Sermons, his <hi>Conciones
ad Clerum,</hi> his Practicall Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme,
with his large Exposition of
the Commandements, and his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
also of the Lords Prayer,
speak his knowledge in Positive Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
his <hi>Tortura Torti, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsio
ad Apollogiam Bellarmini,</hi>
with his Theologicall Determinations,
shew his ability likewise in Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall
or Controversall Divinity. I
shall recite one acute passage of his
<pb facs="tcp:119049:5"/>
in his <hi>Answer to Cardinall Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines
Apology.</hi> When the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
had turned it <hi>tumulos a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dornemus,</hi>
the Cardinall changed
<hi>adornemus</hi> into <hi>adoremus,</hi> though
some say that <hi>adoremus</hi> was in the
Book falsly printed, and then addes,
<hi>Quid hic quaeso Rex dicet, Si Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres
veteris Ecclesiae clamant, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum
tumulos adoremus?</hi> The
Bishop replies, <hi>Dicet abesse voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li
literam, Cardinali fidem.</hi> He
would be so displeased with Scholars
that attempted to speak with him in
a morning, that he would say he
doubted they were no true Scholars
that came to speak with him then.
That which he saith in the third Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph
of the superfluous and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Ceremonies of the Papists bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from the Heathens, is most
true and abundantly confirmed in
<pb facs="tcp:119049:5"/>
two Printed Books of that subject,
<hi>viz.</hi> One by <hi>Moresive</hi> a
Scotchman in his <hi>Origo Papatus,</hi>
where he proveth after the Order
of the Alphabet, how the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
have taken their superstition
from the Heathens, which they have
long since intruded upon us for
the true worship of God: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by <hi>Francis de Coy</hi> a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and translated into English,
but much curtailed and wronged by
the Licenser, and entituled, <hi>The
three Conformities of the Romish
Church with Gentilism; Judaism
and ancient Heresie,</hi> a Learned work
and long since printed. I shall onely
mention a few things wherein the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
symbolize with the Heathens
and Iews. They have framed their
Masse after the Leviticall Morning
and Evening Sacrifices, and their
<pb facs="tcp:119049:6"/>
Priests after the manner of those that
were established in the ancient Law.
They attribute unto the Golden Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
wherewith the Pope beateth one
of the Gates at Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s in
<hi>Rome,</hi> called Holy, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Iubilee, that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth
to the bloud of Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and not to any others, <hi>viz.</hi> the
remission of sinnes more then seven
hundred years before Christ: the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Romanes used Frankincense
in their Sacrifices. And those poor
people beleeved that <hi>Janus</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta</hi>
were well pleased to be thus ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with Incense and Wine. The
Etymology of the Latine Word <hi>thus,</hi>
which is derived from the Greek
to sacrifice, declareth what the use
of Frankincense was, <hi>viz.</hi> the like
to that which on this day is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
in their Massing Sacrifice. The
<pb facs="tcp:119049:6"/>
Egyptians great Idol <hi>Serapis</hi> had a
Crosse in his breast, and that signe
was one of their holy Letters, <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus</hi> l. 2. c. 29. reporteth, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Learned among the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians were the rather contented to
embrace Christianity because they
saw the Crosse esteemed, which was
before a great Ceremony of theirs.
The custome of running about the
streets with firebrands in honour of
<hi>Proserpina,</hi> was turned with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
into <hi>Candlemas</hi> daey. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of <hi>Ceres</hi> done in the Fields
with howling of women and crying
of children, was made a generall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
with us on <hi>Rogation</hi> week.
The Images of <hi>Mercury</hi> set by the
High way sides were afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to Crosses. Whereas there was
in <hi>Rome Templum Pantheon,</hi> a
Temple wherein all the Gods of the
<pb facs="tcp:119049:7"/>
world were honoured: The devout
Fathers to take away this Idolatry did
consecrate a Church unto <hi>Allhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi>
that that should now be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
unto all Saints that before
was attributed unto false Gads. The
Iesuites are descended from the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocratians
ancient Heretiques, of whom
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> writeth, that they bragged
themselves to be fellowes with Iesus,
and to bear rule over the Princes of
of the earth: The Capuchins goe
bare-footed; <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Book
of Heresies, <hi>ad quod vult Deum,</hi>
speaks, <hi>De excalceatis,</hi> and saith,
that they grounded themselves on
this, that the Lord had said unto
<hi>Moses, Put off thy Shoes from thy
Feet,</hi> which perhaps is the same place
whereupon the Capuchins have groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this custome to goe bare-footed:
You cannot be partakers of the Lords
<pb facs="tcp:119049:7"/>
Table, and of the Table of Devils,
<hi>1. Cor. 10. 11.</hi> The Gentiles when they
performed holy exercises were wont to
feast in their very Temples, as the
same Apostle teacheth in <hi>Chap. 8. 10.</hi>
when <gap reason="foreign">

these Feasts after the Sacrifice the

of Devils, and opposeth the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of God to them. Some conceive the
Papists are therefore called Gentiles,
<hi>Rev. 11. 2.</hi> because they so much imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
their worship. I would there was
no cause for those complaints. In New
<hi>England</hi> Heathens turn Christians,
in Old <hi>England</hi> Christians turn Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
and that those unsound Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
persons which they have cast out,
we have received. Some Divines think
<pb facs="tcp:119049:8"/>
the time of slaying the Witnesses draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
near, others conceive that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
shall have a hand in it, and that
they shall yet further prevail rather
to persecute then seduce the people of
God. I conclude all as <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Holland</hi> was

and Usages, not contrary
to the Scripture, were still retained
in their Christian policy; By means
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119049:9"/>
whereof tranquillity and peace was
observed, and the alteration in the
State lesse dangerous or sensible;
For as in General <hi>Arnobius</hi> is true,
writing, Nothing was innovated for
Christian Religion <hi>in rerum natura;</hi>
And as the Heathen Oracle of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo
Pythius</hi> answereth, the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
asking him what Religion was
principally to be embraced, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that which was by descent deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
as a custome of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors;
So in particular, well writeth
<hi>Dionysius Halycarnasseus,</hi> the least
Ceremoniall points of the divine
worship, a Nation, unlesse necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
compell them, will hardly alter;
He instanceth it in the <hi>AEgyptians,</hi>
the <hi>Moors,</hi> the <hi>Gaules,</hi> the <hi>Scythians,</hi>
the <hi>Indians;</hi> Nay, Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi>
in his Common-wealth, expresseth,
that our Ancestors being Heathens,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119049:10"/>
when they agreed to receive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, that which was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
before, and concerned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
policy, they held and kept
still with that which was brought
off new by their Christian Apostles
and Doctors: Because I remember
<hi>Tullies</hi> cognisance, namely, that it
is a badge of a negligent and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
person, not to regard what the
most sort of the people may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of him: And that conceit is
worthily the most hainous, which
may note any to plant by writing,
or water by speaking, the cursed
Roots or Seeds of self-springing
Paganism.</p>
            <p>I will first prove that this kinde
of birth of our Ceremonies can be
no disgrace to our Ecclesiasticall
Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I will insinuate three
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119049:10"/>
observations to be remembred out
of the particular Proposition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I will point at some
of the superfluous and wicked Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Ceremonies drawn from the
Heathens.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and Lastly, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in many Ecclesiasticall Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Heathens, which are
or may be used in ours or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christian State.</p>
            <p>In the first place, allowing much
of our Ecclesiasticall discipline u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the time of our Primitive
Church, was borrowed from the
Heathen: yet that it can be no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
unto it, must needs be
granted; for otherwise to imagine
is the direct opinion of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
<hi>Manichaei,</hi> whose errour in
this Point is solemnly refuted by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119049:11"/>
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Austin</hi> writing against <hi>Faustus,</hi>
and by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Ierom</hi> writing against <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantius:</hi>
That I may not threaten
but perswade, By the judiciall Law
of <hi>Moses</hi> expressed in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. If a
strange woman be taken in battel,
if her beauty please thee, her nails
and hairs being pared and shaven,
and her garment of captivity being
taken away, thou maist lawfully
take her to wife: By the morall
of this Law, severally write <hi>Isidore</hi>
and <hi>Peter Blessensis,</hi> the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Gentiles, the deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
thereof being taken away may
lawfully be used amongst the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
<hi>Isidore</hi> then expounding,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 16. <hi>Thou shalt not plant Trees
near unto the Altar,</hi> his meaning is,
one must not imitate the devotion,
nor the Ceremonies of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:
For the Israelites even by the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119049:11"/>
direction of God made holy Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
and placed them in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, of the gold and silver
they robbed the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of: And
it is vulgarly known, that the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Heathen Poets are used
by the holy Ghost in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament;
Again, we may see in
<hi>Act.</hi> 17. how S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> himself when
he was at <hi>Athens</hi> (the very Altar of
Superstition, which was dedicated
unto an Unknown God, and unto
which bloudy sacrifices were slain,
by as much dexterity and wisedom
as that time would permit) did
make use thereof, and seem to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it to the worship of the true
God; And which is more, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> it is lawfull for a
Christian so it be without scandal,
to eat those things which are conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
unto Idols; Honestly then
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119049:12"/>
writes M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hooker,</hi> That which hath
been ordained impiously at the first,
may wear out by tract of time, as
the names of our Heathen Moneths
and Daies used throughout all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome
without any scandall.
And if the Spaniards well may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of their <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
Qui per cloacam ingressus subter
Muros,</hi> won <hi>Naples,</hi> and from thence
expelled <hi>Renate</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou;</hi>
reasonably then eut out of sormer
rags of the Gentiles, the glorious
rious and fair garment of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in times may be woven. And
as <hi>Ephraim Syrus</hi> a Father that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Bazils</hi> time writeth: If the
money be taken out of the purse,
yet the purse is not to be cast away;
so although the sacrifice and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Gentiles be taken away,
the outward Ceremonies may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119049:12"/>
To conclude, this pedigree
of our Ceremonies staineth not our
Christian policy; For that all the
good Orders of the Heathens came
by Tradition, or reading, or seeing
the Ceremonies that God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
among the Jews in the Land
of Promise; As it appeareth by
<hi>Iosephus</hi> against <hi>Appion,</hi> that the
Sect of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
translated much of the Jews
Laws into their own Sect: And as
by <hi>Eusebius, Austin, Theod<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ret, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin
Martyr,</hi> and others, <hi>Plato</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
much out of <hi>Moses</hi> writings,
For <hi>Moses</hi> writings were long afore
the Empire of the <hi>Persians;</hi> So ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
if it were for this place, it may
be exemplified, that the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ceremonies of the Heathen
were derived from the Jews Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:
And no man can justly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119049:13"/>
deny but that we may use the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of the Jews, <hi>Non ex vised
ex Analogiâ Mosaicae Legis;</hi> And
if this point fancy any man, let him
reade <hi>Alcuinus de Officijs Divinis;
Amalarius de Officijs Ecclesiasticis;
Gratian de Con.</hi> But especially <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
Pausa</hi> in his <hi>Osculum Christianae
&amp; Ethnicae Philosophiae:</hi> I can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<hi>Nicholaus Mount-Georgius</hi> in
his Book <hi>De Mosaico jure enucleando,</hi>
only for his endeavours: you may
observe out of <hi>Iosephus</hi> in the latter
time of the Jews Government, that
<hi>Herod</hi> their first King brought much
of the Romane Heathenish Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
into their policy, and in this
respect that many of our Christian
Ceremonies were formerly Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
and afore that used in the
Common-wealth of <hi>Iury,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God was the Law giver: They
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119049:13"/>
resemble the seventeen Vessels
which the Heathen King <hi>Cyrus</hi>
gave unto the Jews at the Building
of the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> after
the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> among
which as <hi>Esdras</hi> writes there were
Vials of Gold 29. of Silver 2410.
for these were in the last use sacred,
being formerly Heathen and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
but most anciently holy and
sanctified.</p>
            <p>2. The first of the three Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
that I am to insinuate upon,
the particular to be proved is the
amplenesse of the Common Law,
admitting no Common Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Land, but as parcell and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
into the Generall Laws
and Policies of this Land, seeing
most of our Ecclesiasticall Law was
before there was any Popish Canon
Laws observed by the Inhabitants,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119049:14"/>
as the Civill Ordinance of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
in the ages most remote;
But of these hereafter in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>Secondly Note, If much of the
Christian Policy and Discipline
was in practice when the State of
this Land was Heathen, the Lay-Catholiques
are much mistaken in
their Petition, where they write,
We have all our Feasts and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
from <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk; And
let them not play <hi>Suffenus</hi> part, in
delivering there is not the least Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
or circumstance which
hath been added to the Solemniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Majesty of Gods Service,
but the year is known when, and the
Pope by whom it was ordained,
but these forget what their Father
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth, that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Ceremonies were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119049:14"/>
by the Pope.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This will sufficiently
convict the opinion of them whom
<hi>Nazianzen</hi> ingeniously cals New
Pharisees, to be but ceremonious,
that will not conform themselves
to any Ceremonies used in the time
of Popery, seeing we must and
ought to obey the Ecclesiastical dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
established by the Laws of
the Land, for coming to Church,
for having prayers, or preaching,
or musick in our Churches, or such
like, although (as shall be proved)
these Ceremonies and Customes
were used in the time of Pagans,
and at their sacrifices: <hi>Genebrard</hi> by
by whom it is verified that much
Learning and railing may be acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in one Subject, writes that in
the Year 1560. in <hi>England</hi> arose a
new Sect of Puritans; so called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119049:15"/>
they will not pray in the
Churches that were the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
nor wear a Surplice: Sure I
am that many that wear the Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of this name are otherwise min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
And I learn out of <hi>Dubrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
that the <hi>Thaborites</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi>
held that the Clergy should not be
Doctors of Divinity, or quote the
Fathers in their Sermons, or wear
any other then their ordinary gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
But yet for them all, <hi>O quam
honestâ voluntate miseri errant.</hi> It is
confessed, Ceremonies of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are things indifferent, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neither expresly commanded or
forbidden by the Word of God;
And although among the Jews
their Kings would not permit Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
in Ceremonies to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
Christian Kings may: But
yet when they are enacted in a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119049:15"/>
Christian State, and made the Laws
of the Land, they must be obeyed
of necessity as unto a thing not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different:
For well write the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists,
An act indifferent when it
is commanded is a necessary act,
otherwise idle is the command:
And it appeareth by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> that
the <hi>Athenians</hi> made a severe Law
against those that spake against the
outward Ceremonies established by
Law or custome: This also may
appear out of <hi>Livy,</hi> and out of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
who knoweth not that the King,
the <hi>Caesar</hi> of the Countrey must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the Law of the Land? What a
presumption is it then for a private
man to exempt and priviledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from obeying the Laws of the
Land! Truly writes a Learned
Common-Lawyer, the Laws of
men not contrary to the Law of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119049:16"/>
God ought to be kept even of the
Clergy in the Law of the soul.
And <hi>Mutius</hi> notes, that <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great in <hi>Saxony</hi> gave equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to his Magistrates (<hi>Scabinis</hi>) to
put to death those which contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and derided the Ceremonies Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall,
as those which sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to Heathen gods: For <hi>Lodovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Sotomajor</hi> well writes in his
Comment upon the <hi>Canticles,</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
being as the soul, yet Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
are as the body of Christian
Religion.</p>
            <p>3. But I am to point at some of
the superfluous and wicked Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Papists borrowed
from the Heathen; Of so large and
near affinity is the divine worship
of the Heathens, and Papists in
the Temples, that <hi>Lodovicus Vives</hi>
confesseth there cannot any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119049:16"/>
be shewn unlesse the Papists
have changed the Names and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles:
So that with <hi>Chemnitius</hi> to
the followers of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi>
we may object what <hi>Faustus</hi>
did to the Christians, Ye turn I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
into Martyrs and Saints, whom
ye worship with correspondent
vows: And I can hardly imagine
how plentifull the tears of <hi>Petrus
Chrysologus</hi> and <hi>Silvanus</hi> would run,
if they were alive and viewed the
Antichristian Sea: For that in their
times some of the superfluous Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Ceremonies began to abound
in the Christian Churches: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they complained, although
the Gentiles <hi>Circensia</hi> were celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the honour of Christ: Yet
the Church being out of that cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
the particular usage of the
Gentiles in this kinde was not to be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119049:17"/>
imitated: I commend therefore
the intent of that Emperour, who
for revence of the Sign caused (as
<hi>Sozomenes</hi> reporteth) <hi>Furcam</hi> to be
erected <hi>Loco Crucis:</hi> And I reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the Opinion of the Makers of
an ancient Statute in <hi>H.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. time,
namely, that <hi>De Pistoribus</hi> which
punisheth a Butcher that buyeth
flesh of Jews to sell the same to
Christians. And generally that the
Heathen thought their Ceremonies
would drive away the Christians:
<hi>Abbas Urspergensis</hi> a German, and
<hi>Didacus Covarcuvias</hi> a Spaniard
writ, that <hi>Helena</hi> a Brittan and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Constantine</hi> the first Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Emperour born in this Island,
going to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> found in the
place where Christ was crucified,
the Idol of <hi>Venus</hi> placed: But to
instance; the Popish Purgatory, in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119049:17"/>
scope and being agreeth with the
Heathen Purgatory, mentioned in
<hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Virgil:</hi> the Papisticall
manner of consecrating Churches
and Church-yards, fully imitateth
the Ceremonies of the Pagans when
they consecrated their Temples and
Temple-Courts or Yards described
by <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Alexandro:</hi> In
<hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Gregorius Lopus</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the consecration of a
Church, they must make three
crosses in the last part thereof:
Their sprinkling of holy water is
mentioned in the 6. <hi>Sat.</hi> of <hi>Iuve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:</hi>
And <hi>Sozomenes</hi> calleth it a
Heathenish Ceremony. In parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
that it was alwaies used at the
sanctifying of the Capitoll, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Alexandro:</hi>
Their having of Nunnes and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
for Societies or Colledges was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119049:18"/>
used amongst the Heathen, as I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of <hi>Plutarch.</hi> And that the
whole swarm of Friars or Monks
was first fledged amongst the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
at large appeareth by Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Hospinian.</hi> The Papists placing
of Images in their Temples, and
every image to have his severall
Priest, their Priests to have shaven
Crowns, to be unmarried, to have
Frankincense-offerings, Fasts and
Feasts, to have candles in them, and
to carry them up and down in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
respect is Heathenish; And to
do no wrong, <hi>Chemnitius</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
proveth this by variety of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours;
The placing of Lights in
Churches at some time is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
an Heathenish Ceremony,
although it appear by <hi>Seneca</hi> the
Gentiles had it. <hi>Suidas</hi> in the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> thinketh they were first used
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119049:18"/>
in <hi>Athenian</hi> Temples: For the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers used a kinde of light
in the Primitive Church, which
made S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Austin</hi> to write, They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to the Churches, one oyl, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
way to solace themselves for
the night-light. But their burning
of Tapers in their Churches at
noon-day, is altogether a Pagan
custom, as <hi>Rhenanus</hi> well observes
in his Comment upon <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
And I take it, their burning of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
at Funerals is meerly a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
Ceremony of the Gentiles,
as appeareth by <hi>Virgil</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter;
<hi>Servius</hi> writing upon the
Funerall of <hi>Pallans, Lucet via longo
ordine flammarum, &amp; latè discriminat
agros: Hierom</hi> writing of the death
of <hi>Blesilla</hi> describeth the Funerall
pomp of the Christians; The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
kissing of their hands as a kinde
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119049:19"/>
of worship in their Churches, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
in intent with the Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
custome, although <hi>Prudentius</hi>
and <hi>Optatus</hi> make mention of kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of hands in the Primitive
Church. And this <hi>Caelius Rhod.</hi> 11.
notes out of <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Apuleius.
Lucian</hi> cals the worshipping by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the finger to the mouth to be
the sacrifice of poor men, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing else to offer. The
Learned Chief Justice of <hi>France
Brissonius,</hi> whom one cals <hi>Varro
Galliae,</hi> particularly writeth, why
the Papists purposely imitate the
Heathens, in turning on the left
hand at their right Sacrifices:
M. <hi>Perkins</hi> noteth out of <hi>Ruffinus</hi>
that <hi>pro Thoracibus Serapidis, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
caused the Sign of the Cross
to be erected in Pillars and Houses:
<hi>Sozomenes</hi> writeth, <hi>Constantine pro
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119049:19"/>
laboro posuit signum crucis;</hi> and hence
he would have this a superfluous
Ceremony of this kinde; But unto
this I cannot as yet subscribe: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
where <hi>Iulius Pacius</hi> wittily
notes, that the whole corps of the
Canon Law or Ecclesiasticall Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
imitateth the feature and
structure of the corps of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Laws, generally being Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then:
For the common Law-Book
called <hi>Decretum</hi> answereth the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dects,
the <hi>Decretall</hi> the <hi>Codex:</hi> For
as in the <hi>Codex</hi> there are the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
so in the Decretals there are the
Pontificiall constitutions. And as
the answers of wise men, that is,
Lawyers, are reported in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest,
so the sentences of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
are registred in their <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi>
all this I condemn not as an
idle correspondency: But to leave
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119049:20"/>
this point of our Divines, I spare to
prove out of <hi>Calvin</hi> their praier
for the dead as an idle imitation of
the Heathen; That their worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Reliques of their Saints and
Martyrs is meer Gentilism, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
bait of Satan: And therefore
generally to conclude, I conceive
the Jesuites, the golden staves and
mattocks of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> whose
name answereth <hi>Heraclitus's</hi> Greek
Name for a Bow, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
that is, Thy Name, saith
<hi>Heraclitus,</hi> a bow, is life, but thy
work is death: In office resemble
the Heathen Priests of the Indians,
called <hi>Brachmanes,</hi> mentioned by
<hi>Ozorius;</hi> He saith, these Heathen
Clergy-Priests also study Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and the Mathematicall Arts;
Insomuch that by their learning and
counterfeit holinesse they continue
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119049:20"/>
all their life time the singular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers
of all fraud and villany: For
my warrant I appeal to the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe
of many Houses of Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of this Realm, acted by the
Jesuites.</p>
            <p>4. Thus according to my main
design, I have instanced in many
Ecclesiasticall Ceremonies of the
Heathen, which are or may be
lawfully used in ours or any other
Christian State; For the generall,
in the Civill Law-Book called <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests,</hi>
which contains the writings
of the old Lawyers which were
Heathens, you may reade many
precepts superstitious rather then
religious, of their Heathen Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Church-discipline; And
yet when the Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi>
began after to be Christians, you
may perceive by the Civill-Law-Books
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119049:21"/>
called <hi>Codex,</hi> how in many
points the Emperours retain them;
But further to exemplifie this is a
matter fruitlesse, I stand not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
            <p>But more particularly, the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
on this behalf to be reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I shall refer unto the Heathen
Churches, the Heathen <hi>Flamines</hi> or
Ministers, the Heathen people.</p>
            <p>That the Heathens afore the
Christians had their Temples to
resort unto, where they were to
worship their Panism Gods, no man
will deny, though <hi>Diogenes</hi> in his
Cinique Mood held Temples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
by affirming the whole
world was the godly and holy
Temple of the gods, where he
would pray; and this was also the
opinion of <hi>Zenon,</hi> and also of our
Ancestors the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as appeareth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119049:21"/>
by <hi>Abbas Uspergensis;</hi> The <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
by <hi>Herodotus</hi> erected Temples
or Churches to none of the gods
but only unto <hi>Mars:</hi> But although
<hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> note, that in
the beginning superstition was the
parent of all Pagan Temples, they
being formerly (saith he) the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres
for men; Yet <hi>Isidore</hi> well
notes out of <hi>Tranquillus,</hi> that when
the people Heathen began to be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
their Temples were built, and
altered fairer both within and
without; Moreover, the very name
of the Heathen Assemblies among
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the Cities of
<hi>Asia,</hi> was <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> which retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the name of the Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Christians at this day:
<hi>Onuphrius Panvinus</hi> writeth, the
Church (<hi>Ecclesia</hi>) signifieth a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation;
And it is called <hi>Basili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:119049:22"/>
or Temple, after the manner of
the Gentiles; And as we have Bels
in our Churches, so had the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
in theirs: By <hi>Suetonius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Octavius Augustus</hi> was the
first who in the highest place of the
Temple of <hi>Iupiter Capitoline</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Bels; that at the ringing of
their Bels the Heathens were wont
to meet at their Assemblies, as at
Baths, and otherwise is plain by
<hi>Martial,</hi> who writeth, <hi>Redde pilam,
sonat aes Thermarum, ludere pergis?</hi>
But yet you may see by a part of
the canon Law called the <hi>Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi>
that the <hi>Saracens</hi> in their
Steeples have no Bels: For the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
or structure of the Temples,
whether the Christian Temples
were square, and the Heathens all
round, with D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Humphrey,</hi> as no
diversity, I leave it to be enquired
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119049:22"/>
of the curious; only I note out of
<hi>Secrates</hi> the ancient and Apostolical
Churches of the Christians in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochia,</hi>
in <hi>Syria,</hi> were built round,
And out of <hi>Giraldus,</hi> that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Vesta</hi> was like unto a Ball,
The Temple of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
is round; And that <hi>Stuckius</hi>
in his Comment upon <hi>Arrianus,</hi>
notes, the Temple of <hi>Mercury</hi> was
square, and of <hi>Cubick</hi>-figure: As
we have no Images in our Temples,
so likewise was it used of many
Heathens: Among the Romans
their holy and ancient King <hi>Numa</hi>
by a Law banished Images or Idols
out of their Temples: <hi>Tacitus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
the <hi>Germans</hi> likewise would
not represent the gods by Images,
and <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> shew how
the <hi>Persians</hi> for their gods neither
made Altars nor Images; And
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119049:23"/>
               <hi>Eusebius</hi> writes, the people called
<hi>Caes</hi> by a speciall Law forbad the
worshiping of Images.</p>
            <p>To wade a little further, the
Gentiles having their Temples and
Churches for their poeticall gods,
Christianity being received by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Emperours and Civill
Magistrates, it is to be seen whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
those Ethnick Churches were
all demolished, and new ones built
of the Christians: That many of
the Heathen Churches were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ruinated, many Historians and
Fathers witnesse; Among others,
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Ierom</hi> writing against <hi>Jovinian</hi>
telleth of the destruction of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Temples of <hi>Iupiter Capito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line:</hi>
And in his Comment upon
the <hi>Galatians,</hi> his words are these,
<hi>Vacua Idolorum Templa quatiuntur:</hi>
And in the <hi>Theodosian Codex</hi> you
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119049:23"/>
may see a particular Rescript made
by the Emperour <hi>Theodosius</hi> the
younger; That the Panism Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in the East should be pluckt
down, they being fit to be the
Dens of Devils or unclean spirits:
And their subversion of the Idols
Temples is the reason, that by the
canon and common Law <hi>Ius aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationis</hi>
is a speciall cause that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the patronage or advowson of
the Church unto a Lay-Patron;
But yet without controversie, when
Kingdoms and States turned from
Idolatry or Paganism to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and that in short time (so
powerfull was the holy Ghost)
many of the Heathen Temples
were not overthrown: But of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
after some Ceremonies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished,
were used for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
praiers and Assemblies; By
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119049:24"/>
means whereof the alteration in the
State was not so great, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
world with <hi>Democritus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not to be new made <hi>ex atomis,</hi>
and men sooner and easilier embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
publique Christian Religion;
And this is the reason that by the
Common Law of <hi>England</hi> a man
may be said to be Patron of a
Christian Church although he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
built it; if he only endow the
Church with Revenues: And as
in forreign Countries the Emperor
<hi>Honorius</hi> about the year 400. made
a Law restraining the heat of the
Christians against the Wals and
stones of the Gentiles Temples:
The words of the Rescript are, As
we forbid their Sacrifices, so we
will the ornament of their publick
works be kept: And the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> made a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119049:24"/>
Law against them which pluck
down the Tombs and Monuments
of the superstitious Heathens: And
those Laws methinks in forreign
Countries gave some warrant for
retaining Heathen Ceremonies; So
in our Country of <hi>England</hi> it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
by the Epistles of Pope
<hi>Gregory</hi> himself (who sent our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
the Monk) That although Pope
<hi>Gregory</hi> in his Epistle to the King of
<hi>England</hi> writ, that ancient Pagan
Temples in <hi>England</hi> might wholly
be destroied, yet afterwards the
same Pope better advising, that
somewhat was to be yeelded unto
them that were weak in faith, as the
Apostles did; he writeth a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
Epistle to <hi>Miletus,</hi> one of the
first Apostles or Bishops of the
English-men, and expresly willeth
that the Temples of the Idols in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119049:25"/>
               <hi>England</hi> be not destroied, but that
they be hallowed and sanctified,
and turned into Oratories for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
And as in generall for other
Countries this appeareth by <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi>
so now it is a work of some
difficulty to shew you in particular
what Christian Church at this day
standing, was anciently the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of such an Heathen god: In
<hi>Rome</hi> by full ample authority it is
plain, as by <hi>Beda</hi> in his severall
Books, by <hi>Ado,</hi> by <hi>Paulus Diaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and others, that <hi>Pantheon</hi> the
Temple in <hi>Rome</hi> for all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
gods was given by <hi>Phocas</hi> the
Emperor, about the 5. year of his
Reign unto Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 4.
and by the said Pope dedicated to
the honour of our Lady, and of all
Martyrs: It is now called the round
Church of our Lady: And the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119049:25"/>
shape and antiquity thereof is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied
lively in the first description
of <hi>Ianus Outerus</hi> his ancient descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
whose works may please a
man that delighteth in this point:
<hi>Dion</hi> writes in the Reign of the
Emperor <hi>Titus,</hi> when <hi>Rome</hi> burnt
by the space of 3. daies, that the
Temple <hi>Pantheon</hi> was burnt, but
<hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, In the 13. year of
<hi>Trajan, Pantheon</hi> was burnt with a
Thunderbolt, howsoever it was
reedified by the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
It is evident by <hi>Beda</hi> that we
had a <hi>Pantheon</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> it stood
in a Town in <hi>York-shire</hi> now called
<hi>Godmanham,</hi> this Temple among
our Ancestors the Pagan <hi>Saxons,</hi>
was called <hi>Godmandingham,</hi> and
was totally burnt by the people of
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> when at the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> King <hi>Edwyne</hi> of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119049:26"/>
an Idolater became a Christian:
<hi>Beda</hi> writes, the Heathen person or
<hi>Flamine Coysi</hi> was the first <hi>qui inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta
lanceâ prophanavit &amp; sum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
septis suis succendit,</hi> burnt the
very wals of the Church yard:
Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> writeth in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
that Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Church of <hi>Apollo</hi> into the
Oratory of S. <hi>Martins;</hi> And Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> sheweth that at this
day the Church of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Cosme</hi> and
<hi>Damiano</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> was the materiall
Heathen Temples of <hi>Castor</hi> and
<hi>Pollux:</hi> And <hi>Ado</hi> writeth, In the
Year 425. Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> turned the
Temple of God <hi>Bacchus</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi>
into the Church of our Lady;
But for <hi>England,</hi> to omit out of
<hi>Ziphilin</hi> the Abridger, that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
the <hi>Brittains</hi> worshipped
commonly in the Church of God
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119049:26"/>
Victory, as many Learned men
have reason to conjecture, S. <hi>Pauls</hi>
Church in <hi>London</hi> to have been
the Heathen Temple of <hi>Diana:</hi>
For that the adjacent and skirt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buildings
unto the Church are
called the chambers of <hi>Diana;</hi> As
also that in <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. time (as our
Chroniclers report) in <hi>Pauls</hi>
Church-yard, were digged up an
innumerable number of Oxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
which the Learned know
were anciently the Sacrifices unto
<hi>Diana:</hi> So certain I am that S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
Church now called <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Abby,</hi> was anciently the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Apollo;</hi> For so it appeareth
by one of the Charters of King
<hi>Edgar</hi> made to <hi>Westminster Abby,</hi>
and this is also recited in <hi>Sulcardus</hi>
Book, an Authour that lived near
<hi>William</hi> the Conquerors time; And
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119049:27"/>
in the Legier Book of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Albones,</hi>
it is written in the life of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Ead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus</hi>
the 9. Abbot of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Albones,</hi>
who lived in the time of our King
<hi>Edward</hi> the Martyr, that in digging
for a Foundation about <hi>Albones</hi>
Abby, was found a Book written
in the Brittish Tongue; And that
of the first part discoursed of
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Albones,</hi> the second part treated
of the Idolatry of the Citizens of
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Albones, Verulamij,</hi> unto the <hi>Sun,</hi>
and unto <hi>Mercury;</hi> Hence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
probably the ancient Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Albones</hi> were dedicated to
the service of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi>
their gods.</p>
            <p>To proceed, as lawfully the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
and supream Magistrates gave
the Temples of the Heathens to
the Christians, as well S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Austin</hi>
notes in one Epistle, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119049:27"/>
Emperours did passe over to
the true Catholiques the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and Revenues which were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by Donatists to errour and
schism; yet before the Heathen
Temples were consecrated and
purged, the Christians would not
use any Christian service in them;
And this well appeareth out of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus
lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 46. who reports
<hi>Constantine</hi> the Great the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Emperour, that in the wars
he might have a Christian Church
to say a Christian service in, he
built him a Church that might be
carried up and down after his
Camp, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Now how the Christian Bishops
did hallow and sanctifie the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Churches, particularly may
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119049:28"/>
be seen out of <hi>Marihnus Scotus Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gino</hi>
and <hi>Sigisbert</hi> in the year 607.
by <hi>Ado,</hi> and others; when they
speak of the Dedication of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon</hi>
by <hi>Boniface</hi> the fourth. Note
at this day Consecration of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
is only reserved unto the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and anciently there was
more then one Bishop present at
the consecration of a Church: For
<hi>Turpinus</hi> telleth to the consecration
of a Church-yard in <hi>Burdeaux</hi> there
were seven Bishops present, and
that our Yew-trees in Church-yards
was the planting of the Heathens,
even <hi>Verstegan</hi> understands: <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi>
reports, that about the Year
484. Pope <hi>Felix</hi> the third made a
Canon, that Temples should only
be consecrated by Bishops, and that
this ceremony of consecrating and
hallowing of Churches, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119049:28"/>
of them, was anciently used
by the Heathens, both by words
and by hand, is plain by <hi>Livy,
Ovid, Tibullus,</hi> and <hi>Cicero:</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places <hi>Livy</hi> writeth, <hi>Horatius
Pulvillus</hi> did dedicate the Temple
of <hi>Iupiter Capitoline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this second place, I am to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
some of the Ceremonies or
policies observed among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<hi>Flamines</hi> or Ministers which
are likewise in practise at this day
among the Christian Provinces:
That the Heathens had their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
or Priests, nothing is more
plain. And the Priests of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
the Brittish Heathens and
the <hi>Goths</hi> were the <hi>Druides,</hi> as at
large write <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Tacitus;</hi> And
the names of our Bishops, <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>
and <hi>Pontifex</hi> were used among
the Heathen, For that he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119049:29"/>
               <hi>Episcopus,</hi> that is, overseer of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and looked unto the poor,
and had care of their diet, is plain
by the words of <hi>Arcadius</hi> the civill
Lawyer in the Digests. And as <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuphrius</hi>
and others note by <hi>Cicero</hi>
in his Epistles where he writes
[<hi>Pompey</hi> would have him to be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of the Cities of <hi>Asia</hi>] and it
appeareth by the body of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, the office of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
came from the Heathen. Now
for <hi>Pontifex</hi> it is confessed by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that the Christians took that
name from the Heathen Ministers,
and so <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>zomenes</hi> deriveth it: <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanus</hi>
and others note the word
<hi>Diocese</hi> and the jurisdiction in this
kinde came from the Heathen.
Now as among the Christian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
worthily and of necessity,
there are degrees of the Clergy,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119049:29"/>
and one subordinate to another; So
likewise was it when our Ancestors
were Pagans, for they had their
<hi>Pontifex</hi> and <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> heir
<hi>Flamines</hi> and <hi>Arch-Flamines,</hi> as is
plain by <hi>Gratians Rhapsodie.</hi> And as
every particular god had his <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
his Minister; so as <hi>Gallius</hi>
notes <hi>Flamen dialis, Iupiters</hi> Priest
was the chiefest among the rest.
<hi>Beda</hi> writes <hi>Coyfy</hi> was the chiefest
Heathen Priest in the Kingdom of
King <hi>Edwyne,</hi> some of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Chroniclers that lived almost
400. years ago (<hi>Ptolomeus Lucenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>)
who wrote the lives of the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> writes in the life
of Pope <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> how the 3.
<hi>Proto-Flamines</hi> were converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
so many Arch-Bishopricks, tell
you how many <hi>Flamines</hi> and Arch-<hi>Flamines,</hi>
there were among the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119049:30"/>
               <hi>Brittans,</hi> and into what Bishopricks
and Arch-Bishopricks they were
afterwards translated; But no wise
man will beleeve their particular,
seeing they report actions done a
thousand years before their time,
having no former authour or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to warrant it. And the
Heathen Priests had some under
them which were not Priests, and
yet to serve in the Temples, they
were called <hi>Camilli,</hi> as appeareth
by <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and these
are in the nature of our Deacons.
The correspondent power of our
Clergy to that of the Heathen,
would best appear by opening of
the nature of the Heathen Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
To omit <hi>Livy, Plutarch, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat,
Alexander ab Alexandro, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Perkins</hi> in his comment upon
the rules of the common Law wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119049:30"/>
the Heathens assigned a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
jurisdiction to their Pontifices
namely, to look into the publique
and private cermonies of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to defend and interpret their
holy mysteries, to deliver with
what Altars, to which gods, with
what Sacrifices, upon what daies,
at which Temples praiers and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
should be, to see that every
one resorted to Church, and no
new ceremonies to be admitted,
that Vows be performed, Funerals
decently bestowed, Oaths and
Faith fullfilled, Holy Daies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
the Gods pleased. And
<hi>Wolphangus Lazius</hi> particularly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
out of Heathen Authours,
some the chief of their Clergy,
and Pontifices were to be skillfull,
especially in their common or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
Law; to judge of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119049:31"/>
of Sanctuaries, to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
Churches, and places of
buriall; That our Clergy hath in
like manner most of their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
every man must acknowledge:
But to adde unto these last recited
Authours concerning the Holy
Daies observed by the Christians
and Heathen, <hi>Thucydides</hi> notes,
it is a matter of necessity to have
Holy daies; That the Christians
begin their day from midnight,
saith <hi>Censorinus,</hi> it is common
with the Gentiles: And that our
Clergy foretell and declare the
Holy daies to the people; The like
was done by the Pontifices of
<hi>Rome,</hi> witnesseth <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
The Heathens call the daies
which are no Holy daies <hi>profesti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dies:</hi>
yea, that the Holy daies in
the Gentiles Kalendar lose onely
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119049:31"/>
their name, having upon the same
daies Christian Festivities appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(for the Apostles made no
Laws concerning Holy daies) is
known by <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who writeth
that the Heathen Holy daies of
<hi>Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and the rest of
the Heathen Gods were ordained
among the Christians Holy daies
for <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and other Saints.
<hi>Gregorius Nissenus</hi> in the Life of
<hi>Gregory</hi> for his great actions sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Thaumaturgus,</hi> reporteth,
that it was this <hi>Gregory</hi> that first
made the particular conversion of
the Heathen into Christian Holy
daies. And as among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
the day of the Martyrs or
Saints death, is the Holy day,
<hi>Dies martyrij, Dies natalis,</hi> so was it
among the Heathens: for by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
in <hi>Camillo,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119049:32"/>
               <hi>Romulas</hi> Death day for his
Holy day: Moreover, as among
the Christians, before a man can
be admitted into the Ministery,
there is enquiry made by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
Clergy of his ability and
worthinesse, and certain times,
and solemnities observed at the
Ordinance of the Minister: So
likewise was it amongst the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
or Ancestors; For as some of
the recited Authours mention, the
Heathen Pontifices were to be
skillfull in their profession and
Clergy-discipline: So further it
appeareth by <hi>Alexander ab Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andro</hi>
that if a man were a cripple,
or lame in any part of his body,
he could not be a <hi>Pontifex:</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Marcus Sergius</hi> being lame, he
was not suffered to be a <hi>Pontifex:</hi>
So <hi>Dionysius Halicarnasseus</hi> observs;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119049:32"/>
               <hi>Metellus</hi> being a Priest, and losing
his eyes, he was put out of his
Priesthood; So <hi>Gellius</hi> notes, their
Vestals were rejected if they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
wit or beauty: The time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for their ordination or ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
as <hi>Apuleius</hi> writeth, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Dies natalis sacrorum:</hi> The Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
that were used when the
Heathen Ministers were made, are
in part described by <hi>Erasmus</hi> in his
Book called <hi>Lingua,</hi> where he
writes their <hi>afflatus</hi> and <hi>exorcismos:</hi>
Nay as amongst our Clergy impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of hands is almost essentiall
to the office of a Minister, so you
may see how <hi>Livy</hi> treating of the
Ordination of <hi>Numa</hi> to be <hi>Pontifex,</hi>
delivered, upon <hi>Numa</hi> his head
hands were laid <hi>ab augure sacerdote:
Iulius Pollux</hi> in his <hi>Onomasticon</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseth
of the manner of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119049:33"/>
ordaining and ordained; As
at the making or electing of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Minister no Simony is to be
be used, so is it plain by <hi>Dionysius
Halycarnasseus</hi> no reward was to be
given for the making of Heathen
Priests: And as the Minister under
the Gospel may be deposed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
so that the Heathen may be
degraded, I have already shewed:
That he might resign is shewed you
by <hi>Cicero</hi> in his <hi>Brutus,</hi> where <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi>
might resign their <hi>Sacerdoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
and <hi>Livy</hi> writes their Vestals
after they were 30. years old might
give over their order; And as long
as our Ministers continue of the
Clergy, we know they have many
priviledges above the Laity. So
likewise that the Heathen Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
had is plentifully to be proved
out of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> out of <hi>Caesar,</hi> out
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119049:33"/>
of <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Camillo.</hi> Not unpoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly
therefore doth Cardinall <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi>
in one of his Tomes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the argument of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
to prove the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
are but straws, at large
maintain the Superiorities and
Preheminencies of the Bishop of
<hi>Rome</hi> to be due unto him: Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as he noteth at the conversion
of the Emperor of <hi>Rome</hi> from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism
unto Christianity, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of the Heathen <hi>Pontifex
Maximus</hi> were at last transferred
by the Emperour unto the Pope of
<hi>Rome:</hi> Again, look into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the government and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of the Heathenish Priests or
Sacrifices in their prophane Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and you shall see their good
orders are not refused by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Clergy; For you may learn
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119049:34"/>
by <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Philostratus,</hi> that
it is common to the Christians
with the Gentiles to use a white
garment upon their bodies in their
charges, because the <hi>AEgyptians</hi>
brought no kinde of woollen gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into the Temple. <hi>Gyraldus</hi> in
his <hi>Syntagma</hi> notes that they were
called <hi>Linigeri,</hi> more particularly
the Priests of the Heathen <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian</hi>
God <hi>Isis</hi> wore linnen Surpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as witnesseth <hi>Nicolaus Leonice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
and <hi>Apuleius</hi> in his Golden
Asse; <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
the Priests of <hi>Arabia</hi> were
clad in linnen garments, having
Miters on their heads: And gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
that other Heathen Priests did
so, may appear by <hi>Virgil</hi> who wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,

            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:119049:34"/>To proceed, As our Ministers
are bare-headed in the Saying of
Service, so generally was it used
amongst the Heathen Priests, as
appeareth by <hi>Macrobius;</hi> And that
God <hi>AEsculapius</hi> was worshiped
bare-headed, <hi>Plautus</hi> may witnesse,
<hi>Quis hic est qui aperto capite AEscula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium
salutat? Brissonius</hi> notes the
manner of the Heathen Priests be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
covered to sacrifice <hi>obn<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ato
capite</hi> came first from the <hi>Romans,</hi>
So is the opinion of <hi>Servius</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the second of the <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neids,</hi>
and this is formerly noted by
<hi>Polidore, Virgil</hi> out of <hi>Plutark:</hi> But
saving savour I take it, all <hi>Saturns</hi>
Priests though <hi>Romans</hi> were unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
at their time of Service or
Sacrifice; For so I learn cut of
<hi>Plutark,</hi> because he was the God
of Time, and discovereth and lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119049:35"/>
open concealed truth. And I
remember out of <hi>Alexander ab A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandro</hi>
that all the Priests of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,
Honoris, Opis,</hi> did sacrifice bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed;
He saith that <hi>AEneas</hi> was
the first that invented any Priest
should sacrifice covered, or with a
vail upon his face, lest their ears
and eyes might withdraw them
from doing their office: Hence
<hi>V<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>o</hi> his Etymology of <hi>Flamen</hi> is
justified, namely, that in <hi>Italy</hi> he
was so called, <hi>quia Capite velato

            </p>
            <p>Again, As the Christian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are not to suffer prophane or
excommunicate persons to come
into our Churches or Sacraments,
so likewise would not the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Clergy-men. For as in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
appeareth by <hi>Theodoret</hi> and

at their <hi>Eleusine</hi> and other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
the Heathen Priests cried
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which words
were used by <hi>Callimachus</hi> in his
Hymn, and by <hi>Lucian;</hi> These
words exclude especially three sorts
of persons, Atheists, Christians,
and Epicures; <hi>Vives</hi> notes out of
<hi>Servius</hi> the words of <hi>Virgils</hi> verse,
<hi>procul O procul este prophani,</hi> were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the Heathen Pontifices,
which is also further evident out
of <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro,</hi> who
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119049:36"/>
writeth when the people came to
sacrifice, the <hi>Pontifex</hi> or <hi>Flamine</hi>
asked them <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> many and good
men: <hi>Suetonius</hi> saying to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is familiar concerning <hi>Nero.</hi>
The Cryer using in their Temples
at sacrificing times to cry that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and ungodly persons must not
presume to offer sacrifice. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
as we using to preach in our
Churches, so the very Heathen
Priests inlightned only by naturall
reason, made morall exhortations
unto the people: For <hi>Diodorus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi>
writing that among the <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi>
when the King did offer
sacrifice with his Ball, the Priests
out of holy Books, after he had
praied for the health and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the King and State, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the counsels and actions of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119049:36"/>
men, by which the King
was warned to use his authority
and command godly and justly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the example of others:
He did further entreat (saith <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus)</hi>
of their piety towards their
God and Religion: And for that
purpose I gather out of <hi>Valerius
Maximus,</hi> that the people which
were to approach to the Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Altar, were commanded by the
Priests to lay aside out of their
minde all former hatred and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
or else not to approach. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Heathen Priests had mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
in their Temples in the time
of Service. Wherefore for the
generall, to omit <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Maximus:</hi> In particular <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi>
notes, it is a wonder in
<hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi> for offering Sacrifice
unto the gods without Musick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:119049:37"/>Now as the Christians use in
their Churches particular Psalms,
Hymns, and Prayers for set and
Festivall daies; and this <hi>Giraldus</hi>
sheweth in some part, that upon
chief and speciall daies, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
had their particular Verses,
Praiers and Hymns: But more
particularly <hi>Iulius Pollux</hi> writing
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, namely, the speciall
Psalmes, if I may so speak, and
to what gods they were due; It
is worth the remembring how
the Papists if a Bishop or Abbot
be canonized and die, they have a
glorious and speciall Antipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neme,
which begins, <hi>Ecce Sacerdos
Magnus,</hi> but if the Emperour or
King be canonized, his Antipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neme
is but the ordinary one for
a Father. This last I learn out of
a Treatise called <hi>Salome</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance.</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:119049:37"/>
And as for the bounding
of the Meares of Parishes, our
Clergy-Priests on their Rogation
week go on Procession. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
did the Heathen, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulations
for this purpose were
called <hi>Ambarvalia.</hi> And it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by <hi>Livy</hi> that the Heathen
Clergy might not be present at
the sentence of death. And <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
notes that <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi>
might not behold a dead body;
and at this day that this is and
hath been the custome of our
Clergy is full apparent.</p>
            <p>To conclude this particular
with the nature of the coercive
power used by the Heathen
Priests: <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> at large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth
of the Heathen Clergy of
this Island, and of <hi>France,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the <hi>Druides:</hi> if any private:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119049:38"/>
or publick person would not stand
to their Decrees and Orders, they
used to forbid him their Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which (saith <hi>Caesar</hi>) among
them is a most grievous punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the party so interdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is not onely accounted a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
person, and men are to shun
his company, but neither shall he
be capable of any honour, or
shall sue for his own right; Hence
by good probability came the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
used by the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Clergy anciently, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
by our English Clergy at
this day, seeing the punishment
and effect thereof is so lively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
as if <hi>Caesar</hi> had been an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of our age.</p>
            <p>For our Excommunication,
whether it be <hi>hominis</hi> or <hi>Canonis,</hi>
the former may be <hi>Clavis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119049:38"/>
errans,</hi> saith our Register, the
later not: Doth not onely barre
the excommunicated person from
entring into the Church at Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
time; and intimate a man
not <hi>in osculo communicare cum Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicato,</hi>
as it is in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Laws, which is the reason
<hi>Cyprian</hi> cals excommunicated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<hi>abstenti,</hi> because men refrain
their company: but also it seems
unto this day by the Canon Laws
of this Land, an excommunicate
person cannot bring an action, or
implead any other for his right
untill he be absolved. I note out
of <hi>Sophocles Oedipus,</hi> that they
which killed King <hi>Lucins</hi> were
excommunicated, which took the
same effect with the <hi>Druids</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication:
And for this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
saies <hi>Plato</hi> in his 9. and 10.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119049:39"/>
Book <hi>De Legibus.</hi> Pope <hi>Innocent</hi>
the 4. calleth Excommunication
the sinew of Ecclesiasticall Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
The Canonists account
Excommunication to be the Keys
of opening and shutting, which
Christ gave at his departure to
his Disciples: But the Vulgar
came not by many hundred years
by the travell, and employment,
and mission of this good Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt,
it is become <hi>Brutum</hi> or
<hi>Salmoneum fulmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the last place I am to speak
of the Religious Ceremonies of
the Ethnick people in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
that they are answerable to
ours. It is evident by <hi>Tertullian,
Clement, Apuleius,</hi> and <hi>Servius</hi>
upon <hi>Virgil,</hi> that the Heathens in
their Churches at the time of
their service, praying or sitting,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119049:39"/>
looked into the East, but the Jews
in their Churches, as appeareth
by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Ierome,</hi> praying, looked
into the West; and yet we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Gentiles custome, and
build our Churches to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
as the Heathens did: For
<hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruvius</hi> the Heathen Architect
commandeth that the face of the
Temples be built in the West,
that they which pray may have
their faces looking into the East:
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Bazils</hi> opinion then, that an
Apostolicall tradition of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to pray looking into the
East, is not absolutely currant.
<hi>Caelius</hi> notes, <hi>Hermes Trismegistus</hi>
praying looking upon the South,
the Jews looked upon the West,
the Christians (saith he) look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the East, which they
learned of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> as holding
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119049:40"/>
with <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the motion of the
Sun cometh from the East: I
reade in <hi>Athanasius</hi> that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
appointed the Christian
<hi>Churches</hi> to be built to the East, that
in praying they might behold Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise:
But to quit <hi>Tho. Aquinas</hi> his
third reason why the Christians in
praying look into the East, I fancy
the reason of our praying into the
East set down in the particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriber
of the City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
the Christians in <hi>Europe</hi> (saith
he) at their praiers looking into
the East, behold the Countrey
where Christ was conversant on
earth, and in so beholding may
behold the face of Christ upon
the Crosse looking upon them.
Yea, the Heathens in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
not only looked as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and praying held up their
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119049:40"/>
hands toward Heaven, as <hi>Livy</hi>
sheweth <hi>Camillus</hi> praying, and
<hi>Virgils Tendens ad sydera palmas</hi>
intimateth, but also in some points
praied as we do.</p>
            <p>To omit their joynt order and
decency of prayer out of <hi>Plutarch,
Ne Caledonij suis Tragedia renove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
And <hi>Iamblicus</hi> the Scholar
of <hi>Porphiry,</hi> as in generall he
writeth of the force of prayer,
so in particular he concludes all
their sacrifices and Religion are
better joyned and perfected by
Vows and Prayers; yea, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
of the Heathens as <hi>Marsilius
Ficinus</hi> notes upon <hi>Plato's Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
praied devoutly and in spirit
<hi>Flagrantia animi</hi> offering up their
Vows without any Characters,
which were invented to stir up
their affection by <hi>Orpheus</hi> and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119049:41"/>
               <hi>Zoroastes:</hi> And <hi>Alexander ab A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandro</hi>
writes, the Heathen man
which praied first did confesse
himself a sinner: that I observe
out of the <hi>Apopthegm</hi> of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<hi>Lacedemonian</hi> to God, and
not to the Priests, which the
Heathen <hi>Pontifex</hi> there confessed.
And that in their praiers <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ab Alexandro</hi> notes, they than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the gods for benefits recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and desired aversions of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils:
Yea, the Heathens used to
pray in their Churches for the
afflicted in body and minde, as
the Christians doe. For it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by <hi>Lucian,</hi> if any were
hurt, he would sacrifice to the
gods to be relieved: And by
<hi>Plutarch</hi> not only Sacrifices were
used among the Heathen for the
health of <hi>Pompey,</hi> but also Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119049:41"/>
celebrated Holy-daies in their
Temples for receiving great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of their gods, as the health
of <hi>Pompey;</hi> And the praier of
<hi>Arianus</hi> the Scholar of <hi>Epictetus,</hi>
as <hi>Lucian</hi> notes, when he would
call upon the gods, was in these
words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Lord have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
And as I reade <hi>Arrianus</hi> Book
called <hi>Peri-plus,</hi> a phrase of his is,
but now (God willing.) And
that <hi>Si Deus voluerit</hi> ought to be
the praier of the Christians ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by <hi>Iam. 3.</hi> And if the
Heathen praiers were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
for the present state, the
Heathen Magistrates caused them
to be amended; And this I learn
out of <hi>Valerius,</hi> that <hi>Scipio Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> the publick praier being
that the gods would make better
and more ample the state of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119049:42"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> he said, They are already
great enough, and devised the
form of praier to be, that the
gods would continue and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the state of <hi>Rome:</hi> Again,
as the Christian Magistrates afore
they used to consult of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
affairs use to resort to divine
service; so this was an expresse
Law to be observed by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Senators, is noted by <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi>
in <hi>Augusto:</hi> Nay, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

that their unchristian men
would call unto their gods, I
learn out of <hi>Hesychius,</hi> who saith,
that when they went to play at
dice, they would call upon their
god <hi>Mercury,</hi> in these words,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, good God: but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the Heathen praiers in their
Churches were very long; For
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119049:42"/>
our Saviour teacheth us when we
pray, Do not make long praiers,
as the Heathens do: For this last,
<hi>see Pererius</hi> in his note upon <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis;</hi>
And if we have not seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
weather we use particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
            <p>To this purpose you may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of <hi>Dionysius Halicarnas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus,</hi>
that the Gentiles proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and kept solemn Feasts for
the pacifying of their Panisme
gods.</p>
            <p>In this place it were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
to shew how among the
Infidels as well as the Christians,
the Civill Magistrate, especially
the King, the politique Father of
the people made Laws to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by the Heathenish Clergy:
Therefore a common Lawyer in
his Treatise of <hi>Salem</hi> and <hi>Bysance</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:119049:43"/>
may well note, that our King
<hi>Lucius</hi> (buried at <hi>Winton</hi>) had as
much prerogative over his <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>
or Ministers, being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
as Heathen: And this also
appeareth by <hi>Aristotle</hi> in  his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit.</hi>
by <hi>Virgil,</hi> by <hi>Strabo:</hi> But
this I reserve for another place.
And to omit <hi>Wolfangus Lucius</hi>
his discovery of <hi>Lent</hi> to have
been practised as a policy among
the Heathen; I shall conclude this
particular with the duty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
people observed towards their
Priests in relieving of them, and
paying them Tithes, as Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
do to their Pastors: but
much of this which I or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can write in this kinde, is
already quoted in some of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists
Writings, so covetous
men are in advancing their own
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119049:43"/>
particular: As the ancient elect
people of God afore the Law
given in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> paid Tithes
to their Priests, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
paid Tithes to the greater
Priest <hi>Melchisedeck:</hi> but where it
is said in <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. 32. the 10. sheep
shall go under the rod.</p>
            <p>A Rabbin writes that in those
daies the tenth sheep was marked
with Oaker; as they use Tyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at this day by putting sheep
out of the Fold: This I take to
be Rabbinicall and full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit:
So the very Heathen Priests
have by the consent of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or Parishioners alwaies a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
yea, and that with a tenth
part of their Revenues; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for the first-fruits <hi>Pliny</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
The <hi>Romans</hi> were not wont
to taste of their fruits or Vines,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119049:44"/>
afore the Heathen Priests had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
with them; and <hi>Porphiry</hi>
confesseth, That from all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
the first-fruits of the earth
were dedicated unto their gods.
In particular <hi>Euripides</hi> the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goedian
saith, that <hi>Diana</hi> had the
first-fruits of every thing that
the earth could yeeld. And <hi>Suidas</hi>
in <hi>verbo</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> writeth, The Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers

that guideth them in their

And <hi>Herodotus</hi> discourseth of the
Image of <hi>Delphos,</hi> which was
made for receiving of <hi>Primitia<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

terrae</hi> of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>Xerxes. Natalis Comes</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out of <hi>Aristophanes</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides,</hi>
the severall first-fruits
which were due to their severall
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119049:44"/>
gods. But in expresse terms the
tenth of their substance was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto the Heathen gods, and
consequently unto the Heathen
Priests: For so it appeareth by
<hi>Lio Camillus</hi> gave the tenth of
their Corn unto <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the
<hi>Ephesian Diana:</hi> but above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gods, they were given to
<hi>Hercules:</hi> for not onely by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
many men offered the tenth
of their substance unto <hi>Hercules;</hi>
but by <hi>Cicero</hi> in his <hi>Natura De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum,</hi>
Tithes were due unto <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules:</hi>
Nay, so commonly was
the tenth part offered unto <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi>
that <hi>Hercules</hi> part and the
tenth part were all one in signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
For <hi>Plautus</hi> writes, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi
det Rex Herculeanam partem:</hi>
Good Reason then I note <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
had to speak of Tythes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119049:45"/>
that were properly due unto <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>Dionysius Halicarnasseus</hi>
noteth, That <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi>
sent barrennesse upon the face of
the earth, because men intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and neglected the paying of
their Tithes: Hence then it is
more then colourable that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<hi>Brittans</hi> our Ancestors afore
the time of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> paid
Tythes to their Priests and <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ides,</hi>
whether the tenth part or
the eighth, <hi>Quota pars,</hi> I have not
to define, as holding with a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Lawyer
in his Treatise. Tithes
and Maintenance is due by the
Law of God and man, but not
<hi>Quota pars,</hi> namely, the tenth
part, unlesse in places accustomed
to pay it.</p>
            <p>Thus having chalked out the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119049:45"/>
Paths the Christians tread in,
having been formerly beaten by
the Gentiles, but first made (as
I told you) by the Jews, in whose
steps the Gentiles tread, although
awry.</p>
            <p>By this my instant and last
place they may perceive that even
since the time of the Gospel, and
that Christianity was admitted
into the world, the Heathens in
some things also began to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Christians: but it was
<hi>Diobolicâ instigatione,</hi> as the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
phrase in indictments is: A
touch of this given by <hi>Erasmus.
Tertullian</hi> in his time complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of the devils in Heathens i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitating
Christian Baptism. <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
&amp; ipse</hi> (saith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deles
suos.</hi> And after his time
you may perceive <hi>Sozomenes,</hi> but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119049:46"/>
especially by <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi>
in his Oration against <hi>Iulian,</hi> the
damnable Politique: <hi>Iulian</hi> the
Emperour thought it the best way
to extirpate Christianity, that the
Heathen in all points of service
and adoration should correspond
with the Christian service: but it
could not be effected (say they)
because the Christians by faith
inwardly and in spirit worshiped
God; <hi>Arnobius</hi> notes, because the
Christians God was not visible,
the Heathens call the Christians
Athiests.</p>
            <p>Out of this precedent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
the Travelling Bee, that
is, the honest Subject of this
Realm with me, will reason thus:
If our Fore-fathers which were
enlightned onely by naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
would have so good Orders
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119049:46"/>
in their Temples, at their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping
of false and superstitious
Gods: What great care should
Christians have for enjoyning and
observing of comely and godly
Ordinances in the worshiping of
the true and everliving God!</p>
