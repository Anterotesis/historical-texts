            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Some of the Presbyterian Priests or Teachers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> having some years ago writ a great bundle against us, the People of God, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> in a way of slighting and deriding some things of Truth, which above ten years ago I wrote, in <hi>Answer</hi> to a <hi>Paper</hi> (containing a pretended Answer to <hi>26 Queries</hi> of <hi>Geo.

<pb facs="tcp:33302:3"/>
(with two more) the said bundle, against us, was conveyed in Manuscript to divers hands (as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Answer to mine) which providentially after a long time was brought to my hands about four years ago, which then I perused, and collected the principal Heads and Passages in it, both of Doctrine, seeming Argumentation, and their Objections, which I have here inserted, in their own very words (as I have their Book in Manuscript to evince) and I wrote a Reply to each particular, for the clearing the Truth, and to manifest his and their abuse thereof; and their gross perversion of the holy Scriptures, together with their self Contradictions, which are very apparent and easie to be seen by any unbyassed: And not only their weakness and defection appears, but their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, against the <hi>Doctrine of Perfection</hi> (both as it relates to the <hi>truly Sanctified,</hi> and to their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> which these <hi>Presbyters</hi> accuse, not only with <hi>Imperfection,</hi> but with <hi>Sin</hi>) Their darkness against the Light of Christ within; Their cruel par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiallity against the <hi>free extent of Saving Grace;</hi> their sinful unbelief against the <hi>Sufficiency of the Holy Spirits teaching</hi>; their gross ignorance and scorn against <hi>Divine Inspiration,</hi> and <hi>Immediate Teaching</hi> in these dayes; their carnal mindedness (for their <hi>Traditional Ordinances</hi> of men) against
<pb facs="tcp:33302:3"/>
the <hi>Spiritual Dispensation of the Gospel,</hi> and <hi>New Covenant</hi> (wherein the <hi>Antitype</hi> of all, even the <hi>enduring substance,</hi> and <hi>heavenly things themselves</hi> are enjoyed by the <hi>clear sighted Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the day,</hi> beyond and above all <hi>Types, Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi> and <hi>outward Representations</hi> or <hi>Memen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's</hi> whatsoever.)

            <argument>
               <p>Here are the Doctrines and Principles of some of the Presbyterian Priests of <hi>Scotland</hi>; Collected out of a great Bundle in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script; Subscribed, <hi>Edw.

Oswald Harland, Edward Orde</hi>; Together with the Heads of many of his corrupt Reasons and perverse Arguments against the Truth and Scriptures, which are here detected, and the People of God, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> vindicated from his and their Aspersions, Calumnies and false Accusations therein.</p>

               <p>That's false. For, not Learning in it self simply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, do we renounce, but the absurd and corrupt Idolatrous Use of it, by men of corrupt mindes, who have not Learned of Christ, but in their Antichristian Spirit deny his Immediate Teachings.</p>

but against thy abusing and perverting of it, as will yet further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; and much unprofitable labour thou mightest have spared and forborn; whilst thy end was not to convert us, what was it for, to insult and boast over us?

               <p>Its both dangerous and unsound in thee and thy fellows, to oppose the Light and Spirits imediate teachings, and Kingdom within; which both teacheth sufficiently and opens the Scriptures, and leads into all Truth; and to Scoff at the true sence-hereof, though under the term Enthusiastick, or Enthusiasm (however iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically and reproachfully rendred by you) which if that be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and unfound, then is divinely inspired unsound.

               <p>All men are not taught that knowledg by the Light, because all obey it not, but many love darkness rather: The Apostles were sent to turn them from darkness to the Light, that therein they might know their Doctrine fulfilled, and be Christs disciples.</p>

               <p>The dimness was in the Persons that were to be turned, and directed to the Light, not in the Light it self; and the Apostles went by virtue of the Light and Gifts in them, for the help of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and not the Light, for their sufficiency and help was in it, and from it, which was not outward nor natural; and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Gifts, Teachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to continue till we all come to the unity of the Faith, and fulness of the stature of Christ.

               <p>It is not from any feared conscience, nor shameless
boldness for me to assert the Gospel was before the Scripture; and if <hi>Mark</hi> intended his Writing (or what he writ) to be the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, then it follows, that the Gospel of Jesus Christ did not begin before <hi>Mark</hi> wrot that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Revlation,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33302:18"/>
and then how doth he mention what was written in the Prophets, and tell of the Gospel of Jesus Christ? And did not Jesus Christ shew forth his power and preach the Gospel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of <hi>Mark</hi> was writ? But seeing thou hast taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, both to give thy meanings to Scriptures, and pretends to compare one Scripture with another, I may have liberty to tell the other Scriptures in this case, as in, <hi>Luke.</hi> 1.1. he saith, <hi>Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things, which are most truely believed amongst us,</hi> and ver. 3. <hi>It seemed good unto me also,</hi> &amp;c. And, Act. 1.1. <hi>The former Treatise have I made O Theophilus</hi>: So what they writ, it was a Treatise or Declaration of things spoken, done, and believed, and much of which relates to the historical part of things and matters; but if the written Declaration, Treatise of things, or Scripture without, be the Gospel, then hireling Priests may be silent, and let people read them, without spending their mony of them for their various meanings, traditional Interpretations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Gospel ought not to be added to, nor another preached; how-be-it there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between true Preaching, proceeding from the immediate Spirit and Power of God; which <hi>Paul</hi> was a Minister of, and the Scriptures or Writings outward, without the Spirit or Life; for <hi>Paul</hi> was not a Minister of the Letter, but of the Spirit, and New Testament.</p>
               <p>And is not a living Ministry and Voice, especially where it lives by vertue of the Power of God, from whence it immediatly comes of more force and authority then the Letter, or Writings, which Scriptures signify?

                  <hi>Paul</hi> did speak unto the <hi>Romans after the manner of men because of the infirmity of their flesh,</hi> Rom. 6. He did also signify the several states which he had passed thorow, as how it was with him before the Law came, and how when it came, and his warfare, as also his deliverance; so that I say again and still affirm, that <hi>Paul</hi> could not be in all those states he mentions, or represents to the <hi>Romans</hi> at one and the same time (when he so writ, as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time) as thou very blindly hast asserted, argued from hence, and caviled against the truth of what I said, and the most stress of what thou sayest for reason, or proof against me, is as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33302:23"/>
much as a Child might say that has learned his Accidence, <hi>Viz.</hi> that the present Tense is not the preterperfect Tense; whereas if it must be taken for granted from thy feeble reason, that <hi>Paul</hi> was in all those states at one and the same time, then he was both <hi>carnal sold under sin</hi> and yet <hi>spiritual,</hi> a faithful Apostle that could preach in the fullness of the Gospel; as if <hi>carnal sold under sin,</hi> and <hi>spiritual,</hi> made free from the Law of sin and death, by the Law of the Spirit of Life were both one, but, <hi>to be carnal sold under sin</hi> was miserable bondage, not consistent with his Saintship and Spirituallity: And when he said, <hi>With me to will is present, but how to perform that which is good, I know not</hi>; if that was his present condition, then (as thou arguest) because spoke as in the present Tense; Then what did <hi>Paul</hi> at that time in writing that Epistle? Did he perform that which is good, yea or nay? If he did, Then knew he what he did? Or, did he do he knew not what in it? Surely thy Doctrine doth strangly misrepresent and wrong <hi>Paul,</hi> that Servant of Christ, and the Lords-Freeman, who knew the Mysteries of Christ, though sometimes, <hi>he became as weak to the weak,</hi> &amp;c. But if it should be objected, as some vainly have done, that there was an unregenerate part in <hi>Paul,</hi> of which he speaks in those cases; then this would make much of his Epistles to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from an unregenerate or carnal part, which were gross and contrary to their own Doctrine. And to that saying, if he had spoke to them as weak; he would have told them he had bin under such a state, but he was delivered from it; to the very same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he did speak to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. <hi>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of the sins which were by the Law did work in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death; but now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held, that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.</hi> So that its plain, he told them both of his captivity and of his deliverance, speaking in the fore-part of the chapter plainly in several things, with relation to what he was in the flesh in the time past, and also how he was delivered; and so, <hi>both the body of sin and death, and the law of sin,</hi> he came to be delivered from <hi>by the law of the spirit of life in Christ; through whom also he was more then a Conqueror.</hi>

               <p>He is sometime a dying before dead, if at their death, be upon their death or dying (as thou sayest) yea, some are many houres, having the symptomes and pangs of death upon them, before they are dead, and in this sence I supposed thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest, by saying at their death they are freed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it was upon their dying, when the throws or pangs of death are upon them; or, when we commonly say a person is a dying, when he breathes very weakly, faintly, and sometimes with short breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, a little before breath is quite gone, and then there must needs be a little space in this Life, before the person is quite dead.</p>

               <p>A false inference put upon my words, which doth not at all follow; for when the Soul and Body are separate, or the Soul is gone out of the Body, this is after death, now upon dying is not after death; for when the Body is without the Spirit it is dead; so, if thou wilt have it, that when the Soul and Body are separate, the Beleiver is then free from sin; tis not in this Life, and then; Where's the <hi>Popes</hi> Purgatory?

               <p>And to my saying, that its not commanded under the New Covenant to Baptize Infants, thou replyest the Apostle <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. sayes, <hi>That those to whom that promise that God would be their God, and the God of their Seed, should be baptized, but to Believers and their Seed, he saith that promise belongeth,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>And another sorry shift and come off, in the thirty eight <hi>Page</hi> is concerning the Jewes that fell into gross sins, <hi>who all drank of the Rock, which was Christ,</hi> from hence thou sayest, that to profess Christ is called a drinking of Christ, and where provest thou that Doctrine, that to profess Christ is a drinking of Christ, this is a very easie way thou hast prescribed for drinking of Christ if to profess him be it, and then all that profess him drink of him by this Doctrine, the falshood whereof we need not say much to.</p>
               <p>But whereas thou sayest concerning those <hi>Israelites, That ate the same spiritual bread, and drank the same spiritual drink, that drank of the Rock which was Christ,</hi> how-be-it thou confessest they fell into gross sins, as is cleared from the History of the Books of <hi>Exod.

               <p>And thy saying for Infants Baptisme, that it is the Seal of the Covenant, and to be given to those that are within the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; but, Are Drunkards, prophane Persons and their Seed, and whole Parishes within the Covenant? Compare thy matter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Yet thou hast confessed the Spirit is the inward Seal, but sayest Baptisme is the outward Seal, and then instead of proof, askest why may not the Covenant now have outward Seales joyned with the inward Seal of the Spirit; How faintly comest thou off here? And, Where provest thou sprinkling In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants a Seal of the New Covenant, or that the Covenant hath two

such Seales as thou implyest, and how knowest thou that its joyned with the inward Seal of the Spirit upon the Children of drunkards and prophane persons, or on such as turn drunkards, swearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who come under this thy Seal, which hath no impression of Scripture or Divine Authority in it; but now seeing that to gloss over thy groundless Tradition and Confusion uttered in mantaining it, thou hast often made use of divers Scriptures, which the <hi>Baptists</hi> were wont to bring for Baptizing or Plunging such as repent or believe; I have not entered here into controversy with rhee about that point, it being not thy own, but onely thou wouldest make it serve for a cover; yet when thou turnest <hi>Baptist,</hi> and intendest to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in pleading for Plunging believers, thou mayest let me or us know, and that point probably may be treated of, as whether or no it be of necessity to Salvation, and so of continuance to the true Church: But however, under the sence of the Baptisme of the Spirit which baptizeth into one body, we do know present sattis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and do acquiess in our Spirits above the Traditions of men and Rudiments of the world.</p>
