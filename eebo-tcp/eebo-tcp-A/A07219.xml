            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the God-head, being before all time, the maker of time, and all things that increase in time, there is number: The Trinity of persons and vnity of God-head do declare as much. For although god be a most singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diuine essense in himselfe, yet hath he proportioned number in himselfe, vnse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably vnited in his God-head: which the diuines call the Father, Son, and holy Ghost. And the ancient Philosophers cal three inbeings, The Father, the actiue, or inworking vertue, power &amp; nature: The Son, they cal the word, speech, or reason.</p>
               <p>The holy Ghost, Loue. These Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers haue striued wonderfully in this labor, wherin they haue waded exceding deep. <hi>Amelius</hi> the disciple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Plotin,</hi> is said to name the trinity, three things, or three vnderstandings. <hi>The Beer, the Hauer, and the Seer.</hi> The Trinity is expressed in these words, <hi>Power, vnderstanding, &amp; wil</hi>; which Trinity maketh a full number of things belonging to a mind: <note place="margin">

leaue off this kind of descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude with <hi>Plotinus</hi>; There are saith he, three chiefe Inbeings: <hi>The one, or the God</hi> 2. <hi>The vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding or wit.</hi> 3. <hi>The soule of the world.</hi> And of these three, saith he, it is not for any man to speake, without praying vnto god: <hi>And without setling his mind afore vnto quietnes. And if it be demanded (saith he) how one of them begetteth an other; it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that we speak of euerlasting things: &amp; therefore we must not imagine any temporall begetting: for this begetting which we speake of, saith he, betokeneth but onely cause and order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Trinitie and first, and euerlasting number, hath proportioned &amp; appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, other numbers, &amp; in them a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous order. If any aslee a reason hereof, I answere: It was the power, the wisdome, vnderstanding, &amp; wil of God, to expresse himselfe in this compleat number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in one vnity of godhead. By this nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber three, was the whole world created, &amp; al things innumerable: whose mouers are only known to the creator himself.

There haue repaired that downfal; The Father, the giuer: the Sonne the gift, and the holy Ghost the comforter.</hi> In the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of three, is a perfect conclusion of all things. Much may be said of the nomber and orders made by this trinitie; As fire, water, ayre, and earth: to make the world, the <hi>Spring, Somer, Autum, Winter:</hi> to make the yeare, East, West, North, South: to quarter the world, Creatures, going cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, flying, swiming, w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infinit milio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of celestial &amp; terestial bodies, which he kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, preserueth, boundeth in, &amp; holdeth within this Trinity.

The next creation is of the world: which consisteth of things, in number &amp; place: The earth, the water, the Elements, the Sun, the Moon, the stars, the beasts, birds, fishes; and lastly man: as is said in holy Writ, <hi>Male and female, made he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> In all these there is number: in respect of these diuers creatures that were made, there is number in the reasonable creatures, male &amp; female.

               <p>These opinions may be answered thus.

               <p>Time properly of itselfe, is neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue nor passiue: It is neither escense nor substance, and scarcely can be said to haue existence.

               <p>Among the number of things, that haue either being, sense, or mouing man is. But besides this, man hath a certaine <hi>Genus,</hi> or kind specular alone by himself: and so is among the number of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable creatures. A kinde and number, peculiar and alone proper vnto his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and kind. And out of that reason, is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth two other conclusions, place, and time, in this world, amongst the other creatures, so long as the sensitive parts remaine in life. And after that, place and endlesse continuing in an other world. And in respect of immortalitie, man is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10474:19"/>
either in number, place, &amp; time, amongst the elect: or, number, place, and time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reprobates. Now, for that <hi>I</hi> so generally finde, that reasonable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall part, to bee so vniuersally caried away, seduced, and ouer-ruled by the meere sensitiue powers, entertaining the euill and forbidden things, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the good, allowable and lawfull: I haue made thus bolde to distinguish betweene these two times, and to giue this cauiat to the possessers thereof, that they striue not ouermuch, to possesse or entertaine the number, place, and time, of these transitorie and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blessings, as that thereby they loose, and faile to bee of the number, place, and time, of the elect: and bee cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the number of the damned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of vtter perdition.

And so much the more daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is the sicknesse.</p>
               <p>To come neerer to this point. It is plaine by sundry places of the holy Bible, that God alone, numbreth, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, &amp; diuideth: he measureth times, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and seasons: Therefore let him stand for the numberer, placer, disposer, and appointer of all creatures, their places,

times, seasons, their beginings, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, finishings, chaungings, or ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. And let all his creatures be then numbered, placed, and limited, according to their creations, nature, qualities, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, not striuing against the purpose of his diuine prouidence, or adding, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing, too, or from, what hee hath appoindted or created.</p>
               <p>To discouer this, <hi>I</hi> must distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and the other creatures, and the causes and markes they tend too, and ayme at: together, with the admirable blessing of reason: and to what measure the capacity of man thereby extendeth, for the searching out the natures, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, times, seasons, places, and vses of the other creatures, which could not bee but out of a kind of immortall Nature, aboue all other creatures.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied, but that God hath created all things, first for his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honour, wherein he appointeth seuerall vses and seruices: And within the compasse of this dutie, are all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as well men and Angels, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

But take heed of the abuse. Among many other ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vses of mettals; Of yron and steele, they make kniues to cut meat: but it is not intended to cut mens throats: they make sickles and sithes to cut down corne and grasse, without intent to cut mens legs. The like may be concluded of the other mettals, and the vse of them. Wherefore to finish that point, gold and siluer being the finest mettals of the rest, are searched out, refined, &amp; propotioned to passe betweene men at a value and rate, for the prouiding of victuall, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and other necessaries to defend the bodie, from heate, colde, and hunger: not that of themselues, simply by themselues, they are either diet, apparell, or prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ont

to defende winters colde, or sommers heate, but rather an incomberment, then comfort, if men be enforced to weare or vse them next their naked bodies, or to feede of their solide substances. It shall be necessarie therefore, that wee doe not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose or employ the same, to generall cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures bege: or bring forth any new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary &amp; against his own nature: or to make it valuable with the least hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine and reasonable Creature that euer was, or shall be borne.</p>
               <p>Let vs looke further, &amp; see whether we can find any other benefits, if these be not sufficient to satisfie vs. And as we began at the lowest, so let vs ascend vpwards.

               <p>By the comfort and vertue of these, are all the inferiour bodyes, comforted, cherished, relieued, succoured, and made able to performe their seuerall duties.

               <p>Surely none, neither can nor will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this to be true: And yet we see dayly many thousands want, famish, and pine to death, for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of these earthly necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

               <p>This is the condition of the Sunne, the Moone, the Firmament, and all the whole garnished and rich decked skies, with infinite numbers of Starres. And of all the creatures in this Sphere of Elements, they are: and yet they know not, neither what, nor whereof, nor to what purpose they are: what then auaileth this glorious richnesse vnto themselues: Surely nothing.</p>
               <p>This doth wonderfully exalt the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, worthinesse, and estimation of man, and of his reasonable soule: yea, of the meanest of all the race of man, aboue all these creatures, either Coelestiall or tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall; in that he: vnderstandeth them all,

               <p>These benefites God hath bestowed on Man, principally &amp; chiefely to serue his turne, and to instruct and teach him, in this first <hi>life,</hi> which shall finish and ende. Behold, there are further matters, and benefits bestowed and prouided for Man besides these; the meanest, farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the greatest of these: They are such, as I dare not define or treate of; and therefore with reuerence leaue them to the Readers consideration, with such descriptions as they are left to me.

               <p>This is not all, <hi>I</hi> say, that God hath done for man: for beside his creation, he doth still by his holy hand, vphold and support him, he hath receiued him to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, being abiected for vsing the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God contrary to his ordinance: he hath set his holy Angels to preserue &amp; defend him: his only Son to loose his life to redeeme him: his most gratious holy spirit to be his comfort and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.

               <p>BY the precedent Circumstances, it appeareth, that among all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vnder Heauen, (man onely excepted) nothing is seene to bee made for it selfe: nor man onely for himselfe, but for the seruice of God. The Sunne shineth and heateth, but not for it selfe. The Earth beareth, and yet hath no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite thereby. The Windes blowe, and yet they sayle not.

The Water beareth the shippes, and yet knoweth not the waight thereof. Al these serue onely to the glory of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of man.

of God, being more then many men wil at this day acknowledge. But to proceede to the Arts, albeit they are well knowne, yet let me recite some particulars. By Reason, first the generall knowledge is attained. Then Reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath proportioned things into diuers parts: First, in consideration of their natures, &amp; worthinesse: secondly, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration of their numbers and places: thirdly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their vses and employments.

Let vs proceed a little further: By the motion of the Sun, which surroundeth the world in 24 hours, they haue proportioned the circumference of the world, to be 360 degrees: they diuide euery degree, into 60. miles: with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which I omit. By these Arts, they haue found that the sun in the whole yeare, maketh her furthest point, both toward the North, and South pole: and thereupon they haue diuided that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10474:29"/>
time into xii. monethes. To euery of these twelue monethes, they proportion an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed number of daies; to euery day, 24 hours: to euery houre 60. minutes. And so reducing these learnings to one point or head, they proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as wel Latitude and Longitude of place, as motion &amp;<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>passage of time: together with the influence and aspects of the planets and starres; in such sort, as if this mistery were vnknown in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mans vnderstanding, it were impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be found out. And because the sun passeth alwaies fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the East, to the West, and neuer fully reacheth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> point of the North, or South, they haue determined, &amp; diuided the world into 5. seueral zones. The 2. remote parts of North, &amp; South, they call the cold parts: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middle, they cal the hot or burning zone: the other two, are the temperate parts. To this they haue likewise added a girdle, that goeth ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart the hot &amp; two temperat zones: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding the same into 12. equal parts, ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing a seueral Lord, or Gouernor of these houses: limiting the sun 30. daies trauel, to passe throgh euery of mese same: w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other admirable &amp; necessary lernings
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:10474:30"/>
And out of these Arts, it is well knowne, they haue truely set down the Eclipses of the Sunne and Moone, the reuolution of the Starres, stabilitie of the North, and South poles, &amp; the motion of the others: by which, all nauigation is maintained: the compasse, carde, &amp; needle, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: nay the ship it selfe, and all other buildings, both of land and sea, deuised, framed, &amp; fashioned: Al cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries known and seuered, and euery mans possession diuided, one from an other: Astronomy, and Astrologie, haue taken their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation there. And how much the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians knowledges are increased there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, or what defects they would finde by the want therof, let themselues iudge. But to be short: These Arts are the onely and true directors of the whole course of mens liues, as wel in gouernment, as obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: in distribution, as well as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing: for there being diuersitie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, places, dignities, and worthinesse, so ought there to be a measure and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, in proportioning their contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Many thousands of admirable
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10474:30"/>
blessings would follow Reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if measure and proportion were truely kept. For then should the King haue the supreme place: The magistrates, their due honour. The subiects true and equall iustice: and euery man his owne right, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, checke, or controlment. But Originall reason is so weakened and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, that these things are not to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for: mens natures are preuaricated, and intemperate disires so bent to disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; that poore Queene <hi>Reason</hi> hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle place, and her proportions little estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and lesse vsed. <hi>Reason</hi> of it selfe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth, and concludeth, that the heauens are imbowed like a vault about the lower parts. And the lower parts, circumuala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and incompassed within the heauens conuexitie. The earth, as the flower or planckes to goe vpon, and retaine the massie bodies of men, and the mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolued numbers of Creatures, there on residing: And the heauens as the wide drawne, and large extended Canopie, to couer all these, with many included es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences and beings: all seruing to exercise

Reason withall: the more fully to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the incomprehensible greatnesse, goodnesse, &amp; bountie of the Creator, and the worthinesse of mans originall Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But as is before discouered, this perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reason, &amp; innocencie is lost: cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is creptin, and taken vp right and true <hi>Reasons</hi> roome: and had so much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, blemished, darkened, &amp; obscured, <hi>Reasons</hi> faculties, that euen the arts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, were almost forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; put to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuion: &amp; great labour hath bene vsed to reuiue, recontinue, and vphold, or make knowne these former Arts and Science.</p>
               <p>Concerning this point: Let vs take a short viewe of the beginnings of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

Which caused that the Romanes in many yeeres after, durst not aduenture farre ouer into that Countery: Wherevpon it is conceiued, that all the auncient Townes and Cities, which stood vpon the Riuer of <hi>Rheine</hi> and <hi>Danowe,</hi> toward <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> were erected and built for defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Germanes.

               <p>Besides, it seemeth they were but in the beginning of the discouery of these Arts: they vnraked the ashes, and opened the fire, and by the light which they tooke, many haue since lighted their candles.

the nature of mans reason, and reason of mans nature. <note place="margin">Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Nature or Reason of man.</note> But to make and Create of nothing, so worthy a Creature as man is aboue nature: which <hi>Cicero</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when he said: There was a certaine might or power, which had a care of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and which would not haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten him, to fall into the mischiefe of endlesse death, after he hath outworne the great and innumerable aduersities and toyles of the world: For, faith he, <hi>We be not created by hazarde.</hi> Which sheweth directly, that <hi>Cicero</hi> did reach into an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; that there was a greater bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and perfection in the creation, then retained in the nature of man: for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth, that neither misery in this world, nor the mischiefe of an endles death, were the ends vnto which such worthy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were first made.

               <p>To bee briefe in this point, because the natures of things are in some sorte before discouered; I will only touch some fewe points.</p>
               <p>This great worke-master and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of things and natures, hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their kindes, natures, conditions, and effects: their increases, generations, and propagations; for hauing set the Heauens in motion, they continually moue without ceasing: but in this, there is noe increase, nor generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>There is still but one Sunne, and one Moone: notwithstanding all the coniunctions since the worldes begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>There are no more Starres then were made at one instant.</p>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10474:38"/>
of nature it selfe. The earth bringeth forth the vegitatiue things, but not by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The sensitiue things increase by generation, all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mencing from a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of things of their owne natures: which sheweth the worthinesse of this Creation, and the admirable worke that so infinite numbers of things should bee made of nothing: and so admirably composed, and put in order by a worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master, that had neither matter, stuffe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, model, nor patterne for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.</p>

The earth cannot be metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or turned into an incorporiall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, neither is it her nature to produce or bring forth beasts or men: for creation hath appointed euery kindes a seuerall manner of increase. The Fowles of the Ayre doe not bring forth swine, nor the Tyger ingender Doues, nor men beget Bears or Lyon: men ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be Gods. It is impossible for the foule of man to cease or giue off his being, &amp; to be of the same nature. The Hynd ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not bring forth egs, nor the Ostridge be the Dam of the Roe Bucke. Euery thing hath his appointed nature, which it can neither change nor leaue. And because we haue spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of number, place, and time, let vs in this place consider what they are, or at least what they are not. The better to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their employments, they are not as is before recited, any matters, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, natures, nor essences, in respect of themselues: neither haue they pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to procreate or bring forth any thing. They are onely the vessels, engines, mouldes, frames or organs, wherein
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10474:39"/>
things are cast, fashioned, placed, sorted, and ordered.</p>
               <p>Out of these, in respect of nature, can proceede nothing: no not so much as themselues, issue not, nor come not of themselues: but are respected, according to the motions, course, order, or number of creatures, that passe in, by and through them. If a man shall offer to bring vp the Foxe whelpe, among the sheep, euen from the first time of his littering: It is neither the placing him among these creatures, nor the vse of time, will quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his greedy nature of deuouring his fellowes. The like may bee saide of all other Creatures, and their kindes and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>It is against nature, for Creatures of one kind, to destroy one an other: which is a great argument of preuarication of the nature and reason of man: in that they cease not continually and against nature, to worke one an others confusion. Let vs proceed a little further: &amp; set these three, number, place, and time, to work simply of themselues: they neither ingender, nor
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10474:39"/>
bring forth any things: albeit, in them, and by them, that is, in their moulds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit numbers are generated and brought forth. Let vs sprinckle a fewe holy consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations in these causes, to make them the more sauery; least striuing to set our corrupt reason ouer high, we cast it to the dust. As in the first Creation, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst nature, that there should be any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or foule matter, or defect, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in mans nature: So now, nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted, &amp; altogether polluted by disobedience, It is both against, &amp; aboue this corrupt nature, that any perfection should remaine in man: Albeit, there are that maintaine a sparke or remnant of perfection, of the first originall nature, to remaine: whereby it may againe worke his former perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is against cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature: as much as to sunder &amp; take apart wines from water, after it is once mingled: for no polluted thing entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, can afterwards be clensed from this polutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dye wil neuer be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken cleane out of the white cloath. It is to be obserued, that Christ in ministring

               <p>It is vnnaturally holden, that they did really and naturally eate his very flesh, and drink his very blood: This is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst nature.</p>
               <p>First, it is against the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be the thing which it represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: or for the thing signified, to be the signifier, or betokener of that which is signified.

For, as he was ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so was he local. Now to deliuer himself, &amp; to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and yet remaine in the same substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, of and by himselfe, at the same instant, is against nature. Besides, that he should so exhaust or drawe his most precious blood, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bread (which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be his real &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly body) was eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

there should bee therein no parte of his bloud: and more, that himselfe should be at one instant absolute man, &amp; at the same instant, see himselfe visibly eaten with the teeth of men, in distinct and seuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This is against the nature of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, and so against both. For Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not miracles, nor natures to bee changed. Besides, in miracles, things did not at one, and the same instant, containe two seuerall natures: nor one nature in two seuerall places: as in the miracle at the mariage: as long as the water remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned water, it was not wine: and after it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came wine, it was no longer water: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it wine and water, all at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, though turned in lesse then a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: neither was it water in two seuerall places, nor wine in two places, otherwise then by diuiding it into seuerall cupps or vessells. I make bolde to giue a touch of this misterie, which I holde to be of deeper consideretion then mans reason can reach into: which being a matter of spirit, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be apprehended but by the eye of the same spirit, hauing regard to the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d life before spoken of.

If this be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, what will follow of the next que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion? In this case, though time bee not agent, nor the passiue part thereof, yet you must giue this great bellied Lumpe, time to worke to perfection, and bring forth her great litter, brood, or spawne. But it will be answered, that Reason and Art, hath found a meanes, how to helpe Nature in this cause, and to supply the defect of heate by fire, for separating of the purer mettal from the drosse. Admit this, yet it must bee yeelded, that these Mines were substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tially in the bowels of the earth: who in time as is affirmed, wold haue brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth: so as Reason and Art, had to work vpon. And in this case, you must likewise giue Art and Reason, time to worke their effect, and that by degrees and meanes: so that Reason nor Art cannot worke, but vpon substances,

and by meanes, which in the ensuing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is not allowed.

               <p>After that the mettal is taken out of the earths belly, it can be no longer her child, neither can the nourish or make it grow.

is a deuise that Time should cause mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to yeeld increase: wherein they are driuen to vse the helpe and labour of man.</p>

The law being to take construction most strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and straightly for repressing of Vsury.</p>
               <p>The law it selfe is a prohibiting law, in no iote giuing libertie, but repressing. So are the wordes <hi>Negatiue,</hi> and forbidding. And vpon that reason, none of these words can be strained to make any tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. These wordes in the close of the sentence: <hi>And no more greater gaine, or summe thereupon to be had</hi>; Do sufficiently explaine, that by no means 100. li. by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny course to be put out, may yeeld aboue the gaine of 10. li. for a whole yeare: But 100. li. put out for 3.6.9. months, and the money and vse taken at that time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the yeare, may and doth yeeld a greater gaine then the rate of 10. li. for a whole yeare.</p>
               <p>The Reason is, the Lender may
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10474:46"/>
again dispose the same principal and vse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for more gaine within the same yeare: and so not saued by the words nor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Lawe.</p>
               <p>Let vs see how Reason can bring the former words to this conclusion. <hi>And so after that rate and not aboue: of, or for a more or lesse summe: or for shorter or longer time.</hi> These words being in body of the clause, haue refere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to a rate: which rate is before expressed; that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orbearing of 100. shall not raise aboue 10. pounds, for one whole yeare.</p>
               <p>In this behalfe, the borrower is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, but the Lender: for the words are; <hi>No man shall take aboue</hi> 10 <hi>pounds, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby appeareth, that as the Lawe is made onely against the taker, so is there no libertie for him to take any thing, that may exceed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rate of 10. for a whole year. Otherwise, this mischiefe would ensue: the <hi>Lender</hi> would depart with his monie, for one, two, or three moneths, to one man, and then receiue his mony and vse, and deliuer the same to an other debtor: and so monthly, or quarterly, or at his pleasure, raise his benifite vpon the vse of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10474:46"/>
his vse mony within the yeare, contrary to the meaning of the Lawe: by often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing &amp; placing it within one yeare: which vnder correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can by no means be construed to bee saued by the wordes of the Lawe.</p>
               <p>A word or two, concerning the rate which <hi>I</hi> take to be double. A rate of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and a rate of time. These two, are specially to be considered: for seeing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot worke this matter, you must permit Time to doe what office it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to performe. To this purpose the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether there be one, or more takers, at one or more times, within the yeare, is not material: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> respect is, seeing they haue nothing to raise this rate of money, but their industry, imployment, and labour, with a limitation of a rated time for the vse thereof: that they may haue the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all these without abatements. For the eye of Reason in this behalf, doth not regard how often the mony be letten within the yeare, nor to how many or fewe persons: but that the forbearing of 100. li. for a whole yeare, shall yeeld the Lender no more or greater gaine 10. li.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10474:47"/>
And in this behalfe, is specially to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, the seuerall offices of the Lender and Borrower. The Lender departeth with his money vpon time, to raise his benefite: the Borrower, bestoweth his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by merchandising the money, with diligence, in time to raise the increase vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vse of the money: If the Lender will take away any part of the time, limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the statute, he doth not then allow the Borrower his full rate of time: and therefore of a consequent, hee ought to abate it out of the rate of his vse mony: for in this cause, those two, that is, the rate of time, for which the vse of time is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, and the rate of money taken for vse, must euer iumpe, to make the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning euen. And common and ordinary reason yeeldeth, that no man will giue so much for any thing to bee payed at the end of one moneth, as hee would, if his paym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Wherefore, in a word or two, let me remember againe the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene contemplation and action. Any that worketh barely by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit, may pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice by conceite: but hee that will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any act indeed, must haue matter and stuffe: figures and cyphers, make no summes of money. Therefore if the Lender will haue consideration, he must dispose of his money and time: that hee, who will haue mony &amp; time, may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter giue consideration. In this cause ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the matter of Art, &amp; the point from whence <hi>I</hi> conceiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> error to arise, is to be looked into. It seemeth the Arithmatitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hath wrought only by diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the first
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:10474:48"/>
part of diuision, there are two requisite things the <hi>Diuidende,</hi> &amp; <hi>Deuisor,</hi> which in this corr must be essenciall &amp; substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciall, and not by conceit and imagination. Let vs see, mony must needs be the <hi>Diuidend,</hi> and time the <hi>Deuisor.</hi> Put the case a man le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth a 100. li. for one month, what may the Lender take? The Arithmatition saith, a whole yeere will yeeld 10. li. then he diuideth time, by time: One yeere into 12. parts: so that here time is both the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidend</hi> and <hi>Deuisor</hi>: then he diuideth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by time: that is 10. li. by 12 months, &amp; he findeth the 12. part of 10. li. to be 16. s.8.d. which he allotteth to one moneth. The rule is true, but not to be vsed in this case: for Reason the founder of Art, will shew, that he hath no warrant to measure by this rule: in that he hath no essentiall Deuisor: for if you marke it, hee wanteth 11. months of his yeare, <note place="margin">Reason and Art; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so he worketh a substantial <hi>Diuidend,</hi> of 10. li. by an imagined <hi>Deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi> of 12. moneths, when there is but one occured: but his course should be, as in the case of contribution: the shorter

               <p>And on this point, doth Reason and Art conclude, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:10474:49"/>I haue drawn these Tables, as patterns or Modells to shewe and discouer, the truth from the false, and to manifest how truth and Art still drawe to one Period. I the more insist vppon this for my sole example, because it is a matter so directly against nature: and sophistically brought into the danger and ouerthrowe of mens estate: for all the world must confesse, that in this case, as hauing regard to matter of substance, nothing is enforced to produce something. And though I meant not to fill this place with law arguments, yet let me borrow a word for further explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my meaning.

It is not vnknown that one attainted by act of Parliament, part of his lands sold: time and the act of Parliament made the sale good. But this attainder being taken off by another acte of Parliament, and the former act made voide; Time and the act of Parliament, did restore both the blood and lands of the attained: &amp; made their estates voide,

Such a seruant is time, vnto the law, &amp; so assured is the law vnto time; That what contract soeuer it maketh therewith, shall be assuredly performed. In the case of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolments, there is special prouision of time: wherein I make this short obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that time doth worke, and vnworke, one and the same thing in nature accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as time is employed. The Kings te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant acknowledgeth a bargaine and sale of land, held in capite to an other and his heires: before the deede be enrolled, the bargainer dieth, his son within age. In this case', the sonne of this bargainor is ward. But the barganie also dieth within the six moneth, &amp;c. his son within age, &amp; within the 6. moneths the bargains &amp; sale is enrolled. In this case, the son of the bargainer shall be out of ward, &amp; the son of the barganie shall be in ward, by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10474:52"/>
to time. I put these cases, onely to make knowne how flexible time doth turne and wind according to the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it serueth, and how sloute and stiffe it is in some other cases, as the rules of law doth gouerne and direct it: and though this resemble not the case in all points, yet it sheweth, that in this behalfe, time is not to be disposed at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> election or choyce of any, but according to the true constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, scope &amp; meaning of the law: which in this case is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strued most strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the lender.</p>
               <p>A word or two concerning this diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mony &amp; time.
