         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Concerning whose positure in respect of <hi>Heaven, Lucretius</hi> (the first of the Latin Writers that names
<hi>Britain</hi>) seemeth to place it in the same Parallel with <hi>Pontus,</hi> where he saith:
<q>
                           <l>Nam quid Britannum coelum differre putamus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </l>

                        <q>
                           <l>What differs Britains Heaven from that of Nile?</l>
                           <l>Or Pontus welkin from Gades warmer Ile?</l>
                        </q>
In which, by a certain cross comparison, he opposeth two likes against two unlikes, <hi>Britain</hi> and
<hi>Pontus</hi> against <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Gades.</hi> But to seek into profound Antiquity, rather than present practice,
for matters in which <hi>Vse makes perfectness,</hi> were to affect the giving light by shadows, rather than
by Sun-shine.</p>

Island, yet divers have stifly held, that once it was joyned by an arm of land to the Continent of

<hi>Caesar</hi> here arrived, doth not sufficiently appear. <hi>Caesar</hi> himself makes so sparing mention therein,
that we have little cause to believe <hi>Florus,</hi> where he makes <hi>Livie</hi> say, that after <hi>Caesar</hi> had slain an

did not at all touch them, as the word <hi>inactus</hi> doth in him purport.</p>
                     <p>(9) Kings they were, and therefore that division which was here in <hi>Caesars</hi> time, was into <hi>Kingdoms:</hi>
the old names of whole Nations, as also the knowledge of their several abodes, hidden under the
rubbish of so many ages, have of late with infinite labours and exquisite judgment, been probably
restored and abounded; yet that no mans expectation and desire be too much frustrated, reason
wills that we briefly set forth such divisions of the Land, as many repute not ancient only, but au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick.</p>
                     <p>(10) Our seeming ancient Historians begin it at <hi>Brute,</hi> who to every of his three sons gave a part
called presently after by their names; as <hi>Loegria</hi> to <hi>Locrine</hi> his eldest son; <hi>Cambria</hi> to <hi>Camber</hi> his second
son; and <hi>Albania</hi> to <hi>Albanist</hi> his third son: And doubtless, if there had been more Nations of fame
in this Island, <hi>Brute</hi> should have had more sons fathered on him; which conceit some ascribe to
<hi>Monmouth</hi>'s holding that before him it was never so divided.</p>
                     <p>(11) <hi>Ptolomy</hi> naming <hi>Britain</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> and the <hi>Less,</hi> hath been by some mistaken, as so dividing this
Island into two parts; But his proportion and distance from the <hi>Aequator,</hi> compared with his Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical
description will evince, that he calleth this our Island <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland Britain</hi> the

But that <hi>Northern</hi> clime being more piercing for the <hi>Roman</hi> constitutions, and <hi>less profitable or

Northward.</p>
                     <p>(13) This nearer part of <hi>Britain</hi> they then divided into two parts; for the more Southern tract, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

two provinces, and placed two Prefects over the same.</p>

those coasts that lay betwixt <hi>Thamesis,</hi> the <hi>Severne,</hi> and the <hi>British Sea: Britaine Secunda</hi> extended from
<hi>Severne</hi> unto the <hi>Irish Seas,</hi> containing the Countrey that we now call <hi>Wales: Flavia Caesariensis,</hi> was
that which lay betwixt the Rivers <hi>Humber</hi> and <hi>Tyne:</hi> and <hi>Valentia</hi> from the said River, and <hi>Picts wall</hi>
reached unto the Rampire near <hi>Edenburgh</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the farthest part that the <hi>Romans</hi> possessed
when this division was in use. For the several people inhabiting all those parts, with their ancient
Names and Borders (whether designed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> or the old <hi>Britains</hi>) together with our modern
<hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Shires,</hi> answerable to each of them, we will refer you to the Tables thereof elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>(17) This whole Province of <hi>Britain,</hi> as in our History shall appear, was highly esteemed of the
Emperours themselves, assuming as a glorious surname <hi>Britannicus:</hi> coming thither in person over
those dangerous and scarce known Seas; here marrying, living, and dying: enacting here Laws for
the whole Empire, and giving to those Captains that served here, many ensigns of great honour;
yea <hi>Claudius</hi> gave <hi>Plantius</hi> (the first Prefect of that Province) the right hand, as he accompanied
him in his Triumph; and his own Triumph of <hi>Britain</hi> was set out with such magnificence, that the
Provinces brought in golden Crowes of great weight, the Governours commanded to attend, and
the very Captains permitted to be present at the same: A Naval Coronet was fixed upon a Pinnacle
of his Palace, Arches and Trophies were raised in <hi>Rome,</hi> and himself on his aged knees mounted the
staires into the Capitol, supported by his two sons in Law: so great a joy conceived he in himself for
the Conquest of some small portion of <hi>Britain.</hi>

by those provinces that were under his Diocess, which were <hi>Winchester, Oxford, Lincoln, Salisbury,

North with the famous River <hi>Thamisis,</hi> on the East with the <hi>German Ocean:</hi> on the South
with <hi>Sussex</hi> and the narrow Seas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon the West with <hi>Sussex</hi> and <hi>Surrey.</hi> The length
thereof extending from <hi>Langley</hi> in the West, unto <hi>Ramsgate</hi> Eastward in the Isle of
<hi>Thanet,</hi> is about 53 English miles. From <hi>Rother</hi> in the South, unto the Isle of <hi>Graine</hi>

These formerly had been firm ground, but by a sudden inundation of the Sea were swallowed

<hi>London,</hi> suddenly the ground began to sink, and three great Elmes thereon growing, were carried
so deep into the bowels of the earth, that no part of them could any more be seen, the hole left

                     <p>(7) The Kentish people in <hi>Caesars</hi> time were accounted the civillest among the <hi>Britains;</hi> and as

the <hi>Normans;</hi> and herein glory, that their King and Commons of all the <hi>Saxons</hi> were the first Christians,
converted in <hi>Anno</hi> 596; yea, and long before that time also <hi>Kent</hi> received the Faith: for it is recorded

two of his principal Leaders slain, about the year of Christ 560. and three hundred thirty three

                     <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                     <p>HANT-SHIRE, lying upon the West of <hi>England</hi> is bordered upon the North by <hi>Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
upon the East with <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Sussex,</hi> upon the South with the <hi>British Seas,</hi> and <hi>Isle
of Wight,</hi> and upon the West with <hi>Dorset</hi> and <hi>Wilt-shire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(2) The length thereof from <hi>Blackwater</hi> in the North upon <hi>Surrey,</hi> unto <hi>Bascomb</hi> in
the South upon the Sea, extended in a right line, is fifty four <hi>English</hi> miles, and the breadth
drawn from <hi>Petersfield</hi> in the East, unto <hi>Tidworth</hi> in the West, and confines of <hi>Wilt-shire,</hi> is little less than
thirty miles, the whole circumference about one hundred fifty and five miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Air is temperate, though somewhat thick by reason of the Seas, and the many Rivers
that through the Shire do fall, whose plenty of Fish, and fruitfull increase, do manifoldly redeem
the harmes which they make.</p>
                     <p>(4) The Soyl is rich sor Corn and Cattel, pleasant for Pasturage, and as plenteous for Woods;
in a word, in all Commodities either for Sea or Land, blessed and happy.</p>
                     <p>(5) Havens it hath, and those Commodities both to let in, and to lose out Ships of great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in trade of Merchandise, or other imployments: whereof <hi>Portsmouth, Tichfield, Hamble,</hi> and
<hi>South-hampton</hi> are chief: Besides many other creeks that open their bosoms into those Seas, and
the Coast strengthened with many strong Castles, such as <hi>Hurst, Calshot, South-hampton,</hi> S. <hi>Andrews.
Worth, Porchester,</hi> and the South Castle, besides other Bulwarkes, or Block-houses that secure the
Countrey: and further in the Land, as <hi>Malwood, Winchester,</hi> and <hi>Odiam,</hi> so strong that in the time of
King <hi>Iohn,</hi> thirteen <hi>Englishmen</hi> only defended the Fort for fifteen days against <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Franca,</hi> that
with a great Host assaulted it most hotly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:37437:25"/>(6) Anciently it was possest upon the North by the <hi>Segontians,</hi> who yielded themselves to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caesar,</hi> and whose chief City was <hi>Vindonum, Caer Segonte,</hi> now <hi>Silcester;</hi> and upon the South by the
<hi>Belgae</hi> and <hi>Regni,</hi> who were subdued by <hi>Plausius</hi> and <hi>Vespasian</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> where <hi>Titus</hi> rescuing his
Father, straightly besieged by the <hi>Britains,</hi> as <hi>Dio</hi> and <hi>Forcatulus</hi> do report, was grasped about with
an Adder, but no hurt to his person, and therefore taken for a sign of good luck. Their chief
Town was <hi>Rincewood,</hi> as yet sounding the name: and more within Land inhabited the <hi>Manures,</hi> as
<hi>Beda</hi> calls them, whose Hundreds also to this day gave a relish of their names.</p>
                     <p>(7) Near <hi>Ringwood,</hi> and the place once YTENE, from God and peoples Service, to Feast and
luxury, thirty six Parish Churches were converted, and pulled down by the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> and thirty
miles of circuit enforrested for his game of Hunting, wherein his sons <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Rufus,</hi> with
<hi>Henry</hi> the second son to Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> his first, felt by hasty death the hand of Iustice and Revenge:
for in the same Forrest, <hi>Richard</hi> by blasting of a Pestilent Air, <hi>Rufus</hi> by shot taken for a Beast, and
<hi>Henry</hi> as <hi>Absalom</hi> hanged by a bough, came to their untimely ends. At so dear a rate the pleasures
of Dogs, and harbour for beasts were bought in the bloud of these Princes.</p>
                     <p>(8) The general Commodities gotten in this Shire, are Wools, Cloaths, and Iron, whereof
great store is therein wrought from the Mines, and thence transported into all parts of this Realm,
and their Cloaths and Karsies carried into many foreign Countries, to that Countries great benefit,
and <hi>Englands</hi> great praise.</p>
                     <p>(9) The Trade thereof with other provisions for the whole, are vented through eighteen Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Towns
in this Shire, whereof <hi>Winchester,</hi> the <hi>Britains Caer Gwent,</hi> the <hi>Romans Venta Belgarum,</hi>
in chief, ancient enough by our <hi>British Historians.</hi> as built by King <hi>Budhudthras,</hi> nine hundred years
before the Nativity of Christ; and famous in the <hi>Romans</hi> times for the weavings and embroderies
therein wrought, to the peculiar uses of their <hi>Emperours</hi> own persons. In the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, after two
<pb facs="tcp:37437:26"/>
Calamities of consuming fire, her walls was raised, and the City made the Royal Seat of their
<hi>West Saxons</hi> Kings, and the Metropolitan of their Bishops See, wherein <hi>Egbert</hi> and <hi>Elfred</hi> their
most famous Monarchs were Crowned: and <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the <hi>Normans</hi> longest Reigner, first
took breath: And here King <hi>Aethelstane</hi> erected six Houses for his Mint, but the Danish desolation
over running all, this City felt their fury in the days of King <hi>Ethelbright,</hi> and in the <hi>Normans</hi> time,
twice was defaced by the mis-fortune of fire, which they again repaired and graced with the trust
of keeping the publick Records of the Realm. In the civil wars of <hi>Maud</hi> and <hi>Stephen,</hi> this City
was sore sacked, but again received breath, was by King <hi>Edward</hi> the third appointed the place for
Mart of Wool and Cloth. The Caehedral Church built by <hi>Kenwolf</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> that
had been <hi>Amphibalus, S. Peters, Swethins,</hi> and now holy <hi>Trinitie,</hi> is the Sanctuary for the ashes of
many <hi>English</hi> Kings: for herein great <hi>Egbert</hi> anno 836. with his son King <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> 857. Here <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred

Here <hi>Emme,</hi> 1052. with her <hi>Danish</hi> Lord <hi>Canute,</hi> 1035. and his son <hi>Hardicanute,</hi> 1042. And here

                     <p>This Cities situation is fruitful and pleasant, in a valley under hills, having her River on the East
and Castle on the West, the circuit of whose walls are well near two <hi>English</hi> miles, containing one

Degree 51, 10 minutes, and for Longitude 19, 3 minutes.</p>
                     <p>(10) More South, is <hi>South-hampton,</hi> a Town populous, rich and beautiful, from whom the
whole Shire deriveth her name, most strongly walled about with square stone, containing in circuit
one thousand and two hundred paces, having seven Gates for entrance, and twenty nine Towers
for defence, two very stately Keys for Ships arrivage, and five fair Churches for Gods divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
besides an <hi>Hospital,</hi> called <hi>Gods-house,</hi> wherein the unfortunate <hi>Richard,</hi> Earle of <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
beheaded for treason, lieth interred. On the West of this Town is mounted a most beautifull Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
in form Circular, and wall within wall, the foundation upon a hill so topped, that it cannot
be ascended but by stairs, carrying a goodly prospect both by Land and Sea; and in the East with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the walls a goodly Church sometimes stood, called S. <hi>Maries,</hi> which was pulled down, for
that it gave the <hi>French</hi> direction of course, who with fire had greatly endangered the Town: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
thereof, is newly erected a small and unfinished Chappel. In this place, saith learned <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
stood the ancient <hi>Clausentium,</hi> or Fort of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose circuit on that side extended it self
to the Sea: this suffered many depredations by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Pirates, and in <hi>Anno</hi> 980. was by the
<hi>Danes</hi> almost quite overthrown. In King <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time, it was fired by the <hi>French,</hi> under
the Conduct of the King of <hi>Sicils</hi> son, whom a Countrey man encountred and struck down
with his Club, he crying <hi>Rancon, that is Ransome:</hi> but he neither understandiog his language, nor
the Law that Arms doth allow, laid on more soundly, saying, <hi>I know thee a Frankon, and therefore
shalt thou die:</hi> And in <hi>Richard</hi> the seconds time it was somewhat removed, and built in the place where
now it standeth. In this <hi>Clausentium, Canute</hi> to evict his flatterers, made trial of his Deity, commanding
the Seas to keep back from his seat: But being not obeyed, he acknowledged God to be the onely
supreme Governour, and in a religious devotion gave up his Crown to the Rood at <hi>Winchester.</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:37437:27"/>
More ancient was <hi>Silcester</hi> built by <hi>Constantius,</hi> great <hi>Constantines</hi> son; whose Monument (they
say) was seen in in that City, and where another <hi>Constantine</hi> put on the purple robe against <hi>Honorius'</hi>
as both <hi>Ninius</hi> and <hi>Gervase</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> do withess. Herein by our <hi>Historians</hi> record, the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<hi>Arthur</hi> was Crowned. Whose greatness for circuit contained no less than fourscore Acres of
ground, and the walls of great height, yet standing two miles in compass about. This City by
the <hi>Danish</hi> Rovers suffered such wrack, that her mounted tops were never since seen, and her
Hulke (the walls) immured to the middle of the earth, which the rubbish of her own desolations hath
filled.</p>

by the <hi>Britains, Guyth,</hi> and in these days usually called by us, <hi>The Lsle of Wight,</hi>
it belongeth to the County of <hi>South-hampton,</hi> and lieth out in length over against the
midst of it South-ward. It is encompassed round with the <hi>British</hi> Seas, and severed
from the Main-land, that it may seem to have been conjoyned to it, and thereof it
is thought the <hi>British</hi> name <hi>(Guyth)</hi> hath been given unto it, which betokeneth separation,
even as <hi>Sicily</hi> being broken off and cut from <hi>Italy,</hi> got the name from <hi>Secando</hi> (which signifieth
cutting.)</p>
                     <p>(2) The form of this Isle is long, and at the midst far more wide than at either end: From <hi>Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
Isle in the East, to <hi>Hurst</hi> Castle in the West, it stretcheth out in length 20 miles, and in breadth
from <hi>Newport</hi> haven Northward, to <hi>Chale-bay</hi> Southward 12 miles. The whole in circumference
is about sixty miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Air is commended both for health and delight, whereof the first is witnessed by the long
continuance of the Inhabitants in the state of their bodies before they be decayed, and the other
for quantity gives place to no neighbouring Countrey.</p>
                     <p>(4) The ground (to say nothing of the Sea, which is exceeding full of Fish) consisteth of soil
very fruiful; yet the husbandmans labour deserves to be thankfully remembred, by whose pains
and industry it doth not only supply is self, but affords Corn to be carried forth to others. The
Land is plentifully stored with Cattle and Grain, and breeds every where store of Conies,
<pb facs="tcp:37437:28"/>
Hares, Partridges and Phesants, pleasant for meadows, pasturage, and Parks; so that nothing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that may suffice man. The middle yields plenty of pasture; and forrage for Sheep; whose
wooll the Clothiers esteem the best; next unto that of <hi>Leinster</hi> and <hi>Cotteswold.</hi> If you cast your eyes
towards the North, it is all over garnished with Meadows, Pastures, and Woods: If towards the
South side, it lieth (in a manner) wholly bedecked with Corn fields enclosed, where at each end
the Sea doth so incroach it self, that it maketh almost two Islands besides, namely, <hi>Freshwater Isle,</hi>
which looketh to the West, and <hi>Binbridge Isle,</hi> answering it to the East.</p>
                     <p>(5) The Commodities of the whole chiefly consist of Cattle, Sea fowl, Fish, and Corn, whereof
it hath sufficient: Woods are not here very plentiful; for that it is only stored with one little Forrest;
yet the Countrey of <hi>Hant-shire</hi> for vicinity of Site, is a friendly neighhour in that behalf; so (as
it were being tyed together in affinity) they are always ready and propense to add to each others
wants and defects by a mutual supply.</p>
                     <p>(6) The ancient Inhabitants of this Island were the <hi>Belgae,</hi> spoken of in the several Provinces
of <hi>Sommerset-shire, Wilt-shire,</hi> and <hi>Hant-shire.</hi> Such as did then possess it were called <hi>Lords of the Isle of
Wight,</hi> till it fell into the Kings hands, by <hi>Roger</hi> (Son to <hi>William Fits Osburne,</hi> slain in the war of
<hi>Flanders</hi>) that was driven into exile. And <hi>Henry</hi> the first King of <hi>England</hi> gave it unto <hi>Richard Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
with the Fee or Inheritance of the Town of <hi>Christs-Church,</hi> where (as in all other places) he
built certain Fortresses.</p>
                     <p>(7) The Principal Market-Town in the Isle of <hi>Newport,</hi> called in times past <hi>Medena;</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus
Burgus de Meden;</hi> that is, <hi>The new Burgh of Meden,</hi> whereof the whole Countrey is divided into
East-<hi>Meden,</hi> and West-<hi>Meden.</hi> A Town well seated, and much frequented; unto whose Burgesses
his Majesty hath lately granted the choice of a Major, who with his brethren do govern accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
It is populous with Inhabitants, having an entrance into the Isle from the Haven, and a
<pb facs="tcp:37437:29"/>
Passage for Vessels of small burden unto the Key. Not far from it, is the Castle <hi>Caresbrook,</hi> whose
founder is said to have been <hi>Whitgar</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> and from him called <hi>VVhite-Garesburgh:</hi> but now
made shorter for easier pronunciation; the graduation whereof for Latitude is in the degree 50,
36 minutes: and her Longitude in 19, 4 minutes, where formerly hath stood a Priory, and at

                     <p>DORCESTER, from her ancient people DUROTRIGES, is most likely to have
received that name: By the <hi>Britains</hi> called DWRGWEIR, lieth bounded upon the
North side with <hi>Sommerset</hi> and <hi>Wilt-shire,</hi> upon the West with <hi>Devon-shire,</hi> and some
part with <hi>Sommerset;</hi> upon the East altogether with <hi>Hamp-shire:</hi> and her South part
is wholly bounded with the <hi>British Seas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(2) The form grows wider from the West, and spreads her self the broadest in the midst,
where it extends to twenty four miles, but in length is no less than forty four: The whole in
Circumference about, is one hundred and fifty miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Air is good, and of an healthful constitution: the soyl is fat, affording many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
and the Countrey most pleasant in her situation: for the In-land is watered with many
sweet and fresh running-Springs, which taking passage through the plain Vallies, do lastly in a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
manner unite themselves together, and of their many branches make many big bodied
streams: neither doth the Sea deny them entrance, but helpeth rather to fill up their Banks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

this our Empire, and that after the reigns of the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi> it should again return unto
the government of the <hi>British</hi> Kings. But with such vain predictions, our Nation is more than once
taxed by <hi>Philip Comineus</hi> the famous <hi>French</hi> Writer. In this City <hi>Edward</hi> the son of great <hi>Edgar,</hi> and
one and thirtieth Monarch of the <hi>English-men,</hi> was interred, being murdered at <hi>Corfe,</hi> a Castle seated
in the Isle of <hi>Purbeck,</hi> by his Step mother <hi>Aelfrith,</hi> to make way for her Son to enjoy his Crown: in
repentance whereof, and to pacifie Heaven for his bloud, she built the <hi>Monasteries</hi> of <hi>Ambresbury</hi> and
<hi>Whorwell,</hi> in the County of <hi>Wilt-shire</hi> and <hi>South-hampton.</hi> In the former of which with great peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency

Neither among these may I omit <hi>Sherburne,</hi> which in the year of grace, 704. was made a Bishops
See, in whose Cathedral Church was interred the bodies of <hi>Ethelbald</hi> and <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> brethren, both

                     <p>(8) Seven more besides these were set apart from worldly impolyments, consecrated onely to
God and his service in this Service; which were <hi>Camestern, Cranburn, Abbottesbury Bindon, Sturminster,

vulgar <hi>Denshire,</hi> is not derived from the <hi>Danes,</hi> as some would have it, but from the
people <hi>Danmonii,</hi> the same we will speak of in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and whom <hi>Ptolomy</hi> hath
seated in these Western Borders.</p>
                     <p>(2) The West of this County is bounded altogether by the River <hi>Tamer:</hi> the East is
held in with the verge of <hi>Sommerset-shire;</hi> and the North and South sides are washed wholly with the
<hi>British</hi> and <hi>Severn Seas:</hi> betwixt whose shoares from <hi>Cunshire</hi> in the North unto <hi>Salcombe Haven en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering</hi>

are fifty four: the whole in circumference about two hundred and two miles.</p>

of the proud invincible <hi>Spanish Navy,</hi> intending invasion and subversion of State, but with

seals of their own shame, and his high honour.</p>
                     <p>(5) The Commodities of this Shire consist much in Wools and Clothings, where the best and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Kersies are made in the Land. Corn is most plenteous in the fruitful Vallies, and Cattle spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the topped Hills; Sea-Fish and Fowl exceedingly abundant. Veins of Lead, yea and

which with a longing desire of Society search out their passage, till they meet and conjoyn in the
Vallies, and gathering still strength with more branches, lastly grow bodies able to bear Ships into
the Land, and to lodge them of great burthen in their bosoms or Falls: whereof <hi>Tamer, Tave,</hi> and

rest, felt their destroying hands; for in the year 875 it was by them sore afflicted, spoiled, and
shaken, and that most grievously by <hi>Swane</hi> in the year of Christ Iesus 1003. who razed it down
from East to West, so that scarcely had it gotten breath before <hi>VVilliam</hi> the bastard of <hi>Normandy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged

<pb facs="tcp:37437:34"/>three times besieged, and with valiant resistance ever defended. The first was by <hi>Hugh Courtney,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> in the civil broiles betwixt <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York:</hi> Then by <hi>Perkin VVarbeck,</hi> that
counterfeited <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York:</hi> And lastly, by the <hi>Cornish</hi> Rebels, wherein although the Citizens
were grievously pinched with scarcity, yet continued they their faithful allegiance unto King <hi>Edward</hi>
the sixth; and at this day flourisheth in tranquility and wealth, being governed by a Major, twenty
four Brethren, with a Recorder, Town-Clerk, and other Officers their Attendants. This Cities
graduation is set in the degree of Latitude from the North Pole 50 and 45 scruples: And for Longitude
from the West, to the degree 16, and 25 scruples. Neither is <hi>Ioseph</hi> that excellent Poet, whose
birth was in this City, the least of her Ornaments, whose Writings bear so great credit, that they
were divulged in the <hi>German</hi> Language under the name of <hi>Cornelius Nepos.</hi>

these: Upon <hi>Exmore</hi> certain Monuments of Antick-work are erected, which are stones pitched in

there obtained, either by the <hi>Romans, Saxons,</hi> or <hi>Danes,</hi> and with <hi>Danish</hi> Letters one of them is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,

And <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> of <hi>Augustus Caesars</hi> time writeth, that the <hi>Britains in this part digged Tin out of
stony ground, which by Merchants was carried into Gallia, and thence to Narborne, as it were to a Mart.</hi>

<hi>Richard</hi> brother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who was Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and by those <hi>Tinn-works</hi>

the Common-weale of <hi>Tinn-works</hi> from one body was divided into four, and a <hi>Lord Warden</hi> of the

beating upon it on the North side, the South part bordering upon <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Dorset-shires,</hi>
the West confined with <hi>Devon shire,</hi> and the East and North-East upon <hi>Wilt shire,</hi> and
<hi>Gloucester shire.</hi> It took the name of <hi>Sommerron</hi> (sometime the chief Town of this Shire)
whence in the Ancient Historian <hi>Asserius,</hi> this County is called <hi>Sommertunensis,</hi> that is,
<hi>Sommertun-shire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(2) The form thereof is large, bearing it self still wider as it slretcheth into the middle part thereof,
and contains in length from <hi>Brackley</hi> near unto <hi>Frome Selwood</hi> Eastward, to <hi>Oure</hi> in the West, Miles 55.
In breadth from <hi>Parshut Point</hi> in the North, to <hi>Chard</hi> Southward, is somewhat above forty miles.
The whole ciacumference is about 204 miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Air is milde and pleasing, and for the most part subject to such temperate dispositions as
the Sommer-season affordeth, whence some have erroniously conceited, that the Region borrowed
her name from the nature of her Clime: yet how delightful soever it is in the time of Summer,
with change of the season it may well change her pleasing name, and borrow some Winterly deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
so full of wet, so miry and moorish it is; in so much as the Inhabitants can hardly travel
to and fro without their encumbrance.</p>
                     <p>(4) Howbeit they pass over this with all patience, knowing their ensuing seasonable profits
far to exceed any present detriments and displeasures: for as it is fowl, so it is fruitful, which

delightful Meadows, and beautified with Mannor houses both many and fair; and (in a word)
hath every thing in it to content the purse, the heart, the eye, at home: and sufficient ports to give
entertainment to commodities from abroad.</p>
                     <p>(5) The ancient Inhabitants that possessed this Province were the <hi>Belgae,</hi> who spread themselves
far and wide, as well here as in <hi>Wilt-shire,</hi> and the inner parts of <hi>Hant-shire,</hi> who being branched
from the <hi>Germans,</hi> conferred the names of those places from whence they came, upon these their seats
where they resided.</p>
                     <p>(6) The general profits of this province are Corn and Cattle, wherewith it is so plentifully sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as it may challenge any neighbouring County for the quantity to make shew of Cattle so fat, or
Grain so rich. Some places are peculiarly enriched by Lead-mines, as <hi>Mindiphils,</hi> (perchance so
called of the deep Mines) by <hi>Leiland</hi> aptly termed <hi>Minerarii, Mineral-hills,</hi> which yield plenty of
Lead, the most Merchantable Commodity that is in <hi>England,</hi> and vented into all parts of the world.
Some are beautified with Diamonds, as S, <hi>Vincent Rock,</hi> whereof there is great plenty, and so bright
of colour, as they might equalize <hi>Indian</hi> Diamonds, if they had their hardness: yet being so many,
and so common, they are less sought after or commended.</p>
                     <p>(7) This Countrey is famoused by three Cities, <hi>Bath, Wells,</hi> and <hi>Bristow.</hi> The first takes name

and almost of all diseases, (weence it was sometimes called <hi>Akemancester</hi>) who by divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence

many images and <hi>Roman</hi> Inscriptions are found in the walls, which can now be hardly read, they
are so worn and eaten into by age. <hi>Wells</hi> (as <hi>Leiland</hi> reporteth) was sometimes called <hi>Theoderodunum,</hi>

the <hi>Fountain Church:</hi> where the <hi>Cathedral</hi> built by King <hi>Inas</hi> to the memory of S <hi>Andrew,</hi> is very
beautiful and richly endowed. The City is likewise well replenished both with Inhabitants and
seemly buildings. Whose government is managed by a Mayor yearly elected, a Recorder, and
seven Masters, having the Assistancs of sixteen Burgesses, a Town-Clerk, and Two Sergeants at
Mace. Whose Latitude is 51, 20 minutes, and Longitude 17, 31 minutes. <hi>Bristow</hi> is not so anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
as it is fair and well seated: The beauty of it being such, as for the bigness thereof, it scarce
gives place to any City of <hi>England,</hi> and doth worthily deserve the <hi>Saxons</hi> name <hi>Bright-stad:</hi> whose
pleasantness is the more, by reason that the River <hi>Avon</hi> scowres through the midst of it, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the benefit of <hi>Sewers</hi> under all the streets clears the City of all noysome filth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness. It is not wholly seated in this County of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> but one part thereof in <hi>Gloucester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire;</hi>
but because it is an entire County of it self, it denies subjection unto either, having for its
own government both a Bishop, with a well furnished Colledge, and a Mayor, with a competent
assistance of Aldermen, and other Officers for civil affairs.</p>
                     <p>(8) This Province hath been the Theater of many Tragical events and bloudy battels: the
<hi>Danes</hi> did grievously afflict <hi>Porlock</hi> by cruel Piracies, in the year eight hundred eighty six. Yet
neer unto <hi>Pen</hi> a little Village neigbouring upon <hi>North Cadbury, Edmund,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Iron-side,</hi> gave
them a notable foyle, as he was pursuing <hi>Canutus</hi> from place, to place, for usurping the <hi>Crown</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:37437:40"/>
                        <hi>England.</hi> And <hi>Keniwach (a West-Saxon)</hi> in the same place had such a day against the <hi>Britains,</hi> that
they ever after stood in awe of the <hi>English-Saxons</hi> prowess. <hi>Marianus</hi> relateth that not far from
<hi>Bridge-water,</hi> as the <hi>Danes</hi> were stragling abroad, <hi>Ealstane</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sherbourne</hi> did so soyl their
Forces in the year 845, as their minds were much discomfited, and their powers utterly disabled.
<hi>Ninius</hi> also writeth that King <hi>Arthur</hi> did so defeat the <hi>English-Saxons</hi> in a battel at <hi>Cadbury,</hi> that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to be made perpetuously memorable. Neither is <hi>Mons Badonicus</hi> (now <hi>Banesdown</hi>) less fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for <hi>Arthurs</hi> victories. And King <hi>Elfred</hi> in another battel not far from hence gave the <hi>Danes</hi> such
an overthrow, as he forced them to submission, and induced <hi>Godrus</hi> their King to become a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
himself being Godfather to him at the Font. So happy is this <hi>Region,</hi> and so beholding to

houses were thus beautified by bounteous Princes, for religious purposes, and to retire the
mind from worldly services, though blinded times and guides diverted them to superstitious and lewd
abuses.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:37437:41"/>(10) Other memorable places are these: <hi>Camalet</hi> a very steep hill hard to be ascended, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

                     <p>This County is divided into 42 Hundreds, for the disposing of business needful for the State
thereof, wherein are placed 33 Market-Towns, fit for buying and selling, and other affairs of
Commerce. It is fortified with four Castles, and planted with 385 Parishes, for concourse of Divine
Service.</p>

West is confronted against partly by <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and the rest by <hi>Somerset-shire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(2) The form thereof is both long and broad; for from <hi>Inglesham</hi> upon <hi>Thamisis</hi> in
the North, to <hi>Burgat Damarum</hi> in the South, are thirty miles; the broadest part
is from <hi>Buttermer</hi> Eastward, to the <hi>Shire-stones</hi> in the West, being tweuty nine; the whole in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
is one hundred thirty nine miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) For Air, it is feated in a temperate Climate, both sweet, pleasant, and wholesome; and for
soil (saith <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Sarisbury) is exceeding fortile and plentiful, yea, and that with variety.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(4) The Northern part which they call <hi>North-Wilt shire,</hi> riseth up into delectable hills, attired
with large Woods, and watered with clear Rivers, whereof <hi>Isis</hi> is one, which soon becometh the
most famous in the Land. The South part is more even, yielding abundantly Grass and Corn;
and is made the more fruitful by the Rivers <hi>Wily, Adder,</hi> and <hi>Avon.</hi> The midst of this County is most
plain, and thereby is known and commonly called <hi>Salesbnry Plaines;</hi> and lie so level indeed, that
it doth limit the <hi>Horizon;</hi> for hardly can a man see from the one side to the other. These <hi>Plaines</hi>
grase an infinite number of sheep, whose fleeces and flesh bring in a yearly revenue to their
owners.</p>
                     <p>(5) Anciently this County was possessed by the <hi>Belgae,</hi> who are seated by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in <hi>Hamp-shire,

                     <p>(6) After them the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> made it a part of their Kingdom, whose border was <hi>Avon,</hi> as
witnesseth <hi>Athelward</hi> though the <hi>Marcians</hi> many times encroched upon them, whereby many great
Battles, as <hi>Malmesbury</hi> tells us, betwixt them were fought, when in the young years of their <hi>Heptar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi>
each sought to enlarge his, by the lessoning of the next: but grown unto more ripeness, they
assigned their limits by a great and long ditch crossing thorow the midst of these <hi>Plaines,</hi> which for
the wonder thereof is supposed by the vulgar to be the work of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and is called of all,
<hi>Wansdike,</hi> undoubtedly of <hi>Wooden,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> Ancester and great reputed God, where a little Village

received such a foyl of the <hi>Britains</hi> and his Countrey-men, that he was forced to sorfake his
Kingdom, and to end his days in exile, becoming a pitiful spectacle even unto his own enemies.
And in this place <hi>Ina</hi> the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> joyned Battle with <hi>Ceolred</hi> the <hi>Mercian,</hi> whence both of them
departed with equal loss. The like was at <hi>Bradford</hi> by <hi>Kenilwalch</hi> and <hi>Cuthred;</hi> at <hi>Wilton</hi> betwixt
<hi>Egbert</hi> and <hi>Beornwolfe;</hi> at <hi>Edindon</hi> where King <hi>Elfred</hi> was vanquisher of the <hi>Danes;</hi> and at <hi>wilton,</hi>
where the <hi>Danes</hi> won the day against him. With as bloudy success, though not happening by
sword, was the issue of that Synod assembled at <hi>Calne,</hi> a small town in this County, in the year
of Christ Iesus 977, where being hotly debating for the single life, and against the marriages of the
<hi>Clergy,</hi> what wanted by the word to prove their divorce, was supplyed by a Stratagem, and that
very bloody; for suddenly the main timber brake, and down fell the floor with the Nobles and
<pb facs="tcp:37437:43"/>
Prelates, the Gentlemen and Commons, whereby a great number were hurt, and many more slain;
onely <hi>Dunstan</hi> the Prefident, and mouth for the Monks escaped untouched, the Ioist whereon his
Chair stood remaining most firm: which confirmed the sentence of their separations, whom God had
conjoyned, and became the fall and snare of much incontinency in both sexes.</p>
                     <p>(7) The chiefest City of this Shire is <hi>Salesbury,</hi> removed from a higher, but a far more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

that they were in swift flight; so that hopeless to hail them, he gave over the chase; yet no sooner

him subjection, which proved the ruine of all former liberty. But when the <hi>Romans</hi> had rent their
own Empire, and retired their Legion into a narrower circuit, the <hi>Saxons</hi> set foot where their forces
had been, and made this County a parcel of their Western Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> then setting their desire upon spoils, from their roaving Pinnaces pierced into these

<hi>Castle,</hi> where in the Collegiate Chuch of the <hi>Abbey,</hi> himself and Queen (who lay both vailed and
crowned) with the daughter <hi>Maud</hi> the Empress, called the <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> were interred, as
the private History of the place avoucheth, though others bestow the bodies of these two Queens
elsewhere. The Castle King <hi>Henry</hi> the second razed to the ground, because it was the refuge for the
followers of King <hi>Stephen.</hi> From whence the North pole is raised in Latitude 51 degrees and 40
minutes, and in Longitude from the first West-point observed by <hi>Mercator</hi> 19 degrees and 35

                     <p>(7) A Castle and Town of greater strength and antiquity was <hi>Wallingford,</hi> by <hi>Autonie</hi> and
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> called <hi>Gellena,</hi> the chiefest City of the <hi>Attrebatians,</hi> whose large circuit, and strong fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,

resorted as their surest defence.</p>
                     <p>(8) But of far greater magnificence and state is the Castle of <hi>Windsor,</hi> a most Princely Palace
and Mansion of His Majesty. I will not with <hi>Ieffery</hi> affirm it to be built by King <hi>Arthur,</hi> but with
better authority say, it was so thirsted after-by the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> that by a composition with the Abbot
of <hi>Westminster,</hi> whose then it was, he made it to be the Kings possesson, as a place, besides the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
very commodious to entertain the King. In this Castle that victorious Prince King <hi>Edward</hi>
the third was born, and herein after he had subdued the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> held he at one and the
same time, as his Prisoners, <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Neither was it ever
graced with greater Majesty than by the institution of the most honourable Order of the Garter,
a signal Ornament of Martial Prowesse; the invention thereof some ascribe to be from a Garter
falling from his Queen, or rather from <hi>Ioan</hi> Countess of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> a Lady of an incomperable
beauty, as she danced before him; whereat the by-standers smiling, he gave the impress to check

which promised a future glory to the wearers. The most Princely Chappel thereof is graced with the
bodies of those two great Kings, <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, and <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, whom the whole Kingdom
was too little to contain, the one of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> the other of <hi>York,</hi> where the rest now united in one

of them places of the <hi>Romans</hi> residence, as by their moneys there oftentimes found appeareth. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

great amazement of the beholders.</p>
                     <p>(10) The riches and sweet Seats that this County affordeth, made many devout persons to shew
their devotions unto true piety, in erecting places for Gods divine Service, and their exemptions
from all worldly business: such were <hi>Abington, Redding, Bysham, Bromehall, Hendley, Hamme,</hi> and
<hi>Wallingford,</hi> whose <hi>Votaries</hi> abusing the intents of their Founders, overthrew both their own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

                     <p>ESSEX, by the <hi>Normans, Excessa,</hi> and by the vulgar <hi>Essex,</hi> is a County large in compass,
very populous, and nothing inferiour to the best of the Land.</p>
                     <p>(2) The Form thereof is somewhat circular, excepting the East part, which shooteth her
self with many Promontories into the Sea; and from <hi>Horsey Island</hi> to <hi>Haidon</hi> in the West,
(the broadest part of the Shire) are they by measure forty miles; and the length from <hi>East
Ham</hi> upon <hi>Thamesis</hi> in the South, to <hi>Sturmere</hi> upon the River <hi>Stow</hi> in the North, are thirty five miles;
the whole in circumference one hundred forty six miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) It lyeth bounded upon the North, with <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Cambridge-Shires,</hi> upon the West with <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>

                     <p>(4) The Air is temperate and pleasant, only towards the waters somewhat aguish: the soyl is
rich and fruitful, though in some places sandy and barren; yet so that it never frustrates the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
hopes, or fills not the hands of her Harvest-labourers: but in some part so fertile, that after

whom in the former <hi>Chapter</hi> we have spoken, and in our <hi>History</hi> shall speak more at large. But this
name perished with the age of the Empire, the <hi>Saxons</hi> presently framed a new; and with <hi>Hertford</hi> and

King in remorse of conscience, built a Church in the place, to pacifie God for the sins of his people:
but when the <hi>Normans</hi> had got the garland of the whole, many of the Nobles there seated themselves,
whose posterities since, both there and else-where are spread further abroad in the Realm.</p>
                     <p>(6) The Commodities that this shire yieldeth, are many and great, as of Woods, Corn, Cattle,
Fish, Forrests, and Saffron; which last groweth with such gain and increase upon her North parts,
that from a split Clove much like unto Garlike, a white blewish Flower shortly springeth, from
whence fillets of Saffron are gathered before the Sun, and dried, are sold as spice with great gain.
From the Islands <hi>Canvey, Mersey, Horsey, Northly, Osey, Wallot,</hi> and <hi>Foulness,</hi> great store of Fish and
Fowl are daily gotten: and so from their Cattle have they continual increase, which men and boys

Land, much thereof transported unto other Countries. Their Oysters which we call <hi>Walfleet,</hi> the
best in esteem, and are thought from <hi>Pliny</hi> to have been served in the <hi>Romans</hi> Kitchins. But least we
should exceed measure in commending, or the people repose their trust in the soyl; behold what
God can do to frustrate both in a moment, and that by his meanest creatures: for in our age and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
the year of Christ 158. an Army of <hi>Mice</hi> so over ran the Marshes in <hi>Dengey Hundred,</hi>
near unto <hi>South minster</hi> in this County, that they shore the grass to the very roots, and so tainted
the same with their venemous teeth, that a great Murtain fell upon the Cattle which grazed thereon,
to the great losse of their owners.</p>

of the <hi>Saxons</hi> conversion, <hi>Sigebert</hi> King of the <hi>East-Angles</hi> sounded a Christian Church: and
upon the occasion of King <hi>Edmunds</hi> burial (who at <hi>Hoxon</hi> was shot to death) hath been ever since
called S. <hi>Edmundsbury,</hi> where was built to his honour one of the fairest Monasteries in the world,
begun by King <hi>Canute,</hi> much affrighted with the seeming appearance of that Martyrs Ghost, who
to expiate the sacrilegious impiety of his Father <hi>Suenus,</hi> enriched the place with many endowments,
and offered up his own Crown upon the Holy Martyrs Tomb. For the beauty and buildings of
this Abby and Town, let <hi>Leyland</hi> for me declare: <hi>The Sun</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath not seen a City more
finely seated, so delicately, upon the easie ascent of an hill, with a River running on the East side; nor a
more stately Abby, either for revenues or incomperable magnificence, in whose prospect appeareth rather a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

glorious Church, upon which attend three others, standing all in the same Church-yard, all of them passing
fine, and of a curious workmanship.</hi> Whose ruines lie in the dust, lamenting their fall, moving the
beholders to pity their case.</p>

                     <p>NORTHFOLK is an Island inclining to an oval form, closed on the South part
with the Rivers of <hi>Wavenay,</hi> and the lesser <hi>Ouse,</hi> which divides it from <hi>Suffolk.</hi> On the
East and North with the <hi>German Ocean;</hi> on the West toward <hi>Cambridge-shires,</hi> with some
branches of the greater <hi>Ouse;</hi> toward <hi>Lincolis-shire,</hi> with that part of the <hi>Neve</hi> which
passeth from <hi>Wisbitch</hi> into the <hi>Washes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It containeth in length (from <hi>Tarmouth</hi> to <hi>Wifbitch</hi>) about fifty miles. In breadth (from <hi>The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Wells</hi>) about thirty. The whole Circuit is about two hundred forty two miles.</p>
                     <p>The Name ariseth from the situation of the people, who being the Norther-most of the Kingdom
of <hi>East-Angles,</hi> are therefore called the <hi>Northfolk,</hi> as the Souther-most <hi>Southfolk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Air is sharp and piercing, especially the Champion and near the Sea; therefore it delayeth
the Spring and Harvest, the situation of the Countrey inclining thereto, as being under the 53 degree
of Latitude.</p>
                     <p>The Soil diverse: about the towns commonly good; as Clay, Chalk, or fat Earth, well watered,
and with some Wood: upward to the Heaths naked, dry and barren: <hi>Marsland</hi> and <hi>Flegge</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rich: but <hi>Marsland</hi> properly for Pasture, <hi>Flegge</hi> for Corn.</p>
                     <p>(2) The parts from <hi>Thetford</hi> to <hi>Burneham,</hi> and thence Westward, as also along the Coast, be
counted <hi>Champion:</hi> the rest (as better furnished with Woods) <hi>Woodland.</hi> The <hi>Champion</hi> aboundeth
with Corn, Sheep, and Conies and hesein the barren Heaths, (as the Providence of our Ancestors
hath of old disposed them) are very profitable: For on them principally lie our <hi>Fould courses,</hi> called

These heaths by the compasture of the sheep (which we call <hi>Tathe</hi>) are made so rich with
Corn, that when they fall to be sown, they commonly match the fruitfullest grounds in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
and laid again, do long after yield a sweeter and more plentiful feed for Sheep: so that each of
them maintain other, and are the chiefest wealth of our Countrey. The <hi>Woodland</hi> (fitter for grass)
is maintained chiefly by feeding of Cattel, yet well stored with Corn and Sheep.</p>
                     <p>The Coast is fortunate in Fish, and hath many good harbours, whereof <hi>Lynn</hi> and <hi>Tarmouth</hi> be the
mother-ports, and of great traffique: <hi>Wells</hi> and <hi>Blackeney</hi> next in estimation.</p>
                     <p>The whole County aboundeth with Rivers and pleasant Springs, of which the <hi>Ouse</hi> is the chiefest, by
whose plentiful branches, the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> the Towns and Shires of <hi>Cambridge, Huntington,</hi> and the

also their own Countreyman <hi>Ethelward</hi> termeth them. Since the entry of the <hi>Normans,</hi> they have
been counted civil and ingenious, apt to good Letters, adorning Religion with more Churches

with some excellent men; from whom most of our chief Families, and some of the greatest Nobility
of the Kingdom, have taken advancement. And herein is <hi>Northfolk</hi> fortunate, that as <hi>Crete</hi> boasted

Treason. How the Government of this County was about <hi>Caesars</hi> time, is uncertain, but (agreeable

County with <hi>Suffolk</hi> fell in the portion of the <hi>Angles,</hi> and about the year five hundred sixty one,
were together erected into a Kingdom by <hi>Vffa,</hi> of whom the succeeding Kings were tituled <hi>Vffines.</hi>
But having suffered many Tempests of <hi>Fortune,</hi> it was in the year 870, utterly wasted and extinct by

<hi>W. de Albany, Pincerne,</hi> and <hi>W. de Warranna Forrestario,</hi> who to strengthen themselves (according to
the use of that time) with the homage and service of many Tenants, divided large portions of the

were in those days either mediately or immediately holden of one of them. And as <hi>Northfolk</hi>

                     <p>(5) The Towns here are commonly well built, and populous; three of them being of that
worth and quality, as no one Shire of <hi>England</hi> hath the like, <hi>Norwich, Lynn,</hi> and <hi>Yarmouth:</hi> to which
for ancient reputation (as having been a seat of the Kings of <hi>East-Angles</hi>) I may add <hi>Thetford,</hi>
known to <hi>Antoninus, Ptolomy,</hi> and elder ages by the name of <hi>Sitomagus,</hi> when the other three were
yet in their infancy, and of no esteem: For I accept not the Relations of the Antiquity and State of
<hi>Norwich</hi> in the time of the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> though <hi>Alexander Nevil</hi> hath well graced them. Her
very name abridgeth her Antiquity, as having no other in Histories but <hi>Norwich,</hi> which is meer
<hi>Saxon</hi> or <hi>Danish,</hi> and signifieth the <hi>North-Town</hi> or <hi>Castle.</hi> It seemeth to have risen out of the decay of
her neighbour <hi>Venta,</hi> now called <hi>Castor,</hi> and as M. <hi>Cambden</hi> noteth, not to have been of mark before
the entry of the <hi>Danes,</hi> who in the year 1004, under <hi>Swane</hi> their Captain, first sackt, and then
burnt it, even in her infancy. Yet in the days of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi> it recovered 1320 Burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
But maintaining the cause of Earl <hi>Radulph</hi> aforesaid against the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> they were by
famine and sword wasted to 560, at which time the Earl escaping by Ship, his wife upon composition
yielded the Castle, and followed. In <hi>William Rufus</hi> time it was grown famous for Merchandise and
concourse of people; so that <hi>Herbert</hi> then translated the Bishoprick from <hi>Thetford</hi> thither, made
each of them an ornament to other. In variety of times it felt much variety of <hi>Fortune:</hi> By fire
in <hi>Anno</hi> 1508. By extreme plagues, whereof one in <hi>Anno</hi> 1348, was so outragious, as 57104
are reported to have died thereof between the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> and of <hi>Iuly.</hi> By misery of war

which if <hi>Henry</hi> the third had not come in person to appease, the City was in hazard to be ruined

seised. In <hi>Edward</hi> the sixths time, by <hi>Ketts</hi> rebellion, whose fury chiefly raged against this City.
Since this it hath flourished with the blessings of <hi>Peace, Plenty, Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Honour:</hi> so that <hi>Alexander

the River <hi>Hierus,</hi> in a pleasant valley, but on rising ground, having on the East the Hills and Heath
called <hi>Mussold</hi> for <hi>Musswould,</hi> as I take it. In the 17 year of King <hi>Stephen</hi> it was new founded, and
made a Corporation. In <hi>Edward</hi> the firsts time closed with a fair Wall, saving on a part that the
River defendeth. First governed by four Bayliffs; then by <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth in <hi>Anno</hi> 1403, erected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <p>(8) The Bishoprick of <hi>Norwich</hi> had first her seat at <hi>Dunwich</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and was there begun by
<hi>Faelix,</hi> who converted this County, and the <hi>East-Angles</hi> to the Faith. Being brought out of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi>
by <hi>Sigebert</hi> (the first Christian King of the <hi>East-Angles</hi>) he landed at <hi>Babingley</hi> by <hi>Lynn,</hi> and there
builded the first Church of these Countries, which in his memory, is at this day called by his Name.
The second he built at <hi>Sharneburn</hi> then of wood, and therefore called <hi>Stock Chappel.</hi> After
<hi>Faelix</hi> and three of his Successors, this Bishoprick was divided into two Sees; the one with eleven
Bishops in succession, continuing at <hi>Dunwich;</hi> the other with twelve, at <hi>Elmham</hi> in <hi>Northfolk.</hi>
Then united again in the time of King <hi>Edwin,</hi> the entire See for twelve other Bishops remained at
<hi>Elmham,</hi> and in the <hi>Conquerours</hi> time was by his Chaplain <hi>Arfastus</hi> (being the thirtieth) translated to
<hi>Thetford,</hi> from thence by <hi>Herbert</hi> (his next Successour save one) bought of <hi>W. Rufus</hi> for 1900
pounds, and brought to <hi>Norwich.</hi> This <hi>Herbert</hi> (sirnamed <hi>Losinga</hi> a <hi>Norman</hi>) builded the Cathedral
Church there, and endowed it with large possessions. Not far from thence he also builded another
Church to S. <hi>Leonard,</hi> a third at <hi>Elmham,</hi> a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
                     <p>BEDFORD-SHIRE, seated in the South-East of this Island, is a plain and champion
Country, and lyeth bounded upon the North with <hi>Huntington-Shire;</hi> upon the East with
<hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Hartford-shires;</hi> upon the South with <hi>Hertford</hi> and <hi>Buckingham-shires;</hi> and
upon the West with <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Northampton-shires.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(2) The Form thereof is somewhat oval, and not very large: for from <hi>Tilbroke</hi> in the
North unto <hi>Studham</hi> in the South, are but twenty four <hi>English</hi> miles; and from <hi>Turny</hi> in the West, unto
<hi>Hartly Coking</hi> in the East, are not fully fourteen; the whole Circumference, about seventy three
miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Air is temperate, and the Soil bounteous, especially in the North, whose Borders the
fruitful <hi>Ouse</hi> with her many windings watereth. The South is more lean, and with greater industry
bringeth forth <hi>Barley,</hi> no better elsewhere. Generally this County is Champion, though some places
be sprinkled with Pasturage and Woods.</p>
                     <p>(4) The ancient Inhabitants known to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that held in this Shire, were part of the <hi>Cattieuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lani,</hi>
a Stout and war-stiring people: and yet upon the report of <hi>Caesars</hi> proceeding, sent him their

                        </hi> the <hi>West-Saxon,</hi> about the year of Grace, 572, who making
it their own, was lastly enjoyed by the <hi>Mercians,</hi> as a part of their Kingdom.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:37437:64"/>(5) In the year of Christs Incarnation 1399, immediately before those Civil Wars, that rent in
pieces the peace of this Land, between the Princes of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> the River <hi>Ouse</hi> near unto
<hi>Harwood,</hi> stood suddenly still, and refrained to pass any further; so that forward, men passed three
miles together on foot in the very depth of her Channel; and backward, the waters swelled unto a
great height: which was observed by the judicious, to foretel some unkind diuision that shortly
should arise.</p>
                     <p>(6) This County, among the common calamities of the Land, when it lay trampled under the
feet of the <hi>Danes,</hi> sustained a part: and after that in the time of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> when the Civil Wars
thundred betwixt <hi>Maud</hi> the <hi>Empress</hi> and himself, the Shire-Town was sore wasted, with great
slaughter of men: So when the <hi>Barons</hi> forsook their allegiance to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Town and Castle
were rendred up into their hands: And lastly, by King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, laid level even with the
ground, some ruinous walls appearing towards the <hi>Ouse,</hi> but not a stone left upon the <hi>Mount</hi> where
stood his foundation.</p>
                     <p>(7) This Town by the <hi>Britains</hi> was called <hi>Lettidur;</hi> and of us, <hi>Bedford;</hi> being the chiefest in
the County, from whom it taketh the name, and is most fruitful, and pleasantly seated, having the

stood a Chappel upon the Bank of <hi>Ouse,</hi> wherein (as <hi>Florilegus</hi> affirmeth) the body of <hi>Offa</hi> the
great <hi>Mercian</hi> King was interred, but by the over-swelling of that River, was born down, and
swallowed up; whose Tombe of Lead (as it were some phantastical thing) appeared often to them
<pb facs="tcp:37437:64"/>
that seek it not, but to them that seek it (saith <hi>Rosse</hi>) it is invisible. This Town is governed year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a <hi>Mayor,</hi> two <hi>Bayliffs,</hi> two <hi>Chamberlains,</hi> a <hi>Recorder,</hi> a <hi>Town-Clerk,</hi> and three <hi>Sergeants</hi> with
<hi>Maces.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(8) A tale of vain credit is reported of <hi>Dunstable,</hi> that it was built to bridle the outragiousness

<hi>Romans,</hi> whose Legions there lay, as appeareth by the Coyns there usually found, which from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gintum</hi>
are corruptly called <hi>Madning-money.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(6) Castles in this Shire are <hi>Woodhill, Eaton, Temsford,</hi> and <hi>Amphill,</hi> an honour now appertaining to
the Crown. And places of Religion, built by devout persons, but for Idolatrous Abuses again abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
were at <hi>Bedford, Harwood, Helenstow, Newenham, Chicksand, Wardon, Woborne,</hi> and <hi>Dunstable.</hi>
All these, with the like, felt the hand of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth to lie so heavy upon them, that they were
not able to sustain the weight, but were crushed to pieces, and fell to the ground.</p>
                     <p>(10) The Graduation of this County, taken for the Shire-Town, is placed from the <hi>Equator</hi> in the
degree of 52 and 30 minutes for Latitude, and is removed from the first West point of Longitude,
20 degrees, and 16 minutes.</p>
                     <p>(11) Whose Princely Families, that have born the Titles both of <hi>Dukes</hi> and <hi>Earls,</hi> are expressed;

At this place <hi>Edward</hi> the elder stopped the passage of the <hi>Danes,</hi> whilst he strengthened <hi>Torcester</hi> against

Patrendune, Asbridge,</hi> and <hi>Alesbury: Asbridge</hi> in great repute for the bloud (supposed out of Christs

<hi>Cornwall,</hi> whereunto resorted great concourse of people for devotion and adoration thereof. But
when the Sunshine of the Gospel had pierced thorow such clouds of darkness, it was perceived
apparently to be onely honey clarified and coloured with Saffron, as was openly shewed at <hi>Pauls
Cross</hi> by the Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> the twenty fourth of <hi>February,</hi> and year of Christ 1538. And
<hi>Alesbury</hi> for the holiness of S. <hi>Edith</hi> was much frequented, who having this Town allotted for her
Dowry, had the world and her husband farewel, in taking upon her the vail of devotion, and in
that fruitful age of Saints became greatly renowned, even as far as to the working of miracles.
These all in the storms and rage of the time, suffered such shipwrack, that from those turmoiled

of this Shire is bordered upon by the Counties of <hi>VVarwick</hi> and <hi>Northampton</hi> the East
with <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the West by <hi>Glocester-shire,</hi> and the South altogether is parted from <hi>Bark-shire</hi> by

                     <p>(2) The blessings both of the sweet-breathing heavens, and the fruitful sight of this Counties soil,
are so happy and so fortunate, that hardly can be said whether exceeds. The Air milde, temperate and
delicate; the Land fertile, pleasant, and bounteous; in a word, both <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> accorded to
make the Inhabitants healthful and happy: The hills loaden with Woods and Cattle, the valleys bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
with Corn and Pasturage, by reason of many fresh springing Rivers which sportingly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorow
make their passage; whereof <hi>Evenlod, Charwell, Tame,</hi> and <hi>Isis</hi> are chief: which two last
making their Bed of Marriage near unto <hi>Dorchester,</hi> run thence together in one channel and name.</p>
                     <p>(3) The length of this Shire is from <hi>Cleydon</hi> in the North-West, unto <hi>Caversham</hi> in her South-East,
near unto <hi>Thamisis,</hi> and amounteth almost to forty miles; the broadest part is in her Western Borders,
which extending from the said <hi>Cleydon</hi> in the North, unto <hi>Faringdon</hi> seated upon the River <hi>Isis</hi> in the
South, are scarcely twenty six: and thence growing narrower like unto a <hi>Wedge,</hi> containing in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
about one hundred and thirty miles.</p>

unto <hi>Clifford</hi> upon another <hi>Avon</hi> in her North, are about forty eight miles; and her
broadest part from East to West, is from <hi>Lechland</hi> unto <hi>Preston,</hi> containing twenty eight: the whole
circumference about one hundred thirty eight miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Form whereof is somewhat long and narrow: the Air thereof is pleasant, sweet, and
delectable; and for fruitfulness of Soyl hear <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and not me; The ground of this Shire
throughout (<hi>saith he</hi>) yieldeth plenty of Corn, and bringeth forth abundance of Fruits; the one through
the natural goodness only of the ground, the other through the diligent manuring and tillage, in such
wise, that it would provoke the laziest person to take pains. Here you may see the High-ways, and
Common Lanes clad with Apple-trees and Pear-trees, not ingraffed by the industry of mens hand,
but growing naturally of their own accord: the ground of it self is so inclined to bear fruits, and those
both in taste and beauty far exceeding others, and will endure until a new supply come. There is not
any County in <hi>England</hi> so thick set with Vineyards as this Province is, so plentiful of increase, and
so pleasant in taste. The very Wines made thereof carry no unpleasant tartness, as being little inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

                     <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
                     <p>RUTLAND-SHIRE, the least of any County in this Realm, is circulated upon the
North with <hi>Lincoln-shire;</hi> upon the East and South with the River <hi>VVeland</hi> is parted from
<hi>Northampton-shire;</hi> and the West is altogether held in with <hi>Leicester-shire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(2) The Form thereof is round, and no larger in compass than a light horse man can
easily ride about in a day: upon which occasion some will have the Shire named of one
<hi>Rut,</hi> that so rode. But others from the redness of the Soyl, will have it called <hi>Rutland;</hi> and so the old
<hi>English-Saxo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

give the name of this Province, seeing the earth doth stain the wool of her Sheep into a reddish co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
Neither is it strange, that the stain of the Soyl gives names unto places, and that very many:
for have we not in <hi>Che-shire</hi> the <hi>Red Rock,</hi> in <hi>Lanca-shire</hi> the <hi>Red Bank,</hi> and in <hi>Wales Rutland Castl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

To speak nothing of that famous <hi>Red Sea,</hi> which shooteth into the Land betwivt <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi>
which gave back her waters for the <hi>Israelites</hi> to pass on foot: all of them named from the colour of
the Soile.</p>
                     <p>(3) The longest part of this Shire is from <hi>Caldecot</hi> in the South upon the River <hi>Ey,</hi> unto <hi>Thistle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
a small Village seated in the North, not fully twelve miles: and from <hi>Timwell</hi> East-ward, to
<hi>Wissenden</hi> in the West, her broadest extent is hardly nine: the whole circumference about forty miles.</p>
                     <p>(4) The Air is good both for health and delight, subject to neither extremity of heat nor cold,
nor is greatly troubled with foggy mists.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:37437:91"/>The Soil is rich, and for Corn and tillage gives place unto none. Woods there are plenty, and
many of them imparked, Hills feeding heards of Neat, and flocks of Sheep; Vallies besprinkled with
many sweet springs; Grain in abundance, and Pastures not wanting: in a word, all things ministred
to the content of life, with a liberal heart and open hand. Only this is objected, that the Circuit is
not great.</p>
                     <p>(5) The draught whereof, that I may acknowledge my duty and his right, I received at the hands
of the right Honourable <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Harrington, Baron</hi> of <hi>Exton,</hi> done by himself in his younger
years.</p>
                     <p>Near unto his house <hi>Burley,</hi> standeth <hi>Okam</hi> a fair Market-Town, which Lordship the said <hi>Baron</hi>
enjoyeth, with a Royalty somewhat extraordinary, which is this: If any Noble by birth come
within the precinct of the said Lordship, he shall forfeit as an homage a shooe from the horse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he rideth, unless he redeem it at a price with money. In witness whereof, there are many Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shooes
nailed upon the Shire-Hall door, some of large size and ancient fashion, others new, and of
our present Nobility; whose names are thereupon stamped as followeth.</p>

were subdued by <hi>P. Ostorius</hi> under the yoke of <hi>Claudius</hi> the <hi>Roman Emperour:</hi> and at their departure,

                     <p>That the <hi>Ferrars</hi> here first seated, besides the credit of Writers, the Horse-shooe, whose badge then

Church fair, end the Town spacious; whose degree of Longitude is 19, 46 scruples, and the
North-poles elevation in Latitude 53 degrees, and 7 minutes.</p>
                     <p>(8) Let it not seem offensive, that I (to fill up this little Shire) have inserted the seat of a Town
not sited in this County: for besides the conveniency of place, the circuit and beauty, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
it being for a time an University, did move much; yea, and the first in this Island, if <hi>Iohn Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi>
Author fail him not, that will have <hi>Bladud</hi> to bring from <hi>Athens</hi> certain <hi>Philosophers,</hi> whom
here he seated, and made publick profession of the Liberal Sciences, where (as he saith) a great
number of Scolars Studied the Arts, and so continuing an University unto the coming of <hi>Augustine,</hi>
at which time the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> interdicted it, for certain Heresies sprung up among the <hi>Britains</hi>
and <hi>Saxons.</hi> But most true it is, that the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, upon debate falling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Southern and Northern Students at <hi>Oxford,</hi> many School-men withdrew themselves hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and a while professed, and named a Colledge, according to one in <hi>Oxford, Brazen-nose,</hi> which
retaineth that name unto this day. This was so great a skar unto the other, that when they were
recalled by Proclamation to <hi>Oxford,</hi> it was provided by Oath, that <hi>no Student in Oxford should publickly
profess or read in the Arts at Stanford, to the prejudice of Oxford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(9) As this Shire is the least in circuit, so is it with the fewest Market-Towns replenished, having
onely two. And from societies that feed upon the labours of others, was this Land the freest: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Rishal,</hi> where <hi>Tibba</hi> the <hi>Falconers</hi> Goddess was worshiped for a Saint, when Superstition had

than that at <hi>Okam,</hi> whose ruines shew that a Castle hath been there.</p>

which is nothing so well inhabited as the rest.</p>
                     <p>(2) The Air is gentle, milde, and temperate, and giveth appetite both to labour and rest:
wholesome it is, and draweth mans life to a long age, and that much without sickness; at <hi>Carleton</hi>
onely some defect of pronunciation appeareth in their speech.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Soil thus consisting, the Commodities are raised accordingly of Corn, Cattle, and
Coals; and in the Rocks near <hi>Bever</hi> are sometimes found the <hi>Astroites,</hi> the Star-like precious
Stone.</p>
                     <p>(4) The ancient people that inhabited this County, were the <hi>Coritani,</hi> who were spread further
into other Shires, but after that the <hi>Romans</hi> had left the Land to it self, this with many more fell to
be under the possession and government of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> and their Kings, from whom the <hi>English</hi>

                     <p>(5) In Circular-wise (almost) the compass of this Shire is drawn indifferently spacious, but

stubbornness of Earl Robert</hi> (saith he) <hi>the whole City</hi> Leicester <hi>was besieged and thrown down by</hi>
King Henry, <hi>and the Wall that seemed indissoluble, was utterly raced even to the ground.</hi> The pieces
of these Fragments so fallen down remained in his days like to hard Rocks, through the strength
of the Morter cementing whole lumps together: and at the Kings command the City was
set on fire and burnt, the Castle raced, and a heavy imposition laid upon the Citizens, who with
<pb facs="tcp:37437:94"/>
great sums of money bought their own banishments: but were so used in their departure, that
for extream fear many of them took Sanctuary, both at S. <hi>Edmunds</hi> and S. <hi>Albans,</hi> In repentance
of these mischiefs, the Author thereof, Earl <hi>Robert,</hi> built the Monastery of S. <hi>Mary de Pratis,</hi>
wherein himself became a Canon Regular, and for fifteen years continuance in sad laments served
God in continual prayers. With the like devotion, <hi>Henry</hi> the first Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> built an Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
for an hundred and ten poor people, with a Collegiate Church, a Dean, twelve Canons Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries,
as many Vicars, suffciently provided for with Revenues; wherein himself lyeth buried: and it
was the greatest ornament of that City, until the hand of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth lay over-heavy upon
all the like foundations; and laid their aspiring tops at his own feet.</p>
                     <p>The fortunes of another <hi>Crouch-back</hi> (King <hi>Richard</hi> Usurper) who no less remarkable in this
City than the former <hi>Robert</hi> was, both of them in like degree of dishonourable course of <hi>life,</hi> though
of different <hi>issue</hi> at their deaths, the one dying penitent and of devout esteem; the other leaving
the stench of Tyranny to all following ages; who from this City setting forth in one day with
great pompe, and in Battle aray, to keep the Crown sure upon his own Helmet, in a sore fought
field, yieldeth both it and his life, unto the head and hands of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Richmond</hi> his Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
and the next day was brought back, like a Hog, naked and torn, and with contempt, without
tears obscurely buried in the <hi>Gray Friers</hi> of this City; whose suppression had suppressed the plot
place of his grave, and only the stone-chest wherein he was laid (a drinking trough now for horses
in a common Inn) retaineth the memory of that great Monarchs Funeral: and so did a stone in the
Church and Chappel of S. <hi>Maries;</hi> inclose the Corps of the proud and pontifical cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> who
had prepared for himself, as was said, a far more richer Monument.</p>
                     <p>(7) Other places worthy of remembrance in this Shire were these: In the West, where a high
Cross was erected, in former times stood the fair City <hi>Cleycester,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> BENONNE,
<pb facs="tcp:37437:94"/>
where their Legions lay, and where their two principal ways crossed each other, as the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants

by <hi>Cuthwolse</hi> their King, about the year of Christ 572.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Redmore,</hi> near <hi>Bosworth,</hi> Westward in this County, the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> lay in hazard
of one Battle, when King <hi>Richards</hi> field was fought, where the Land at once was free from a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and wicked Usurper. Neither may we pass <hi>Lutterworth,</hi> as the least in account, where the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

the Gospel in that his charge; the stile of his pen, so piercing in power, that the man of Sin ever
since hath been better known to the world.</p>
                     <p>(8) Religious houses by Princes erected, and by them devoted to God and his service, the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in this Shire were at <hi>Leicester, Grace-Dieu, Kerby-Bellers,</hi> and at <hi>Burton</hi> a Spittle for <hi>Lazers,</hi> a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease

were in the defects of the soul; whose skirts being turned up to the sight of the world, their
shames were discovered, and those houses dissolved, that had long maintained such Idolatrous sins.</p>
                     <p>(9) This Shires division is into six Hundreds, and in them are seated twelve Market-Towns for
commerce, and containeth in circuit two hundred Parish-Churches.</p>

<hi>Hamber,</hi> on the East with the <hi>German Ocean,</hi> upon the South, is parted from <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>

                     <p>(3) The Air upon the East and South part is both thick and foggy, by reason of the Fens and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute

from all power of hurt.</p>
                     <p>(4) The Form of this County doth somewhat resemble the body of a Lute, whose East-coasts lye
bow-like into the <hi>German-Ocean,</hi> all along pestered with inlets of salt waters and sands, which are
neither firm nor safe for travellers, as those in the South proved unto King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who marching North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
from <hi>Northfolk,</hi> against his disloyal Barons, upon those washes lost all his furniture and carriage
by the sudden return of the Sea, and softness of the Sands.</p>
                     <p>(5) Her Soil upon the West and North is abundantly fertile, pleasant and rich, stored with

                     <p>(6) The Shires commodities consist chiefly in Corn, Cattle, Fish, Fowl, Flax and Alablaster;

ploughed up a brazen vessel, wherein was inclosed a golden Helmet of an ancient fashion, set with
precious stones, which was presented to <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> Wife and Dowager to King <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth.</p>
                     <p>(7) This Shire triumpheth in the birth of <hi>Beauclerk,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the first, whom <hi>Selby</hi> brought
forth, and of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, at <hi>Bullingbrooke</hi> born; but may as justly lament for the death
of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> herein poisoned by <hi>Simon</hi> a Monk of <hi>Swynsted Abbey;</hi> and of Queen <hi>Eleanor,</hi> wife to
King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, the mirrour of wedlock, and love to the Commons, who at <hi>Hardby,</hi> near
<hi>Bullingbrooke,</hi> his birth-place, ended her life.</p>
                     <p>(8) Trade and commerce for provision of life is vented thorow thirty one Market-Towns
in this Shire, whereof <hi>Lincoln</hi> the Counties Namer is chief, by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Antonine</hi> called <hi>Lindum,</hi>

nine hundred Burgesses with twelve Lage-men, having Sac and Soc. And in the <hi>Normans</hi> time, saith

whence <hi>Arthur</hi> enforced their Host: the like also did <hi>Edmund</hi> to the destroying <hi>Danes;</hi> and by the

for defaced, wherein not only the buildings were consumed, but wihal many men and women in
the violence thereof perished: as also by an Earth quake her foundation was much weakened and
shaken, wherein the fair Cathedral Church, dedicated to the Virgin of Virgins, was rent in pieces.
The government of this City is committed yearly to a Mayor, two Sheriffs, twelve Aldermen in
Scarlet, a Sword, a Hat of Estate, a Recorder, Sword-bearer, and four Serjeants with Maces:
whose situation on a steep hill standeth for Longitude, in the degree 20, 10 scruples, the Pole elevated

                     <p>(10) Commotions in this shire were raised the eight and twentieth of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight,
where twenty thousand making insurrection, violently sware certain Lords and Gentlemen to
their Articles. But no sooner they heard of the Kings power coming, but they dispersed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb facs="tcp:37437:97"/>
and sued for pardon. And again in the third year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixt, in ease of Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
<hi>Lincoln</hi> rose in seditious manner, as did they of <hi>Cornwall, Devonshire, York-shire,</hi> and <hi>Norfolk:</hi>
but after some slaughters of their chiefest men, were reduced to former obedience.</p>
                     <p>The Shires division is into three principal parts, viz. <hi>Lindsey, Kesteven,</hi> and <hi>Holland; Lindsey</hi> is subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided

                     <p>SHROP-SHIRE, is both large in circuit, well peopled, and very fruitful for life. It lyeth
circulated upon the North with the County Palatine of <hi>Chester;</hi> upon the East altogether
with <hi>Stafford-shire;</hi> upon the South with <hi>Worcester, Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Radnor-shire;</hi> and upon

                     </p>
                     <p>(2) The form thereof is almost circular or round, whose length from <hi>Wooserton</hi> below
<hi>Lodlane South,</hi> to <hi>Over</hi> neer unto the River <hi>Trent</hi> in the North, is thirty four miles: the broadest part
is from <hi>Tong</hi> in the East, to <hi>Oswestre</hi> fited at the head of <hi>Morda</hi> in the West, twenty and five miles:
the whole in circuit about, extending to one hundred thirty four miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) Wholesome is the Air, delectable and good, yielding the Spring and the Autumn, Seed-time
and Harvest, in a temperate condition, and affordeth health to the Inhabitants in all seasons of the
year.</p>
                     <p>(4) The Soil is rich, and standeth most upon a reddish Clay, abounding in Wheat and Barley, Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coals,
Iron and Woods; which two last continue not long in league together. It hath Rivers that
make fruitful the Land, and in their Waters contain great store of fresh-fish, whereof <hi>Severn</hi> is the
chief, and second in the Realm, whose stream cutteth this County in the midst, and with many wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sporteth her self forward, leaving both Pastures and Meadows bedecked with flowers and green
colours, which every where she bestoweth upon such her attendants.</p>
                     <p>(5) This River was once the bounds of the <hi>North-Britains,</hi> and divided their possession from
the Land of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> until of latter times their began to decay, and the <hi>Welsh</hi> to increase, who
<pb facs="tcp:37437:105"/>
enlarged their lists to the River <hi>Dee.</hi> So formerly had it separated the <hi>Ordovices</hi> from the <hi>Cornav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

those ancient Inhabitants mentioned by <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> The <hi>Ordovices</hi> under <hi>Caractacus</hi> purchased great
honour, whilst he a Prince of the <hi>Silures</hi> removed his Wars thence among them, where a while he
maintained the <hi>Britains</hi> liberty with valour and courage, in despite of the <hi>Romans.</hi> His Fort is yet
witness of his unfortunate Fight, seated near <hi>Clune-Castle,</hi> at the confluence of that River with <hi>Temd,</hi>
where (in remembrance of him) the place is yet called <hi>Caer-Caradoc,</hi> a Fort of his won by <hi>P. Ostorius</hi>
Lieutenant of the <hi>Romans,</hi> about the year of Grace 53. The <hi>Cornavii</hi> were seated upon the North of
<hi>Severn,</hi> and branched into other Counties, of whom we have said.</p>
                     <p>(6) But when the strength of the <hi>Romans</hi> was too weak to support their own Empire, and <hi>Britain</hi>
emptied of her Souldiers to resist, the <hi>Saxons</hi> set foot in this most fair Soil, and made it a part of their
<hi>Mercian</hi> Kingdom: their line likewise issued to the last period, and the <hi>Normans</hi> beginning where
these <hi>Saxons</hi> left, the <hi>VVelshmen</hi> took advantage of all present occasions, and brake over <hi>Severn</hi> unto
the River <hi>Dee;</hi> to recover which, the <hi>Normans</hi> first Kings often assayed, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Second with
such danger of Life, that at the Siege of <hi>Bridge-North</hi> he had been slain, had not Sir <hi>Hubert Syncler</hi>
received the Arrow aimed at him, in stepping betwixt that Shaft and his Soveraign, and therewith was
shot thorow unto death. In the like danger stood <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who in the strait Siege of
<hi>Ludlow,</hi> begirt by King <hi>Stephen,</hi> had been plucked from his Saddle with an Iron-hook from the Wall,
had not <hi>Stephen</hi> presently rescued him, <hi>Anno</hi> 1139.</p>
                     <p>(7) This then being the <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>VVales,</hi> was sore afflicted by bloody broils,
which caused many of their Towns to be strongly walled, and thirty two Castles to be strongly
built: Lastly, into this County the most wise King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh sent his eldest Son Prince
<hi>Arthur,</hi> to be resident at <hi>Ludlow,</hi> where that fair Castle became a most famous Princes Court
And here King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight ordained the Council of the <hi>Marches,</hi> consisting of a Lord Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb facs="tcp:37437:105"/>
as many Counsellors as the Prince shall please, a Secretary, an Attorney, a Soliciter, and four
Iustices of the Counties in <hi>Wales,</hi> in whose Court were pleaded the Causes depending and termly tried
for the most part in presence of that honourable President.</p>
                     <p>(8) But the Shire-Town <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> for circuit, trade and wealth, doth far exceed this, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to few of our Cities, her buildings fair, her streets many and large, her Citizens rich, her
trade for the most part in the Staple Commodities of Cloth and Freeses; her Walls strong and of a large

Castle, down unto and in part along the side of <hi>Severn:</hi> thorow which there are three entrances
into the Town, East and West, over by two fair Stone-Bridges, with Towers, Gates and Bars, and the
third into the North, no less strong than them over which is mounted a large Castle, whose gaping
chinks do doubtless threaten her fall. This Town is governed by two Bailiffs, yearly elected out or
twenty four Burgesses, a Recorder, Town-Clerk, and Chamberlain, with three Sergeants at Mace: the
Pole being raised hence from the degrees of Latitude 53, 16 minutes, and from West in Longitude 17

and dissolveth Ice sooner there then in those parts that are further off; and so wholsome for life, that
the Inhabitants generally attain to many years.</p>
                     <p>(4) The Soyl is fat, fruitful and rich, yielding abundantly both profit and pleasures for Man. The
Champion grounds make glad the hearts of their Tillers: The Meadows imbroydered with divers

twelve hundred Christian Monks, resorted thither from <hi>Bangor</hi> to pray. Again by the <hi>Danes</hi> it was
sore defaced, when their destroying feet had trampled down the beauty of the Land. But was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built

                     <p>THE County Palatine of <hi>Lancaster</hi> (famous for the four <hi>Henries,</hi> the fourth, fifth, sixth, and
seventh, Kings of <hi>England,</hi> derived from <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi>) is upon the
South, confined and parted by the River <hi>Mersey,</hi> from the County Palatine of <hi>Chester;</hi>
the fair County of <hi>Darby-shire</hi> bordering upon the East; the large County of <hi>York-shire</hi>
together with <hi>Westmerland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> being her kind neighbours upon the North,
and the Sea called <hi>Mare Hibernicum,</hi> embracing her upon the West.</p>
                     <p>(2) The form thereof is long, for it is so inclosed between <hi>York-shire</hi> on the East side, and the <hi>Irish-Sea</hi>
on the West, that where it boundeth upon <hi>Cheshire</hi> on the South-side, it is broader, and by little
and little more Northward it goeth (confining upon <hi>Westmerland</hi>) the more narrow it groweth. It
containeth in length from <hi>Brathey</hi> Northward, to <hi>Halwood</hi> Southward, fifty seven miles; from <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
in the East, to <hi>Formby</hi> by <hi>Altmouth</hi> in the West, thirty one; and the whole circumference in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
one hundred threescore and ten miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Air is subtile and piercing, not troubled with gross vapours or foggy mists, by reason
whereof the People of that Country live long and healthfully, and are not subject to strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
diseases.</p>
                     <p>(4) The Soil for the generality is not very fruitful, yet it produceth such numbers of Cattel
of such large proportion, and such goodly heads, and horns, as the whole Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi>
doth scarce the like. It is a Country replenished with all necessaries for the use of Man, yielding
without any great labour, the commodity of Corn, Flax, Grass, Coals, and such like. The
<pb facs="tcp:37437:110"/>
Sea also addeth her blessing to the Land, that the People of that Province want nothing that serveth
either for the sustenance of Nature, or the satiety of appetite. They are plentifully furnished with all
sorts of Fish, Flesh, and Fowls. Their principal Fuell is Coal and Turff, which they have in
great abundance, the Gentlemen reserving their Woods very carefully, as a beauty and principal
ornament to their Mannors and Houses. And though it be far from <hi>

this Kingdom) yet doth it every year furnish her and many other parts of the Land besides, with
many thousands of Cattel (bred in this Country) giving thereby, and other ways, a firm testimony
to the World, of the blessed abundance that it hath pleased God to enrich this noble Dukedom
withall.</p>
                     <p>(5) This Counties ancient Inhabitants were the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> of whom there is more mention in the
description of <hi>York-shire,</hi> who by <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour were brought under the <hi>Roman</hi> subjection,
that so held aud made it their Seat, secured by their Garrisons, as hath been gathered as well by many
Inscriptions found in Walls and ancient Monuments fixed in Stones, as by certain Altars erected in
favour of their Emperours. After the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> brought it under their protection, and held
it for a part of their <hi>Northumbrian</hi> Kingdom, till it was first made subjugate to the Invasion of the
<hi>Danes,</hi> and then conquered by the victorious <hi>Normans,</hi> whose Posterities from thence are branched fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(6) Places of antiquity or memorable note are these: the Town of <hi>Manchester</hi> (so famous, as well
for the Market-Place, Church and Colledge, as for the resort unto it for Clothing) was called <hi>Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by <hi>Antonine</hi> the Emperour, and was made a Fort and Station of the <hi>Romans.</hi>

                        </hi>) though it be a small
Town, yet by Tradition hath been called the richest Town in Christendom, and reported to have
been the Seat of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which the many Monuments of their Antiquities, Statues, Pieces of
<pb facs="tcp:37437:111"/>
Coin, and other several Inscriptions, digg'd up from time to time by the Inhabitants, may give us suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
perswasion to believe.</p>
                     <p>But the Shire Town is <hi>Lancaster,</hi> more pleasant in situation, than rich of Inhabitants, built on the
South of the River <hi>Lon,</hi> and is the same <hi>Longovicum,</hi> where (as we find in the <hi>Noti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e Provinces</hi>) a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the <hi>Longovicarians</hi> under the Lieutenant General of <hi>Britain</hi> lay. The beauty of this Town is in
the Church, Castle, and Bridge: her Streets many, and stretched fair in length. Unto this Town King
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third granted a Mayor and two Bailiffs, which to this day are elected out of twelve Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
assisted by twenty four Burgesses, by whom it is yearly governed, with the supply of two Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlains,
a Recorder, Town-Clerk, and two Sergeants at Mace. The elevation of whose Pole is in
the degree of Latitude 54 and 58 scruples, and her Longitude removed from the West point unto the
degree 17 and 40 scruples.</p>
                     <p>(7) This Country in divers places suffereth the force of many flowing Tides of the Sea, by which
(after a sort) it doth violently rent asunder one part of the Shire from the other: as in <hi>Fourness,</hi> where
the Ocean being displeased that the shore should from thence shoot a main way into the West, hath
not obstinately ceased from time to time to slash and mangle it, and with his Fell irruptions and boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
Tides to devour it.</p>
                     <p>Another thing there is, not unworthy to be recommended to memory that in this Shire, not far from
<hi>Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the space of ten miles, of wonderful depth, and all paved with stone in the bottom: and along the
Sea-side in many places may be seen heaps of sand, upon which the People pour water until it recover
a saltish humour, which they afterwards boil with Turffs, till it become white Salt.</p>
                     <p>(8) This Country, as it is thus on the one side freed by the natural resistance of the Sea from the
force of Invasions, so is it strengthened on the other by many Castles, and fortified places, that take
<pb facs="tcp:37437:111"/>
away the opportunity of making Roads and Incursions in the Country. And as it was with the first
that felt the fury of the <hi>Saxons</hi> cruelty, so was it the last and longest that was subdued under the <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>(9) In this Province our noble <hi>Arthur</hi> (who died laden with many Trophies of honour) is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Ninius</hi> to have put the <hi>Saxons</hi> to flight in a memorable Battel near <hi>Duglasse,</hi> a little Brook not
far from the Town of <hi>Wiggin.</hi> But the attemps of War, as they are several, so they are uncertain;
for they made not Duke <hi>Wade</hi> happy in his success, but returned him an unfortunate enterpriser in
the Battel which he gave to <hi>Ardulph</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland</hi> at <hi>Billango,</hi> in the year 798. So were
the events uncertain in the <hi>Civil Wars</hi> of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster:</hi> for by them was bred and brought
forth that bloody division, and fatal strife of the Noble Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ses, that with variable success to both
Parties (for many years together) molested the peace and quiet of the Land, and defiled the earth
with blood, in such violent manner, that it exceeded the horror of those <hi>Civil Wars</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> that
were betwixt <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Scylla, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar, Octavius</hi> and <hi>Antony;</hi> or that of the two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Houses <hi>Valoys</hi> and <hi>Burbon,</hi> that a long time troubled the State of <hi>France:</hi> for in the division
of these two Princely Families there were thirteen Fields fought, and three Kings of <hi>England,</hi> one
Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> twelve Dukes, one Marquess, eighteen Earls, one Vicount, and three and twenty Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
besides Knights and Gentlemen, lost their lives in the same. Yet at last by the happy Marriage
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, King of <hi>England,</hi> next Heir to the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> with <hi>Elizabeth</hi> daughter
and Heir to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, of the House of <hi>York,</hi> the white and red Roses were conjoyned in the

(and since suppressed) both fair for Structure and Building, and rich for seat and Situation: namely,
<hi>Burstogh, VVhalleia, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Penwortham.</hi> It is divided into six Hundreds, besides <hi>Fourness Felles,</hi>
and <hi>Lancasters Liberties,</hi> that lie in the North part. It is beautified with fifteen Market-Towns, both
fair for situation and building, and famous for the concourse of people for buying and selling. It hath

may seem to diminish from the dignity of so worthy a Country; nor so prodigally, as to spend time in
superfluous praising of that which never any (as yet) dispraised. And although perhaps it may seem a
labour unnecessary, to make relation of ancient remembrances either of the Name or Nature of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
especially looking into the difference of Time it self (which in every age bringeth forth divers ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects)
and the dispositions of men, that for the most part take less pleasure in them, than in divulging
the occurrents of their own times: yet I hold it not unfit to begin there, from whence the first certain
direction is given to proceed; for (even of these ancient things) there may be good use made, either
by imitation, or way of comparison, as neither the reperition, nor the repetition thereof shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted impertinent.</p>
                     <p>(2) You shall therefore understand: That the County of <hi>York</hi> was in the <hi>Saxon</hi>-tongue called
<hi>Ebona ycyne,</hi> and now commonly <hi>York-shire,</hi> far greater and more numerous in the Circuit of her
miles, than any Shire of <hi>England.</hi> She is much bound to the singular love and motherly care of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in placing her under so temperate a clime, that in every measure she is indifferently fruitful.
<pb facs="tcp:37437:114"/>
If one part of her be stone, and a sandy barren ground: another is fertile and richly adorned with
Corn-fields. If you here find it naked, and destitute of Woods, you shall see it there shadowed with
Forrests full of Trees, that have very thick bodies, sending forth many fruitful and profitable branches-
If one place of it be Moorish, miry, and unpleasant; another makes a free tender of delight, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
it self to the Eye, full of beauty and contentive variety.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Bishoprick of <hi>Durham</hi> fronts her on the North-side, and is separated by a continued course
of the River <hi>Tees.</hi> The <hi>German-Sea</hi> lyeth sore upon her East-side, beating the shores with her boiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Waves and Billows. The West part is bounded with <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and <hi>Westmerland.</hi> The South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
hath <hi>Cheshire</hi> and <hi>Darby-shire</hi> (friendly Neighbours unto her) with the which she is first inclosed:
then with <hi>Nottingham</hi> and with <hi>Lincoln-shires:</hi> after divided with that famous Arm of the Sea <hi>Humber;</hi>
Into which all the Rivers that water this Country, empty themselves, and pay their ordinary Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
as into the common receptacle and store-house of <hi>Neptune,</hi> for all the watry Pensions of this
Province.</p>
                     <p>(4) This whole Shire (being of it self so spacious) for the more easie and better ordering of her
Civil Government, is divided into three parts: which according to three quarters of the World, are
called, <hi>The West-Riding, The East-Riding,</hi> and <hi>The North-Riding. West-Riding</hi> is for a good space com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
with the River <hi>Ouse,</hi> with the bounds of <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and with the South limits of the Shire, and
beareth towards the West and South. <hi>East-Riding</hi> bends it self to the Ocean, with the which, and
with the River <hi>Derwent</hi> she is inclosed, and looks into that part where the Sun rising, and shewing
forth his Beams, makes the World both glad and glorious in his brightness. <hi>North-Riding</hi> extends
it self <hi>Northward,</hi> hemmed in as it were with the River <hi>Tees</hi> and <hi>Derwent,</hi> and a long race of the
River <hi>Ouse.</hi> The length of this Shire, extended from <hi>Horthill</hi> in the South, to the mouth of <hi>Tees</hi> in
the North, are neer unto seventy miles, the breadth from <hi>Flambrough-head</hi> to <hi>Horn-Castle</hi> upon the

                           </gap>,</hi> is fourscore miles; the whole Circumference is three hundred and eight miles.</p>
                     <p>(5) The Soil of this County for the generality is reasonable fertile, and yields sufficiency of Corn
and Cattle within it self. One part whereof is particularly made famous by a Quarry of Stone, out of
which the stones newly hewn be very soft, but seasoned with wind and weather of themselves do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
become exceeding hard and solid. Another, by a kind of <hi>Limstone</hi> whereof it consisteth, which
being burnt, and conveyed into the other parts of the Country, which are hilly and somewhat cold,
serve to manure and enrich their Corn fields.</p>
                     <p>(6) That the <hi>Romans</hi> flourishing in military prowess, made their several stations in this Country,
is made manifest by their Monuments, by many Inscriptions fastned in the Walls of Churches, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Columns engraven with <hi>Roman</hi> work lying in Church-yards, by many votive Altars digg'd up that
were erected (as it should seem) to their Tutelar Gods (for they had local and peculiar Topick Gods,
whom they honoured as Keepers and Guardians of some particular Places of the Country) as also by
a kind of Brick which they used: for the <hi>Romans</hi> in time of peace, to avoid and withstand idleness (as
an enemy to vertuous and valorous enterprises) still exercised their Legions and Cohorts in casting of
Ditches, making of High-ways, building of Bridges, and making of Bricks, which having sithence been
found, and from time to time digg'd out of the ground, prove the Antiquity of the place by the <hi>Roman</hi>
Inscriptions upon them.</p>
                     <p>(7) No less argument of the piety hereof, are the many Monasteries, Abbeys and Religious
Houses that have been placed in this Country; which whilest they retained their own state and
magnificence, were great ornaments unto it: but since their dissolution, and that the Teeth of Time
(which devours all things) have eaten into them, they are become like dead Carkasses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaving only
some poor Ruins and Remains alive, as Reliques to Posterity, to shew of what beauty and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
they have been. Such was the Abbey of <hi>Whitby,</hi> founded by Lady <hi>Hilda,</hi> daughter of the

                     <p>These places for Religion erected, with many more within this Provincial Circuit, and consecrated
unto holy purposes, shew the antiquity, and how they have been sought unto by confluences of Pilgrims
in their manner of Devotions: The mists of which superstitious obscurities, are since cleared by the
pure light of the Gospel revealed, and the skirts of Idolatry unfolded to her own shame and ignominy:
And they made subject to the dissolution of Times, serving only as antique Monuments and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
to the memory of succeeding Ages.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:37437:115"/>
related of it; namely, That a Clerk (for so they call him) being far in love with a Maid, and by no
means either of long praises or large promises, able to gain like affection at her hands, when he saw
his hopes frustrate, and that he was not like to have his purpose of her, turned his love in rage, and cut
off the Maids head, which being afterwards hung upon an Ewe-tree, common people counted it as an
hallowed Relique till it was rotten: And afterwards (such was the credulity of that time) it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the opinion of reverence and Religion still: for the People resorted thither on Pilgrimage, and
perswaded themselves, that the little Veins that spread out between the Bark and Body of the Ewe trees
like fine threds, were the very Hairs of the Maids head. Hereupon it was called by this name <hi>Halig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi>

the little Region about it (in times past called by an old name <hi>Elmet</hi>) was conquered by <hi>Eadwin</hi> King
of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the son of <hi>Aela,</hi> after he had expelled <hi>Cereticus</hi> a <hi>British</hi> King, in the year of
Christ, 620.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Casterford</hi> (called by <hi>Antonine Legiotium</hi> and <hi>Legetium</hi>) the Citizens of <hi>York</hi> slew many of King
<hi>Ethelreds</hi> Army, and had a great hand against him, in so much as he that before sat in his Throne of
Majesty, was on a sudden daunted, and ready to offer submission.</p>
                     <p>But the most worthy of memory, was that Field fought on <hi>Palm Sunday,</hi> 1461. in the quarrel of
<hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> where <hi>England</hi> never saw more puissant Forces both of Gentry and Nobility:
for there were in the Field at one time (partakers on both sides) to the number of one hundred thousand
fighting men. When the fight bad continued doubtful a great part of the day, the <hi>Lancastrians</hi> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
longer to abide the violence of their enemies, turned back and fled amain, and such as took part
with <hi>York,</hi> followed them so hotly in chase, and killed such a number of Nobles and Gentlemen, that
thirty thousand <hi>Englishmen</hi> were that day left dead in the Field.</p>
                     <p>(11) Let us now loose the point of this Compass, and sail into some other parts of this Province,
<pb facs="tcp:37437:117"/>
to find out matter of other memorable moment. Under <hi>Knausbrough</hi> there is a Well called <hi>Dropping
Well,</hi> in which the waters spring not out of the veins of the earth, but distill and trickle down from the
Rocks that hang over it: It is of this vertue and efficacy, that it turns Wood into Stone: for what Wood
soever is put into it, it will be shortly covered over with a stony bark, and be turned into Stone, as hath
been often observed.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Giggleswick</hi> also about a mile from <hi>Settle</hi> (a Market-Town) there are certain small Springs not
distant a quaits cast from one another: the middlemost of which doth at every quarter of an hour ebb
and flow about the height of a quarter of a yard when it is highest, and at the ebb falleth so low, that
it is not an inch deep with water. Of no less worthiness to be remembred is St. <hi>Wilfrids</hi> Needle, a
place very famous in times past for the narrow hole in the close vaulted room under the ground, by
which womens honesties were wont to be tried, for such as were chaste pass thorow with much facility;
but as many as had plaid false, were miraculously held fals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Tees</hi> and <hi>Derwent,</hi> and all along the <hi>German Seas.</hi> It is neighboured on the North
with <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and their Iurisdictions parted by the River <hi>Derwent:</hi> her West is
touched by <hi>Cumberland, Westmorland,</hi> and from <hi>Stain-More</hi> divided by the River <hi>Tees,</hi>
and by the same water on her South, from <hi>York-shire</hi> even unto the Sea; and the East is
altogether coasted by the <hi>German-Seas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(2) The form thereof is triangular, and sides not much differing; for from her South-East, unto the
West-point, are about thirty miles: from thence to her North-east and <hi>Tyne-mouth,</hi> are likewise as
many, and her base along the Sea shore are twenty-three miles; the whole in circumference, about
one hundred and three miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Air is sharp and very piercing, and would be more, were it not that the vapours from the
<hi>German-Seas</hi> did help much to dissolve her Ice and Snow; and the store of Coals therein growing and
gotten, do warm the body, and keep back the cold; which fewel besides their own use, doth yield
great commodities unto this Province<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by trade thereof into other parts.</p>
                     <p>(4) For Soil, it consisteth much alike of Pastures, Arable, and barren grounds; the East is the

in the General of <hi>York-shire,</hi> they being subdued by the <hi>Romans;</hi> after whom the <hi>Saxons</hi> made it a
part of their <hi>Northumberland Kingdom;</hi> at first a Province belonging to the <hi>Deirians,</hi> and enjoyed
by <hi>Ella</hi> their first King; afterwards invaded by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and lastly possessed by the <hi>Normans:</hi> whose
site being so near unto <hi>Scotland,</hi> hath many times felt their fury, and hath been as a Buckler betwixt
them and the <hi>English;</hi> for which cause the Inhabitants have certain freedoms, and are not charged
with service as other Counties are, so that this with <hi>Westmorland, Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi>
are not divided into hundreds in those Parliament Rolls whence I had the rest; which want I must
leave for others to supply.</p>
                     <p>(6) Over this County, the Bishops thereof have had the Royalties of Princes; and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
have pleaded priviledge not to pass in service of War over the River of <hi>Tees</hi> or <hi>Tyne;</hi> whose
charge (as they have alledged) was to keep and defend the Corps of S. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> their great adored
Saint, and therefore they termed themselves, <hi>The holy work folks.</hi> And the repute of this <hi>Cuthbert</hi>
and his supposed defence against the <hi>Scots</hi> was such, that our <hi>English</hi> Kings in great devotion have
gone in Pilgrimage to visite his Tomb, and have given many large possessions to his Church:
such were King <hi>Egfred, Aelfred,</hi> and <hi>Guthrun</hi> the <hi>Dane, Edward</hi> and <hi>Athelstane</hi> Monarch of <hi>England,</hi>

to be thus named in our language by the situation, which in every part is so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously

of <hi>England.</hi> It challengeth not much glory for Antiquity; only that it accounteth it a great credit,
that it hath dignified three Earls with the title thereof, as <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> whom <hi>Henry</hi> the

chosen every year out of his twelve Brethren, who are all distinguished and notified from the
rest by the wearing of purple Garments. The Alderman and his Senior Brother are always Iustices of
Peace and Quorum. There are in it a Town Clerk, a Recorder, two Sergeants at Mace, and two
Chamberlains. By Mathematical observation the site of this Town is in the degree of Longitude 17,
30 scruples from the first West-point, and the Pole elevated in Latitude to the degree 55, and 15

was a little Monastery seated near unto the River <hi>Loder,</hi> built by <hi>Thomas</hi> the son of <hi>Gospatricke,</hi> the
Son of <hi>Orms:</hi> where there is a Fountain or Spring that Ebbs and Flows many times a day, and it is

by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> called the <hi>Itune-Bay.</hi> The North-West part is neighboured by <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi>
more East-ward with <hi>Westmerland,</hi> the South with <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and the
West is wholly washed with the <hi>Irish-Seas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(2) The form whereof is long and narrow, pointing wedg-like into the South, which part is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pestred with copped hills, and therefore hath the name of <hi>Cop-land.</hi> The middle is more level,
and better inhabited, yielding sufficient for the sustenance of man: but the North is wild and solitary,
cumbred with Hills, as <hi>Copland</hi> is.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Air is piercing, and of a sharp temperature, and would be more biting, were it not that
those high Hills break off the Northern storms, and cold falling Snows.</p>
                     <p>(4) Notwithstanding, rich is this Province, and with great varieties thereof is replenished: the
Hills, though rough, yet smile upon their beholders, spread with Sheep and Cattel, the Vallies sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with Grass and Corn sufficient: the Sea affordeth great store of Fish, the Land overspread with
variety of Fowls, and the Rivers feed a kind of Muskle that bringeth forth Pearl, where in the
mouth of the <hi>Irt,</hi> as they lie gaping and sucking in Dew, the Country people gather, and sell to the
<hi>Lapidaries</hi> to their own little, and the buyers great gain. But the <hi>Mines Royal</hi> of <hi>Copper,</hi> whereof
this Country yieldeth much, is for use, the richest of all: the place is at <hi>Keswick</hi> and <hi>Newland,</hi> where
<pb facs="tcp:37437:123"/>
likewise the <hi>Black-Lead</hi> is gotten, whose plenty maketh it of no great esteem; otherwise a commodity
that could hardly be missed.</p>
                     <p>(5) The ancient Inhabitants known to the <hi>Romans,</hi> were the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> whom <hi>Ptolomy</hi> disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
into <hi>Westmorland, Richmond, Durham, York-shire,</hi> and <hi>Lancashire.</hi> But when the <hi>Saxons</hi> had
overborn the <hi>Britains,</hi> and forced them out of the best, to seek their resting among the vast Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
these by them were entred into, where they held play with their enemies, maugre their force,
and from them, as <hi>Marianus</hi> doth witness, the Land was called <hi>Cumber,</hi> of those <hi>Kumbri</hi> the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi>
But when the State of the <hi>Saxons</hi> was sore shaken by the <hi>Danes,</hi> this <hi>Cumberland</hi> was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

the Castle, planting a Colony of <hi>Flemings</hi> to secure the Coasts from the <hi>Scots,</hi> but upon better advise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

or Thieving, or Licentious living.</p>
                     <p>(6) The Inhabitants of this Island are for the most part religious, and loving to their Pastors, to
whom they do much reverence and respect, frequenting daily to Divine Service, without division in the

upon a clear and fair day, a man may easily see three Kingdoms at once; that is, <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
This Isle prohibits the customary manner of begging from dore to dore, detesting the disorders,
as well <hi>Civil</hi> as Ecclesiastical of Neighbour Nations. And the last, not least, that deserves to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to memory, is, that the women of this Country, wheresoever they go out of their dores, gird
themselves about with the Winding-sheet that they purpose to be buried in, to shew themselves mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of their mortality: and such of them as are at any time condemned to die, are sowed within a Sack,
and flung from a Rock into the Sea.</p>
                     <p>(8) The whole Isle is divided into two parts, South and North, whereof the one resembleth the

The King yielding to their request, sent one <hi>Dopnald</hi> the son of <hi>Tade,</hi> and charged him to govern the
Kingdom (which by right belonged to another) with lenity and gentleness. But after he was come
to the Crown, forgetting or not weighing the charge that his Lord and Master had given him, swayed
his place with great Tyranny, committing many outrages and cruelties, and so raigned three years: till
all the Princes of the Islands agreeing together, rose up against him, and made him flie into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

years a peaceable Prince. He took to wife <hi>Affrica,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Fergus</hi> of <hi>Galway,</hi> of whom
he begat <hi>Godred.</hi> By his Concubines he had <hi>Raignald, Lagman,</hi> and <hi>Harald,</hi> besides many daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whereof one was married to <hi>Summerled,</hi> Prince of <hi>Herergaidel,</hi> who caused the ruine of the Kings
of the Islands. On her he begat four sons, <hi>Dulgal, Raignald, Engus</hi> and <hi>Olave.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(7) An. Dom. 1144. <hi>Godred</hi> the son of <hi>Olave,</hi> was created King of <hi>Man,</hi> and raigned thirty
years. In the third year of his Raign the People of <hi>Dublin</hi> sent for him, and made him their King.
Which <hi>Murecard</hi> King of <hi>Ireland</hi> maligning, raised War, and sent <hi>Osibeley</hi> his half brother by the

the rest all put to flight, These Atchievements made, <hi>Godred</hi> returned to <hi>Man,</hi> and began to use
Tyranny, turning the Noblemen out of their Inheritances. Whereupon one called <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

son) being mightier than the rest, came to <hi>Summerled,</hi> and made <hi>Dulgal (Summerleds</hi> son) King
of the Islands: whereof <hi>Godred</hi> having intelligence, prepared a Navy of 80 Ships to meet <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merled.</hi>
And in the year 1156 there was a Battle fought at Sea on Twelfth day at night, and
many slain on both sides. But the next day they grew to a pacification, and divided the Kingdom
<pb facs="tcp:37437:131"/>
of the Islands among themselves. This was the cause of the overthrow of the Kingdom of
the Isles.</p>
                        <p>(8) An. 1158. <hi>Summerled</hi> came to <hi>Man,</hi> with a Fleet of fifty three Sail, put <hi>Godred</hi> to flight, and
wasted the Island. <hi>Godred</hi> upon this crossed over to <hi>Norway</hi> for aid against <hi>Summerled.</hi> But <hi>Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
in the mean time arriving at <hi>Rhinfrin,</hi> and having gathered together a Fleet of 160 Ships, coveting
to subdue all <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the just Iudgment of God, was vanquished by a few, and both himself and
his son slain, with an infinite number of people.</p>
                        <p>(9) The fourth day after, <hi>Raignald</hi> began to raign, but <hi>Godred</hi> coming upon him out of <hi>Norway</hi>
with a great number of Armed Men, took his Brother <hi>Raignald,</hi> and bereft him both of his Eyes and
Genital Members. On the fourth Ides of <hi>November,</hi> An. Dom. 1187. <hi>Godred</hi> King of the Islands
died, and his body was translated to the <hi>Isle of Ely.</hi> He left behind him three sons, <hi>Raignald, Olave,</hi>
and <hi>Tvar.</hi> He ordained in his life time that <hi>Olave</hi> should succeed him, because he only was born legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate.
But the people of <hi>Man</hi> seeing him to be scarce ten years old, sent for <hi>Raignald,</hi> and made
him their King. This caused great division, and many turbulent attempts between the two Brethren
for the space of thirty eight years; which had no end, till at a place called <hi>Tingualla</hi> there was a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
struck between them, wherein <hi>Olave</hi> had the Victory, and <hi>Raignald</hi> was slain. The Monks of
<hi>Russin</hi> translated his Body unto the Abbey of S. <hi>Mary de Fournes,</hi> and there interred it in a place which
himself had chosen for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>(10) An. 1230. <hi>Olave</hi> and <hi>Godred Don</hi> (who was <hi>Raignalds</hi> son) with the <hi>Norwegiaus</hi> came to
<hi>Man,</hi> and divided the Kingdom among themselves. <hi>Olave</hi> held <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>Godred</hi> being gone unto
the Islands, was slain in the Isle <hi>Lodaus.</hi> So <hi>Olave</hi> obtained the Kingdom of the Isles. He died the
twelfth Calends of <hi>Iune,</hi> Anno 1237. in Saint <hi>Patricks</hi>-Islands, and was buried in the Abbey of
<hi>Russin.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb facs="tcp:37437:132"/>(11) <hi>Harold</hi> his Son succeeded him, being fourteen years of Age, and raigned 12 years.
In the year 1239 he went unto the King of <hi>Norway,</hi> who after two years confirmed unto
him, his Heirs and Successors, under his Seal, all the Islands which his Predecessors had
possessed.</p>
                        <p>(12) An. 1242. <hi>Harald</hi> returned out of <hi>Norway,</hi> and being by the Inhabitants honourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
had peace with the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The same year he was sent for by the
King of <hi>Norway,</hi> and married his Daughter. In the year 1249 as he returned homeward with his
Wife, he was drowned in a Tempest neer unto the Coasts of <hi>Radland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(13) An. Dom. 1249. <hi>Raignald</hi> the Son of <hi>Olave,</hi> and brother to <hi>Harold,</hi> began his raign and on
the thirtieth day thereof was slain by one <hi>Tvar</hi> a Knight, in a Meadow neer unto the holy <hi>Trinity-Church,</hi>
and lieth buried in the Church of S. <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Russin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(14) In the year 1252. <hi>Magnus</hi> the son of <hi>Olave,</hi> came to <hi>Man,</hi> and was made King. The next
year following he went to the King of <hi>Norway,</hi> and stayed there a year.</p>
                        <p>(15) In the year 1265. <hi>Magnus (Olaves</hi> son) King of <hi>Man,</hi> and of the Islands, departed this life,
at the Castle of <hi>Russin,</hi> and was buried in the Church of S. <hi>Mary of Russin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(16) In the year 1266 the Kingdom of the Islands was translated, by reason of <hi>Alexander</hi> King of
<hi>Scots,</hi> who had gotten into his hands the Western Islands, and brought the <hi>Isle of Man</hi> under his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,

                     <p>THis Island is called <hi>Lindisfarne,</hi> by the River <hi>Lied</hi> that is opposite unto it on the Coast of
<hi>Northumberland. Beda</hi> termed it a <hi>Dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>-Island.</hi> The <hi>Britains</hi> name it <hi>Iuis Medicante,</hi>
for that it twice every day suffereth an exordinary inundation and over-flowing of the
Ocean in manner of an Island, which twice likewise makes it continent to the Land,
and returning unto her watry habitation, lays the Shore bare again, as before. It is
called in English, <hi>Holy-Island,</hi> for that in ancient times many <hi>Monks</hi> have been accustomed to retired
themselves thither, and to make it their receptacle for solitude: having on the West and South, <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi>
and more South Eastward the Island <hi>Farne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(2) The form of it is long and narrow, the West-side narrower than the East, and are both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
by a very small spang of Land that is left unto Conies. The South is much broader than the
rest. It is from East to West, about two thousand two hundred and fifty paces: and from North to
South, twelve hundred and fifty paces; so that the circumference cannot be great.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Air is not very good either for health or delight, as being seated on those parts that are
subject to extremity of cold, and greatly troubled with vapou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

Seas.</p>
                     <p>(4) The Soil cannot be rich, being rocky and full of Stones, and unfit for Corn and Tillage.
It is neither commended for Hills to feed Sheep, nor Pastures to fat Cattel; neither hath it Vallies
replenished with sweet Springs, or running Rivolets, only one excepted, descending from a standing
Pond. The only thing this Island yieldeth, is a fit and accommodate aptitude for Fishing and Fowling.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:37437:134"/>(5) Notwithstanding, this is very worthy of note concerning the same, which <hi>Alcun</hi> wrote in an
Epistle to <hi>Egelred</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> namely, that it was a place more venerable than all the
places of <hi>Britain,</hi> and that after the departure of S. <hi>Paulinus</hi> from <hi>York,</hi> there Christian Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in their Nation, though afterwards it there felt the first beginning of misery and calamity, being
left to the spoil of Pagans and Miscreants.</p>
                     <p>(6) It is also remembred of this Island, that sometime there hath been in it an Episcopal See, which
<hi>Aidan</hi> the <hi>Scot</hi> instituted (being called thither to Preach the Christian Faith to the People of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi>)
being thus delighted with the solitary situation thereof, as a most fit place for retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But afterwards when the <hi>Danes</hi> rifled all the Sea-Coasts, the Episcopal See was translated to
<hi>Durham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(7) This Island so small in account either for compass or commodity, and so unpeopled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
cannot be numerous in Towns and Villages. It hath in it only one Town, with a Church
and a Castle, under which there is a commodious Haven, defended with a Block-house, situate upon
an Hill towards the South-East.</p>

that in this Isle he built a City fitting his Government, and erected certain Houses in the same; the
whole building standing almost round in compass, and reaching the space of four or five Pearches. The
Wall about it, he made higher than a Mans height, to with-hold and keep in the wanton lasciviousness
both of his thoughts and eyes, and to elevate the whole intention of his mind up to heavenly desires,
that he might wholly give himself to the service of God. But these are all made the ruins of time, as
sithence many other Monuments have been of worthy Antiquity.</p>
                        <p>(6) I cannot report that there are now many Houses standing in it, much less Towns or Villages:

Southward not far from a craggy ridge of Rocks, which is much feared of the Mariners, and makes the

and thought to be the <hi>Magnos</hi> in <hi>Antonine</hi> the Emperours Survey. This Town is pleasantly seated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

drawn along the West of the Town, whereon a Wall of Stone was once raised, as by the remains in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places appeareth. This Trench doth likewise inverge her West-side so far as the River, but after is

that as <hi>Giraldus</hi> hath written, <hi>They make the Air much colder, and defend the Country from the excessive

the site of that Town, the Aldermen or chief Seniors thereof regarding my pains with friendly
and courteous entertainments, at my departure, no less than eight of them, that had been Bailiffs of
the Town, came to visite me; where they reported upon their Credit and Trials, that from the top of
that Hill, in the <hi>Welsh</hi> called <hi>Mounch-denny,</hi> or <hi>Cadier Arthur,</hi> they had oftentimes cast from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and down the North-East Rock, their Cloaks, Hats, and Staves, which notwithstanding would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

any thing descend from that Cliffe being so cast, unless it be stone or some Metalline substance: affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the cause to be the Clouds, which are seen to rack much lower than the top of that Hill. As

Oval-wise are both strong and of good repair, having three Gates for Entrance, with ten Towers for
defence, and is in circuit six hundred and forty paces about, upon whose West part a most sumptuous and
stately Castle is seated, the like whereof is not commonly seen, whose decayes approaching do increase
her ruins daily, and in the end is feared will be her fall. This Town is seated upon the meeting of
two Rivers, <hi>Houthy</hi> and <hi>Vske,</hi> whose yearly Government is committed to two Bailiffs, fifteen Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
two Chamberlains, two Constables, a Town-Clerk, and two Sergeants their Attendants, having

                     <p>CARDIGAN-SHIRE, (in the <hi>Welsh</hi> called <hi>Sire Aber-Tivi</hi>) is parted on the North from
<hi>Merioneth-shire</hi> with the River <hi>Dovi;</hi> by the <hi>Plinillimon</hi> Hills from <hi>Montgomery-shire</hi> in
part of her East; and the rest from <hi>Brecknock shire,</hi> with the water <hi>Towy;</hi> and with <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi>
altogether on the South from <hi>Caermarden-shire:</hi> The West is wholly washed with the
<hi>Irish-Sea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(2) The Form thereof is Horn-like, bowing compass, long and narrow, and growing wider stll to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North: so that from <hi>Cardigan,</hi> the Shire-Town and uttermost point in the South, unto the
River <hi>Dovi,</hi> her farthest North-bounder, are thirty two miles: and from the head of <hi>Clarwan</hi> in the
East, to <hi>Abersthwyth</hi> on her West, the broadest part in the Shire, are only fifteen: the whole in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is one hundred and three miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Air is open and somewhat piercing; The Soil is hilly, and (<hi>Wales</hi> like) uneven: yet
more plain and champion towards the Sea, than in the East or North of the Land. For besides
that great and high Hill called <hi>Plinillimon,</hi> a continual range of lesser doth shoot along, yielding in
their Vallies both goodly rich Pastures, and very large Pools, which being assisted with Springs
from the Rocks, do branch themselves as Veins in the Body, and make fruitful their passages un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea. In <hi>Tyuy</hi> one of these, as <hi>Giraldus</hi> hath written, the <hi>Beaver</hi> hath been found, a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
living both by Land and Water, whose Stones the Physicians hold in great price. His fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But this creature in these parts a long time hath not been seen, whose room we may well say the
<hi>Salmon</hi> hath possessed, who still coveting fresh-water-Rivers, at their down-right falls useth this
policy: He bendeth himself backward, and taketh his Tail in his Mouth, and with all his strength
unloosing his circle on the sudden (as a Lath let go) mounteth up before the fall of the Stream;
whereupon such water-falls are called the <hi>Salmons-leap:</hi> and in these Rivers many such <hi>Salmons</hi> are
caught.</p>
                     <p>(4) The Commodities of this Shire chiefly <hi>consist</hi> in Cattel, Sea-Fowl, and Fish; Corn sufficient,

                     <p>CAERMARDEN-SHIRE, so called from the chief Town <hi>Caermarden,</hi> lyeth bordered upon
the South, with <hi>Cardigan-shire;</hi> upon her East, by <hi>Brecknock</hi> and <hi>Glamorgan-shires;</hi> upon
the South, with a Bay of the <hi>British-Seas;</hi> and upon the West with <hi>Pembroke-shire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(2) The form of this County is long, and shooteth it self from the South-West into
the North and by East, betwixt whose further bounds are thirty five <hi>English</hi> miles, and in
her broadest part twenty miles; the whole in circumference about one hundred and two miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) This Shire is not altogether so pestred with Hills as her bordering Neighbors are: and those
that she hath, neither so high nor so thick, and therefore is better for Corn and Pasturage, yea and in
Woods also, so that for Victuals this County is very well stored, which the Stomach doth as well digest,
the Air being wholsome, temperate, and pleasing.</p>
                     <p>(4) Anciently these parts were possessed by the <hi>Dimetree,</hi> as <hi>Ptolomy, Gildas,</hi> and <hi>Ninius</hi> do name
them: though <hi>Pliny</hi> holds opinion that they were part of the <hi>Silures,</hi> with whom no doubt they
were subdued to the <hi>Romans</hi> yoke by <hi>Iulius Frontinus,</hi> when he struggled with the Rocky Hills in those
Southern parts. And this County is accounted by Writers to be the very strength of <hi>South-Wales.</hi>

about the Town, being in circuit one thousand and four hundred paces. The Inhabitants of
this place do not a little glory of their <hi>Merlin,</hi> who (as they say) was therein born the Son of a

the North butteth upon the County of <hi>Brecknock;</hi> and the East by <hi>Remney</hi> is

                     </p>
                     <p>(2) The form of this Shire groweth still wider from her West-point, spreading her broadest touch
in the East, betwixt which extreams I find by measure to be well-near forty <hi>English</hi> miles, and from

twelve miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Air is temperate, and gives more content to the mind, than the Soil doth fruit or ease unto
Travellers. The Hills being high and very many, which from the North notwithstanding are lessened

those mountains breed innumerable of Cattel, especially of Horses, whose Portraiture for making

and loyal to the <hi>English</hi> Crown.</p>

and upon another far higher mounted, stands a fair and well-repaired Castle, from the East-Rock
whereof, the Town hath been walled, as by some part yet standing, and the Tract and Trench of
the rest even unto the North-side of the said Castle, may evidently be seen: whose graduation for

Latitude is placed in the degree 53, and for Longitude 17, the lines cutting each other in the site of
this Town.</p>

                     <p>DENBIGH-SHIRE, called in <hi>Welsh, Sire Denbigh,</hi> retiring more from the Sea within the
Country, on this side of the River <hi>Conwey</hi> shooteth Eastward in one place as far as to
the River <hi>Dee:</hi> on the North, first the Sea, (for a small space) and then <hi>Flint-shire</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compasseth
it: on the West, <hi>Caernarvan</hi> and <hi>Merioneth shire:</hi> on the East, <hi>Cheshire</hi>
and <hi>Shropshire;</hi> and on the South, <hi>Mountgomery shire.</hi>

                     <p>(2) The form thereof is long, growing wider still towards the North-West, and narrower towards
the East. It is in length from East to West, one and thirty miles; and in breadth from North to South,
seventeen miles: in the whole circuit and circumference, one hundred and fourteen miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Air is very wholsome and pleasant, yet bleak-enough, as exposed to the winds on all sides,
and the high Hills, wherewith it is in many places environed, long retaining the congealed Snow. The
tops whereof, in the Summer time, are the Harvest-Mens Almanacks, by the rising of certain Vapours
thereon in the Mornings, and foreshew a fair Day ensuing.</p>
                     <p>(4) The Soil is but barren towards the West-part: yet the middle, where it lieth flat in a Valley,
is most fertile. The East-side, when it is once past the Valley, findeth Nature to be a very sparing nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of her favours: but next unto <hi>Dee</hi> it feeleth a more liberal extent of her blessings. The West
part is but here and there inhabited, and mounteth up more than the other with bare and hungry
Hills; yet the leanness of the Soil (where the Hills settle any thing flatting) hath been now a

<pb facs="tcp:37437:158"/>
for they parting away the upper Coat of the Earth into certain Turffs, with a broad kind of Spade, pile
them up artificially on heaps, and fire them, so as being turned into Ashes, and thrown upon the ground
so pared, they fructifie the hungry barrenness and sterility of Soil, and make the Fields bring forth a
kind of <hi>Rie</hi> or <hi>Amell-Corn,</hi> in such plenty, as is hardly to be believed.</p>

Country.</p>
                     <p>(6) The Mountains of this County yield sufficiency of Neat, Sheep, and Goats. The Valleys in
most places are very plenteous of Corn, especially Eastward on this side, betwixt the Rivers of <hi>Alen</hi> and
<hi>Dee;</hi> But the most Westerly part is Heathy, and altogether barren. The heart of the Shire shews it self
beneath the Hills, in a beautiful and pleasant Vale, reaching seventeen miles in length from South to
North, and five miles, or thereabouts, in breadth, and lieth open only toward the Sea. It is environed
on every side with high Hills, amongst which, the highest is <hi>Moillenly,</hi> on the top whereof is a warlike
Fence with Trench and Rampier, and a little Fountain of clear Water. From these Hills the River
<hi>Cluyd</hi> resorts unto this Vale, and from the very Spring-head (increased with Becks and Brooks) doth
part it in twain, running through the midst of it; whereof in ancient time it was named <hi>Strat-Cluyd:</hi>

                        <pb facs="tcp:37437:159"/>This thing is worthy observation, as a matter memorable, both for admiration and antiquity, that in
the Parish of <hi>Lan-sanan</hi> within this Country, there is a place compass cut out of the main Rock by
Mans hand, in the side of a Stony Hill, wherein there be four and twenty Seats to sit in, some less, some
bigger, where children and young men, coming to seek their Cattel, use to sit, and to have their sports.
And at this day they commonly call it <hi>Arthurs Round Table.</hi>

Conviction and Beheading of <hi>David</hi> Brother of <hi>Llewelin</hi> for High-Treason, was the first that fortified
it with a Wall about, nor large in circuit, but very strong, and on the South-side with a fair Castle,
strengthned with many high Towers. But he gave it over, and left the work unfinished, conceiving

where they be bigger. Great store of Fish they take in the River of <hi>Dee,</hi> but little from the Sea, by

part of <hi>Wales</hi> are found, it having been a general plague unto all the Country ever since the head-strong
Rebellions of their Princes and great Men against the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> that (in time) took
away the principal helps of their Innovations, by cutting down their Woods, whereof in this Shire
there hath heretofore been great plenty. Fruits are scarce, but Milk, Butter and Cheese plenty, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

Muskadine, which they call <hi>Metheglin.</hi> Yea, and in the days of <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis,</hi> near the place

strength of their Castles and Fortifications, as in their Mountains and Hills, which in times of danger
served as natural Bulwarks and Defences unto them against the force of Enemies. As was that which
standeth in a certain strait set about with Woods, near unto the River <hi>Alen,</hi> called <hi>Coles-hull,</hi> that is,
<hi>Coles-hill,</hi> where the <hi>English,</hi> by reason of their disordered multitude, not ranged in good array, lost
the Field, and were defeated, when King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second had made as great preparation as might
be to give Battel unto the <hi>Welsh,</hi> and the very Kings Standard was forsaken by <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Essex,</hi> who was
Standard-Bearer to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> in right of inheritance.</p>
                     <p>(8) This Country hath many shallow Rivers in it, but none of fame and note, but <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>Cluyde.</hi>
Howbeit, there is a Spring not far from <hi>Rudland Castle,</hi> of great report and antiquity, which is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Fons Sacer,</hi> in English, <hi>Holy-Well,</hi> and is also commonly called S. <hi>Winefrids-Well;</hi> of whom an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
thus reporteth: That <hi>Winefrid</hi> a Christian Virgin, very fair and vertuous, was doated upon
by a young lustful Prince or Lord of the Country, who not long able to rule his head-strong affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
having many times in vain attempted and tried her chastity, both by rich gifts and large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
could not by any means obtain his desires; he therefore (in a place of advantage) suddenly
surprised and ravished her weak (yet resisting) body. After the deed done, the cruel Tyrant, to
stop her cries and acclamations, slew her, and cut off her head; out of which place did suddenly
arise a Spring that continueth to this day, carrying from the Fountain such a forcible stream and
Current, as the like is not found in Christendom. Over the Head of the Spring there is built a
Chappel of Free-stone, with Pillars curiously wrought and engraved, in the Chancel whereof, and
<pb facs="tcp:37437:161"/>
Glass-Window, the Picture of the Virgin is drawn, together with the memorial of her Life and Death,
To this Fountain Pilgrims are accustomed to repair in their zealous, but blind devotion; and divers
others resort to Bath in, holding firmly that the water is of much vertue.</p>
                     <p>There be many red Stones in the bottom of this Well, and much green Moss growing upon the
sides: the superstition of the People holding that those red spots in the Stones were drops of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Blood, which all the Water in the Spring can never wash away; and that the Moss about the
Wall was her Hair, which though some of it be given to every Stranger that comes, yet it never wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth.
But howsoever this be carried for truth by the Tradition of time, the Moss it self smells exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sweet.</p>
                     <p>There is also hard by <hi>Kilken</hi> (a small Village) within this County, a little Well of no great note,
that at certain times riseth and falleth, after the manner of Sea-tydes.</p>
                     <p>(9) In the South-part of this Country, divided from the rest, is a place ( in some written Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of <hi>Antonine,</hi> called <hi>

great number of Monks, and them divided into seven Companies, every one having his several Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
assigned. None of these Companies had less than three hundred Persons devoted to Prayer, and
to get living by their own labour, for themselves and the poor: although it hath long since been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly

and betwixt which the River <hi>Dee</hi> now runneth, where are often-times found many pieces of <hi>Roman</hi>
Coyn, and other tokens of antiquity. But of these shall be more mention made in the following
History.</p>
                     <p>Another like Monastery, but of lesser account, stood in the Vale beneath <hi>Varish</hi> (a little City placed
<pb facs="tcp:37437:162"/>
by the <hi>Romans</hi> in the consines of this Shire and <hi>Denbigh-shire</hi>) and upon the Bank of <hi>Elwy</hi> and <hi>Cluyd.</hi>
This the <hi>Britains</hi> call <hi>Llan-Elwy,</hi> of the River; the <hi>Englishmen, Asaph,</hi> of the Founder; and the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers,
Asaphensis.</hi> It is more famoused for antiquity, than for building or bravery: for about the
year 560 <hi>Kentigern</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glasco,</hi> being fled hither out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> placed here a Bishops See, and
erected a Monastery, gathering together 663. in a Religious Brotherhood, whereof 300 that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
gave themselves to husbandry, and to work within the Monastery; the rest to Prayer and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations.
When he returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> he ordained <hi>Asaph,</hi> a godly and upright man, to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
over this Monastery, of whom it took the name, and is called <hi>Saint Asaphs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another Monastery of great account was at <hi>Basingwarke</hi> in this County, near unto which began
that admirable Ditch drawn thence into the Month of <hi>Severne</hi> by King <hi>Offa,</hi> the Tract whereof I have
expressed thorow this Shire, and will further speak thereof in the following History.</p>
                     <p>(10) This Shire is divided into five Hundreds, fortified with seven Castles, hath only one Market-Town,
and twenty eight Parishes, in which there is a continual celebration of Divine Service.</p>

                     <p>ANGLESEY was in the time of the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Mona,</hi> by the <hi>Britains Mon,</hi> and <hi>Ver-Mon,</hi>
(that is) the Land of <hi>Mon,</hi> of the ancient <hi>England-Saxons Moneg:</hi> And at last,
after the <hi>Englishmen</hi> had by their sharp and several assaults brought it under their rule,
and became Lords thereof, it was termed <hi>Anglesey,</hi> as one would say, <hi>The Englishmens
Island.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(2) For an <hi>Island</hi> it is, albeit it be severed from the Continent of <hi>Britain,</hi> but with a small and
narrow straight of the River <hi>Menai,</hi> and on all other parts beaten upon with the surging and troublous
<hi>Irish Sea,</hi> in which it lyeth somewhat square-wise not much different in length and breadth; being,
where it reacheth out in length, from <hi>Beau-marish</hi> Eastward, to the utmost Promontory Westward,
which we call <hi>Holy-head,</hi> twenty miles; and in breadth from <hi>Llambederick</hi> Northward, to the point
of <hi>Menai</hi> Southward, seventeen miles; the whole circuit or circumference amounting towards seventy
miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) The Air is reasonable grateful and healthful, and not generally subject to Diseases, excepting
certain Agues at sometimes, which are occasioned by the Fogs and misty Exhalations, which arise from
the Sea called <hi>Mare Virginium,</hi> with the which this Isle is encompassed.</p>
                     <p>(4) The Commodities that commend (or rather beautifie) this Country, are in Corn and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
wherewith it not only enricheth it self exceedingly, but sendeth out great Provision thereof to
others to supply their defects, and although the ground may seem dry and stony, or unpleasant and

are not so fruitful, yet for the inward bounties of nature, it is far unlike; for above all the

this alone, like a provident and full breasted Mother is able to sustain the rest. Whereunto Nature

<hi>Millstones</hi> or <hi>Grindstones.</hi> In some places also it yieldeth an Earth of <hi>Aluminous</hi> quality, out of which

                     <p>(6) This Nation was attempted first by <hi>Paulinus Suetonius</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> but brought under

                     <p>SCOTLAND, the second Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and the North part of the Island, hath on
the East the <hi>German-Ocean;</hi> on the North, the <hi>Orkneys,</hi> and <hi>Deucalidon-Sea;</hi> the West

                     <p>(2) This Kingdom is fair and spacious, and from these South borders spreadeth it self wide
into the East and West, till again it contracts it self, narrower unto the Northern Promontories: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with all things befitting a famous Kingdom; both for Air and Soil, Rivers, Woods, Mountains,
Fish, Fowl, and Cattel, and Corn so plenteous, that it supplyeth therewith other Countries in their
want. The People thereof are of good feature, strong of body, and of couragious mind, and in Wars
so venturous, that scarce any service of note hath been performed, but that they were with the first and
last in the Field. Their Nobility and Gentry are very studious of learning, and all civil knowledge;
for which end they not only frequent the three Universities of their own Kingdom (S. <hi>Andrews, Glasco,</hi>

who with the <hi>Getes</hi> infesting <hi>Ireland,</hi> left both their issue there, and their manners, apparent in the

there was no other bounds of <hi>Britain</hi> to be sought for: and that here the second Legion <hi>Augusta,</hi>
and the 20 Legion <hi>Victrix,</hi> built a part of the Wall, certain Inscriptions there digged up, and reserved
at <hi>Dunloyr</hi> and <hi>Cader</hi> do witness: as also an ancient coped Monument of an high and round compass,
which as some think, was a Temple consecrated unto the God <hi>Terminus;</hi> others, a Trophy raised by
<hi>Carausius,</hi> who fortified this Wall with seven Castles, as <hi>Ninius</hi> doth declare.</p>
                     <p>(12) At this place began the great and dark Wood <hi>Caledonia,</hi> famous for the wild white Bulls

that therein were bred, whose Manes were Lion-like, thick and curled, of nature fierce and cruel, and
so hateful to mankind, that they abhoried whatsoever was by them handled or breathed upon: these
Woods stretched far and wide with many turning, dark shades, and dreadful dens, and so famous
in the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers, that they often used that name for all <hi>Britain;</hi> whose Inhabitants were the
last in this Island, that yielded their Necks to the Yoke of Subjection, as shall appear in our following
Story.</p>
                     <p>(13) <hi>Ninian</hi> a <hi>Britain</hi> is recorded to have converted the <hi>South-Picts</hi> unto the Faith of Christ in

so likewise in the same age <hi>Palladius</hi> sent from Pope <hi>Celestine,</hi> became an Apostle unto the <hi>Scots,</hi> whose
Reliques lay enshrined at <hi>Fordon</hi> in <hi>Mernis,</hi> as was verily supposed: but that Christianity had been
formerly planted in this uttermost Province, is testified by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in saying the <hi>Britains</hi> had
embraced the Faith further than the <hi>Romans</hi> had power to follow or persecute them, whereupon
<hi>Peter</hi> Monk of <hi>Clun</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> concludeth their conversion to be more ancient than the Southern
<hi>Britains.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(14) But touching things observable for the present, surely admirable is the report of the plenty of
Cattel, Fish, and Fowl there abiding: their Neat but little, yet many in number: Fish so plentiful,
that men in some places (for delight) on Horse-back hunt <hi>Salmons</hi> with Spears: and a certain Fowl,
which some call <hi>Soland-Geese,</hi> spreading so thick in the Air, that they even darken the Suns light; of
whose Flesh, Feathers, and Oyl, the Inhabitants in some parts make great use and gain; yea, and
even of Fishes brought by them, abundant Provision for Diet, as also of the Sticks (brought to make
their Nests) plentiful provision for Fuel.</p>
                     <p>(15) With these, as of Wonders, I might speak of the natures of those two famous Longhs,

                     <p>(16) No less strange than any the fore-mentioned waters, but more lamentable is the remembrance
of the great inundation, hapning, by the sudden rising of <hi>Tay,</hi> which bare away the Walls and Town
of <hi>Berth,</hi> and with it the Cradle and young Son of King <hi>William</hi> into the Sea, wherein the Royal Infant
with many others perished, the King and his Courtiers hardly escaping the danger with life. The ruine

                     <p>(18) The <hi>Western</hi> lying scattered in the <hi>Deucalidonian</hi> Sea, were anciently ruled by a King of their
own, whose maintenance was out of their common Coffers, and the Regal Authority never continued in
lineal succession, for (to prevent that) their Kings were not permitted to have Wives of their own, but
might by their Laws accompany with other mens: as the like Law was in the other parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
that the Virginity of all new Wives, should be the Landlords prey, till King <hi>Malcolme</hi> enacted, that half a
mark should be paid for redemption. The residence of those fore-mentioned Kings, was chiefly in <hi>Ila,
Bunals,</hi> and <hi>Iona,</hi> now <hi>Columbkill,</hi> where (as <hi>Donald Munro,</hi> who travelled through these Islands, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth)

of them plentiful of Corn, Woods, Salmons and Herrings, as others of Conies, Deer, Horses, and
Sheep, where in some they are wild, and in others without any owners; but the People uncivil, and
lacking Religion, they rather live rudely in state of necessity, than as Lords of these portions which
God hath allotted them; and with a sufferable ease, ignorant of ambition, enjoy those contentments,
which some others (though they no great sum) do more laboriously attain unto by the Precepts of
Philosophy: for feeding themselves with competency without any excess, they return all the over-plus
unto their Lords, as do the Inhabitants of <hi>Hirta</hi> and <hi>Rona:</hi> but alas, Religion not known among
them, these penurious vertues are rather the curses of <hi>Cham,</hi> than the followings of Christ, who forbids
us <hi>to be too careful for the morrow.</hi>

                     <p>(21) Of all the <hi>Romans, Iulius Agricola</hi> first discovered the <hi>Orkenays;</hi> yea, and subdued them,
if we will believe <hi>Tacitus:</hi> but <hi>Pomponius Mela,</hi> that wrote thirty years before him, doth mention

the Souls of good Men are ferryed into those <hi>Elizian</hi> Fields that ever grow green, and whence
<hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> could hardly be drawn, as <hi>Muretus</hi> had written: but their Fictions intended only that
the vertuous Souls of the dead passed the uttermost bounds of earthly abode, and attained to an ever-pleasing
repose, and ever-flourishing happiness; which whether they borrowed from the description of
Paradise, (taken both for a fair Garden and the Souls happy rest) I cannot define; but sure they would
not have made those Fields always green, if they had seen how they lie ever covered with Ice and Snow,
being in the 63 degree of Latitude, as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> hath placed it, where (for the most part) is a continual
Winter: but for proof that this was the <hi>Thule,</hi> besides <hi>Ptolomies</hi> Positure, <hi>Saxo Grammaticus</hi> betwixt

that is, The holy Island: to which opinion the people are soon drawn, by reason of the many
Saints that the Island is said to produce, and the blessed Soil that affords no venomous Creatures to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Life. It is thought that <hi>Plutarch</hi> meant <hi>Ireland</hi> by his <hi>Ogygia,</hi> for her great antiquity; and of
latter times by <hi>Isidore</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> it was called <hi>Scotia,</hi> of those <hi>Scots</hi> that inhabited it: and that thence
the name of <hi>Scotland,</hi> together with the <hi>Scots</hi> themselves, came into <hi>Britain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(4) For largeness and circuit, in times past, this Island challenged the third place in rank of all the
Isles of the then known World for thus have Geographers left us, that the <hi>Indian Taproban</hi> for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

                     <p>(6) The Soil (saith <hi>Cambrensis</hi>) is uneven, woody, wild, waterish, and boggy, so full of Loughs
and Mears, that great Ponds of Water are found upon the high Mountains. These indeed make the
places somewhat dangerous unto all new Commers, by breeding of Rheums, Dysenteries and Fluxes,
whose usual remedy is <hi>Vskebah,</hi> a wholsome <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> that drieth more, and enflameth less, than
many other hot Confections.</p>
                     <p>(7) The Commodities of this Kingdom chiefly consist in Cattel, whose seed is so sweet and so rank,
that they will soon graze to a surfeit, if they may be suffered to feed as they will. Their Sheep are
many, but bear not the best Wooll, which twice are shorn within one year. Of these they make Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
Caddowes, and Coverlets, vented from thence into forrain Countries. Their Hobbies likewise
are of great esteem, and are answerable to the Ienners of <hi>Spain.</hi> Bees are there in such abundance,
that honey is found in holes of Trees, and in rests of the Rocks. No annoyance of hurtful Snake or
venomous Creatures: and to speak all in a word, nothing wanting for profit or pleasure: for so much

<pb facs="tcp:37437:177"/>
                        <hi>Noah,</hi> to have found it out before the Flood; and that three hundred years after, when <hi>Iaphets</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
took into these Wests-parts of the World, one <hi>Bartholarus</hi> of his Progeny, a <hi>Scythian</hi> by birth,
encouraged by the late success of <hi>Nimrod</hi> (who now had intruded upon the Monarchy of <hi>Syria</hi>)
wandred so far West, that <hi>Fortune</hi> at last cast him and his people upon the coast of <hi>Ireland.</hi> There he
setled with his three sons, <hi>Languinna, Salanus,</hi> and <hi>Ruthurgus,</hi> who searching through every creek and
corner of the Land, left their own names by three notable places, <hi>Languini, Stragrus,</hi> and Mount <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langa,</hi>
which the revolution of times hath since called by other names, as S. <hi>Dominickhill, Ruthurgi,</hi>
and <hi>Stagnum.</hi> Under the government of these three sons, and their off-spring, this Land was kept
about three hundred years; at which time there arrived also in <hi>Ireland,</hi> a Giant-like kind of People of
<hi>Nimrods</hi> race, who in bodily shape exceeded the proportion of usual men, using their strengths to
win soveraignties, and to oppress with rapine and violence. These growing to numbers, accounted it
necessary to prevent dominion, lest the curse of slavery (prophecied by <hi>Noah</hi>) should light upon them:
to prevent the which, they set up a King of their own; then quarrels bred daily, either parties pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
to hold their interest by their Swords; against whom, lastly a Battel was fought, and an infinite
company of Giants slain; when also died most of those of the posterity of <hi>Iapheth,</hi> leaving them of
<hi>Cham</hi> Lords of the Island.</p>
                     <p>(9) Whereupon <hi>Nemethus</hi> a <hi>Scythian</hi> with his four Sons, arrived in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by strong hand
seated themselves among these Giants; where for two hundred and sixty years they kept, but then no
longer able to hold out against them, they left their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tandings, and departed the Land.</p>
                     <p>(10) Soon after, the five Sons of <hi>Dela,</hi> descended from the said <hi>Nemetheus,</hi> came into these coasts,
and with manly prowess drove these miscreants out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereby the Seed of <hi>Cham</hi> was utterly
expelled, and these of <hi>Iapheth</hi> divided the Land into five parts, whereof they became themselves Kings:
<pb facs="tcp:37437:178"/>
but falling at variance, gave advantage unto others, among whom the BRITAINS set in a foot.</p>
                     <p>(11) But to make this Island more famous, certain Historians have fetched their Kings from most
uncertain Records, as namely from <hi>Gaothel</hi> the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Scotia,</hi> (the daughter of King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
and nourisher of <hi>Moses</hi>) his Wife: who at that time, when <hi>Israel</hi> were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> with a Colony came
into <hi>Spain,</hi> and after into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he was made King, and in honour of his Queen, the Land
named <hi>Scotia,</hi> from whom also the Inhabitants took name: his posterity increasing in the parts of
<hi>Spain,</hi> where first they had seated, in process of time sought further adventures under the four Sons of
<hi>Milesius</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whose names were <hi>Hibernus, Hermion, Euer,</hi> and <hi>Erimon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(12) These, by the direction, sufferance and assistance of <hi>Gurguntius,</hi> King of the <hi>Britains,</hi> after
that <hi>Ireland</hi> had been very much dispeopled by a contagious pestilence, seated themselves, and from the
eldest, <hi>Hibernus,</hi> called the Island <hi>Hibernia,</hi> as some are of opinion: these divided the whole into five
Provinces, famously known by the names of <hi>Mounster, Leinster, Connaught, Vlster,</hi> and <hi>Meath</hi> in their
midst: and from these the present <hi>Irish</hi> repute themselves to come. Yet surely, as I make no question,
but that this Island became inhabited even of old time, when mankind again over-spread the face of
the earth, so doubt I not, but that our <hi>Britains</hi> passed thereinto themselves, such infinite number of words
in the <hi>Irish</hi> language yet in use, such ancient names of Waters, Isles, Mountains, and Places, meerly
<hi>British</hi> words, yet remaining, and the testimony of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who saith, that their manners were fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to the <hi>Britains,</hi> inforceth so much; and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> before him, calleth that Island by the name of
<hi>Little-Britain:</hi> all which shew a former interest for <hi>Ireland,</hi> than that which by conquest under <hi>Henry</hi>
the second was made.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:37437:178"/>(13) That it ever was subject to the <hi>Romans,</hi> is doubtful, though <hi>Agricola</hi> did wish it, and <hi>Tacitus</hi>
held most necessary: yea, and in the division of their Empire, <hi>Ireland,</hi> with <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Thule,</hi> fell
unto <hi>Constantine</hi> the Son of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great; yet their Manners unreclaimed, and barbarism
retained long after those days, do witness no such civility sown, to be in that plot. But when <hi>Romes</hi>
great Empire began to grow less, the <hi>Scots</hi> or <hi>Scythians</hi> grew mighty in <hi>Ireland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and as <hi>Orosius</hi> writeth,
that Island was wholly inhabited by the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation in the days of <hi>Honorius,</hi> and <hi>Arcadius,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours:
whose Wars and Slaughter, <hi>Claudian</hi> doth lightly touch in this his Verse.</p>

arms into the water, that so (as they thought) they might give a more deep and incurable blow; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
calling them by the names of their Parents whilst they lived together, but at their death took it
upon them. Their women nursed not the children they bare; and they that nursed others, did affect
and love them much more than their own.</p>
                     <p>(16) So much were they given to fantastical conceits, that they held it very ominous to give their
neighbours fire upon <hi>May-day:</hi> to eat an old Egg, endangered the death of their Horse: and before
they cast in their Seed, they send Salt into the Field: to hang up the Shells in the Roof, was a preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
of the Chickens from the Kite: to set up green Boughs at their Doors in the Moneth of <hi>May,</hi>
increased their Kines Milk; and to spit upon Cattel, they held it good against Witchery, whereof <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was full.</p>
                     <p>(17) Superstitious Idolatry among the wilde <hi>Irish</hi> was common, yielding divine honour unto the
Moon after the change, unto whom they both bowed their knees and made supplications; and with a
loud voice would thus speak unto that Planet: <hi>We pray thee leave us in as good estate as thou foundst
us.</hi> Wolves they did make their Godsibs, terming them <hi>Chari Christ,</hi> and so thought themselves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
from their hurts: the hoofs of dead Horses they accounted and held sacred: about childrens
necks they hung the beginning of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospel, a crooked nail of an horse-shoe, or a piece of
a Wolves Skin: and both the sucking-child and nurse were girt with Girdles finely plated of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
hair; so far they wandred into the ways of errour, in making these arms the strength of their
healths.</p>

years of age, whose customs were to send to their Lovers Bracelets pleated, and curiously wrought of

Linnen, rolled about their Heads, rather loading the Wearer than delighting the Beholder: for as the

their Arms wreathed with many Bracelets, and over their Side-garments the Shag-Rug Mantlets pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled

                     <p>(4) This Province is at this day divided into two parts: that is, the West-<hi>Mounster,</hi> and the South-<hi>Mounster.</hi>
The West-<hi>Mounster</hi> was inhabited in old time by the <hi>Luceni,</hi> the <hi>Velabri,</hi> and the <hi>Vte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini:</hi>
the South-<hi>Mounster</hi> by the <hi>Oudiae</hi> or <hi>Vodiae,</hi> and the <hi>Coriondi.</hi> The <hi>Velabri</hi> and <hi>Luceni</hi> are said

towards the <hi>Cantabrian</hi>-Ocean, looketh afar off to <hi>Gallitia</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Luceni</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> (who
seem to have derived their name and original from the <hi>Lucensii</hi> of <hi>Gallitia,</hi> and of whom there still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
some Reliques in the Barony of <hi>Lyxnouw</hi>) are supposed to have been seated in those parts that
lie neighbouring upon the bank of the River <hi>Shennon.</hi>

                        <pb facs="tcp:37437:182"/>(5) The general Commodities of this Province, are Corn, Cattel, Wood, Wooll, and Fish. The
last whereof, it affords in every place, and abundance of all sorts. But none so well known for the
store of Herrings that are taken there, as is the Promontory called <hi>Eraugh,</hi> that li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Ballatimore</hi> Bay, whereunto every year a great Fleet of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugals</hi> resort (even in

                     <p>(6) The principal City of the Province is <hi>Limericke,</hi> which the <hi>Irish</hi> call <hi>Loumeagh,</hi> compassed

built. In this Castle certain Hostages making their abode in the year 1332, grew (as is reported)
so full of pride and inconstancy, that they slew the Constable thereof, and seized the Castle into their
own hands. But the resolute Citizens, that could neither brook nor bear with such barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
did in revenge then shew such manly courage and vivacity, as they soon after recovered the
Castle again, repaying the Hostages in such hostile manner, as they put them all to the Sword
without partiality. The position of this Town is by <hi>Mercator</hi> placed for Latitude 53 degrees,
20 minutes; and for Longitude, 9 degrees 34 minutes. Near unto the River that <hi>Ptolomy</hi>

marriage into the Country, but make contracts of Matrimony one with another among themselves.
In this place, that holy and religious man <hi>Briock,</hi> is said to have his birth and breeding, who flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

convenience and commodiousness of the Haven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that affords such necessary aptitude for trade and
traffique, as also for the faithful loyalty which it hath always shewed to the Imperial Crown of
<hi>England:</hi> for ever since it was won by <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> it still performed the obedience and
peaceable offices of duty and service unto the <hi>English,</hi> as they continued the course in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of <hi>Ireland:</hi> whence it is that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have from time to time endowed it
with many large Franchises and Liberties, which King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh did both augment and
confirm.</p>
                     <p>(8) Although since the time of S. <hi>Patrick,</hi> Christianity was never extinct in this Country, yet
the government being haled into contrary factions, the Nobility lawless, and the multitude wilful,
it hath come to pass, that religion hath waxed (with the temporal common sort) more cold and
feeble, being most of them very irreligious, and addicted wholly to superstitious observations: for
in some parts of this Province, some are of opinion, that certain men are yearly turned into Wolves,
and made Wolf-men. Though this hath been constantly affirmed by such as think their censures
worthy to pass for currant and credible: yet let us suppose that haply they be possessed with the
disease and malady that the Physicians call Lycanthropy, which begetteth and endange<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

phantasies through the malicious humours of Melancholly: and so oftentimes men imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb facs="tcp:37437:183"/>
to be turned and transformed into forms which they are not. Some again embrace another
ridiculous opinion, and perswade themselves, that he who in the barbarous acclamation and out-cry

may also not be void of the inward grace of their souls and understanding.</p>
                     <p>(9) This Province hath been sore wasted in the rebellions of <hi>Desmond,</hi> to whose aid Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>

fatherly chastisements and afflictions upon them, sometimes by winds, sometimes by famine and
dearth, and sometimes again by opening his hand of plenty into their laps to convert them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and to divert their hearts from superstitions. In the year 1330, about the feast of Saint <hi>Iohn
Baptist,</hi> there began such a dearth of Corn in this Country, by the abundance of rain and the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of waters (which continued until <hi>Michaelmas</hi> following) that a Cranoc of Wheat was sold
for twenty shillings, a Cranoc of Oats for eight shillings, a Cranoc of Pease, Beans, and Barley for
as much. The winds the same year were so mighty, that many were hurt, and many slain out-right
by the fall of houses that was forced by the violence of the same. The like whereof were never seen
in <hi>Ireland.</hi> In the year 1317, there was such a dearth of Corn and other Victuals, that a Cranoc of
Wheat was sold for twenty three shillings. And many Housholders, that before time had sustained
and relieved a great number, were this year driven to beg, and many famished. In the time of which
famine, the mercy of God so disposed, that upon the <hi>27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                     <p>This Province is governed by a Lord President<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who hath one assistant, twelve learned Lawyers,

Mean woun,</hi> that is, <hi>Middle Mounster;</hi> and <hi>Vrwoun,</hi> that is, the Front of <hi>Mounster.</hi> But at this day
it is distinguished into these Counties; <hi>Kerry, Desmond, Limerick, Tiperary, Holycross, Waterford,</hi> and
<hi>Cork</hi> which County in times past had been a Kingdom, containing with it <hi>Desmond</hi> also: for so in
the Grant given by King <hi>Henry</hi> the second unto <hi>Robert Fitz-Stephen,</hi> and to <hi>Miles de Cogan,</hi> it is
called in these words: <hi>Know ye that I have granted the whole Kingdom of</hi> Cork, <hi>excepting the City and

                     </p>
                     <p>(2) The form thereof is triangle, and sides not much unequal, from her South East unto the
West-point about 80 miles, from thence to her North-west about 70 miles, and her East Coast along
the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea-shore, eighty miles: the circumference upon two hundred and seventy miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) The air is clear and gentle, mixt with a temperate disposition, yielding neither extremity of
heat or cold, according to the seasonable times of the year, and the natural condition of the Continent.
The soil is generally fruitful, plentiful, both in fish and flesh, and in other victuals as butter, cheese,
and milk. It is fertil in Corn, Cattle, and pasture grounds, and would be much more, if the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
did but apply his industry, to which he is invited by the commodiousness of the Country. It
is well watered with Rivers, and for the most part well wooded, except the County of <hi>Divelin,</hi> which
complains much of that want, being so destitute of wood, that they are compelled to use a clammy kind
of fat turff for their fuel, or Sea-coal brought out of <hi>England.</hi>

to derive their denomination from the River Birgus, about which they inhabited, for to this the
very name is almost sufficient to perswade us.</p>
                     <p>(5) The commodities of this Country do chiefly consist in Cattle, Sea-fowl, and Fish. It breeds
many excellent good horses, called <hi>Irish Hobbies,</hi> which have not the same pace that other horses have
in their course, but a soft and round amble, setting very easily.</p>
                     <p>(6)<unclear>This</unclear> Country hath in it three Rivers of note, termed in old time the three sisters, <hi>Shour, Neor,</hi>

combination.</p>
                     <p>(7) Places very dangerous for shipping are certain flats and shallows in the Sea, that lie over

                     <p>(8) In this Province are placed many fair and wealthy Towns, as <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> which for a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough-Town
excels all the midland Burroughs in this Island. <hi>Kildare,</hi> which is adorned with an
Episcopal See, and much graced in the first infancy of the <hi>Irish</hi> Church, by reason of Saint <hi>Brigid,</hi> a
venerable Virgin, had in great account and estimation for her virginity and devotion, as who was
the Disciple of S. <hi>Patrick</hi> of so great fame, renown, and antiquity: also <hi>Weisford</hi> (a name given
unto it by these <hi>Germans,</hi> whom the <hi>Irish</hi> term <hi>Oustmans</hi>) a Town though inferiour to some, yet as

to be builded, the foundation was laid upon hurdles.</p>
                     <p>(10) That it is ancient, is perswaded by the authority of <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> That it was grievously rent and
dismembred in the tumultuous wars of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and brought afterwards under the subjection of <hi>Edgar</hi>
King of <hi>England,</hi> (which his Charter also confirmeth, wherein he calleth it the noble City of <hi>Ireland</hi>)
is written by <hi>Saxo Grammaticus.</hi> That it was built by <hi>Harold</hi> of <hi>Norway,</hi> which may seem to be
<hi>Harold Harsager,</hi> when he had brought the greatest part of <hi>Ireland</hi> into an awful obedience unto him,
we read in the life of <hi>Griffith ap Sinan</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> At length it yielded unto the valour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the <hi>English,</hi> at their first arrival into <hi>Ireland,</hi> by whom it was manfully defended from the
fierce assaults as well of <hi>Auscoulph</hi> Prince of the <hi>Dublinians,</hi> as afterwards of <hi>Gotard</hi> King of the Isles:
since which time it hath still augmented her flourishing estate, and given approved testimony of
her faith, and loyalty to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> in the times of any tumultuous straights and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions.</p>
                     <p>(11) This is the Royal Seat of <hi>Ireland,</hi> strong in her munition, beautiful in her buildings, and

In the East Suburbs, <hi>Henry</hi> the second, King of <hi>England</hi> (as <hi>Hoveden</hi> reporteth) caused a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Palace to be erected: and <hi>Henry Loundres,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Divelin,</hi> built a Store house about the

year of Christ 1220. Not far from it is the beautiful Colledge consecrated unto the name of the holy
Trinity, which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory dignified with the priviledges of an University.
The Church of S. <hi>Patrick</hi> being much enlarged by <hi>King Iohn,</hi> was by <hi>Iohn Comin</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>

at this day maintain a Dean, a Chanter, a Chancellor, a Treasurer, two Archdeacons, and twenty
two Prebendaries.</p>
                     <p>This City in times past, for the due administration of Civil Government, had a Provost for the
chief Magistrate. But in the year of mans redemption 1409, King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth granted them
liberty to chuse every year a Major and two Bailiffes, and that the Major should have a gilt sword
carried before him for ever. And King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth (to heap more honour upon this place)
changed the two Bailiffs afterwards into Sherif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

serve to make the estate of a City most flourishing.</p>
                     <p>(12) As the people of this Country do about the neighbouring parts of <hi>Divelin</hi> come nearest unto

being at deadly feuds amongst themselves, committing oft-times Man slaughter one upon

                     <p>(5) Such as in ancient time made their abode and habitations in this Province, were the GAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GANI,
who were also called CONCANI, AUTERI, and NAGNATAE. As the <hi>Luceni</hi>
(that were next neighbours unto them) came from the <hi>Lucensii</hi> (in <hi>Spain</hi>) so those <hi>Gangani</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cani</hi>
may seem also to have fetcht their derivation from the <hi>Concani</hi> (a Nation of the self-same Country)
both by the affinity of name, and vicinity of place. In <hi>Strabo,</hi> according to the diversity of reading,
the same people are named <hi>Coniaci</hi> and <hi>Conisci:</hi> and <hi>Silius</hi> testifieth them at the first to have been
<hi>Scythians,</hi> and to have used ordinarily to drink horses bloud (a thing nothing strange among the wild
Irish even of late days.) And some may also haply suppose that the <hi>Irish</hi> name <hi>Conaughty,</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of <hi>Concani</hi> and <hi>Nagnatae.</hi> Howsoever, it is sure that these were the ancient inhabitants of
this Country, as is to be seen in <hi>Ptolomy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(6) The Principal City of this Province, and which may worthily be accounted the third in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> is <hi>Galway,</hi> in <hi>Irish, Gallive,</hi> built in manner much like to a Tower. It is dignified with a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
See, and it is much frequented with Merchants, by reason whereof, and the benefit of the
Road and Haven, it is gainful to the Inhabitants through traffique and exchange of rich commodities,
<pb facs="tcp:37437:189"/>
both by Sea and Land. Not far from which, near the West shoar that lies indented with small in-lets
and out-lets, in a row, are the Islands called <hi>Arran,</hi> of which many a foolish fable goes, as if they were
the Islands of the living, wherein none died at any time, or were subject to mortality; which is as
superstitious an observation, as that used in some other corners of the Country, where the people leave
the right Arms of their Infants males unchristned (as they term it) to the end that at any time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
they might give a more deadly and ungracious blow when they strike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which things do not only
shew how palpable they are carried away by traditious obscurities, but do also intimate how full their
hearts be of inveterate revenge.</p>

in <hi>Ireland</hi> (raised and gathered together by the Arch-Rebbels of that time, <hi>William Burk O Brien, Mac-Nenare,</hi>
and <hi>O Carrol</hi>) were after a bloudy overthrow discomfited and put to flight by the noble
service of <hi>Girald Fitz-Girald</hi> Earl of <hi>Kildare.</hi> And the suppression of certain <hi>Irish</hi> (the posterity of
<hi>Mac-William</hi>) who usurping a tyranny in these parts, raged sometimes upon themselves, with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

they left scarce one house in the Country unrifled, or unrased; but were bridled and repressed (even
in our remembrance) by the severity and resolution of the Commissioners of those times, who
in his wisdom and pollicy well understood, that their excessive insolence, and those their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just

such therefore as refused to obey the Laws, and sided with the tumultuous, with all care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

                     </p>
                     <p>(8) About the year 1316, there was such a great slaughter made of the <hi>Irish</hi> in this Province of
<hi>Connaught,</hi> through a quarrel that rose there between two Lords or Princes, that there were slain on
both sides about four thousand men; and so great a tribulation at that time came upon the people,
that they did devour and eat one another, so as of 10000, there remained not above 300 living.
As it is reported for truth, that the people were then so hunger-starved, that in Church-yards they
took the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that women did eat their own Children. Thus appeared the ire and anger of God, in punishing
their sins, and seeking their conversion.</p>

the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea; and the West part is continually beaten with the boyst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rous rage of the
main West Ocean. This Province and furthest part of <hi>Ireland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> affronteth the <hi>Scottish
Islands,</hi> which are called the Hebrides, and are scattered in the Seas between both Kingdomes; whose
Inhabitants at this day is the <hi>Irish Scot,</hi> Successour of the old Scythian.</p>
                     <p>(2) The form thereof is round, reaching in length from <hi>Coldagh</hi> Haven in the North to <hi>Kilmore</hi>
in her South, near an hundred miles; and in breadth from <hi>Black-Abbey</hi> in her East, to <hi>Calebegh</hi> point
in her West, one hundred thirty and odd miles: The whole in circumference, about four hundred and
twenty miles.</p>
                     <p>(3) This Country seldom feeleth any unseasonable extremities, the quick and flexible Winds cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the heat of Summer, and soft and gentle Showers mollifie the hardness of the Winter. Briefly,
the frozen nor torrid Zone have not here any usurpation; the clouds in the air very sweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
yea, and when they are most impure, are not unwholsome, nor of long continuance, the rough
winds holding them in continual agitation.</p>
                     <p>(4) This equal temperature causeth the ground to bring forth great store of several Trees, both fit
for building<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bearing of fruit; plentiful of Grass for the feeding of Cattel, and is abundantly
furnished with Horses, Sheep, and Oxen; the Rivers likewise pay double tribute, deep enough to carry
Vessels either for pleasure or profit, and Fish great store, both for their own uses, and commodity of
<pb facs="tcp:37437:191"/>
others. <hi>Salmon</hi> in some Rivers of this County abound more in number than in any River of <hi>Europe.</hi>
To speak (in general) though in some places it be somewhat barren, troubled with Loughs, Lakes, and
thick Woods, yet it is every where fresh, and full of Cattel and Forrage, ready at all times to answer
the husbandmans pains. But nature is there so little beholding to Art or Industry, that the various
shew upon Banks, the Shady Groves, the Green Meadows, hanging Hills, and fields fit for Corn, (if
they were manured) do seem to be angry with their Inhabitants for suffering all to grow wild and
barbarous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through their own negligence.</p>
                     <p>(5) This Country in <hi>Prolomies</hi> daies was wholly possessed by the <hi>Voluntii, Darni, Robogdii,</hi> and
<hi>Erdini,</hi> who branched and spread themselves into the several parts of that Island.</p>
                     <p>(6) The people of this Province were accustomed in controversies and solemn protestations to
swear by S. <hi>Patricks Staffe,</hi> which oath they feared more to break, than if they had sworn by the holy
<hi>Evangelists.</hi> Their ancient custom in making their King, was this: A white Cow was taken, which the
King most kill, and seeth the same in water whole, then must he bathe himself therein stark naked;
and sitting in the Caldron wherein it was sod, accompanied with his people round about him, he and
they used to eat the flesh and drink the broath wherein he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ate, without cup, or dish, or use of hand.
How far these prescriptions and customes were different from the conformities of other civil Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies,
we may well perceive by these and other like observations of those gross times: and as yet they
are more barbarous than is any other part of the Island besides.</p>
                     <p>(7) Historians relating of <hi>Ireland,</hi> tell of several Islands in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he several Provinces: some full of
Angels, some full of Devils; some for Male only, some for Female; some where none may live; some
where none can dye; and such effects of trees, stones, and waters, that a man (but of easie conceit)
may well esteem them as heedless as uncertain. So also S. <hi>Patrieks</hi> Purgatory (a thing of much note
in the Tract of this Province) is a vault or narrow cave in the ground, near a Lake (called <hi>Ern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would not lose the possession of their present pleasures, in hope or fear of things to come, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and torments which the godles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are to suffer after this life, might be there presented to the eye,
that so he might more easily root out the sins and Heathenish Errours, that stuck so fast in the hearts of
the <hi>Irish.</hi> But touching the credit hereof (although common fame, and some records do utter it) I
neither will urge the beliefe, nor regard, seeing it is no Article of our Creed.</p>
                     <p>(8) Matters memorable within this Province are these: first, that the Bishops of <hi>Ireland</hi> were
wont to be consecrated by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in regard of the Primacy which they had in
this Country, until such time as <hi>Iohn Papirio</hi> a Cardinal was sent thither from Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the
fourth, to reform Ecclesiastical Discipline in this Island, which was then grown so loose, that there were
Translations and Pluralities of Bishops, according to the will and pleasure of the Metropolitan. Also
that the <hi>Irish men</hi> were accustomed to leave and forsake their wedded Wives at their own free-wills,
whereof <hi>Lanfranck</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> complained unto <hi>Therdeluac</hi> a King of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And
had not this Nation been corrupted with this vice, even unto these our days; both the right of lineal
succession had been more certain among them, and the Gentry and Commonalty had not in such cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
imbrued themselves, with such effusion of their own kindreds blood, about their Inheritances and
legitimation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:37437:192"/>(9) The principal Town in this Tract is <hi>Armagh,</hi> near unto the River <hi>Kalin,</hi> which (albeit it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a poor shew) is the <hi>Archiepiscopal See</hi> and <hi>Metropolitane</hi> of the whole Island. Before Saint <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi>
had built there a fair City, for site, form, quantity, and compass, modelled out (as he saith) by
the appointment and direction of Angels, this place was named <hi>Drumsalrich;</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> tell much that
it received the name of Queen <hi>Armacha:</hi> but the better opinions are, that it is the same which <hi>Beda</hi>
calleth <hi>Dearmach,</hi> and out of the <hi>Scottish</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Language interpreteth it, <hi>The Field of Oaks.</hi> Here
(as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> writeth) S. <hi>Patrick</hi> the Apostle of <hi>Ireland</hi> ruled in his life time, and rested after death: in
honour of whom it was of such venerable estimation in old time, that not only Bishops and Priests, but
Kings also and Princes were (in general) subject to the Metropolitan thereof in all obedience, and to
his government alone. Among the Archbishops of this Province, S. <hi>Malachy</hi> is famoused, who first
prohibited Priests marriage in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and (as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, who wrote his life at large) borrowed
no more of the native barbarousnes of that County, than Sea-fishes do saltness of the Seas. Also
<hi>Richard Fitz-Ralph</hi> (commonly called <hi>Armachanus</hi>) is of famous memory, who turned the edge of his

the Rebels in the year 1593, and won by <hi>Dowdal</hi> a most valiant Captain: near unto which is a great
downfall of water, termed, <hi>The Salmon Leap:</hi> of which there is a common Speech currant among the
Inhabitants, that it was once firm ground, very populous, and well husbanded with tillage; till it
was suddenly over-flown with water, and turned into a Lake, for some filthy abominable acts of the
people against Nature committed with Beasts.</p>
                     <p>(10) The places of Religion, sequestred from other worldly services, and consecrated to holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
erected in this province, were, The Abbey which sheweth it self at <hi>Donegal:</hi> The Monastery
of <hi>Deryo,</hi> where the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebel <hi>Shan O Neal</hi> received such an overthrow (by <hi>Edward Randolph,</hi>

sustained at that time: The Monastery near unto the River <hi>Liffer:</hi> The famous Monastery at the Bay
of <hi>Knockfergus,</hi> of the same institution, name and order, as was that ancient Abbey in <hi>England,</hi>
near unto <hi>Chester,</hi> called <hi>Banchor:</hi> also <hi>Mellifont</hi> Abbey, founded by <hi>Donald</hi> a King of <hi>Vriel,</hi> and
much commended by S. <hi>Bernard:</hi> And lastly, the most renowned Monastery, built at <hi>Armagh</hi> in the
year of our Salvation 610, out of which very many Monasteries were afterwards propagated both in
<hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> These places were far and near frequented and sought unto by great confluences
of <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> till Time proved their devotions to be erronious, and the pure light of the word revealed,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Eaven was too long a reach for Man to recover at one step: And therefore God first
placed him upon the earth, that he might for a time contemplate upon his inferiour
works, magnifie in them his Creator; and receive here a hope of a fuller bliss, which by
degrees he should at last enjoy in his place of rest. For this end was the lower World
created in the beginning out of a rude Mass, which before had no Form. And that
it might be made habitable, the Lord separated the dry Land from the Waters upon the third day.
Yet so as still they make but one Globe, whose center is the same with the middle World; and is the
Point and Rest as it were of all heavy Bodies, which naturally apply themselves to it: and there are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by their own weight and equal poise.</p>

                     </hi> Isa. 40. <hi>He set it upon her foundations so that it shall never move. He covered it with

Figure, as is here described. And is caused by the proper inclination of each part, which being heavy,
falls from ever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

towards his place of rest. We may illustrate both the figure and situation by a familiar similitude, to an
ingenious apprehension. Suppose we a knot to be knit in the midst of a cord that hath many ends: and
those to be delivered to sundry men of equal strength, to be drawn several ways round from every
part, above and below, and on each side; questionless whilest every man draws in the boes of the
knot, it must needs become round: and whilest they continue to pluck with equal strength, it must
rest immoveable in the middle betwixt them: since every strength that would destory, hath a strength
equal to resist it. So it is in the bosom of the earth, where every part meets upon equal priviledge of
na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ure; nor can any press farther than the center, to destroy this compacted figure: for it must meet
there with a body that will oppose it. Or if not, yet could it not pass, since every motion from the
middle were to ascend, which Nature will not permit in a body of weight, as the earth is.</p>
                  <p>(4) Now though in a Sphere every cross line, which way soever drawn, if it run through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
must needs be of equal quantity, and therefore admits no difference of length or bredth: yet
the Geographers for their purpose have conceived (and but conceived) a Longitude and Latitude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth. The Longitude they reckon from the first <hi>Meridian</hi> in the <hi>Azores,</hi> and so Eastward
round number the degrees upon the <hi>Aequator:</hi> The Latitude from the <hi>Aequator</hi> to each Pole, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the degrees upon the outward Meridional circle. This inkling may suffice to instruct the ignorant in
the search of any place that shall be hereafter mentioned in my Discourse.</p>
                  <p>(5) The compass of the whole is cast by our latest and most learned to be 21600 <hi>English</hi> miles:
which though none ever yet so paced, as to measure them by the foot: yet let not the ignorant reject
this account, since the rule by which they are led cannot fail. For we see by continual experience, that
the Sun for every degree in the Heavens gains 60 miles upon the earth towards his circuit round: and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37437:197"/>
after 360 degrees returneth to the same point in respect of us as before it was. Repeat the number of
sixty so oft, and you will find the account just. And so by proportion of the circumference to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
(which is <hi>tripl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> the same which 22 hath to 7) we may judge likewise of the earths
thickness to the Center. The whole Diameter must (by rule) be somewhat lesser than a third part of
the circuit: that in proportion to 21600 will be 6872: half the number will reach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the middle of the
world, and that is 3436. In this report both of the quantity and form of the earth, we must not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
such exactness as cannot vary a hairs bredth: for we see the mountains of the earth, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
the waves of the Sea make the superficies unequal. It will be sufficient, if there be no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
sensible to be reckoned in so great a bulk. for let us rudely hew a ball out of rough stone; still
it is a ball, though not so smooth as one of Crystal: Or suffer a mote to fall upon a Sphere of glass, it
changeth not its figure: far less are the mountains which we see in respect of the whole lump. For
other rules or terms Geographical, I refer them to a peculiar tract, that will afford me more room
and time.</p>
                  <p>(6) When the Earth and Sea were thus prepared with a due figure, a just quantity and convenient
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

use her Art, and to make it a fit dwelling place for the Image of God, for so was man created, and so
indeed was the Earth no other than the picture of Heaven. The ground brought forth her plants and
fruits: the Skies were filled with the Fowl of the Air: the waters yielded their fish, and the fields
their Cattel. No sooner his house was thus finish't, but man enters upon his possession the sixth day.
And that shall be our tract to find out the worlds first Inhabitants; where it was peopled in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:
and how it was over-spread with Countries and Nations, as now it is.</p>
                  <p>(7) In the first Age, there was little need of skill to measure the whole Earth. A garden plot
might suffice, and so (for a time) it did. It was planted in <hi>Ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

D. <hi>Willet,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> and others, make it a part of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> North-west from <hi>Babylon,</hi> about
the degrees of 78 in Longitude, and of Latitude 35, where still the Rivers meet, mentioned in <hi>Genesis</hi>
and where <hi>Ptolemy</hi> hath his <hi>Audanites,</hi> a corrupt name, (as is supposed) from <hi>Ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

about the middle of the Earth, and abounded by a peculiar blessing of God, with all kinds serviceable
for the use of man.</p>
                  <p>(8) But <hi>Adam</hi> soon lost this possession by his disobedience, and was cast out on the East-side of
the garden, where he placed himself. <hi>Moses</hi> makes no more particular relation. <hi>Cain</hi> is specified to
have gone out of the presence of the Lord into the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> and there built him a City, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it after his sons name <hi>Henoch:</hi> this was the first City, and was seated (some thing) about <hi>Mount
Libanus.</hi> As the place, so the time when it was found is uncertain: but the common conjecture
gives it to be about 2 or 3 hundred years after the Creation, when the world was replenished: as well
it might be within that compass, if we compare it to our known stories. <hi>Abraham</hi> in 215 years had
600 thousand of his own stock, in the blessed line, besides women and children. And in this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

we omit his other seed, of whom came twelve Princes. Questionless after this proportion the
people multiplied in the beginning, and so for 1656 years forward, and that must needs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <p>(9) But now as man, so the sin of man was grown to a height. For this the wrath of God fell
upon them in a flood, that destroyed the whole earth saving eight persons, <hi>Noah</hi> and his family, who
were commanded into an <hi>Ark</hi> built by Gods own direction, and is held to have been the pattern for all
Ships to all posterity.</p>
                  <p>(10) When the anger of the Lord was ceased, and the waters abated, after 150 days float the <hi>Ark</hi>

                  <p>(11) But God blessed the remnant which he had preserved; and when he had given them the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow
for a sign of his mercy, that he would no more break up the fountains of the great deep, nor open
the windows of heaven upon them to root out all flesh, by degrees they descended from the hills East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

ambitious to leave a name behind them for posterity, and therefore adventured upon a building whose

confounded their speech, that they no longer understood one the other. Thus they were broke off from
their impious attempt, and scattered upon all the earth (about an hundred years after the Floud) into
seventy two several Nations, as some have punctually numbred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as it was revealed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> should be given to his posterity. Yet part of his issue (the Sons of <hi>Iock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan)</hi>
were divided and lived remote toward the East. To him was <hi>Asia.</hi> But <hi>Cham</hi> by his fathers curse,
for discovering his nakedness, roved to the utmost parts of the earth, and peopled with his Progeny
especially those Countries which are most toucht in Histories for Barbarism and Idolatry. As indeed
how could it otherwise be? since himself had lost his father that should instruct him: and therefore
could deliver no precepts to his children, but left every one to his own inventions. And those that at
the confusion spread, where ever they came, this diversity of Customs and Religions, that possess the
world at this day. To him was <hi>Africa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(15) <hi>America</hi> too doubtless had her portion in the division, though not so soon or so immediate, but
seemed rather of later times to have received her people from the bordering parts of <hi>Asia;</hi> and those are
thought by most to have been first inhabited by <hi>Iocktan</hi> and his thirteen Sons, the issue of <hi>Sem.</hi> It is

from the River <hi>Cephew</hi> to <hi>Ieria,</hi> which is now called the East or <hi>Portugal Indies.</hi> Indeed many of
those Eastern Regions are noted to bear the name as yet of <hi>Iocktans</hi> sons. The <hi>Shabeans</hi> found as if

whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ey were so long since known I must doubt. For the bestowing of <hi>Iocktan,</hi> and his sons, it
was toward the East from <hi>Mesha</hi> to <hi>Sephar:</hi> but where those are, Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> confesseth himself at
a stand. And for my part I will travel no farther in these hidden Mysteries, than I find a path beaten
before me.</p>
                  <p>(16) This may satisfie the ingenuous, that I have (as far as I might in this little room) trac't the
first Nations from their first Founders which they had in the beginning. But to draw the direct line of
every people mixt as they now are, I think a work impossible; to me I am sure it is. For besides our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
translations and promiscuous commerce, that puzzle us in the knowledge of our selves: we have
of late found, and as yet are in search of a new people, that know not their own Original, nor have we
any means to examin it, but conjectural, such as may fail. To <hi>Moses</hi> time the Scripture affordeth us
a certain truth for as many as he mentioneth, and since we have some light from such as have laboured
in the search of Antiquities. The Families (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> gives time) are truly and curiously brancht
forth and placed among the Genealogies before our Bible of the last Translation, by our well-deserving
Countrey-man Mr. <hi>Iohn Speed.</hi>

                  <p>(17) Thus far it was requisite we should know at large the growth of the world from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;

as in after Ages it was found by our first Artists, and hath been since more at large discovered by the
experience of our later Travellers.</p>
                  <p>(18) And in this we may still observe our method. For questionless by the same degrees almost
as it was inhabited, so it grew into the knowledge of our ancient Geographers. And therefore our first
Authors in this Science bounded their Descriptions within a less compass, and divided the world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those three parts only, which you see lie closest about the point of the earth, where the first men,
first Religion, first City, first Empire, and first Arts were. For in <hi>Prolomy</hi>'s time (about an hundred
and forty years after Christ) we hear not of either Land or Sea known more than was contained in
<hi>Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(19) And of that he never knew the East and North parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> nor the South of <hi>Africa,</hi> no
nor the most Northerly parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> but placed the end of the world that way in <hi>Vltima thule,</hi>
about sixty three degrees from the <hi>Aequator.</hi> And Southward the other way not above 17 degrees,

                  <p>THe method propounded in our general Description of the World, gives <hi>Asia</hi> the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

will suffice her, if she be at this day most famous for the acts of men, and so it is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by most. But in <hi>Asia</hi> did God himself speak his miraculous work of the Creation.
There was the Church first collected: there was the Saviour of the World born, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and raised again: indeed the greatest part of Divine History was there written and acted. And
if we should as well compare her to the rest, in that earthly glory of Kingdoms, Empires and Nations,
which sounds fairest to mans sense, she would still keep her rank. For was not the first Monarchs and
Monarchies of the World in <hi>Assyria, Persia, Babylonia, Media?</hi> Did not the first People of the World
receive their Being in <hi>Mesopotamia?</hi> And had not the several Tongues of the World their original in

                  <p>(8) Let my first division of this <hi>Asia</hi> the Less, be into two Regions; of these one hath the particular
appellation of <hi>Asia propria,</hi> and contains the several Regions of <hi>(1) Caria, (2) Ionia, (3) Doris, (4)
Aeolis Phrygia, (5) Lydia, (6) Minor, (7)</hi> and <hi>Major.</hi> The other hath no one name as I find among
Geographers, but is known by her Provinces of <hi>(1) Cilicia; (2) Pamphilia, (3) Lycia, (4) Bythynia,
(5) Pontus, (6) Paphlagonia, (7) Galatia, (8) Cappadocia, (9) Lycaonia, (10) Pisidia,</hi> and <hi>(11)
Armenia minor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(9) <hi>Asia propria</hi> was the scene of many noble actions much celebrated among our Historians. First,
in <hi>Caria</hi> stood the City <hi>Mindum,</hi> upon which <hi>Diogenes</hi> brake his Iest, That the Citizens should take
heed lest it run out at her Gates And <hi>Halicarnassus</hi> the birth place of <hi>Dyonisius</hi> and <hi>Herodotus:</hi> and
of this was <hi>Artemisia</hi> Queen, that erected the miraculus Monument in honour of her Husband <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solus.</hi>
The second Province is <hi>Ionia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and here stood <hi>Miletum,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> made his Oration to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>Ephesus;</hi> and here <hi>Ephesus</hi> it self, the Star of <hi>Asia,</hi> that as well for her Religion as her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Temple, set the World at a gaze upon her. It was raised in the middle of the City, modelled
out by <hi>Ctesiphon,</hi> but was 220 years in building; and was ordered in such a ground, that no Earth-quake
should move it: it was 425 foot long, and 220 broad, and had an hundred twenty seven Pillars, given
by so many several Kings (saith <hi>Vadianus</hi>) whereof twenty seven were most curiously graven, all the
rest of Marble polished. In this City Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist is said to have gone down into his
Grave alive: there be who yet question his Death: and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> reports that he lived in <hi>Trajans</hi>
time. This with the third and fourth Provinces of <hi>Doris</hi> and <hi>Aeolis,</hi> were only accounted <hi>Greeks:</hi>
the other Nations of <hi>Asia</hi> were called <hi>Barbarians.</hi> (5) <hi>Lydia</hi> was the fifth named in our Division;
and in her are many Cities, which we have mentioned in Scripture, and are common among other
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37437:203"/>
Writers. Of these the chief are <hi>Laodicea, Thyatira, Philadelphia, Sardis,</hi> where <hi>Croesus</hi> kept his Court,
and <hi>Pergamus</hi> the Seat of <hi>Attalus,</hi> that made the <hi>Romans</hi> his Heir, and where <hi>Galen</hi> the great Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
was born, and lived 140 years. (6) The first was <hi>phrygia minor;</hi> it is called <hi>Troas</hi> by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
and those are now <hi>Greeks, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Arabians;</hi> heretofore they were the antient <hi>Trojans,</hi> that
gave <hi>Homer</hi> his subject for his admired Poem. Here is that <hi>Adramittium</hi> named in the <hi>Acts.</hi> and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janopolis:</hi>
and the Mount <hi>Tmolus,</hi> that sends down a River into <hi>Lydia</hi> with abundance of Gold and
Silver. And lastly, the Mount <hi>Ada,</hi> famous for the judgment of <hi>Paris</hi> past upon the three Goddess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(7) The last was <hi>Phrygia major;</hi> and on this was <hi>Gordion,</hi> the very Town where <hi>Gordius</hi> hampered
his Plow-tacklings in such a knot that none might unty, but he that should possess the Monarchy of the
World; and indeed it proved true enough in <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. Another was <hi>Midaium,</hi> where
<hi>Midas</hi> son to this <hi>Gordius</hi> turned all to Gold with a Touch. A third <hi>Coloss,</hi> the place of the <hi>Colossians</hi>
to whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> directs an Epistle. And all these were contained within the compass of that one
part which bears the name of <hi>Asia propria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(10) The other Provinces of <hi>Asia minor</hi> have their Stories worth the Memory. (1) The first was
<hi>Cilicia</hi> now called <hi>Garamania;</hi> whose People in times past were noted for grand Pirats, till overcome
by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and when by force they were turned honest, they gained the repute of a warlike Nation,
especially in Sea-fights. So <hi>Lucan,</hi>

                  <p>It was a rich Province to <hi>Rome</hi> when <hi>Cicero</hi> was <hi>Proconsul:</hi> and still it is full of pleasant places: but
withal hath many wild and waste grounds, that are no mans peculiar: but who will, may there freely
feed his Goats, which afford them good commodities, as well by their milk as their hair, of which are
made most curious Chamlets. In this Province was <hi>Tarsus,</hi> the City of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Pompeiopolis</hi> and <hi>Alexandria<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

heretofore of great fame. The Metropolis was <hi>Patara</hi> Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> his birth-place, and where some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Apollo</hi>'s answers were returned. (4) <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Bythinia</hi> were the fourth and fifth, though once
severed, yet afterward they made but one Province, and was governed by <hi>Mithridates</hi> that first found out
the Medicine that bares his name. He had many years war with <hi>Rome,</hi> but at last with much adoe was
overcome. Her Cities were <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the place of the fourth General Counsel, and <hi>Nice</hi> of the first,
as also <hi>Nicomedia, Apamia, &amp;c.</hi> (6) The sixth <hi>Paphlagon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> directed one of his Epistles. It was the seat of King <hi>Deiotarus,</hi> Client to <hi>Cycero</hi> as appears by

City of this Isle stood the <hi>Colossus</hi> in the form of a man, erected in a kind of Religion to the Sun, that
once a day at least breaks out upon the Isle, howsoever cloudy it be in other places. <hi>Graeians</hi> heretofore
possest it; and when the Christians had lost the Holy Land, the <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> gave this
Isle to the Knights of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in the year 1308. But now the Inhabitants are most
<hi>Turks,</hi> and some <hi>Iews</hi> sent thither out of <hi>Spain.</hi> As for Christians, they may not stay in the City in the
night time. (2) The second is <hi>Cyprus,</hi> a place heretofore consecrated to <hi>Venus,</hi> to whom both men
and women peformed their sacrifice naked, till by the prayer of <hi>Barnabas</hi> the Apostle the Temple
was ruined. <hi>Trogus</hi> reports, that the fathers of this Isle were wont to prostitute their Daughters to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
for money, whereby to raise them a portion against they could get them husbands: but Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
corrected those barbarous Customs. In time it was made a <hi>Roman</hi> Province, and in the division
of the Empire was assigned to the Emperor of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> So it continued till <hi>Richard</hi> the first of
<hi>England,</hi> in his voyage put into this place for fresh water: but being incensed by the discourteous usage
of the <hi>Cyprians,</hi> turned his intent into an invasion, took the King prisoner, and bound him in silver
fetters. Afterwards he sold it to the Templers for a time, but recovered it again, and exchanged it for
the title of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>

                  <p>(15) Lastly, the Islands of <hi>Asia</hi> the great lie most in the <hi>Indian</hi> or Eastern Ocean, and indeed are
innumerable, but the chief of account are these; <hi>Ormus, Zeilan, Summatra, Avirae Insulae, Bocuro,
Iava, Major</hi> and <hi>Minor, Iapan,</hi> and <hi>Moluccoes,</hi> and the <hi>Philippian</hi> Isles.</p>

And so indeed that Kingly Prophet in the 78 <hi>Psalm,</hi> useth the tents of <hi>Cham</hi> for
the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is that part of <hi>Africa</hi> which joyns upon the South west of
<hi>Asia,</hi> and is divided from the Holy Land but by a small <hi>Isthmus.</hi> Give the people
their own asking, and they will have the glory of the first Inhabitants of the world: and prove it too
both from the temperature of their air, and fertility of their soil, which breeds and nourisheth not only
Plants and fruits, but sends forth, of its own vertue, living creatures in such sort, as amazeth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder.
We have a report (if you will belive it) that in a ground neer the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> there have
been found <hi>Mice</hi> half made up, and Nature taken in the very nick, when she had already wrought life in
the fore-parts, head and breast, the hinder joynts yet remaining in the form of earth. Thus I suppose they
would have man at first grown out of their soil, without the immediate hand of God in his Creation.
And it hath been the opinion of some vain Philosophers, that for this cause have made the <hi>Eihiopians</hi>
to be the first people: for that there the Sun by his propinquity, wrought soonest upon the moisture of
the ground, and made it fit for mortality to sprout in.</p>
                  <p>(2) But to leave these, without doubt <hi>Africa</hi> is of great antiquity, and so is allowed by all Historians
of credit: In the year 1566 the people were increased to an exceeding multitude; and therefore were
enforced to enlarge their bounds, upon their neighbouring Countries. For as it was of a most rare
fertility; so it lay not any long way, and had free access to it by land from the garden of our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>

the Scepter of the earth into her hand, she had the name with <hi>Pliny</hi> of <hi>Orbis domitorum genitrix:</hi> and
well she might, if we but read her story, since first she came in view: In the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy <hi>Alexander</hi>
was her Champion. In the Latine Empire the <hi>Romans</hi> bare the sway, and scarce left a corner of the

Continent, yet have we a part too in <hi>America</hi> for our peculiar, and hope still to bring more into our
prossessions that we may bring them unto Christ.</p>
                  <p>(3) In respect of the two other quarters in the Eastern Hemisphere, <hi>Europe</hi> is partly West, and
partly North, for she is situated North-ward, betwixt the Tropick of <hi>Cancer</hi> and the Polar Artick:
and Westward hath no Continent betwixt her and <hi>America,</hi> but is bounded with the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean.
On the East toward <hi>Asia,</hi> she hath the <hi>Mare Aegeum,</hi> which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Archipelagus,</hi> and the <hi>Pontus
Euxinus,</hi> or <hi>Mare Magor.</hi> And the <hi>Palus Meoris</hi> and the River <hi>Tanais.</hi> South-ward it hath
the <hi>Mediterraneum</hi> and <hi>Fretum Herculeum;</hi> So that it is almost encompast with the Seas, and hath
the form of a <hi>Peninsula,</hi> whose <hi>Isthmus</hi> that joyns it ot the rest of the Continent is to be reckoned that
part, which lyeth betwixt the branches of the River <hi>Tanais,</hi> and the <hi>Mare Glaciale:</hi> These are her out
bounds</p>
                  <p>(4) If we view her within we shall find that Nature has not spent her store, nor was she close han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
when she allotted her portion. And though <hi>Europe</hi> indeed be the least, yet is she furnished in all
points with the like variety: her Rivers as commodious as those of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and her Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
no less famous than <hi>Taurus</hi> or <hi>Atlas.</hi> Her measure indeed is not comparable to any of the other
three: She bears in Longitude but 3800. miles from S. <hi>Vincent</hi> in <hi>Portugal</hi> to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And in
Latitude at most 1200. and that too from the <hi>Aegean</hi> to the frozen Sea, by some account not above
900.</p>
                  <p>(5) But by her extent (as it is) small; it adds to her glory, that <hi>in exiguo res numerosa jacet:</hi> that yet
sheexceeds those vaster Regions, and bears the name of the most happy Country in the world, both for
plenty of Corn, Plants, Fruits, for Rivers and Fountains of admirable vertues, for beauty as well of
Cities, Castles, and Horses, as men and women of excellent feature. For the study of Arts, for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
in Religion, and what-ever else God hath pleased to bless his Church with from the beginning.</p>

where they breed: hot Spices, which fit not our temper: and rather corrupt our manners, than mend
our diet: precious Iewels, and the like, which have brought in a degree of vain and useless pride, not
known before by our Predecessors; yet too of gold, silver, and other commodious Metals she hath her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And in brief is of a very prosperous temper, yet of so strange variety, that it is admirable to
think that there is no place in this quarter, but is fit for any man to live in. Insomuch as every corner
is inhabited, as is confirmed by our later Travellers: though heretofore it hath been questioned by reason
of the extream cold toward the Pole. This in general.</p>

<hi>English</hi> miles. It is begirt on every side with Seas, unless on the Eastern, and there it is joyned to <hi>France</hi>
by a kind of <hi>Isthmus,</hi> when the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Mountains cross from one Sea to the other, and set the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits

Kingdoms, <hi>Aragou, Castile,</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Land yields all sorts of Wines, Sugar, Fruits, Grain,
Oyls, Metals, especially Gold and Silver. It is fertile enough for the Inhabitants. For indeed they
are not many, nor have they so great Cities as there are in other Regions in <hi>Europe.</hi> Besides, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of those for the most part are base: The meanest proud, the best superstitious and hypocrites:
most of them lascivious. Give them their own, they are good Souldiers, not so much for their valour

are a sort of ungreatful ones, that commonly debase them most that deserve of them best: and judge it
a thing worthy their hate, to be out gone in any fair action, though it redound to their own profit.
Pardon my zeal to truth; it warms my stile against those Robbers, in the behalf of so honourable
a man: They are no petty theeves that would steal from one his immortality; as what less could he deserve,
that gave us the knowledge of another world, and laid the way open for the entrance of the Gospel, to

by which he fully perswads himself of some lands that must needs lie in that portion of circle, which

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37437:218"/>
or cold, that could make it less habitable or fruitful, than those places of the old world, which lay
under the same Climates, and had the like respect to the Heavens. These indeed were good rational
perswasions, but the difficulty would have daunted a mean spirit, and dasht not the action only, but
the very thought. His resolution was confirmed, and his purpose well digested to himself in the year
1486 and put into practise about six years after.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37437:219"/>
and breadth, she lyeth at such several distance in respect of the Heavens, that she admits indeed all varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
almost either of plenty or want, which we have hitherto found in <hi>Asia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>Europe.</hi> Here
admirable for the fertility of soly; then again as barren: here temperate, their scorching hot, else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
as extream cold. Some Regions watered with dainty Rivers, others again infested with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
drouth. Some Plains, some Hills: some Woods, some Mines; and what not in some tract or
other within the compass of <hi>America?</hi> Yet nothing almost common to the whole but Barbarisme of
manners, Idolatry in Religion, and sottish ignorance, such as hardly distinguisheth them from brutes; else
they would not have taken reasonable men to be immortal Gods as at first they did: yet what either
God was, or immortality, they knew no more than instinct of nature gave them, only a confused
thought they had of some place or other (God knows where) behind some Hill, where the blessed
after their death. And from thence they supposed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came at their first arrival. But
it was not long before the Tyrants cudgelled their simplicity, and by their cruelty appeared to them
rather Devils from hell, than Saints from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>(8) Yet still the <hi>In lund</hi> Countries retain for the most part their in-bred blindness: and worship the
Sun, Moon, and Stars, and they have their other Spirits, which they call their <hi>Zemes,</hi> and adore them
in Images made of Cotton-wooll, which oft-times by the delusion of Satan seem to move, and utter an
hideous noise, that works in these poor Idolaters a great awe, lesst they should harm them.</p>
                  <p>(9) The rest of their Customes are answerable to their Religion, beastly. They go naked, and are
very lustful people without distinction of sex. In many places they are <hi>Anthropophagi,</hi> and prey upon each
other like Wolves. They labour not much to sustain themselves: but are rather content to take what
the earth can yield without Tillage. This in general.</p>
                  <p>(10) Time hath not given way to many divisions of this <hi>America.</hi> I find one only in the best

other for the most part South-ward toward the <hi>Magellanick</hi> Straits, and is called <hi>Peruviana.</hi> Each of
them are subdivided into their Provinces.</p>
                  <p>(11)<hi>Mexicana</hi> is the first, and her bounds on the East and West are the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, and

by which she is divided from <hi>Africa</hi> on the East, and on the West at a large distance from the most

course of high Mountains, whose tops the very Fowls of the air cannot reach by flight. And from
thence descend many admirable Rivers, among which <hi>Maragno</hi> and <hi>Argenteus</hi> are most famous. The
one for his extent, and the other for his plenty of silver. The Country is exceeding rich, but the
people differ not much from the worst of Beasts. They devour mans flesh, filthy worms, and what
else comes in their way. The chief Provinces are numbred thus; <hi>(1) Castella Aurea. (2) Guiana.

                  <p>(24) <hi>Guiana</hi> is the second Province of the <hi>Peninsula Peru Maria,</hi> situated just under the <hi>Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial.</hi>
On the North it hath the main River <hi>Oronoque</hi> or <hi>Raliana</hi> from Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> who went
further than any before him into the Country. This River is navigable by report above 1000 miles,
On the South it hath likewise another great River of the <hi>Peninsula</hi> called <hi>Maragnon,</hi> which exceeds
the former, and is navigable 600 miles in length. In this province stands the largest City of <hi>America</hi>
called <hi>el Dorodo,</hi> or the guilded City: For indeed there is plenty of gold. The length, as it is spoken
by some Travellers, will exceed belief. The second memorable Town is S. <hi>Thome:</hi> not so much for
her own worth, as the disastrous fortunes of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> who there first lost his eldest son, and
after returned home with that ill success, as it cost him his own life.</p>
                  <p>(25) <hi>Peru</hi> the third in rank, yet by name it seems to be the chiefest Province of this Southern
Tract. It is contained almost betwixt the <hi>Aequator</hi> and the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Capricorn.</hi> On the North it hath

Sugar and Brazile wood. The people are covered with natural hair, cruel, lascivious, false, and what

before reckoned the rest of the earth Barbarous in comparision to their polite Common-wealth, are now
themselves sunk below the envy of the meanest Nation, and become the most miserable object of pity
living upon the earth. Indeed they may hardly be said to live, for that they take no farther care than
barely to live. They are lazy beyond belief, and ignorant almost beyond recovery: for they have now
no means to bring their children either to learning or manners. Not an Academy in all <hi>Greece.</hi> Their
carriage generally uncivil: their feasts riotous, and their mirth debaucht. Their Wives are well-favoured,
and so indeed they must be; for they use them no longer as their Wives than they continue to their
liking: when they once fade they are put to the house drudgery. Their language is the same as heretofore
but rudely corrupted, though (as <hi>Maginus</hi> reports) it differs not so much as the <hi>Italian</hi> from the pure

used in the unjust oppression of his neighbours. His name was grown odious when the lust of his Son

                  <p>(13) This variety had took up hitherto scarce 245. years since the City was first built, a time too
short for her greatness, if we compare her with the progress of other Nations: yet to her own ensuing
fortunes, it is esteemed but her child-hood, her infancy: while she had not yet spake, nor the world well
heard of her actions, farther than her own home, and her Countries near about. She began now to feel
her strength, and when she had first freed her self from the oppression of her home bred Tyrant; she
soon after spread her Arms over all <hi>Italy,</hi> and her fame through most parts of the world. Her power
was now no more at the disposing of one King, but designed over into the hands of two aged and

before practised, both in the name of their new Governours, for they were called only <hi>Consules à

unless by death: and lastly, by their ensigns of state, their twelve <hi>lictors</hi> and <hi>fasces,</hi> which were
not allowed to both, but to each in turns for their several month. And this went on without breach al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
six years, till the <hi>Romans</hi> thought fit to correct their Laws by the <hi>Greek</hi> Copy; and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
three of their best esteemed subjects to see <hi>Athens,</hi> to peruse their orders and customs, of which
the world had then a great opinion: for it was indeed the mother of learning.</p>
                  <p>(14) They returned them written at first in ten tables made of brass; two more were soon after
added, and together were distinguished from their own municipal laws by the name of <hi>Leges 12. tabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum.</hi> The Consuls power was now taken off; and thus was their rule of justice put into the hands
of ten, whom they called <hi>Decemviri.</hi> Each ruled in his turn, and (for that course) had a power well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh
as large as their Kings or Consuls, else differed little at other times from a private <hi>Romane.</hi> This
began some 303 years after their first founder, and had continued but three, when <hi>Appius</hi> laid false
claim to <hi>Virginia</hi> for his bond-maid, that indeed he might dishonour her as his strumpet. By this means
he doubly provoked the Commons, both with her injuries, and her fathers sorrow, who was forced to
murder his own daughter, to quit her from the lust of the <hi>Decemviri:</hi> and therefore they took revenge,
not upon him only, but his office; abrogated the <hi>Decemviratus</hi> and returned the authority into the
hands of Consuls as before: yet so, as oft times by intercourse the <hi>Tribuni militum</hi> put in for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulary
soveraignty, and was admitted to the same dignity, though not the name, which the <hi>Patricii</hi>
only referred to themselves as their royalty. It was first procured by the importunate motion of the
Commons, that they might be equally capable of the Consulship. To this, though the nobility would
not give their full assent in all circumstances, yet they were constrained for their own peace to yield

in effect, and mince it with another title of <hi>Tribuni plebis Consulari pot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>The Description of the Kingdome of BOHEMIA.</head>
                  <p>IN our Description of <hi>Germany,</hi> we reckoned <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but as a Province among the rest: and
therefore she was mentioned there with no more solemnity, than the other parts were. We
purpose here to declare it an intire Kingdom of it self: which besides her own compass (as
she is most commonly limited by Geographers) hath under-subjects, Dukedoms, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisates,
such as do her homage, and make her well worthy of a more particular History, than we
had before room for.</p>
                  <p>(2) The ancient Inhabitant of these parts was the <hi>Bemorum magna gens,</hi> as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> calls it: and
placeth it somewhat South, toward <hi>Danubius</hi> under <hi>Suna sylva:</hi> After them, the <hi>Boii,</hi> a people of
<hi>Gallia Lugdunensis,</hi> which had been before conquered by <hi>Caesar</hi> (saith <hi>Quadus</hi>) and packt over the
<hi>Alpes</hi> to seek them a new seat in <hi>Italy.</hi> But, when they found the <hi>Romans</hi> too hot for their abode there,
they were forced to trudge farther, and to pass the River. <hi>Rhene</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> witnesseth,
where they found them a fit place to lurk in, compassed with a large Wood called the <hi>Sylva Hircinia:</hi>
and like enough they joyned in with the <hi>Bemi,</hi> to make up the name of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> But neither here
did they enjoy their peace long, for they were in time nestled out by a potent people of <hi>Swevia,</hi> called
<hi>Marcomanni:</hi> and they again had the like measure from the <hi>Sclavonians,</hi> a barbarous crue, which
came in upon them, under the conduct of an exiled murderer of <hi>Croatia,</hi> one <hi>Zechius,</hi> about the
year five hundred and fifty.</p>
                  <p>(3) From that time there hath been no general expulsion: but the present <hi>Bohemians</hi> are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny
of those <hi>Sclavonians,</hi> whose very language and customs are in use among them at this day.
Doubtless it was at first a rude Common-wealth, that had no other Governours, but so ungoverned
a multitude: for so they continued above an hundred years after <hi>Zechius.</hi> But when they had for a time
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37437:240"/>
endured the misery of such a confusion, they were content to agree upon some one for their Prince,
that might rule them: and the first which they elected was <hi>Cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their several Massacres they have destroyed many assemblies of the <hi>Hugonotes,</hi> as they call them. The

                  <p>(6) Yet by reason of her watry situation, it must needs be that the air is exceeding moist, and
therefore unwholsome: but not so as heretofore. For the multitude of Inhabitants, and those won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
industrious, have laboured out of many of her marshes, and drawn their Pools into running
channels; and by this means fewer vapours arise, insomuch that now the Natives at last may very well
agree with the temper, which (as <hi>Maginus</hi> gives it) <hi>incolarum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Their Summer is pleasant, not extream hot, nor abounds it with such troublesome flies and gnats as
ours doth. There is seldome any thunder heard, or lightning seen, or Earthquake felt. The reason is
the same for all. The Winter is not altogether so tolerable; but brings with it bleak winds and much
rain. Yet betwixt both, the Country is moderately fertile, yields corn and fruit, in some places more,
and in some le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which draw many other Nations to them for Traffique: and they lie as fit for it, having free access by
Sea to and from all the chief parts, as of <hi>Europe,</hi> so also <hi>Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> and are as skilful to

and in their own private Families excell any other people. The men are of a goodly presence;
of a cold, or at least no cholerick temper. They neither love nor hate any extreamly; but will soon
forget both a good turn, and (they say) an injury. They are not very open, or easie of belief, nor apt to
be deceived. Not very proud, nor exceeding base. Not much given to <hi>Venus,</hi> but more to <hi>Bacchus,</hi>
especially when he presents himself upon an <hi>English</hi> Beer-barrel. For they will hardly make a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
before they be well whetted. This is their common character; but for the best part of it we
have found it far other, as in their commerce with us in the East <hi>Indies</hi> we have found, where by their
extream dealings with our Nation, they have made known their unthankfulness for the many benefits
our <hi>English</hi> have shewed them. But I return to their better qualities. Their women are fair, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

                  <p>(9) The last quality required in a Nation of esteem (as they are) is valour. And indeed I may well
place it last. For so it grew upon them since the long war which they have had with the <hi>Arch-Duke.</hi>
Before they lived for the most part in peace; and as they had but little use of Chivalry, so they had as
little heart to it: but were counted a heavy dull people. To say truth, they have hardly yet recovered
that censure: for in the managing of their Land-fights especially, they are content enough to give way
to other Nations, and will hardly second them in any dangerous attempt. The <hi>English</hi> have both act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and suffered their parts in the behalf of the <hi>Low Countries:</hi> and that (me-thinks) might have been
remembred in the midst of their tyrannical usage of our Merchants.</p>
                  <p>(10) These <hi>Netherlands</hi> towards our latter times were divided into 17 Provinces, whereof the most
part had several Rites and Governours, four Dukedomes, seven Earldomes, five Baronies, and one
Marqueship. But by the next marriages of the heirs to the sundry Titles, the whole at last fell upon
one, and was made an entire Government, and known by the name of the Dukedom of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Yet
still doth each Province retain her proper Laws, liberty of Religion, and other Customes, which their
Rulers in succession were sworn to maintain for their parts: and the people again for their security,
had this main prerogative left them from the beginning; that if their Prince should at any time attempt
the contrary, they might, after Declaration, proceed to the choice of a new Governour. These Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
confirmed, it continued for a while peacefully, and by marriage with <hi>Mary,</hi> heir and last of the
house of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> it fell to <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Germans.</hi> And his Successour
<hi>Philip</hi> matching in the like sort with <hi>Ioan,</hi> heir to the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> joyned both together in his
eldest son <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, who by the Mother was entituled to <hi>Spain,</hi> and by his Father to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi>

or <hi>Netherlands,</hi> as for <hi>Austria</hi> it passed to another brother. Thus came it subject to the King of
<hi>Spain.</hi> And while yet the Emperour enjoyed it, they felt no misery of civil wars among themselves.
When he left it, he commanded this charge withall to his son <hi>Philip</hi> the second, that he should intreat
the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> well. But this he either forgot or neglected: and taking it in foul scorn to be so
curbed by the conditions of his Predecessors, began first with a pretence to Religion, and at last em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled
them in a bloudy war, which hath found no end to this hour; and caused them to cast off the
<hi>Spanish</hi> clog, which they did in the year 1581. and declared by their Writings, that <hi>Philip</hi> the second,
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> had forfeited his Government of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> by breach of his faith. And
withall they bound their people by a new oath, never to return to their obedience: which they yet make
good against the <hi>Arch-Dutchess,</hi> who by kindred to the <hi>Spanish</hi> King, and marriage to the <hi>Arch-Duke,</hi>
is at this time interested in the Government, and therefore in the quarrel.</p>

Villages, besides Castles, with several Earldoms, many other petty Governments. In the South is the

<hi>Luick</hi> the chief City of the Bishoprick is an University, memorable for this one story, above any other
in Christendom: That at one time there studied 9 Kings sons, 24 Dukes sons, 29 Earls sons, &amp;c. The
Dukes part in the East is not of that fame, either for multitude of Towns and Villages, or command
of under territories. In the year 1293, the heirs male were extinct, and by that means it fell to the
Duke of <hi>Brabant.</hi> The whole Region is exceeding fertile, and affords almost all necessaries except
Wine: Among other commodities, it abounds with a kind of stone, of excellent use in Physick, called

                  <p>IN our Division of <hi>Europe,</hi> we placed her Regions as they lay from the first <hi>Meridian</hi> of Longitude
in the <hi>Azores,</hi> and so on towards <hi>Asia</hi> Eastward. We will not here vary the course which was
there proposed, and that gave <hi>Spain</hi> the precedency, as lying most Westward into the <hi>Atlantick</hi>
Ocean. And indeed she puts forward as well upon her terms of Antiquity, as order of place. For
if her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

be one of the first Nations of the second world. Likely enough those parts might be inhabited by
his Progeny; but I doubt whether so soon after the floud, as himself lived, and as some would have
it, who suppose that he then kept Cattel, and named the Province <hi>Taraconensis,</hi> from the Hebrew
<hi>Taraco<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> a possession of Herds. This and other the like improbable Relations pass over her original.
Which as we may not accept for truths, so we have no room here to confute them for lies. We must
be content rather to omit those former ages, which give us no light but by Fables; and begin with the
affairs of <hi>Spain,</hi> which come within the compass of our known and approved Stories. As for the exploits
of <hi>Hercules,</hi> of <hi>Gerion,</hi> and <hi>Cacus,</hi> and the rest; questionless, they had some ground from truth it self,
if we knew how to search it forth: and here was their residence, men twelve hundred years by compute
before the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Carthaginians</hi> enjoyed it. But by reason that the passage of those times, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
only in vain fictions, we can warrant nothing for certain till the <hi>Syrians</hi> there planted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Isle of <hi>Gades:</hi> and of them little, till the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were called in to aid them against
the disturbance of ill neighbours; when once they were mingled with so flourishing a Nation, they
wanted not Writers to record their actions, and sundry turns of Fortune.</p>

                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:37437:256"/>(2) The next Inhabitants there of <hi>Spain,</hi> after the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and indeed the first which affords us any
Story worth observing, were the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> and the first cause of their entrance was to defend the
Islanders of <hi>Cales:</hi> but when they had once got firm footing, and sucked the sweetness, they were not
to be removed by the easie term of friendship: but there kept hold, till a people stronger than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
dispossessed them. The attempt was made by <hi>Scipio</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> forces; but they withstood
their assault with so resolved a courage, and so strong a hand, that it might oft times be questioned
<hi>Vter populus alteri esset pariturus?</hi> and so held play almost 200 years, and could not be fully subdued
into the form of a Province, till the Reign of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> yet after, they were held to it till <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3) About his sixth year was there a second Invasion made by the <hi>Vandales,</hi> and soon after by the
<hi>Gothes,</hi> which bare sway for above 300 years. The last King was <hi>Rodericus,</hi> who lost both himself and
Kingdom for a rape committed upon the Daughter of <hi>Iulian,</hi> a Noble Gentlemen, and at that time Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
with the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Africa.</hi> When the Father had understood of his Daughters unworthy
injury, he brought back his revenge with him, 30000 Horse, any 180000 Foot, of <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Sarazens;</hi>
which discomfited the King, overthrew all the ressistance which he could make, and bespread
the Countrey with their Forces, where they and their posterity stood firm, till within the memory of
some which yet live.</p>
                  <p>(4) This change of State was before prophesied, and concealed in a large Chest within a part of
the Palace, which both the last King and his Predecessors were forewarned not to discover. But the
hope of an inestimable treasure made him transgress: and when he had entred, there appeared nothing
but the Portraictures of armed <hi>Moors,</hi> with a presage annexed, that when the part of the Palace should
be forced open, such enemies should ruine <hi>Spain.</hi> It is now at last but one people, but yet retains
the mixtures of those many Nations which have heretofore possest it, <hi>Goths, Sarazens,</hi> and <hi>Iews,</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:37437:257"/>
who were partly banisht hither by <hi>Hadrian</hi> the Emperour, and partly sent hither by <hi>Vlider Vbit</hi> the
<hi>Caliph</hi> after the <hi>Moors</hi> conquest.</p>
                  <p>(5) In all this discourse touching the beginning and setling of the State of <hi>Spain,</hi> it appears not from
whence she derives her several names of <hi>Iberia, Hesperia,</hi> and <hi>Hispania.</hi> It seems they are more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
than the entrance of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and therefore they allow us no certain Story, nor other
reason indeed, more than likely conjecture: and in some scarce that. Her first name of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

given by her ancients, from a River that runs almost through the middle of the Countrey; So saith
<hi>Maginus,</hi> and relies upon <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Iustin</hi> for his Authors. Others give it rather to the <hi>Iberi,</hi> the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
people of <hi>Asia,</hi> thas came in under <hi>Panus</hi> from toward <hi>Syria,</hi> and possest it before the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
Her second name admits as much question: Some fetch it from <hi>Hesperus</hi> the brother of <hi>Atlas,</hi> and
their twelfth King from <hi>Tubal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

own sense, the truth may be questioned; For they have not such plenty of meat, as they have of sawce.</p>
                  <p>(7) It yields indeed abundance of Oranges, Lemmons, Capers, Dates, Sugar, Oyl, Honey, Licorish,
Horses. It hath been heretofore noted for rich Mines, insomuch that <hi>Hannibal</hi> received daily 3000
from one Mine in <hi>Spain.</hi> The number is not answerable in proportion to other Regions of <hi>Europe.</hi>
Their Cities not so great, nor so many. The reason may be, because indeed their Women are not so
fertile to multiply among themselves, and their usage of strangers so uncivil, that very few of other
Countries seat themselves there, as in <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> And yet they have of late times

they would seem to express in a kind of reserved state, and silent gravity, when perhaps their wit will

                  <p>(10) She hath been subject to many divisions, according to the humour of those that have been her
Lords. The first of note was made by the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Citeriorem,</hi> which lay nearest to their Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and <hi>Vlteriorem,</hi> which was all the extent, beyond the River <hi>Iberus ad fretum usque Herculeum.</hi>
The second was by them too, in <hi>Baeticum</hi> the whole tract beyond the River <hi>Ana</hi> South-ward. (2) <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitanium</hi>
Northward, toward the <hi>Cantabrick</hi> Ocean, and (3) <hi>Terraconensem</hi> Eastward, joyning upon
<hi>France.</hi> When the <hi>Moors</hi> enjoyed it, they rent it into twelve parcels, a multitude of petty royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<hi>Arragon, Catalonia, Valentia, Castile, Toledo, Biscay, Leon, Gallicea, Murcia, Navarre, Corduba,</hi> and
<hi>Portugal.</hi> And these yet retain the name of Kingdoms, but their government was long ago recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the hands of five, which bare the titles of <hi>Castile, Arragon, Granada, Navarre,</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi>
It was of latter times contracted into the three Kingdoms of <hi>Arragon, Castile,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> but is in
the power of one King, called the Catholick King of <hi>Spain.</hi> We stand to this last division as most
proper for our times, and best befitting my brief Discourse. Give me leave to add the Islands which
lie near to each Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>(11) The present state of <hi>Arragon</hi> comprehends three of those Kingdomes, as it was scattered by
the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Sarazens.</hi> (1) <hi>Arragon</hi> it self, which lieth on the South of <hi>Navarre,</hi> on the East of
<hi>Castile,</hi> on the North of <hi>Valentia,</hi> and the West of <hi>Catalonia.</hi> The ancient Inhabitants were the <hi>Iac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetani,

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:37437:258"/>
possest it after the <hi>Vandals</hi> had lost their hold. The Region is but barren; yet it hath in it many Cities,
the chief <hi>Terra cona,</hi> which gave name to the whole Province, called by the <hi>Romans, Terraconenses.</hi>
(3) <hi>Valentia,</hi> which on the East is touched with the <hi>Mediterraneum,</hi> on the North with <hi>Castile,</hi> on the
South with the Kingdom of <hi>Murcia.</hi> It is reported for the most pleasant and fruitful Region in all
<hi>Spain;</hi> it hath her name from her chief City, and as <hi>Maginus</hi> relates, admits as yet of 22 thousand Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of <hi>Moors.</hi> In this is the University where S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> Father of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> studied; and
the old <hi>Saguntum</hi> besieged by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> now <hi>Morvedre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(12) The state of <hi>Castile</hi> as now it stands, comprehends all the rest of those scattered Governments,
as were possest by the <hi>Moors, Portugal</hi> only excepted. And first <hi>Castile</hi> it self, both the old which
joyns with <hi>Arragon</hi> on the East of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the west of <hi>Navarre;</hi> and the new which toucheth
her upon the South. The first abounds not much with fruits, but yet it breeds many Cattel. The <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis</hi>
is <hi>Burgos,</hi> and the other chief are <hi>Salamanca,</hi> an University, and <hi>Valadolit,</hi> once the seat of the
Kings of <hi>Spain.</hi> Now <hi>Castile</hi> abounds more with Corn, is watered with the River <hi>Tagus</hi> and <hi>Ana:</hi>
And in this stands the Kings chief Cities, <hi>Madrid</hi> and <hi>Toledo,</hi> which was heretofore a propriatory of
it self. The rest that belong to <hi>Castile</hi> are 2. <hi>Toledo,</hi> however now but a City of new <hi>Castile,</hi> yet in the
division, her Territories spread themselves over a large compass. The City is in the midst of <hi>Spain.</hi>
It was the seat of the <hi>Gothish</hi> Kings, and successively of the <hi>Moorish</hi> Princes: now of the Arch-Bishops,
who exceed in Revenues any other Prelate in the world, except the <hi>Pope.</hi> Here hath sate eighteen
National Councils in the time of the <hi>Gothish</hi> Kings 3.</p>
                  <p>(13) <hi>Biscay,</hi> heretofore <hi>Cantabria,</hi> on the North of old <hi>Castile</hi> toward the Ocean, it was the last peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which yielded to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and after to the <hi>Moors.</hi> A Mountainous Countrey, but affords excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Timber for ships, and good Iron. Her Cities are S. <hi>Sebastian, Fonterabia,</hi> and <hi>Bilbao,</hi> which stands
but two miles from the Sea, and is noted for excellent Blades: some have been tried by the <hi>English</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their own Crests 4.</p>

Ocean, and on the South old <hi>Castile.</hi> The Region is reported to yield plenty of Gold, Vermili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
red Lead and other Colours, else she is barren, her inhabitants not many, and those live most upon
Hunting and Fishing. It is the title of the eldest Son of <hi>Castile,</hi> as <hi>Wales</hi> is to our Prince of <hi>England.</hi>
Her chief City is <hi>Oveido,</hi> which bears part with her in the name of a Kingdom; and indeed was the
Title of the first Christian King after the <hi>Moors</hi> Conquest.</p>
                  <p>(15) <hi>Gallicia,</hi> on the East joyns upon <hi>Leon,</hi> on the West it is bounded with the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean,
on the North with the <hi>Cantabrick,</hi> and on the South with the River <hi>Mingo.</hi> It breeds Iennets in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
insomuch that they have been Poetically feigned to be conceived by the wind. <hi>Niger</hi> writes,
that here hath been an incredible plenty of Gold, Lead, and Silver; that the Rivers are full of a mixt
earth, and that the Plough could scarce wag for clods of Golden Ore. There appears now no such
matter. The principal Cities are Saint <hi>Iago,</hi> where S. <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle lieth buried, his Reliques
kept, worshipped, and visited by Pilgrims. And the other of note especially with us, is <hi>Corugna,</hi> an
excellent Port for Ships, and mentioned oft in our wars with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by the name of the <hi>Groyne.</hi>
Here likewise is the Promontory <hi>Nerius,</hi> called by our Mariners <hi>Capo de finis terrae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(16) <hi>Murcia,</hi> on the North hath new <hi>Castile;</hi> on the South and East the <hi>Spanish</hi> Seas. It is not
much peopled, but yet is famous for several commodities, especially for pure earthen Vessels, and fine
Silk. Heretofore it enriched the <hi>Romans</hi> with a daily supply of 25000 Drachmae of silver. Her chief
places are <hi>Alicante,</hi> whence our <hi>Alicant</hi> Wines come; and new <hi>Carthage</hi> oft commended by our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
for her large and safe Haven; and lastly, <hi>Murcia,</hi> a Town which gives name to the whole
Region.</p>
                  <p>(17) <hi>Navarre</hi> lieth close to the <hi>Pirenaean</hi> Hills, and as <hi>Maginus</hi> gives it, is enclosed with Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
and so it is North and East: on the West it hath the River <hi>Ebro,</hi> and on the South <hi>Arragon.</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:37437:259"/>
The <hi>Vascones</hi> are said to have lived here, who afterward placed themselves in <hi>France,</hi> and kept there
their name to this day of <hi>Vascones,</hi> corruptly <hi>Gascoigns.</hi> The chief Towns are <hi>Bampelme,</hi> the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,
and <hi>Viana,</hi> the title of the <hi>Navarran</hi> Prince. <hi>Maginus</hi> sets the Revenue annual of this Kingdom
at 100000 Duckets.</p>
                  <p>(18) <hi>Corduba,</hi> now a City only, heretofore a Kingdom, and included <hi>Andaluzia, Granada,</hi> and
<hi>Estremadura;</hi> Equalized almost the whole Province which the <hi>Romans</hi> in their second division called
<hi>Baetica Andaluzia</hi> hath lost but one Letter of her name since she was possest by the <hi>Vandales.</hi> From
them she was first called <hi>Vandalicia:</hi> since <hi>Andalicia,</hi> corruptly <hi>Andaluzia.</hi> It lieth on the west of
<hi>Granada,</hi> and is a very fertile Countrey. In this Region is the chief City <hi>Corduba,</hi> whence we receive
our <hi>Cordavan</hi> Leather. The second of note is <hi>Sevil,</hi> the Metropolitan of <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> and the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Islands, esteemed the goodliest City in all <hi>Spain;</hi> and though (as <hi>Corduba.</hi> it was not honoured
with the Title of a Kingdom, yet it honoured a Kingdom with her Title, in the opinion of some, which
derive <hi>Hispania</hi> from her former appellation <hi>Hispalus.</hi> From this shoar they lanch forth toward the
<hi>Indies,</hi> and from hence they send their <hi>Sevil</hi> Oranges. The Arch-bishop of <hi>Sevil</hi> is second to <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi>
as well in Revenues as degree. Near to <hi>Andaluzia</hi> is the Island of <hi>Gades,</hi> by which the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
entred into <hi>Spain:</hi> Since it is called <hi>Cadis,</hi> and commonly <hi>Cales.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> have had
their turn in the possession of that Isle. Now again, fortune hath cast it upon the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> On the

                  <p>(19) <hi>Portugal</hi> is the third Kingdom in our last division of <hi>Spain,</hi> and it may well be esteemed one
of her largest Territories: for it runs along the <hi>Atlantick Ocean,</hi> from the borders of <hi>Gallicea,</hi> as
<hi>Andaluzia;</hi> on the North it is limited with the River <hi>Mingo,</hi> on the South with part of the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneum,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>(20) The Country affords not much Corn, but fruit reasonable store, and Mines of several me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,

                  <p>(6) About 60 years after, <hi>Aeneas</hi> arrived in this Countrey from the siege of <hi>Troy,</hi> was entertained
as an amorous suitor by <hi>Lavinia,</hi> with consent of her Father <hi>Latinus:</hi> and after the death of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
<hi>Turnus,</hi> King of the <hi>Rutilians,</hi> was setled heir to the <hi>Latin</hi> Monarchy after his Father.</p>
                  <p>(7) From <hi>Aeneas</hi> to <hi>Numitor</hi> the succession went on (not without some rubs) but suffered no great
breach for almost four hundred years: When the title should have fallen to him, being the elder and
true heir, he was spoiled of the Kingdom by his younger, <hi>Amulius Sylvius:</hi> nor could it be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
till time had given growth and strength to <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> his grand-children, by his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Rhea.</hi>

                  <p>(8) The birth and breeding of these two brothers is well known, we need not enlarge their story

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:37437:262"/>
of <hi>Vesta,</hi> by her Uncle <hi>Amulius Sylvus,</hi> that she might not bring forth an heir to endanger his Title.

                  <p>(9) When years, and their supposed father had taught them their pedegree, and the base tyranny
of their Uncle; they began with revenge upon him, for their mothers quick burial: for their own

                  <p>(10) Thus when they had once dealt in disposing of Empires, they could not easily return to the
Shepherds hook, but bethought them of the like fortune for their own advancement: and stirred
not far to make good their purpose, but in the very <hi>Mons Palatinus,</hi> the place where they suckt their
nurse, they drew together a monstrous head of debaucht Shepherds, and built the City, which is now
called <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Romulus;</hi> who in strife for the name, or (as some say) for a disdainful skip over
the new walls, slew his brother <hi>Rhemus,</hi> and was left the sole Founder and Commander of this rascal
crew, for so indeed it was, and held in that contempt by their borderers, that they could not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty
get wives from them, to continue their succession, till by a guile they had enticed the <hi>Sabines</hi>
to their Pastimes, ravisht their women, and afterward by degrees either made their peace, or wan it
with the sword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the people round about them.</p>
                  <p>(11) Thus began the Empire of <hi>Rome:</hi> and was governed at first by 7 Kings in a direct succession
to <hi>Tarquinius Superbus,</hi> who lost both himself and Kingdom, by his own pride, and his Son <hi>Sextus</hi>

again in another course; and for a while Dictators; which when <hi>Caesar</hi> had once clapsed, he soon made
to himself a power Imperial: and (though after five years it cost him his life, which he enchanged
with <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> for 23 wounds in the Senate-house; yet) the liberty of <hi>Rome</hi> was never so
fully recovered, but that soon after the Government fell upon <hi>Angustus,</hi> by the death of <hi>Anthony</hi> and

suspition. Little friendship with them but for advantage; and a man must beware that he venter not
farther upon those terms, than he may well step back, lest he be betrayed (perhaps forced) to a love
worse than their hate; for they are most unnatural in their lust. The Women when they have their
free liberty differ not much, but their close keeping either hinders, or at least hides their faults, so as
they appear modest, lovely, and witty, for as much as they dare speak.</p>

will not repeat her beginning: she was then but two miles in compass: but after she grew far, she
burnished to 50 miles about; upon the walls 740 Turrets, and the Inhabitants innumerable. For
those memorable actions which were performed in her under the Antique Empire, we will refer the
Reader to a particular Description, derived wholly to that purpose. As it is now, it stands somewhat
lower on the banks of <hi>Tiber,</hi> in the <hi>Campus Maetins:</hi> she retains yet 11 miles round, and 200000
Inhabitants, a great part Friars, and such odd idle fellows, which pretend to Religion, for want of
other means to live: cloyster themselves up to a single life, only to avoid the charge and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
of marriage, not to separate themselves from the world, or desires of the flesh: for among
them they maintain commonly 40000 Curtizans in good custome, and so rich, that they are able to
pay 30000 Duckets yearly to the Pope. The buildings in which they most glory in, are the Church
of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> the Castle of Saint <hi>Angelo,</hi> the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, and the Popes Palace. The truth is,
there is pride enough to attire the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as there can hardly be any other meant than

(little enough to keep him from the thought of tyranny) about 40000 Duckets by the year. The City

The younger brothers of the Gentry may not marry to increase the number beyond maintenance:

She hath her name from the chief City built by <hi>Ianus.</hi> It is in compass eight miles; and the houses
for two stories high are built with marble. The people noble minded, and forward to any honourable
action, be it in Wars by the Land, or hazzard by Sea. One <hi>Christopher Columbus</hi> is sufficient to make
good this Elogy, for whose birth she deserves to be honoured to the Worlds end. The women of

                  <p>IT is not without example of good authoriy, if I take into this Description, not only that part which
is now more peculiarly known by the name of <hi>Hungary:</hi> but the whole Country likewise of <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
which was once one with it, though time and fortune have at last severed them: so that each hath
now its own Princes, Laws, Customes, Language and Religion, different from other.</p>
                  <p>I the rather take to my self this leave, to avoid both the charge and trouble of ordering for every
one a several Table.</p>
                  <p>(2) First then the Kingdom of <hi>Hungaria</hi> is on the South-East of <hi>Germany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and joyns upon the
Dukedom of <hi>Austria.</hi> They heretofore divided betwixt them the Countrey of <hi>Pannonia. Austria</hi> was
the <hi>superior,</hi> and this the <hi>inferior Pannonia.</hi> The government and titles are now dis-joyned; and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi>
hath got the start in power; for she is the mother of many <hi>German</hi> Princes, and hath drawn
the crown Imperial almost into a succession.</p>
                  <p>(3) Yet is <hi>Hungary</hi> still an absolute Kingdom; and if not so rich and populous as heretofore, it
must not take from her honour, since her fortunes sunk not through want of valour, and fault of her
former Inhabitants; but we have been for a long time exposed to hazzard in the defence of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
against the mis-believing <hi>Turks:</hi> and for that it hath been by some stiled the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they held till they were displaced by the <hi>Lombards.</hi> These last were the <hi>Winnili,</hi> which lived in <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
or <hi>Scandinaria,</hi> a Northern <hi>Peninsula,</hi> betwixt the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Hyperborean</hi> Seas. Their seat it seems
was too barren for their number, and meer want of Victuals forced them to seek better sustenance
in some other quarter. They over-ran many Countries, e're they could find any one to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:
Among the rest the <hi>Parnonia</hi> had her course: and here they continued till they marched into
<hi>Italy,</hi> under the command of <hi>Alboinus,</hi> where, after 200 years, their Kingdom was ruined by <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(5) When it was thus left by <hi>Lombards,</hi> the <hi>Hunnes</hi> returned to their former seat: and after some
time of rest, grew up to a great Nation, able to encounter the <hi>Roman Macrinus,</hi> to break his forces, and

she yields Corn thrice in one year, almost without any tillage or care of the husbandman. Fruit of
all kinds in great abundance, and Grapes which make an excellent, wholsome, and rich Wine. It
breeds Cattel in such plenty, that this one Countrey, besides store for her own Inhabitants, sends Sheep
and Oxen into for eign Nations, which lye about her: and might (say they) suffice to feed all <hi>Europe</hi>
with flesh. Venison is not here any Dainty: Does, Hares, Goats, Boars, are every mans meat:

Pigeons, most Fowl, wild and tame.</p>
                  <p>(9) The earth is enricht with variety of Mines, which yields her plenty of Iron, Steel, Copper,

                  <head>The Description of the Kingdom of DENMARK.</head>
                  <p>THE Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> strikes into the Sea, upon the North of <hi>Germany,</hi> as <hi>Italy</hi> on the South:
the manner of both is not much unlike: and the glory of this heretofore was not inferior. For
however in these latter ages, the pride of <hi>Rome</hi> hath pranked up her Territories in gay apparel: yet
the day was, when both she and they stooped to the Inhabitants of this Country, though then
known by another name of <hi>Cimbria Chersonesus.</hi> Three <hi>Roman Consuls, Manilius, Sillanus,</hi> and <hi>Cepio</hi>
fell by their sword: and the Empire it self (it seems) was in a shrewd hazzard, when their own Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
reports that, <hi>Actum esset de imperio, nisi illi saecul. Marius contigisset.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2) The people were then and had been from their beginning the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> a Progeny of <hi>Gomer,</hi> first
son of <hi>Iapheth;</hi> who before they removed into this quarter of the world, dwelt in the inner <hi>Asia,</hi>
near the straight which passeth from the <hi>Pontus Euxinus,</hi> to the <hi>Polus Maeotis:</hi> there we yet find the
<hi>Bosphorus Cimmericus</hi> in <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> which took name from the <hi>Cimmerii,</hi> for so they were called at
large, and by contraction <hi>Cimbri.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3) From thence they were in time disturbed by the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and forced to seek them a new sea
for their habitation, which (after long travel) here they found fittest for their security, as being a <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>insula</hi>
fenced almost round with Seas, from the force of all foreign Enemies. Yet here too they met at
last with a worse danger, which they could less resist. For the main <hi>Ocean</hi> brake into a great part of the
Countrey, displaced many of their Colonies, and sent them Petitioners to <hi>Rome</hi> for a dwelling within
her Dominions: but their entreaty being with some neglect denied, it kindled the sparks, which to
this time had lain (as it were) dead in a dejected Nation, and <unclear>now</unclear> they break out into flames, which
stirred them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to require that by force of Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they could not request by submissive Oratory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:37437:273"/>(4) Hence grew their first quarrel with the <hi>Romans,</hi> which they put on with that courage and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
that they were emboldened at last to assault the very City, with so strong Forces, that the glory
of it began to shake, and had shattered to pieces, had not the victory followed rather the fortune of one
<hi>Marius,</hi> than the valour of the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Legions: and that too (as some relate it) was bought of
his heathenish gods at a dear rate, by the bloudy sacrifice of his own daughter. The great and most me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
encounter was six hundred and forty years after the City was built, about an hundred and
eleven before Christ. And then indeed they received (in a manner) a fatal crush, which quelled them
for the present: yet not so, but that in after ages, they recovered strength and same: spread their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
over the most part of <hi>Europe:</hi> and left their name (for many years since that) in <hi>Italy</hi> it self.</p>
                  <p>(5) For without doubt those <hi>Cimmerii</hi> mentioned by <hi>Starbo,</hi> which lived on the North side of the
<hi>Appennine</hi> Mountains near <hi>Boianum,</hi> were of this stock, and of that note, as they gave occasion for
many Proverbs and Fables to both Greek and Latin Poets. It was a people which belike seldom saw
Sun, but lurked for the most part under ground, lived upon theft, and issued forth only in the night,
a season most fit for deeds of darkness: and so was their whole course, which caused our well known
Adage of <hi>tenebrae Cimmeriae pro densissimâ caligine.</hi> The horrid dens, and dismal Rivers, which ran
by the place of their abode, bred at length a terrour in the silly Heathens, and was esteemed by
them, the passage down to their <hi>Elizium.</hi> So <hi>Homer</hi> gives it in the second of his <hi>Odysses,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi>
in his sixth of the <hi>Aeneidos:</hi> and here did <hi>Naso</hi> feign his house of sleep, <hi>Metamorph.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <l>Est propè <hi>Cimmerios</hi> longo spelunca recessu</l>
                  <l>Mons <hi>Carus,</hi> ignavi domus &amp; penetralia Somni.</l>
                  <p>(6) Thus was their Original and progress for the first Age, whilst it continued i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the possession
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:37437:273"/>
of the <hi>Cimmerians.</hi> The next which succeeded were the <hi>Saxons,</hi> a people no less famous; but since
their story hath been elsewhere remembred in our other Descriptions, it must give place here to the
third Invader the <hi>Danes,</hi> who whilst the <hi>Saxons</hi> were employed with us here in the Conquest of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
start out of those petty Isles in the <hi>Sinus Codanus,</hi> and took up their room in this <hi>Peninsula.</hi> There
they have continued to this day; and added other Territories to their Dominions: so that the then
<hi>Cimbria Chersonesus</hi> is but a parcel of the now Kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi> (as shall appear when we come
to her division) and that only which in our latter times is called <hi>Iuitland,</hi> and runs North ward in
form almost of a Hounds tongue into the <hi>Baltick Ocean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(7) The <hi>Danes</hi> (like enough) were at first one Nation with the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> but being together expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the <hi>Scythians</hi> from their native soyl, they were severally dispersed, though not at any great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
These setled themselves in the Northern Isles, as the other did in their <hi>Chersonesus.</hi> The first
(at their removal) varied not their antique name of <hi>Cimbri:</hi> As for <hi>Chersonesus</hi> it is not peculiar to this
Country, being as common as <hi>Peninsula:</hi> for it imports no more than <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>terrâ &amp; insulâ:</hi> and of these there are many more, some perhaps of equal same. <hi>Taurica Chersonesus</hi> was
not far distant from the place of their first abode; <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> well known in <hi>Greece, Thracia, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonesus</hi>
in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Aurea Chersonesus</hi> in <hi>India.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(8) But the <hi>Danes</hi> it seems suffered some change as well in their name as fortunes. <hi>Saxo
Grammticus</hi> gives it to one <hi>Dan</hi> the son of <hi>Huniblus,</hi> which was their first Governour in
their new Commonwealth. But this is controuled by <hi>Reccanus</hi> (saith <hi>Quade</hi>) who renders
another <hi>Etymon,</hi> how likely, I leave to those, who can best judge by their skill in the <hi>Danish</hi>
Language. The <hi>Cimbri</hi> (saith he) when they were grown to great multitudes, bethought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of several names to distinguish their Colonies: Each following their own concei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> best
to express the quality, in which they most gloried. Among the rest, some there were
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:37437:274"/>
which affecting at least the opinion of a valiant people, such as scorned riches without honour, honour
without victory, and victory without the bloud of their enemies; assumed their name from that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which Nature had marked out with this Character, <hi>Gallum igitur gallinaceum, tum bellicae laudis,

good the Elogy of a valiant and warlike Nation; strong of body, big boned, and of a terrible counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
ambitious of a glorious death, rather than a sluggish idle life. It is the saying of <hi>Valerius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,

plenty, as well of Whet, Rie, and Barley, as Beeves and other Cattel, which gives supply to <hi>Saxony,</hi> and
the rest of <hi>Germany</hi> near hand, which hardly yield enough for their Inhabitants out of their own
store. The blessing of this fertility cannot come alone; but must needs bring with it the like riches
of butter, Cheese, Milk, Wax, Honey, and whatever else hath its birth from the ground. It is well nigh
past belief which is reported of the multitude of Bees, such as yield more Honey and Wax, than the
people can find room for: They need here neither Art, nor care of the good Huswife to order their
Hives, but naturally are their own Guardians, and provide so diligently for their own safety within
the bulks of trees, that they easily pass over the hardest winter without hurt. There is store of game,
both for hunting, fowling, and fishing. In her Forests is seen a kind of wild Horse with an horn like
an Harts, and the Alces, &amp;c. Lastly, among other good commodities, the worst is not her Pitch and
Rosin, which yield her a large annual revenue.</p>

for the most part with Woods: very cold, and by that means she hath little Oyl, and scarce Grapes
enough to teach them the use of Wine. A great defect among so good drinkers; for they have a

walk in our open streets in the dusk of Evening. Questionless, this special practise of honesty in that
kind, above other Nations, proceeds from an inbred desire which they generally have to be in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment:
for they are very industrious in their several faculties. Those which pretend to Learning,
addict themselves much to the study of Languages. The Latine is familiar to the Gentry as their own:
(and as <hi>Maginus</hi> reports) is used in some Towns by rich and poor as their proper speech. They are
prodigal both in diet and apparel, give much entertainment, and keep a large retinue of servants.
In brief, they are as equal to themselves, as they are courteous to others; For they will not be oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the greatest Potenate either home bred or foreign. They are very vallant, and meet their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
with an undaunted courage, be they never so much over-born either by number or strength. The
truth is, no Peasant is suffered to bear arms: only their Nobility and Gentry of place in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth: such as war, not for others only, and upon constraint, but have somewhat themselves
to lose: and therefore are ready as well for their own safety, as defence of their King and Country,
to set on upon all assays, and raise an incredible number of excellent Horse, well manned almost, in
an instant: For they are kept in continual motion by the <hi>Muscovite.</hi>

therefore they will try all. Christians they have been ever since the year 965. but from that time, they
have scarce slipt any error, schisme, or heresie, which hath crept into the Church. Here are <hi>Iesuites,</hi>
and others of the Romish Sects; Here are <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and <hi>Arrians,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and
<hi>Anti-trinitarians;</hi> none allowed, but all tollerated: and indeed <hi>Poland</hi> had the seniority of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi>
for that old saying, That if a man had lost his Religion, here he might find it. They have one ancient
custome in their Churches, which, methinks may well interpret our standing up at rehearsal of the
Creed; when the Gospel is reading, the Nobility and Gentry unsheath their Swords, and stand as it
were prepared to defend it with their lives against any which dare violate it.</p>
                  <p>(11) Their King is chosen by the general States, and is for the most part some great Warriour of
their neighbouring Princes: For they have no peace on their East limit, with <hi>Muscovites</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi>
but what they make with the Sword. The Laws are only temporary Statutes, there are none funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental:
But when the King hath any great design in behalf of the Common wealth, he assembles a
Councel of the Nobility to assist him. His Revenues coming in, are thought to be about six hundred
thousand Crowns: and each quarter of his Kingdom maintains his expence for one quarter of the
year. Their first King was <hi>Boeslaus,</hi> crowned by <hi>Otho</hi> 3. in the year 1001. But the Regal dignity was
lost again to <hi>Boleslaus</hi> the Bold, who began his Reign 1078. but was deposed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and no
other suffered to take up the Scepter and rule by the name of King, till the year 1295. The first of

himself and built the City <hi>Guesna,</hi> which was the Regal seat till it was translated to <hi>Cracovia</hi> in the

                  <head>The Description of the Kingdom of PERSIA.</head>
                  <p>THis Empire was one of the first, and most potent in the Eastern world; and though since in
several ages, she hath felt the variety of fortunes, to which all Kingdomes are subject, and
been forced to deliver up her glory to the succeeding Monarchies of the <hi>Macedonians, Parthians,
Turks,</hi> and <hi>Sarazens;</hi> yet now at last is she recovered to her own heighth and greatness, and
the name of <hi>Persia</hi> reacheth farther than ever, if we take in, (as most Geographers do) the
Regions of <hi>Media, Assyria,</hi> and the rest; which were heretofore the seat of several illustrious
Kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>(2) Surely the first which inhabited any part of this compass, were the <hi>Medes,</hi> a people of great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
who reach both their original and name from <hi>Madai,</hi> the son of <hi>Iapheth:</hi> for it was not long
after the floud; that they were subdued by <hi>Ninus</hi> King of the <hi>Assyrians:</hi> one and t'other, <hi>Media</hi> I mean
and <hi>Assyria,</hi> though then they had apart their peculiar governments, yet both were but a parcel of this
Countrey, which is now known by the name of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3) To <hi>Ninus</hi> and his successors they continued faithful for many years, till the effeminate weakness
of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> gave opportunity to the ambition of <hi>Belochus</hi> governour of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Arbaces</hi> of
<hi>Media,</hi> to divide his Empire betwixt them, which they did in the year of the world three thousand
one hundred forty six; and then began the Monarchy of the <hi>Medes,</hi> which spread it self through the
the greatest part of <hi>Asia;</hi> and (for above two hundred years) gathered strength, till the time of <hi>Astia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
who dreamed himself out of his Empire, as <hi>Iustine</hi> relates the story.</p>
                  <p>(4) <hi>Persia propriè dicta,</hi> from whence this whole Country at last took name, was at this time but
an obscure Kingdom in respect of what now it is, and tributary to the <hi>Medes.</hi> Her Prince was <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byses,</hi>
the Father of the great <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by <hi>Mandanes</hi> daughter to <hi>Astiages;</hi> when she was great, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:37437:283"/>
the time of her deliverance, her Father touched with a perplexed dream, that she made so much
water as would drown all <hi>Asia,</hi> interpreted it, that her issue should be the overthrow of his state;
and therefore delivered the child which was born to her, into <hi>Harpagus</hi> his charge to be destroyed,
and he to the Kings Herdsman, who (unawares to Both) preserved the guiltless infant, so that at
last he took revenge upon his cruel Grand-father, and laid a foundation for the <hi>Persian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>
                  <p>(5) In this attempt his anger wrought him no farther than his enemy: for he left the government
of <hi>Media</hi> still to <hi>Cyaxares</hi> the son of <hi>Astyages,</hi> and afterward married his daughter, joyned with him
in his conquests, and till his death gave him preheminence of title. They were both engaged in
the taking of <hi>Babylon,</hi> slaughter of <hi>Baltazar,</hi> and destruction of the <hi>Chald<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ans:</hi> The Scripture gives
this victory to <hi>Darius Medus,</hi> who, as most hold, was no other than <hi>Cyaxares:</hi> and he only named as
the principal of the two while he yet lived, though <hi>Cyrus</hi> had his part in the action, after his Uncles
death enjoyed it as his own, and made perfect the Monarchy of the <hi>Persians</hi> in the year of the
world 3046.</p>
                  <p>(6) About thrity seven years after, the succession was broke for want of lawful heirs, to <hi>Cambyses</hi> their
second King; and therefore their Princes consulted to salute him, whose Horse first neighed at a set
meeting upon the Court green, before the Sun-rising. <hi>Darius Histaspes</hi> was one, and by the subtiliy
of his Horse-keeper carried the Crown; for the night before, in the same ground, he had coupled a
Mare with the Horse that his Master should ride, which when the lustful Steed missed the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
being full of spirit, no sooner had he set footing upon the place, but with much eagerness he snuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
and neighed after his Mare, and gave the quue to the other Princes to proclaim <hi>Darius</hi> King of
the Persians. This was he whom the Scripture calls <hi>Ahasuerus:</hi> he was <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:37437:283"/>
made war upon <hi>Greece,</hi> with an incredible Army, joyned Asia to Europe with a bridge, and dammed
up <hi>Hellespont</hi> with his Navy; yet was at last vanquished by four thousand at <hi>Thermopyle,</hi> and after by
Themistocles forced to make his flight in a small boat towards his own Countrey, contemned of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and within a few years slain in his Palace by <hi>Artabanus.</hi> His immediate successour was <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes
Lengimanus,</hi> who. sent the Prophet <hi>Esdras</hi> to re-edifie the Temple, and so on to <hi>Darius</hi> the last
<hi>Persian</hi> of. that course, who was ost vanquished by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and left the Monarchy of the
world to the <hi>Macedonians:</hi> After the death of their victorious Captain, it was divided among many
of the most potent Princes of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(8) But when the <hi>Persians</hi> saw the force of their enemy thus severed, they began to conceive a
hope of recovering their liberty; and so they did indeed under the conduct and command of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian
Arsaces,</hi> but. found themselves little bettered in their condition, as being now become new slaves
to a more harsh tyrant; and therefore in the year two hundred twenty eight after the Incarnation,
they made a second attempt to quit themselves from the <hi>Parthians;</hi> they took their time, when
their Masters were sore afficted with a strong enemy from <hi>Rome,</hi> which had broke their Forces to
their hands; so that by the admirable prowess of another <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> they made good their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
upon the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and adventured so far with the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves, that their name began
to grow terrible, and the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> forced to fortifie his Provinces, which lay towards
the East; and his might be some cause too, why he removed his seat to <hi>Constantinopolis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(9) After this fell into the hands of the Saracenical Caliphs, in the year six hundred thirty four,
and to the <hi>Turks</hi> in the year one hundred and thirty, next to the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and so again to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
by the help of <hi>Gempsas,</hi> who redeemed both his own and this from the <hi>Tartarian;</hi> and

qualities of her several Regions: In some places there is that fertility, which makes her equal to any

as being not able to nourish an Inhabitant. <hi>Ora maritima</hi> (saith <hi>Quadus) aestuosa est ac ventosa, &amp; fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuum inops, praeterquam palmarum, mediterranea regio Campestris est &amp; omnium ferax, pecorumque opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma nutrix,

                  <p>(12) The ancient <hi>Persians</hi> were warlike, and ambitious of rule; for not content with their own,
which they freely posses in <hi>Asia,</hi> they attempted the nearest parts of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> which cost
them the first fall from their Monarchy. <hi>Nec enim petituri Macedones Persidem vide bantur, in priores Persae
Graeciam provocassent,</hi> faith <hi>Vadianus.</hi> Their customes are most of them superstitious, but they held
nothing almost in so great reverence as water: it might not lawfully be soyled, so much as with a
soul hand; but to piss, or cast rubbish, or a dead carcass into the Rivers, was a kind of Sacriledge.
They had many Wives, and more Concubines: for they were exceeding desirous of increase, and
great rewards were appointed by their King himself, for him that could most augment the number of
his subjects in one year. They seldome entred into any consultation of State, till they had well arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves with drink; for then they thought they should be more free to speak what they most
thought. To spit, or laugh before their Prince, was a crime well nigh unpardonable: some say that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:37437:284"/>
they bury not their dead, but cast them forth to be devoured by wild beasts, and thought him most
happy which was soonest torn to mammock; the rest their friends bewailed, as such who had lived
impurely; and were therefore by this sign declared worthy of hell only, without any redemption.</p>
                  <p>(13) Their Philosophers were called <hi>Magi,</hi> and studied principally the art of fore-telling things to

excellent Warriour, sgreat Scholars, especially in Astrology, Physick and Poetry. Those which apply
themselves to Mechanick trades, are not inferiour to any almost in our quarter; they deal most in
making of Silks, which they send into all the Eastern Countries in great abundance. They are mild
and courteous to Strangers, yet jealous of their Wives, which for the most part are very fair and richly
attired; not withstanding their affection to them <hi>usque ad insanam Zelotypiam;</hi> yet are they much

turned the Victory to their own advantage: for when they had once tryed their strength, and found
their Forces sufficient in behalf of others, they bethought themselves at last, to use them for their own
advancement; and to that purpose, turned head first upon their pay masters, out of whose spoils they
raised incredible Armies, which over-spread all <hi>Asia,</hi> to the very <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea. Others again conjecture,
that they were a <hi>Scythian</hi> people; and the rather, for that they made their way into these parts
through <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and so on, as it were in a direct course from <hi>Scythia.</hi> The truth is,
the customs of both are not much unlike, their habit very near, and their wars waged with the same
weapons and discipline.</p>

world, and suffered him not to rest in it, till he had seated himself in an Empire, which his progeny
enjoy to this day. He began with a rascal crew of such as were led on by want, and seemed rather to
bear Arms in defence of their privy thests, than with intent to invade an enemy: for he appeared
not at first as an open Warriour, but wrought his spoils by stratagems and sleights, and clandestine
excursions, upon such as were unprovided for resistance; possest himself of mountains and woods, as
lay most convenient for his lurking practises, and whither he might retire safe, if at any time he
were pursued.</p>
                  <p>(4) By these means he was content for a while, to encrease his wealth and power, which soon grew
to that eminency, as in few years he durst meet a strong enemy to the face; buckle with him upon
his own ground, for his possessions, and at last so prevailed where ever he set footing, that he scarce
stept back till he claspt into his own government, <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia, Galathia</hi> and <hi>Bythinia, Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philia</hi>

Common-wealth are almost innun erable, many of them not natives, but apostate Christians, and in
conditions, differ as the Countries from whence they first sprang.</p>
                  <p>(7) The multitude, I mean the born <hi>Turks,</hi> savour still of their barbarous Ancestors, and carry
the marks in their fore-heads, and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

strong-boned, well-proportioned, dull and heavy-headed, of gross understanding, idely dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:37437:288"/>
and yet greedy of wealth, luxurious in their diet, and beastly in their lustful affections, without
distinction of kindred or sex, base minded, slaves to themselves and their superiours in their own
Country; yet ignorantly proud, and contemptuous of other Nations, which they take in soul scorn,
should be compared with their lubberly Inhabitant. They pass not to couzen a Christian in their course
of traffique; nor do they think they are bound to keep promise unless it make for their advantage.
The greatest part they have by due desert, is their strict obedience to the discipline of war: no sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no tumult, no chat in their Camp or March, insomuch that oft-times many thousands on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
surprize their enemies unawares, with so very little noise, as not to be heard in their approach.
No difficulty can be demanded, which they are not ready to perform, without any respect at all had
to the danger; be it to pass Rivers, top Mountains, scale Walls, stand Centinel: In brief, they are not
to eat or sleep in War, but at full leisure; and are the truest military men upon earth.</p>
                  <p>(8) No great marvel then, if with so great multitudes, so well ordered, they daily improve their
Empire upon the Christians, who are not so zealous in defence of their true faith as these mis belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
bold and fool-hardy to uphold their false god. But the truth is, their superstitious credulity of
fate, which they think hath immutably prefixed every mans hour for life or death, which he can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and his Mother a faithless <hi>Iew.</hi> Betwixt them they sent into the world a pernicious deceiver
(which none but two such Religions could have made up) in the year five hundred ninety seven.
When he had been for a while thus instructed by his distracted Parents, poverty, and hope to improve
his Fortunes, perswaded him from his Native soyl, to live for another while among true professed
Christians, where he received so much knowledge of the world, and light of the Gospel, as to pervert
it to his destruction, and ruin of many millions of souls.</p>
                  <p>(11) In his first adventurous travels abroad, he fell into the hands of theevish <hi>Sarazens,</hi> which sold
him to a <hi>Iewish</hi> Merchant; and he employed him to drive his Camels through <hi>Egypt, Syria, Palestine,</hi>
and other Forein Countries, where he still gathered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arther instructions of that truth which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to abuse. His wickedness first brake forth into fraud, open theft, and rapine, and other sins
of highest rank; in which he continued and seduced others, till the death of his Master, and after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
his aged, but rich mistress.</p>
                  <p>(12) He had means now to act his malicious purposes, and wealth to countenance his exceeding
pride, which would not be satisfied with any lower ambition than to be called a Prophet of God.
This he began to practise, by the counsel of one <hi>Sergius</hi> a Monk, who being cast out for Heresie from
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> betook himself into <hi>Arabia,</hi> and joyned in with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to make up this mischief per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
see now their juggling. There wanted not craft betwixt them, to make use of his worst actions
to gull the simple: For when by his debaucht drinking and gluttony, he was fallen into an Epilepsie,
and in his fits lay Bear-like groveling, and foaming upon the earth, as one without sense, he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
an extatick swound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein his soul was rapped from his body, whilst he converst with <hi>Gabriel,</hi>
an Angel from Heaven. To make this familiarity with God the more to be believed, he had bred up
a Dove to take her meat from his ear, which he most blasphemously professed to be the holy Ghost,
which at such times, and in that shape, infused the Prophecies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he was to preach. Lastly, what they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:37437:289"/>
in their wicked fancies had conceived, and meant to propagate, they digested into a Volume, and
called it the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(13) For this too they had a trick, that it might seem to have been sent from heaven into the hands
of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and to this purpose he had himself fed up a tame Bull, which by custome became so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar,
that no sooner he heard the voice of his Master, but he would straight run, cast the head in
his lap, and use his wanton dalliance as with a fellow. Betwixt the horns of this Bull had he fastned
the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and conveyed him into a by-place, near where he had assembled the multitude at a set
time, to expect a wonderful miracle from Heaven, that might confirm his Prophecy. The sce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e thus
ordered, on the sudden he lift up his voice, and made a loud cry, which no sooner the Beast heard,
but he brake his way through the prease, overturned many of the spectators, which now stood at a
gaze, and gently laid his Horns and Book in the bosome of this false Couzener; which he with much
ceremony and feigned reverence received, and in their presence opening the Volume, began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
the chief of their Laws, which for hereafter they were to observe.</p>
                  <p>(14) Circumcision he allowed, and with the old Law, forbad Swines flesh, that he might with more
ease lead on such as were <hi>Iewish;</hi> he suffered himself to be baptized by <hi>Sergius,</hi> that the Christian too
might have in some measure his content. <hi>Moses</hi> and our Saviour he denied not to be great Prophets; but
that neither party might emulate the greater observance of other; and indeed, especially that his own
might seem new, and yet take place from both, he changed the Circumcision of the <hi>Iews</hi> from the eight
day, and multiplies Baptisme, which can be conferred but once for all, upon the true believer. For
the like reason of difference with other Nations and Sects, he left both the <hi>Iews</hi> Sabbath, and
<hi>Diem Christianorum Dominicum,</hi> and commands his holy ceremonies to be celebrated on the Friday,
for so it was, when the Bull bestowed on him his <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Before they enter the Temple, they
wash all the unclean parts of their bodies, and then to Prayer, which must be performed five times
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:37437:290"/>
in a day, with their face toward the South. They have a moneths fast too once every year, but it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

observed only for the day; for they may, when the Sun is down, redeem it with what gluttony they
please: Wine is forbidden, only for a shew, that he might not seem to have loved that, which (as he
was guilty to himself) had brought him into his epileptical fits. Briefly, what he knew would best
agree with the bruitish desires of the people, that he took order should be confirmed by his laws; four
or five wives to every husband, and as many Concubines as they would maintain. For their bliss after
life, he proposed no invisible delights which over-reacht their understanding, but proportioned to
each of their sensual thoughts, and promised to those which could keep his Law a Paradise of all
kinds of pleasure, which they themselves most affected. To the covetous, wealth; to the ambitious,
honours; to the gluttonous, meats; to the Virgins, rich attire, and embraces of Angels; the poor souls
were never so fitted: and when he had thus for a long time, discoursed over his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> he took a
yoke from <hi>Sergius,</hi> and put it upon the Bulls neck; for it was foretold by an inscription brought by
his door, that whosoever could yoak the Bull, it should be a sign to declare the man, as one sent from
God to govern his people.</p>
                  <p>(15) This huddle of miracles put the gazers beyond all pause, so that in an instant they cryed him
up King, and held his companion in reputation of a minor Prophet; called themselves <hi>Musulmanni,</hi>
true believers, which the <hi>Turk</hi> still affects, rather than his right name of <hi>Turk,</hi> which imports banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and upbraids him with the disgrace of his original.</p>
                  <p>(16) And now he hath past the difficulty of his attempt, an easie matter to draw on millions of
followers, such as would like that Religion best which baulkt not their pleasures; yet at last he met
with an end answerable to his beginning; for he was poysoned by some of his own Family.</p>
                  <p>(17) He had long before prophesied, that he should be wonderfully conveyed to Heaven: and to
make good this fraud, had framed an iron chest for his Sepulchre, which he purposed should have been

held up by force of a Load-stone, placed in the top of the Temple, and by this means have appeared
to the beholder to hang in the air without any support: But this trick (it seems) was prevented by
death; yet they expected still his ascent to Heaven, till he stank upon earth: so that at last they were
forced to convey him into his iron coffin, which remains to this day in <hi>Mecha</hi> a City of <hi>

to do themselves what honour they might, though ignorance of the main truth makes them oft times
to trespass upon Chronology, and forge stories so unlikely, that the whole may be justly suspected.</p>
                  <p>(4) Their first King they name <hi>Vitei,</hi> and report him to have reigned an hundred years: his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors

for a while, cut off by the <hi>Tartarians.</hi> This change was fore-told to <hi>Fairfar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

first to dazle them with a strange Prophecy, and then to keep up the credit in the performance, with
the simple Idolaters. After nine <hi>Tartarian</hi> Princes it was again recovered to the state, in which it

many ages untoucht, and break abruptly, into our own times and stories, which do afford us more
certainty by the relation of later travellers, some of our own Nation.</p>

amounts to the yearly value of 18000 Crowns. To this happiness of soyl may be added the thrift
and great industry of the Inhabitants, who hold it a soul disgrace to be accounted idle: and therefore
make the most of what they have; so that without doubt, as they are infinitely populous, so they
are proportionably rich, beyond any other Nation of the world.</p>
                  <p>(18) The <hi>Chinoyse</hi> is described with a broad face of a dusky colour, crooked nose, small and black
eyes, and very thin beard, but long hair on the head: if any be deformed (for so they take it) with a
better feature, they are as like to break a jest upon his handsome comely visage, as a scoffer would upon
their ill-fashioned countenance. The better sort are clothed in long silk garments, the ordinary peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:37437:293"/>
in linnen, for they have not yet the Art well to weave woollen: their women deck their heads
with gold and precious Iewels, seldome shew themselves abroad without great attendance of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
                  <p>(9) The men in their several employments, are infinitely laborious and ingenious; it is very rare
to see any of them in a strange Country: nor will they easily admit a Stranger far into theirs, unless he
be first well tried for his honesty and good meaning toward their State; they are addicted much to
manual arts, for they have excellent practick wits; and indeed, for that go beyond any other Nations.
Much quarrel hath been about the invention of Guns and Printing, which several people have been
ambitious to take to themselves, as the master-piece of mans wit: but without doubt, they were both
used here, long before any of <hi>Europe</hi> pretended to the knowledge of either. In their writings, they
make not their lines from the right hand to the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we do; but from the top to the bottom of the Page: and use all one Character through the whole
Kingdom, though several parts differ much in their language, or at least in their idiomes. Their special
skill, which we much admire, but cannot imitate, is in making the Purslain dishes white as very snow,
and transparent as glass, formed up only of Cockles found in the Sea-shore mixt with Egg-shells; but
lie buried in the earth many years before they come to perfection, and are seldome took up by the
same artificer which kneads them, but are left as a portion to some of his posterity.</p>
                  <p>(10) Their fashions in private Houses are not much unlike to those of <hi>Europe:</hi> at board they sit in
chairs, and upon forms, not loll on the floor, as most of the <hi>Asiaticks</hi> do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they touch not their
meat with the Hand, but use the Silver fork, or else some stick of Ivory or Ebony, not much unlike
it: they eat thrice in one day, but sparingly enough: when they travel over the plains, they use a
kind of Coach, yet not drawn with Horses or other beast, but driven by the wind under sayl, as a
Bark on the Sea, which the people are as perfect to guide which way they please, as the Mariner is to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:37437:293"/>
direct his course unto any coast, whither he is bound: as they sail upon Land, as if it were Sea, so
they dwell as frequently upon the Sea, as if it were land: for they have an incredible number of ships,
and boats, which are in many places ranked like streets upon the waters, and filled with Inhabitants,
such as are here born, live, traffique, marry, and die. Mr. <hi>Purchas</hi> reports, that upon one River from
<hi>Nanquin</hi> to <hi>Paquin,</hi> they are thus ordered for 300 leagues. No marvel then, if their number exceed
any part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>roportionably of the whole earth; since their Land is not sufficient, but is forced to borrow
room out of the Sea for their Habitation: yet are they all governed by one Monarch, whom they
call the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d of the World, son to the Sun. For they are a proud Nation, and admit not equal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
with any other earthlings; but cast it as a Proverb into their teeth, that they have but one
eye to see with, in respect of the <hi>Chinoys,</hi> who alone (as themselves boast) see with two: the truth is,
in matters of State, they are very politick, in peace wary, and in war valiant, crafty, and excellent
Engineers.</p>
                  <p>(11) Their Laws are for the most part just, and severely executed, especially against idle droans,
which set not a hand to advance their State, or maintain themselves. They will not cherish the very
blind by alms, since without eyes a man may be fit for some corporal imployment; but to the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and lame they deny not a charitable mainten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so that no pretence almost is left for wanderers: and briefly, as far as humane Laws can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,
all other vain occasions, for mis-expence of time, are taken off; for within the Cities no Stews
are allowed, or lewd persons to withdraw them; adultery is punished with death, but yet they have
liberty to take many wives; one they keep at home, the rest are disposed of abroad, where they best
please. Their Marriages they chiefly solemnize at the new Moon, and for the most part in <hi>March.</hi>
which begins their year.</p>
                  <p>(12) For their Religion they are <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but have a confused knowledge of God, Heaven, and the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:37437:294"/>
Creation, which they ascribe to one <hi>Trine,</hi> who first (say they) made <hi>Pauson</hi> and <hi>Pausona,</hi> and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
continued for 90000 years; but were then for their wickedness destroyed, and a new race was
created. The first of their second was one <hi>Lutitzan,</hi> who had two horns; from the right come men,
as they fondly imagine, and from the left women; when they would descipher their great god, they
express him by the first letter of their Alphabet; and in their devotions they worship him as their
chief, (but not only) preserver; for they have their prayers to the Sun, Moon Stars, and to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
himself, that he would not hurt them. Their Priests are distinguisht into the black and white Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,
as we call them; for they much resemble Friars in their course of life; some are clothed in white,
their heads shorn, and their victuals in common; others in black, long hair, and live apart: neither
are married, but both take their liberty to live obscenely, as the debauchedst swaggerers.</p>
                  <p>(13) The Empire is divided into 15 Provinces. <hi>(1) Canton. (2) Feguien. (3) Olam. (4) Sisnam.
(5) Tolench. (6) Causaie. (7) Minchien. (8) Ochiam. (9) Horan. (10) Pagino. (11) Zaiton. (12) Quinchien.
(13) Cheguem. (14) Susnam. (15) Quinsay.</hi> All of large extent, and contain in them many Towns and
Cities, in number more, in compass bigger, and in wealth more eminent than the best of ours.</p>
                  <p>(14) (1) In the Province of <hi>Canton</hi> are 190 Towns, and 37 Cities. (2) In <hi>Feguien,</hi> 99 Towns, and
33 Cities. (3) In <hi>Olam</hi> 130 Towns, and 90 Cities. (4) In <hi>Sisnam,</hi> 150 Towns, and 44 Cities. (5) In
<hi>Tolench</hi> 235 Towns, and 51 Cities; and this is governed immediate by the Emperour himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any substitute, as all other Provinces have, except <hi>Pagina.</hi> (6) <hi>Causaie</hi> hath 122 Towns, 24 Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
(7) <hi>Minchien</hi> 29 Towns, 25 Cities. (8) <hi>Ochiam</hi> 74 Towns, 19 Cities. (9) <hi>Honan,</hi> 102 Towns,
and 20 Cities. (10) <hi>Pagina,</hi> 150 Towns, and 47 Cities.</p>
                  <p>(13) The chief of this is <hi>Paquin,</hi> where he hath his continual residence, and scarce at any time
leaves the City, unless upon occasion of war; for it is seated near to the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who oft-times
make assaults upon the <hi>Chinoyse,</hi> and force the King to gather his strength into that quarter; and he
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:37437:294"/>
himself present to withstand their entry: lest if they should once get footing into any part of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
they might encroach farther, and enable themselves by his spoils to follow their blow upon his
other Provinces. His Palace here is compassed with a triple wall, carries the bulk and face of a fair
Town; for indeed his retinue are no fewer than might well people a large City: among the rest he
hath 16000 <hi>Eunuchs</hi> daily attending, such as their own parents have emasculated in their infancy, to
make them capable of this Court preferment. The seat Imperial was heretofore at <hi>Nanquim,</hi> where
still remains a golden testimony of her past glory. It is a fair City thirty miles in compass, seated
nine leagues from the Sea, upon a fair and navigable a River, where there rides commonly at least 10000
of the Kings Ships, besides Merchants. It hath three brick walls, the streets are six miles in length, of
a proportionable breadth, and trimly paved.</p>
                  <p>(16) (11) <hi>Zaiton</hi> hath 78 Towns, and 27 Cities; the chief <hi>Zaiton,</hi> which hath a fair harbour, and is
seldome without 500 ships. (12) <hi>Quinchien</hi> hath 113 Towns, and 45 Cities. (13) <hi>Chaguean,</hi> 95
Towns, and 39 Cities. (14) <hi>Susnam,</hi> 105 Towns, and 41 Cities. (15) And lastly, <hi>Quinsey</hi> 114
Towns, Cities.</p>
                  <p>(17) The Metropolis is <hi>Quinsay</hi> or <hi>Suntien,</hi> the largest City of the world: for it contains 100
miles in compass: it is seated in a low and Fenny ground, is subject to Flouds, and hath been forced
in very many places to erect bridges for free passage from one street to another: there are in all
12000, built of stone, and most of them so high, that a good ship may strike under them with full
sayl: each of them hath its ten watchmen for a night guard. The inhabitants of this City live luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously,
especially their women, who are much more comely than their men; yet all of them almost
eat both Horse and Dogs flesh. Towards the South part of the City there is a great lake about 24
miles in circuit; in the midst stand two Islands, whither the chief Nobility repair a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

friends to solemnize their marriage, and have in each a stately place erected, furnished sufficiently
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:37437:295"/>
with all fitting ornaments for a wedding jollity. In many parts of the City there are publick places
of receit for such as sustain any misfortune by fire; there they may lodge their goods safe upon a
sudden casualty till they can make better provision.</p>
                  <p>(18) It were vain to give a more particular Description of the many Cities which make up the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
numbers in each Province: they stand so thick, and are so populous, that they all seem to be as
one; one, as well for their continued building almost, as their fashion of building; for they all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the same form, and dispose their streets alike; two broad, cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ing each other in the middle in
so strait a line, that the eye may reach clean from one end to the other.</p>
                  <p>(19) We may conclude, that both the Revenues of the whole Empire, and number of Inhabitants,
are not easily to be reckoned: yet this in brief, he hath subject under him 70 crowned Kings, gathers
up yearly 120 millions of Crowns, stirs not into the field without 300000 Foot, and 200000 Horse.
To this Empire did once belong most of the Islands in the Eastern Seas, but it seems the <hi>Chinoyse</hi> in
time found, that their defence was a business of more charge than their worth countervailed: and
therefore let them even slip into their own hands, and bounded their government with the Sea-coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of sex, unless in this, that their women were most warlike: witness that incomparable story of
<hi>Tomyris,</hi> who cut off the <hi>Persian Cyrus,</hi> and 200000 more of his Souldiers at one encounter, and cast
his head into a cauldron of bloud, with this upbraid, for the slaughter of her son <hi>Pergapises: Satia te

<hi>Salmanassar.</hi> How likely the Reasons are I will not dispute. But surely if so, they must have retained
some knowledge of the the true God, at least some precepts of civility from their Fore-fathers, though
never so long since. For what people can we read of in Stories, which have at any time been enlightned
with the truth, and yet afterward fallen into that gross barbarism, which is now found among the
<hi>Tartarians?</hi> See their Character, which (as they are by most described) deals impartially; gives them
ill-fashioned bodies, answerable to their rude minds, fit Houses for so unclean Guests.</p>
                  <p>(7) There stature is different. The most part have large shoulders, a broad face, with a crooked
nose, deformed countenance, swarthy colour, hollow eyes, hairy and untrimmed beard, and head close
shaved. Their speech is boysterous and clamourous; their noise in singing like the yell of Wolves;
and endurance of Hunger, Thirst, Heat, Cold, and Watching, equals them (in strength of body) to
the most able beast, for it exceeds the common power of a man. Their lust is without law. For they
except no kindred but their own Mothers, Daughters, and Sisters: No species, for they mix with
Beasts: no sex, for they are insatiate <hi>Sodomites:</hi> and yet take liberty for as many wives as they can
maintain; which contrary to our civil courses they buy of their Parents, instead of receiving dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Their meat is the raw flesh of Horses, without regard how they were killed, or of what diseases
they died: sometimes they suck bloud from the living, to appease their Hunger and Thirst, if (in a
journey) they be distressed for want of food.</p>
                  <p>(8) Cities they have but few, nor Houses, other than moveable Tents, made of Beasts skins, which
they pitch up by great multitudes, in the form of a Town, and those are called Hordes; when the grass
is once eaten bare, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Horseback, for their more speedy flight; and have them commonly strongly poysoned, for the more
sure mischief to the Foe. Their Stratagems are down right fraud, and breach of truth; for they keep
no Faith with any enemy, regard not any compact made upon terms of peace; but follow their own
sense, and commit what outrages they can with least danger to themselves.</p>
                  <p>(9) Their Religion is answerable to their vile customs; Some are <hi>Pagans,</hi> others <hi>Mahometans,</hi> yet
will not be called <hi>Turks,</hi> but <hi>Bersemanni,</hi> and their chief Priest <hi>Seyd,</hi> whom they reverence more than
their Maker, and admit that none should touch his Hand, but their Kings, and these too with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
gesture: their Dukes aspire not above his knee, nor their Nobles higher than his feet: the rest
are happy, if they can but reach at his garment, his horse, his any thing, so simple are they in their
Superstition: and thus have they continued either Atheists or false Idolaters, ever since their first
entrance upon this Kingdome in the year 1187. Before, they were not esteemed a Nation at all, but
wild people, without law or reason almost, who lived in the open fields, and conversed with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>(10) Their first King was one <hi>Chinchis,</hi> a man of low birth, but high spirit, impatient of that sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
condition to which he was bred; he brake forth at last, and drew more by his example, into the
thoughts of better fortunes: which he ceased not to prosecute, till he had made good his purpose, and
not only setled himself in the throne, but enlarged the dominion of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> through a great part
of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> which had scarce before heard of any such people. His first Forces he imployed

being since distinguished by the names of <hi>New-England, New-York,</hi> and <hi>Mary-Land.</hi> After the more
perfect discovery of these parts (which is said to have been first encouraged and promoted by
Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>) by several worthy Adventurers; as first Captain <hi>Philip Amidas,</hi> and Captain

eight of the Counsel were declared, with power to choose a President to govern for a year to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

Colony to be undertaken by those of <hi>London,</hi> the other by those of <hi>Bristol, Exeter, Plymouth,</hi> &amp;c.
However, it was not till in some years after, that this Plantation came to be considerably peopled:
and that principally by the great care, industry, and activity in this affair of the Valiant Capt.
<hi>Iohn Smith,</hi> who in the year 1615, in the <hi>12th.</hi> of King <hi>Iames</hi> his Reign, procured by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest

the said Corporation or Company of Adventurers of <hi>Virginia</hi> held any interest there which was
done in <hi>Trinity</hi> Term 1623, by reason of several misdemeanors and miscarriages objected against
the said Corporation, was an inlet of a far greater conflux into these parts than otherwise
would have been, by reason that this Corporation been dissolved, and the Plantation governed
be persons immediately appointed by commission from the King, a greater freedom of Trade was
opened to all his Majesties Subjects that would adventure into those parts. The greatest distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
the English received from the Natives was in the year 1622, when by a general insurrection
of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> 300 of our men were massacred.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1631, being the 7th. of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, the most Nothernly

<hi>England.</hi> Next Captain <hi>Prinne</hi> set out by the <hi>Bristol</hi> Company, whose Voyage, though it had
not its wisht success, yet he returned with a farther discovery of the Coast than had been made
before. Not long after <hi>George Popham</hi> and <hi>Raleigh Gilbert,</hi> were fitted out at the
charge of Sir <hi>Iohn Popham,</hi> with one hundred men, who though they had seated themselves
not uncommodiously in a <hi>Peninsula</hi> at the mouth of the River <hi>Sagadahoc,</hi> and were upon mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
farther discoveries; yet in the year 1608, upon the death of <hi>George Popham</hi> their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
and soon after of the Lord Chief Iustice, they returned into <hi>England,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
supplies had but lately been sent them, to the very great distaste of the chief promoters of
the design; and whereupon the <hi>French</hi> had taken occasion to plant themselves in these parts, had
they not been timely expelled by Sr. <hi>Samuel Argal</hi> from <hi>Virginia.</hi> The next that attempted a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:37437:306"/>
settlement here, was Captain <hi>Hobson,</hi> who by reason of the opposition raised against him by
two Natives, whom having been detained some while in <hi>England</hi> he took back along with him,
upon an affront offered them by some of the <hi>English,</hi> was forc't to return without effecting of
any thing, notwithstanding which insuccess, he ventured again, having under his command
several Land Soldiers in the company of Captain <hi>Harly,</hi> who was fitted out by Sr. <hi>Ferdinando
Gorges</hi> then Governour of <hi>Plymouth.</hi> Afterwards in the year 1615, there went Sr. <hi>Richard
Hawkins,</hi> then Captain <hi>Rocroft;</hi> after him Captain <hi>Dormer:</hi> And in the year 1623, Captain
<hi>Robert Gorges.</hi> By all which Voyages, however though this Plantation was not brought to any
settlement, by reason of the many misfortunes and disappointments that attended them; yet
so many of them as were made, and following so thick upon the neck of each other, could not
but add much light to the discoveries that were first produced, and at least make way for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
improvements: but that which chiefly conduced to the full peopling, and that flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
estate which this Colony at present injoys, was that general aversion at that time grown to
a great height, against the Church Government of this Nation, which caused multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
greedily to take hold on this occasion, that they might betake themselves to a place where
they might securely indulge to that liberty of Conscience they so much desired, and for which
many of them had fled before into <hi>Holland,</hi> especially when at length upon consideration of
the little loss, but rather benefit, the absence of persons so disaffected and unconformable
would be to the Kingdom, and of the advantage that would accrue to the Colony from the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of so great a number of people, free liberty was granted for their transportation. So
that in the year 1630, there landed of them a very considerable number at <hi>Plymouth</hi> Plantation,
and that without any opposition from any of the Natives, one great reason whereof might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be the great Mortality that hapned at that time among the <hi>Narragansetts, Niantics, Taran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:37437:307"/>
Wippanaps, Peoods,</hi> those of <hi>Agissawang, Pockaneki,</hi> and <hi>Abargini,</hi> and other chief Tribes
of the <hi>Indians</hi> of these parts. From this time forward, what with the industry of the people,
and the continual supplies that were sent from time to time for some years, they soon increased
to a great height, and are become at present one of the most powerful and thriving of the <hi>English</hi>
Plantations in <hi>America.</hi>

                  <p>The temperature of the Air, and fertility of the Soil differs not remarkably, as may well be
imagined, from the rest of the <hi>Virginian</hi> tract; and consequently affords the like plenty and
variety of all sorts of Commodittes, yet there are reckoned as chiefly appropriated to this
part of the Country divers kinds of Plants, and Trees, among which the <hi>Cedar,</hi> the <hi>Sprewse,
sassafras,</hi> and Dyers <hi>Sumach,</hi> and also some peculiar Beasts, Birds, and Fishes.</p>
                  <p>Of Beasts, the <hi>Musquash</hi> less than a Beaver, but much resembling it in shape, the Musky Scent
whereof proceeds from the stones of the male, and whose skins in regard of their sweet Scent, are
brought over as rich Presents. The <hi>Moose</hi> as big an Ox, slow of foot, yet in shape somewhat
like a red Dear, and headed like a Buck, yielding flesh good for meat, hides for cloathing:
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:37437:307"/>
This Beast in regard of its fruitfulness (for the female brings forth three at a time) and its har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness;
for it will live in winter without fodder, may be with good advantage kept tame, and
accustomed to the Yoke. The <hi>Rackoon,</hi> tailed like a Fox, otherwise like a Badger, but with a
deep furr: This beast sleeps by day in a hollow tree; in moonshiny nights at low tide it feeds
on Clams by the Sea-side.</p>
                  <p>Of Birds, the <hi>Loon,</hi> a most ill-favoured bird not much unlike the <hi>Cormorant,</hi> and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weildy,
for it cannot fly, and scarce go; it makes a noise like a Sow-gelders horn. The <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
or rather <hi>Simplicity,</hi> in regard it so simply exposeth it self to the shot of the fowler, the
bigger sort is about the bigness of a green Plover, the other no bigger than that sort of bird we
call here a Knot: but the <hi>Humbird</hi> is no less curious and remarkable than any other bird whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
whether in <hi>New-England</hi> or any other part of the World, if we consider the rarity of its
bulk, it being no bigger then a Horne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, yet having the perfect shape and proportion of a bird;
it seems to take its name from the humming noise it makes.</p>
                  <p>Of Fishes the most peculiar are the <hi>Seal</hi> or Sea-calf, chiefly prised for its Skin, next for its
Oyl, of which it yields a large quantity, the chief use whereof is to burn in lamps; for its flesh
wholly useless, as not fit to be eaten. The <hi>Shark</hi> sometimes as big as a horse, having three
rows of teeth with which they have many times snapt off the hands and feet of men as they
swam: With the flesh of this fish (being good for nothing else) they oft manure Land. The <hi>Holli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but,</hi>
a fish in shape somewhat resembling a <hi>Pleace,</hi> but of a far larger size, that is to say, two yards
long, one wide, and a foot thick, the best of this for the table is accounted the head and fins,
especially baked or stew'd. The <hi>Basse,</hi> a fish of all others in these parts accounted the greatest
delicacy to eat, exceeding Ling or Haberdine, when salted up for winter, as usually the bodies
of them are, the heads being eaten fresh; the common size is two or three foot long. The
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:37437:308"/>
                     <hi>Clam</hi> or <hi>Clamp,</hi> a shell-fish, having some resemblance of a Cockle, with a round hole by which
it takes in and spouts out water continually, the biggest of them which are as big as a large
apple, are among the Natives a great dainty, and by the <hi>English</hi> not altogether despised. The
<hi>Alewife,</hi> a sort of fish most like a Herring, coming up once a year, namely in <hi>April,</hi> in vast
shoales into Rivers and fresh waters to spawn, from whence till they have spawned, not the
most violent disturbance that can be devised, can force them to return.</p>
                  <p>Of Noxious Creatures the chief is the Rattle Snake, being generally a yard and a half long,
thick in the middle, yellow bellied, spotted on the back with various colours, its thin neck
stretching into a wide swallow, wide mouthed, with teeth as sharp as needles, wherewith such
as are bitten cannot be cured, but by chawing the root of snake-weed, and applying the chaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
root to the wound: which root chawed by any that are not thus bitten, is of it self poyson.
Of Insects the most peculiar and principal are the <hi>Wild Bee,</hi> as they call it, which building ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitacles
like Cobwebs among the Vine leaves, guards the Grapes. The <hi>Gurnipper,</hi> which no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than a flea, bites also like a flea, though somewhat more rancorously, and lives but three
weeks. The <hi>Musqueto,</hi> which lives chiefly in thick woods or swamps, scarcely induring wind,
or excess of cold or heat, but in thick close weather, and against rain it raiseth where it bites
a venomous kind of itching.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Inhabitants of this part of the Country were formerly divided into several Tribes
or petty Nations, the chief whereof were East and North-East the <hi>Churchers</hi> and <hi>Tarentines:</hi>
Southward the <hi>Pequods</hi> and <hi>Naragansetts:</hi> Westward the <hi>Canectacuts</hi> and <hi>Mawhacks:</hi> North-West,
the <hi>Aberginians;</hi> all which people how different from each other in nature and disposition
in so small a compass of ground, is wonderfull to imagine; the <hi>Mawhacks</hi> most bloudy, savage,
and man-eaters: The <hi>Tarentines</hi> little less cruel, but not Canibals: The <hi>Aberginians</hi> more mild,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:37437:308"/>
innocent, and harmless, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in religious Ceremonies, Habit, Civil manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Marriages, Burials, Ingenuity in Arts and Manufactures, Games and Exercises, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
differing. Among the rest, which it would be too tedious here to insist upon; it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
that the figures of Beasts and other things described upon their bodies, are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by superficial painting, but by incision and impunction of colours between the skin and
the flesh.</p>

about the same, either more or less with the Country of the <hi>Troquois</hi> anciently so called. The

                     <hi>NOvum Belgium,</hi> or <hi>New-Netherland,</hi> now called <hi>New-York,</hi> was first discovered by
<hi>Henry Hudson, Aun:</hi> 1609, at the charge of the <hi>East-India</hi> Company; but in regard
he return'd without leaving any men upon the place; the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the year 1614,
under <hi>Adrian Block</hi> and <hi>Godyn</hi> began to plant themselves there; and doubtless had
soon setled themselves, (upon a double pretence; first, as finding the place not
pre-possest, and therefore free for any that would enter: next, as having contracted with <hi>Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
for his interest, and bought all his Charts and Instruments) had not Sir <hi>Samuel Argal,</hi> then
Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> disputed the business with them. And upon a serious debate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with them about it, wherein he alledged that <hi>Hudson</hi> being a Subject of the King of
<hi>England,</hi> and acting solely by his commission, had not power to alienate any Countrey he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
for the King his Master, without his Majesties consent; but that this Countrey more
especially belonged to him as his own Dominion, being accounted part of the Province of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia:</hi>
he brought them to acknowledge the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Title, and to submit to the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Countrey as feodatory of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and under the Government of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia.</hi>
Yet this compliance was not of a very long continuance; for upon the expectation of a
new Governor they fell back into their first principles, and made no scruple to usurp the whole
Soveraignty; and to denominate it their own, called it by the name of <hi>Novum Belgium,</hi> or the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:37437:311"/>
                     <hi>New Neatherlands:</hi> and moreover they fell to building of Towns and Forts; the Town they
erected they called <hi>New Amsterdam;</hi> their first Fort <hi>Fort-Orange;</hi> after which they raised an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

late Majesty, and by him represented to the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> were absolutely disowned by
them, and wholly laid upon the <hi>East-India</hi> Company of <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> upon which the most Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thernly
part toward <hi>New-England,</hi> was by his Majesty granted by Patent to Sir <hi>Edmund Loiden,</hi>

Lord <hi>Baltimore,</hi> by the name of <hi>Mary-Land;</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> upon some consideration agreed on,
were forthwith to have quitted the place: yet for all this, as the custom of this people is, never
to let go any opportunity that serves their turn, whether by right or wrong, taking advantage
of the unhappy dissentions and civil wars that soon after hapned in this Nation, they not only
stood upon higher demands than were at first agreed on, but also endeavoured to stir up the
Natives against the <hi>English,</hi> that they might have the better opportunity to fix themselves. In
this state things remained till his present Majesty, after his restauration, resolving to make a full
determination of his right to these parts, sent three Men of War, by whom <hi>New Amsterdam</hi>
being easily reduc'd, the Countrey came thenceforth into the sole possession of the <hi>English,</hi>

Wheat stampt and boyled to pap, is a great dish with them. Men turn away their Wives upon

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:37437:312"/>
Whale-sins, and Sea-shells, the men putting half an ell of cloath three quarters broad between
their legs, so as that a square piece hangs before over his belly, another below behind his back. The
women wear a coat that reaches half way down their legs, curiously wrought with Sea-shells; and
for an upper garment they have a large Dear-skin, the lappets whereof hang full of points, button'd
on the right shoulder, and tied about the middle. The men go bare-headed; the women tying
their hair behind in a tuft, wear over it a square-cap, wrought with Sea-shells; of which they also
wear chains and bracelets about their middle, neck and arms: the men paint their faces with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
colours; the women use only here and there a black spot: their usual painting colours are either
the Iuices prest out of several Plants, or the fine ground powders of certain curious coloured
Stones: the chief of these plants hath a great resemblance to a myrtle, especially in its leaves: out
of the red berry of this plant a juice is squeezed, and dried in the Sun, and preserved for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
use in bags; when they have occasion to use it, they temper it with water, producing the
richest purple colour that can be imagined: they use pleated hair, which being coloured red,
hath a fine gloss, in stead of feathers.</p>
                  <p>It is observable in their religious worship that in the midst of their sorceries and diabolical ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
the Devil, whom alone they worship, as the regent of mischief, and sitting president in
every bodily pain, and therefore most proper to be sought and oblig'd, is said to appear in the
shape of a wild or tame beast, informing them obscurely of things to come; and portending, if the
first, bad; if the last, good fortune. Yet they acknowledge a God, who living in profound bliss, not
troubling himself with humane affairs, solaceth himself with a Goddess of most surpassing beauty,
and the Mother of all terrestrial creatures. Moreover, they believe that the souls of those that
have lived well here, are translated after their decease to some Southern Clime, where they live
in utmost pleasure and delight: whereas the souls of the wicked are hurried up and down in a
miserable vagrancy.</p>

                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:37437:312"/>Remarkable also is the manner of their proceeding against Criminals condemned to death;
which is, to hunt them like wild beasts into the woods; whither, in stead of being committed to
Prison, they are forced, or rather suffered to fly; as soon as he is discovered, the King having
first shot, if he miss, the rest follow; and happy is he who hath the fortune to give the Malefactor
his deaths-shot, for he is sure to be made a Captain, or some eminent Commander in the Wars.</p>
                  <p>Not to mention the several beasts, birds, and other animals that are common to this Countrey,
with the <hi>European</hi> Countreys in general, or with other parts of <hi>America;</hi> there is seen on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>New-York</hi> towards <hi>Canada,</hi> a sort of beast, which in its cloven feet and shaggy main re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles
an Horse, in its neck a Dear, in its tail a wild-Hog, having black eyes, and an horn in
the midst of the forehead. Of this animal the males never keep company with the females, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
at time of copulation. Toward the South are many <hi>Buffalo's,</hi> a beast in shape between an
Horse and a Stag; like the last of which it hath branchy horns; also a skin for thickness not
easily penetrable: the tail is short, the hair varying colour each succeeding season, the lips hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the teeth small: this beast, though strong, is subject to the Falling-sickness, and dies of a
small wound. When hunted by the dogs, it defends it self by vomiting out an hot scalding li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
upon them.</p>
                  <p>The chief Trade of this Countrey at present consists of Corn and Cattel; though great plenty
of Flax is also sowed, at least sufficient for so much wearing cloath as serves for the use of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
themselves, who live in very happy plenty and quiet, and very good amity and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with the <hi>Indians,</hi> especially ever since the arrival of Collonel <hi>Nichols;</hi> who about
eight years since, upon the Patent granted of this Countrey, by his Majesty, to his Highness the

that by the <hi>English,</hi> who have all along kept continual and undisturb'd possession.</p>
                  <p>This Island being of an oval form, about eight leagues in length<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and five in bredth, is seated
in the latitude of 13 degrees, and 20 seconds; on the North-east of St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> very strong both

three <hi>Forts,</hi> and a standing <hi>Militia,</hi> consisting of two Regiments of Horse, and five of Foot, well
disciplin'd, and ready at a short warning.</p>
                  <p>The weather here is so hot for eight months, that it would be very intollerable to travellers,
but for the cool breezes which rising and mounting with the Sun, blow generally from the North-east
and by East, except in the time of the <hi>Tornado,</hi> when for a few hours they change into
the South. Yet notwithstanding this great heat of the Air, it is also so moist, that all iron-tools,
without continual use, are wonderfully apt to contract rust. This heat and moisture of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

two, if the first be not rather to be accounted a Lake, since it runs but a very little way into the
Land: the other they call the River <hi>Tuigh,</hi> on the surface of whose waters there swims an Oil,
which being gathered thence, is usually burnt in Lamps.</p>
                  <p>The Estate of a Master Planter here consists chiefly in servants and <hi>Negro</hi>-slaves; and of
these three Classes or Orders the whole Islands consists: the Masters live not only in all manner
of plenty and delight: for besides Beef, Mutton, Pork, Kid, Pease, Beans, and excellent Roots,
they have all variety of Fish and Fowl, and plenty of Wine, Strong-waters, and English Beer
and Ale; but also in full stretching ease, having their Overseers to manage their business for
them, who calls the Servants and Slaves to their work, by ringing of a Bell at six a clock in the
morning, and one after dinner, and dismisses them at eleven at noon, and six at night, orders
them their several tasks, and corrects them for all misorders and neglect of their duties. The
Servants have this advantage of the Slaves, that their servitude lasts but for five years; which
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:37437:319"/>
time being expir'd, they either acquire Plantations of their own, or have good allowances for
working under the chief Planters. The <hi>Negroes</hi> on the other side, who are bought like beasts in
a Fair, are kept in perpetual bondage, they and their children; and therefore though the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Servants are also bought, yet double the price is given for the <hi>Negroes, viz.</hi> twenty pound
a piece for the men, fifteen for the women. The diet, clothing and lodging is very hard both
for servants and slaves; but the servants have a double allowance of clothes, and their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
of lodging much better: Sunday, which is allowed as a day of respit from the Masters
labour, the most ingenious spend in some kind of manufacture for their own benefit; others
in wrestling, dancing, and such like recreations.</p>
                  <p>For the better administration of Government, and putting in execution the Laws of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
which, if not the same, have a very near correspondence with ours in <hi>England,</hi> excepting
some that are peculiar to the place. The Island is divided into four circuits, in each of which
there is a Court of Iudicature for civil Causes, from whence appeals may be made to the Supreme
Court, which Supreme Court is in the nature of our Parliament, both as having a Legislative
Power, and consisting of three Estates, namely, the Governor or his Deputy, ten of his Counsel,
which are in stead of our House of Peers; and the Burgesses elected by the Free-men, two out
of each Parish. For the execution of Iustice here are held five Sessions yearly.</p>

                     <hi>FLorida,</hi> a pleasant and spacious Countrey, was so called by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whereas the
ancient name was <hi>Irquassa,</hi> because to <hi>Iuan Ponce de Leon,</hi> the first of that Nation that
steered his course toward this Coast, it gave landing in 1512 on Palm-Sunday, which
they call <hi>Pascha de Flores,</hi> or <hi>Florida Pascha:</hi> though it had been formerly discovered,

Ponce,</hi> by reason of the resistance of the Natives, being soon forc'd to quit the place; and
dying not long after of a wound he received in one of his encounters, not many years after <hi>Lucas
Vasques de Aylon</hi> arriving with two Ships, was courteously entertained by a King of the Countrey,
and well he requited him; for at his departure he treacherously hoisted Sail with divers of the
<hi>Indians,</hi> whom he carried with him captives, to work in the Mines at <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> but it thrived
with him accordingly, when having obtained the Government of <hi>Florida,</hi> he was beaten out with
the loss of one Ship, and about 200 of his men; this notwithstanding discouraged not <hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Nervaes</hi> from making another attempt, who after many strange adventures, losses and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
at length lost himself, it being never known what became of him; and of 80 that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
him, but 4 escap'd to return home alive. Much more remarkable and puissant, and more
destructive to the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> of whom many thousands were slaughtered, was the expedition
of <hi>Ferdinando Soto, Ann.</hi> 1534. who nevertheless, after many losses, died therein, and his successor

left on Shore perish'd with hunger. However, of so many landings as had at several times been
made by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> some footing, notwithstanding all misfortunes, could not but be made in

<hi>Gascoigner,</hi> who in the year 1567, in revenge of his Countrey-men, of whom divers were hang'd,
and especially of the death of <hi>Ribaut,</hi> who is said to have been flead alive, ventur'd of his own
accord to make thither with three Ships well mann'd with Souldiers and Sea-men, and with the
help of divers <hi>Casicks</hi> of the Countrey ingaged to his Party by <hi>Pierre du Bre,</hi> the only French-man
that escaping the Massacre of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Laudonieres</hi> attempt, was left alive in the
place, took from them Fort <hi>Carolina,</hi> and two other Forts, hanged divers <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the same
trees whereon they had hung the <hi>French,</hi> and return'd with honour, though not without suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

hear not of any other adventures of the <hi>French</hi> in this part of <hi>America:</hi> however there fell not

                  </p>
                  <p>The Countrey, as it is now in possession of the <hi>English,</hi> is divided and governed according to
a platform and model drawn up by my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> with the consent and approbation of
the rest of the Lords Proprietors, judged by many serious persons that have perused it, of equal
advantage to the Inhabitants, with any that ever hath been yet experienced, in respect of the
equal ballance of the interests of all parties.</p>
                  <p>The whole Province is divided into several Counties, each containing forty square plats of
12000 acres a piece: of these square plats, eight are to be divided among the Lords Proprietors,
that is, each to have one, with the title of a <hi>Signory;</hi> eight more among the Nobility, of which
there are to be three in every County, a <hi>Landgrave,</hi> and two <hi>Cassiques;</hi> only the <hi>Landgrave</hi> to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:37437:324"/>
have double the proportion to the two <hi>Cassiques;</hi> that is, four to their two a piece; the rest
containing 24 acres, falls to the people: and this division is to be observed alike in every
County; by which means one fifth of the Land comes to the Proprietors, another to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and three to the People. The <hi>Signories</hi> or Lands belonging to the Proprietors are to
be hereditary, and descend with the Dignity to their Heirs, and in like manner the Baronies.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament which is to be <hi>Biennial,</hi> is to consist of the Proprietors, the Nobility; and
for the people, one chosen out of every District by the Freeholders; which representatives are
to have a free Vote in the making of Laws; the force whereof is determined to set a time,
<hi>viz.</hi> sixty years, or thereabouts, to prevent the incumbrances and mischiefs arising from
the multiplicity of rules and penalties, which the longer a Law continues, are liable to
be increased and perplexed by the cunning of such as make a gain by the practice of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Besides the Parliament which hath the Legislative Power, there are e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the dispatch of all publick affairs. The first is that of the <hi>Palatine;</hi> for so the eldest of the
Proprietors is stil'd, who hath power to call Parliaments, and dispose of publick affairs. The
second is the <hi>Chief Iustices,</hi> for the judging of Criminals, and trial of Causes about Right and
Propriety. The third is the <hi>Chancellor's Court,</hi> which is for the passing of Charters, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

for the ordering of the <hi>Land-Militia.</hi> The fif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and other Maritime affairs. The sixth is the <hi>High Stewards,</hi> which inspects into the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Trade. The seventh is the <hi>Treasurers,</hi> which looks after the incomes and disbursements
of the publick Stock or Treasury. The eighth is the <hi>Chamberlain's,</hi> which marshals and orders the
ceremonies and fashions in all great Marriages, Burials, and publick Solemnities. All these
Courts (each of which consists of one Proprietor, and six Counsellors; whereof two are
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:37437:325"/>
chosen by the Nobility, and two by the People,) joyned together make up the Council of State,
or Grand Council, by which all affairs of highest concernment are managed; and to which
the last appeal lies in all Causes belonging to them. There is also a Court in every County,
and in every District another: in each of which, to prevent long Suits, whereby the people
suffer, only to enrich a numerous Tribe of glib-tongu'd Orators, no Cause is tried above once;
only an appeal to be made from an inferior to a superior Court, till it come to the Proprietors
Court, where the last determination is made without farther appeal: neither indeed are there
any mercenary Pleaders allowed. And farther, to prevent the occasion of Controversies, and

                  <p>Lastly, to prevent all disturbance and annoyance to publick or private weal and safety,
strict enquiry is to be made into the conversations of such as shall be found to have neither
estates not employments; such provision being to be made as shall take away all excuses of
following illegal courses: nor are any to be suffered to make a Trade of begging, who
have ability of body, and are obliged by necessity to work: since it is apparent that idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and beggery are the source of all those villanies, which by the hand of Iustice bring so
many to untimely ends, whose lives might otherwise haply have one way or other conduced
to the service of their King or Countrey; and that it must needs be much more advantagious
to the publick to prevent the necessity of inflicting capital punishments, than to inflict them
when deserved.</p>
                  <p>As to the Government in point of Religious affairs, there is only this to be observed;
that a free toleration and liberty of Conscience is granted to all, excepting in the case of
Atheism, Profaneness, and debauchery of life, as destructive to all Government and humane
Society: whereas ceremonies and indifferent circumstances in Religion are judged to tend
most to disturbance, when most strictly and rigorously imposed.</p>

                  <p>INDIA, by the Ancients simply so denominated, but by the Moderns sirnamed <hi>Orientalis,</hi>
for distinction sake; in regard <hi>America,</hi> or the new found World, is usually stil'd <hi>India
Occidentalis,</hi> or the <hi>West-Indies:</hi> is that Region of <hi>Asia,</hi> which under one appellation takes
up the largest part thereof; it being all that part which lies beyond the River <hi>Indus,</hi> now

wholly with the <hi>Indian</hi> or <hi>Oriental</hi> Ocean; Westward with <hi>Persia;</hi> and Northward with that
part of <hi>Mount Taurus</hi> which divides it from <hi>Tartary.</hi> This Countrey, as it was by the Ancients,
so is still primarily distinguished into <hi>India intra Gangem,</hi> and <hi>India extra Gangem:</hi> the first is
vulgarly term'd <hi>Indostan,</hi> the other <hi>Mangi;</hi> under which some doubt not to comprehend <hi>China</hi>

temperature of the Air must needs be very diverse under so large an extent; lying partly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>torrid,</hi> partly under the temperate <hi>Zone.</hi> Many vast and barren Desarts there are; but
generally the Soil is fruitful, and the Countrey abounding with things convenient for life: and
in some parts are produc'd most delicious fruits, especially the <hi>Palm,</hi> of which the people of
those parts make Wine more frequently than of the <hi>Grape:</hi> and for <hi>Gums, Spices,</hi> and all sorts
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:37437:326"/>
of rich <hi>Drugs,</hi> it surpasseth all other Countreys: but that which is the chief glory of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi>
is, that the rest of the World receives lustre from the Diamonds, Rubies, and other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>Gems</hi> that are brought from thence. So that it so far out-shineth the opposite or <hi>Occidental
Indies,</hi> by how much these Gems exceed in value Gold it self; besides the great Trade that is
driven in many places in Silks, and other curious Stuffs, and rich Commodities; whereupon
they are much frequented, and resorted to by Strangers from all parts of the World.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> people are generally of a complexion somewhat tawny, tall of stature, and strong
of constitution, healthful, and for the most part long-liv'd, even many times to the age of 130
years, notwithstanding their addiction, above all other people in the World, to luxury and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal
exercises. It is permitted them to marry every man as many Wives as he can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
whereof, nevertheless, one of them hath a more peculiar respect, and observance, and a
predominance over the rest; for which she pays dear enough, if she survive her Husband; for
at his death she is obliged to throw her self into the same Funeral Pyre with him. They are
simple-hearted, and vold of all fraud and deceit in their bargains and contracts, and not given to
any quirks or cavils in the Law; and scarcely is there any such thing as the every known among
them: so that their houses have little or no need of the guards of locks and bolts, so usual and
necessary among us. The lowermost rank of people go very ill-habited, or rather almost stark
naked, except their head, feet, and what decency requires to have hid: but those of Quality,
Birth or Estate, go richly clad in Silks, fine Linnen, or other the most costly attire; and spare
for no adornments of Pearl, and the most precious of Gems; and they stand very much upon
the honour of their Birth and Family, observing a suitable grandure in their garb and retinue,
admitting not of any mixture of affinity with those of mean degree.</p>
                  <p>The strength of the <hi>Indian</hi> Militia consists in their <hi>Nairi,</hi> who are a select number of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:37437:327"/>
and better sort of Citizens; who from seven years of age are train'd up in all manner of
bodily exercises; by which, and by a continual inunction and suppling of their nerves, joynts
and bones with oil of <hi>Sesamum,</hi> they attain in time to an incredible dexterity and agility of
body.</p>
                  <p>The chief Ministers and Dispencers of the Rites and Ceremonies of their Religion, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Idolatry, are said to be of the stock of those ancient <hi>Brachmanes,</hi> who doubtless were the
same with the <hi>Gymnosophists,</hi> so term'd by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> among whom they had a very great
fame; being mentioned for their Learning and Philosophy by divers, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi>
Writers; and reckoned in the same rank of honour and esteem as the <hi>Magi</hi> among the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
and the <hi>Druids</hi> among the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Britains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great Mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> which for extent is doubtless the biggest in the World;
stretcheth in a continued ridge through the whole length of <hi>Asia,</hi> only under several names, as
<hi>Imaus, Emodus, Caucasus, Parapomisus, &amp;c.</hi> This Mountain <hi>Taurus</hi> is judged to be the same with
that <hi>Mount Ararat</hi> mentioned in holy Scripture, upon which the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> rested after the
Flood.</p>
                  <p>Of the Rivers of <hi>India Oriental, Indus</hi> and <hi>Ganges</hi> are the chiefest, and most famous; and of
the number of the most principal and largest of all <hi>Asia. Indus,</hi> which gives denomination to
the Countrey, and is now vulgarly called <hi>Hiind, Duil, Inder, Caercede,</hi> and by some <hi>Pengah,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

course Northward, with seven mouths into the <hi>Indian Ocean,</hi> having taken in by the way 19
navigable Rivers; the chief whereof are <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> and <hi>Hypasis,</hi> which terminated <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great's expedition. This River, where broadest, is accounted 50 furlongs broad; where
deepest, 15 paces deep. <hi>Ganges,</hi> now <hi>Guencam,</hi> from her uncertain original (some say the

the way 30 Navigable Rivers. This River, where narrowest, is accounted two <hi>German</hi> miles
broad; where shallowest, 100 foot deep. It is moreover famous for the 460 Channels, cut
like so many wounds out of its sides, by <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> in revenge for the drowning of
an Horse, upon which he set a very great value.</p>
                  <p>The Empire of the Great <hi>Mogul</hi> is so promiscuously spread throughout that part of <hi>India</hi>
which lies within <hi>Ganges,</hi> that there are reckoned up no less than 37 Provinces or Kingdoms
under his Dominion.</p>
                  <p>But because his Dominion doth not exactly comprehend all <hi>Indostan,</hi> or <hi>Interior India:</hi> others
have chosen rather to divide it into those several Regions which have been adjudged the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
