         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and judge thou with that of God in thy conſcience, if their ſhame

fetch't me out of the loweſt hell, and led me through the graves
of ſin and death, wherein I ſaw lying all the Profeſſors under the
Sun; yet amongſt them all, I have not met with ſuch a cup of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
as there with my fellowes I drunk from the hands of our
Countrey-men, the cruel English Jewes, who profeſſeth Chriſt in
the letter, but crucifieth him in the life where ever he appeareth;
Greater hypocrites are not under the Sun then they are in word,
and in shew they appear beautiful unto men, but in covetouſneſs
and deceitful dealing, ſecret luſt, and diſſimulation, they flow;
Penitency nor Mercy, Juſtice nor Righteouſneſs in reality, is not in

heard, and my hands have handled amongſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then should I be
like unto them; if I ſpeak as from revenge and malice against that
people, I were to be blamed, but in reality to forewarn all to beware
of hypocrites, of which ſort in all Nations they are the head. If thou
canſt have patience to peruſe my words with the leaſt degree of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
or taſte of the Saints travels ſuſtained through true experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
obtained through obedience to the light of the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, hearken and I ſhall speak; I was in darkneſs, yea groſs darkneſs
covered me, and Satan (as King over all the earth) ruled over me,
and I knew it not, until the terrors of God fell upon me for ſin; and
then out of the belly of hell cryed I, ſo grievous was my complaint,
and ſo dolefull was my cry, that I was vomited forth as one not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95128:3"/>
to have place in all the earth; my bones did waſte, and my flesh
was as the ſlime for Pharoah's houſe, ready to be converted into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
crawling creature, as the plague changed, ſo did the boyl, and
the form of the creature was accordingly. This is the word of
Truth, he that can receive it let him. In this diſtreſs, I heard a
cry in the coaſts of Goshen, of light that was broken forth, and that
there was a meaſure of it given to every man to profit withall; but
ſo dark was I, and ſo groſsly bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not, nor amongſt all Profeſſors, Prieſts nor others, I had never
heard it ſpoken of, nor preached for ſalvation to the ends of the earth.
Then called I to queſtion all that ever I had either read or heard,
to the laſt tittle of my Belief, wherein I ſaid, that he deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hell, and read that he was given for a light into the world, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the whole world lay in wickedneſs, and the Devil the god
thereof, according to the Scriptures; and I had ſought heaven
long, yet knew I not in the leaſt meaſure that which firſt diſcovers
hell; yet from amongst the wickedeſt of men was I crauled, and
loathed the baſeſt of abominations, and deſires great to live juſtly
and to inioy God, (no mans groanes greater) which ſet me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after this new light which was ſo called amongst the wicked,
and what effect it wrought amongst ſuch as did believe in it; I
heard that it did convince of ſin, and being believed in, obeyed,
and followed, led out of all manner of uncleanneſs. Then ſaid I in
my heart, if ſo, it should not want following, for I was weary of
my ſin, and my tranſgreſſions was before me continually, yea I loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
my life unto death when I ſaw Chriſt ſo low deſcended, and
compaſſed about with ſuch a caule of corruption, it brought me as
low as he, yea even to dye with him: And believing in this Light,
I shall tell thee Reader of a Truth what further effect it wrought
in me, without in the leaſt giving thee the report as from any other
man beſides my ſelf, that thou mayſt know the truth thereof, O
<hi>Theophilus,</hi> whatſoever thou art; it was unto me as the Angell

who cries unto thee day and night, againſt theſe who builds up Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

So after the diſcharging of my conſcience towards God, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
theſe things to publike view, recommending them to the

conſciences and conſiderations of all that are in Authority, the chief

ought in righteouſneſs ſo much as in them lies, to ſee theſe grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

be required; for let them be aſſured, that that ſpirit which hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted

called to an account for it, will attempt to take away life, if ſtill ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered;
as you may further underſtand their cruel intent by a Law
ſet forth in this preſent yeer 1658. and this as ſurely they ſeek after,
as the enemies of <hi>God</hi> doth after thine, or did after thy father <hi>O. C.</hi>
for as little art thou eſteemed by the one, as by the other, further then
baſe and ſelf-ends leads them to ſeek unto thee; for when we were
moved of the Lord to make our appeal once and again, that our cauſe
might be heard and tryed by the chief Magiſtrate, or whom he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to appoint, we were utterly denyed it, and his Name ſleighted, and
never ſo much as made mention of, in their proeeedings in that bloody
and cruel place of Boston; and as the leaſt principle of the law of
Love bears rule in thee, it will lead thee to do for thy neighbors and
friends as for thy ſelf, and if this thou do not, thou canſt not be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> nor from our blood cleer in the day of thine
account; and leaſt thou or any one ſhould question the truth hereof,
we the Sufferers are the Subſcribers, who are all of us by name and

we ſhall be as ready to do the ſecond, as we have been to ſuffer

finde out this as thou art Noble, and if any man can contradict the

had, which being done, thou maiſt underſtand by their order, that
their common Executioner was appointed to deſtroy them (O lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

if he would work; if not, he ſhould be whipt every day: then
he demanded what Law he had broken, and called for his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
that he might know his tranſgreſſion, and told him, That
if he were called to that work by the Lord he ſhould not refuſe
it; then thiy chained him to the Barrow again, and told him,
that if he ſpake to any one he ſhould be puniſhed worſe; yet
his mouth was opened to ſuch as came about him: then they
ſeeing that he could not be ſilent, they put him up into the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,

have a third part, and to be concealed, notwithſtanding many of us
did entertain them willingly, ſuffered them to ſpeak in our houſes,

pay it them; then might he ſpeak no more, but forthwith caſt into

him, and asked him if he were not once a ſtranger in

told him that he had been an extravagant perſon; ſo after his
departure, they invented ſeveral lyes againſt him, and entred
them upon their lying Record, as hereafter you will further
underſtand.</p>
            <p>At that ſame time and againſt that ſame Court, it being about
the beginning of the eighth Moneth (57) ſummoned they
<hi>Ralph Allin,</hi> with <hi>William Newland,</hi> (Inhabitants in <hi>Sandwitch</hi>)
men fearing God, and of a good report, to appear at <hi>Plymouth,</hi>
to ſerve on a Jury, (which was 20 miles diſtant from them) and
not being unwilling to find cauſe of crime againſt <hi>Ralph Allin,</hi>
they ſummoned him to ſerve on the high and petty Juries at
one and the ſelf ſame time; ſo that hereafter you will with
me find out the end of this Enmity; ſuch was their Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that in obedience to their Order they went, and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their willingneſs to ſerve their Countrey, ſo that they might
do it without ſwearing, (which for conſcience ſake they could
not) but the Governour would not, except they would ſwear,
and break the doctrine of Chriſt, which they refuſing was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed,
after requiring them further to attend the Court; for

               </gap> how this unrighteous Ruler ſerved them; I cannot

time, were accuſed for keeping diſorderly meetings in their
houſes, which was not mentioned unto them at firſt, although
thereunto none but their neighbours and Friends did repair
to wait upon God, ſaving ſuch as they ſent to diſturbe them,
who had alſo threatned them with Fines, both perſons and

places where ſo they did, as hereafter you will further under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
for which theſe men were there fined and required to
finde Sureties for the good behaviour, (upon the penalty of
80 l.) for ſix months, which they refuſing, it being a thing
tending to the worſhip of God, and the wronging of their
conſciences, and granted in the Inſtrument of Government,
(a priviledg of great price, and higher value then to be parted

Marſhal, where they were continued, betwixt 20 and 30 miles
from their wives and ſmall children, they having many, with
relations and occaſions, and upon great charge and expence,
they being ſentenced by the Governour, to pay five ſhillings
at their commitment, and five ſhillings at their releaſement,
and five ſhillings every day whilſt they were there continued,
which was until the firſt Month (58) and longer by his Order;
before the middle of which time, they were proffered by the
Magiſtrates, if they would neither receive nor hear the Quakers
(as they call them) they ſhould be forthwith releaſed, which
they not entring into Covenant to the denial of Chriſt and
his Meſſengers, were continued near five months priſoners, the
fine alſo they levied, taking from <hi>William Newland</hi> one heifer,
valued by them at 27 ſhillings, but was better then thirtie
ſhillings, the other having been wickedly fined formerly, and
overplus taken, which they detained; therefore judge ye, if
they intended theſe men for Jury men. Reader thou mayeſt
underſtand, that their Marſhal was a moderate man, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Their ſecond part of this I commit to the conſideration

their Oath of Fidelity, (as they call it) I remember when
I vvas before them, they put it upon me to anſvver, Whether
the Scriptures vvere uot the Rule of Life, and ground of

the Scriptures, to be either the Rule of life, or ground of

the Governor proffered me (in words) their Oath

Rulers therein concerned, to take notice how they labour to
caſt the innocent (who are engrafted into Chriſt) out of Court
and Countrey; finding Jeſus ſuch an Inſtrument of Juſtice,
and ſuch an Enemy to Hell, and the Powers therof, the Devil
doth what he can that he may not have the overſight of his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95128:19"/>
proceedings, therefore ſaith he (being aſſembled in the firſt

            </p>
            <p>Again, their fift part alſo I commit to the ſame conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
what an ancient and wholeſome pill it is, bearing date
neither from time nor place, ſo that its riſe is neither from
beginning nor end, and its intent is accordingly, vvho will
not ſuffer a forreigner to have a reſt in their borders, neither
place in Houſe, Court, nor Countrey, vvithout the conſent
of ſuch as in their Act is mentioned, the whole World lying
in Wickedneſs, the Devil being god and guide therein, the
Rulers are bent that the ends thereof ſhall never be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt;
therefore do they eſtabliſh ſuch ancient Antidotes as this,
which they have digged out of the bottomleſs pit, for which
they are aſhamed to bring their black proof. Theſe ſeveral
perſons again herein mentioned, is this ſame <hi>Ralph Allin,</hi>
whom for ſeveral years they have envied, and maliciouſly
uſed, having renewed this laſt year againſt him this Antidote,
thinking thereby to cover their malice and wickedneſs, for
which God will plague them; if there be any more, it is ſuch
as are one with him, who cannot bow their knee to <hi>Baal;</hi> You
may alſo underſtand by their laſt clauſe, that it is one with
all the reſt, that no place, nor peace, nor comfort, union nor
ſociety, muſt the people of God have under their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it being altogether againſt God &amp; Chriſt, true Church
and its order, life, power and ſpirit. This Teſtimony have I
ſealed amongſt them with my blood, and God is my record
at this day, it is true therefore as the Wicked make void the
Law of the Righteous, even ſo doth the righteous make void
the Law of the Wicked, and reconciliation betwixt them
there cannot be, ſaith</p>

            <p>Again, here follows the practice and exerciſe of this Law,
with the Parties and Cauſes which ſuffered under it; if this
Law had had ſo much as the ſhew of good things to come,
they had put an end to it before its beginning; for before this
they had left ſacrifcing Goats and Calves, and offered up
two poor ſheep in ſacrifice upon their Altar-Stocks, (to wit)

in obedience to his Spirit I went (with my beloved Brother,
<hi>John Rous</hi>) into that Patent; and ſeeing and hearing of the
ſufferings inflicted upon the people of God inhabiting there,
with the wrongs, ſufferings and abuſes ſuſtained by me and
others of the ſervants of God, I drew up theſe particulars
following, and ſent them before me to the Governor and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Aſſiſtants the day before, that ſo they might
not be unacquainted with the matter; which when I came
there (according to the Will of God as he had ſhewed me) I
was taken up in the ſtreet and caſt into Bonds, according to
the malice of the Devil; And when I came before them with

kept far from tranſgreſſion, but in truth, for not depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of their Colony when their Conſtable (ſo called)
commanded us, having the grounds here following to make
good.</p>
               <p>1. I who am called and choſen of God to bear the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Jeſus (the Word of God) againſt all unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and oppreſſion in all ſorts of people whatſoever, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
formerly been in this Colony, and before your Court
held at Plymouth, and being cleared (ſo far as I remember)
without the leaſt clauſe of the tranſgreſſion of any Law of
God whatſoever, laid to my Charge, the which I charged
upon you after my Tryal, by vvay of falſe Impriſonment,
and required thereupon to know who might diſcharge the
houſe vvhereunto I was confined; the anſwer was made (as I
remember) by <hi>John Alden</hi> Magiſtrate, after asking me if I had
Silver, told me it ſhould be left to my freedom whether I
vvould do it, or leave it unto them; ſince which time (and in
my abſence) I am informed that I am recorded in your Court
Book for being convicted of ſeveral Errors, and at that time
neither the Convictions nor the Convictors mentioned to
me, as the grounds before mentioned makes manifeſt.</p>
               <p>2. Again I am informed that it is given and received in
upon Oath againſt me, That I have held forth, and therewith
ſtand charged in your Court-Book for ſome unſound and
untrue Doctrines.</p>
               <p>3. I require it of you, that ſuch as hath given Oath againſt
me, with all ſuch as were eye and ear-witneſſes, by whom
theſe things were ſpoken, may appear before me and you,
face to face.</p>
               <p>4. I am unſatisfied touching the ſufferings ſuſtained by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Brend</hi> and <hi>John Copeland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. The injuſtice and unparalled means uſed againſt us the
ſaid people for the depriving and diſappointing of our peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
meeting together to wait upon God in the way of his
Worſhip, according to the life and practice of the Saints and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95128:20"/>
holy men of God declared of, and holden forth in Scripture.</p>
               <p>6. The Impoſitions of Fines, Taxes and Oppreſſions laid
upon the people of God in theſe parts.</p>
               <p>7. To know the ground of your late Laws whereby you
do theſe things againſt them and us; and to hear it made
forth how any that fears God, and profeſſes him in the leaſt
meaſure, can be bound by Oath or otherwiſe, to execute or
proſecute the ſaid Laws with a ſafe conſcience.</p>
               <p>8. Whether you will not grant unto us who are by the
ſcorners called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and all other free-born Engliſh men,
the liberty and exerciſe of a pure conſcience, (<hi>Proviſo</hi>) That
this Liberty do not extend to liſcentiouſneſs in the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>9. Whether it doth not ſtand good in Equity and Juſtice,
That ſuch as will have ſuch a Miniſtry as muſt be upholden
by Tythes, or Hire, or Gifts, or Rewards, and ſaith it is their
conſcience to have ſuch, Whether they onely ought not to
uphold them? And ſeeing you have, and may have this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
Whether you will not grant that ſuch as have a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
freely received from the Lord, and for his ſake freely
gives it, ought not in conſcience, and are not to have their
liberty? And whether all ſuch as are the children of God,
and are taught of God, and needs not that any man teach
them, (according to the Scriptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 8. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 27.
3 <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 8.) ought to be debarred from this Teacher, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
contrary to their conſciences to uphold another, ſeeing
it is written, <hi>They that help, and he that is holpen, ſhall both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
together?</hi> Therefore had not people need to take heed what
they do?</p>
               <p>10. I require of you the true ground and cauſe why <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Newland,</hi> with <hi>Ralph Allin,</hi> was retained and kept priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
from their Families, they being both very great, having
many ſmall children, with Relations and occaſions, from the
eight Month, 1657. until the firſt Month, 1658. putting
them thereby to great loſs in expence, beſide all other loſſes
and damages which did thereby enſue.</p>
               <p>11. By what Law <hi>Edward Perry's</hi> Goods, with <hi>Peter Gants</hi>
and others, were forced from them, without making reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95128:21"/>
or account of them to the owners in the leaſt? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theſe things muſt be continued without regulating, this
knowing, that for theſe things, and all ſuch, you muſt and
ought to give an account? For deeds done in corners muſt no
longer be hid, but muſt be preached upon the houſe top to
the ſhame and condemnation of him and them that acts it.</p>
               <p>12. Whether you acknowledge it to be juſt, and done by
your order, the taking away of <hi>Arthur Hewlands</hi> Iron Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
belonging to his Draught, to the quite diſabling and
diſappointing him of the uſe of the ſame, to his loſs and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage?
And whether theſe things ſo continued will not by
probability be the ruinating and deſtroying of Families, and
the undoing of the Common-Wealth.</p>
               <p>13. Again, <hi>William Allin, Thomas Greenfeild, Peter Gant,</hi>
with others, have their Goods lately diſtrained, and part
forced from one or more of them, without their tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any Law of God; and whether theſe things you intend
to continue and tollerate without making reſtitution, yea or
nay? The particulars of theſe things plainly laid open, will
yeild an ill ſavour, ſuch a one as his Name you make uſe of,
will be too ſhort a cover for.</p>
               <p>14. Whether you acknowledge the Governor and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as it is now eſtabliſhed in old <hi>England?</hi> And if ſo, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you ought to act contrary to it? And whether this Law
of yours for the baniſhing of us, is not contrary to it? And
whether the ſpirit that would baniſh us out of this Pattent, if
it had power would not do the ſame in baniſhing us out of
old <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the dominions thereof?
And whether this be to do as you would be done unto, yea or
nay? Is not baniſhed men turned baniſhers, and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcience-ſake?
Will not ſuch as this produce the plagues of
God upon a people that he hath raiſed up from the duſt, who
hath groaned under the grief of oppreſſion, and now are
become the chief of oppreſſors.</p>
               <p>15. Whether we the ſaid people may have peaceble &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
commerce and trading into any part of your Pattent, as
occaſion ſhall offer, from Road-Iſland, or elſevvhere?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:95128:21"/>

they would, that ſo they might ſee the patience and faith of the
Saints, both in priſons and ſtocks, for which end they put four
there, for owning of us in the veiw of the people; after they
had executed their wills upon us, by vvhiping us, one of their

acted on us, the people cryed out againſt (there being at that

they fined us five pounds a peice more that Court; and not long
after the Court, the Marſhall came for the cattle which they
had formerly marked, and alſo for the laſt five pounds; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Edward Perry</hi> demanded the laſt fine, his anſvver being
much as the former, the Marſhall went from him to the reſtof
his company, and he having brought his cattle out of the woods
into his field, and having a fat Cow amongſt them to kill, alſo
having a man to help him, went about it, the Marſhals and their
company being in the field talking together, and he that help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him driving the Cow to the place where ſhe was killed; one
of the Marſhals asked him whoſe Cow that was? he anſvvered,
What if it be mine? ſo no more words being ſpoken, he
brought the Cow to the place, and vvhen vve were ready to
knock her down; one that helped the Marſhal to drive the
cattle, came in haſt both in body and ſpirit, and ſaid, do not
kill that Cow; we asked him whether he were the Marſhal, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
whether he had any order to take the Cow, and required to
ſee an order; whereupon came <hi>George Barloe</hi> one of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals,
he was asked whether he had any order, and required if
he had to ſhew it; but he ſaid he had not, but the other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal
had was abſent; ſo we ſeeing no order we killed the Cow,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95128:24"/>
and after we had killed her, the other Marſhal came, of whom
an order was demanded if he had any, but he would ſhew none
although it was required that before they took any cattle out of
the field to ſee their order, but none they would ſhew, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
drive away two Cows for the laſt five pounds fine;
and ſo great is their rage that for that vvhich was killed, they
required another as good of him that helped to kill her, becauſe
he knocked her down, and ſince <hi>John Alden</hi> hath ſent a warrant
or mittimus without examination to the Conſtable to take his
body, and to carry him to Plimouth, and deliver him to the
Marſhall, there to be kept till the firſt moneth 59. this being
in the ninth moneth 58. ſo he was had before <hi>John Alden</hi> and
<hi>William Collier,</hi> who hath bound him to let them have as good a
Covv, and to anſwer it at the next Court, though it was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared by <hi>Edward Parry</hi> to <hi>John Alden,</hi> that if he had
ought againſt any man, it muſt be againſt him, for he that
helped was as his ſervant and did it by his order; vvhich thing
he made light of, and ſince hath ſent the Marſhall, who hath
ſeized upon one of his Cows, ſo that for that five pound from
<hi>Edward Perry</hi> they have taken three Covvs, which are worth
eleven pounds; Behold what a violent cruſh this is, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
twenty ſeven pounds for fifteen pounds! is this to deliver the
innocent and help the needy? ſurely the proverb that Wiſdom
ſpake is true, which ſaith; As a roaring Lyon, and a raging
Bear, ſo is a wicked Ruler to a poor people; Alſo taken from
<hi>Robert Harper</hi> two young Oxen and one Heifer for ten pounds
fine, worth thirteen pounds; and marked from <hi>Ralph Allin</hi> in
cattle, eleven pounds ten ſhillings for ten pounds fine, and from
<hi>Thomas Greenfeild</hi> is taken two Cows, and from <hi>Richard Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>
for the whole fifteen pounds fine, they have taken four Cows,
one of them with a bell about her neck, alſo a call, all which
are vvorth ſixteen pounds: Alſo from <hi>VVilliam Allin,</hi> whom
they have fined fifteen pound, they have taken two Covvs and
a Steer, which are worth thirteen pounds, the laſt five pounds

the waſte, with his back turned to the Magiſtrates, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of them that ſtood by, had 36 ſtripes; but he himſelf knows
not how many; for they had no ſooner done (then I heard him
ſay that his Body was all as if it had been covered with Balm)
then turning his face to the Magiſtrates, they brought a pan
with hot burning coals and their Iron in it, and took his right
hand made faſt in the ſtocks, and burnt it more deep then ever
I ſaw any impreſſion upon any quick creature, after which
being looſed, the Lord opened his mouth in prayer, and he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
his voice towards heaven, from whence came his help,
who covered the heads of his enemies with ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
but himſelf with peace, love and joy; after which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times they profered him his deliverance paying his fine and
his fees: His anſwer was always ſuch, that if they would
do it for two pence, they might never have it from him, nor
none by his conſent; or if he would but promiſe it, which thing
he could not do; but a Dutchman whoſe face he never ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ingaged unto them for twenty Nobles altogether without
his conſent, which they wickedly received in ſtead of ten
pounds, making their Law a lie; the aforeſaid Dutchman being
asked a reaſon why he would offer it, ſaid his own ſpirit within
him made him do it, beſides him not another face appeared with
him, nor for him, only they ſeemed to force ſalves upon him,
for the killing of the fire, the which he refuſed, not needing it;
the Marſhal being a malicious man and much tormented, would
have a reaſon why he would not receive it his anſwer was, he
could not ſuffer a dog to lick his ſores, (am I a Dog ſaith the
Marſhal?) And <hi>William Brend</hi> and ſeveral others, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

all threatned and ſent away in the manner of Baniſhment, ſome

                     </gap>rd,</hi> it being
the will of God, that his ſeed ſhould be ſought out in all parts,
we were moved to go to <hi>Hartford,</hi> (in the Juriſdiction of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>anit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticote</hi>)
for that purpoſe, and after ſome paſſages at the Town;
which will not be needful to relate, we being at the Ordinary
were ſent for by the Governour to come to his houſe, and we
went; where were aſſembled the Governour, a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
man, and ſome of the Magiſtrates, ſo called, and
their Prieſt called <hi>Samuel Stone;</hi> after ſome queſtions asked us
by the Governour as from whence we came, and whether we
were going, of which we gave him an account as the Lord gave
us freedom; <hi>Samuel Stone</hi> asked us, What God is? we ſaid a
Spirit, then with his Logick he did thus cavil; a Spirit is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
and an Angel is a creature, God is not a creature, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God is not a Spirit; the which we did deny, it being both
contrary to Scripture and truth, but by it he ſhewed how learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he was that had learned more of Logick then of God; for had
he known God he dared not thus to have ſpoken: After ſome
more words he ſaid further, That God is the Author of all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and all arts, the which we denied, and put him to prove it,
and in ſtead of proving it, he went to raiſe another Argument
nothing to the purpoſe, but we kept him to what he ſaid, and put
him to prove it by Scripture, but he would not nor could not;
then we ſaid, There is a wiſdome, which is <hi>earthly, ſenſual, and
deviliſh;</hi> and God is not the Author of that wiſdome, and God
will deſtroy the wiſdome of the wiſe, and bring to nought the
underſtanding of the prudent; and we ſaid, God would not
deſtroy the wiſdome which he is the author of, ſo this learned
man vvas much puſled, not being able to make good what he
had ſaid in the face of many of his hearers that were then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
then the Governour ſeeing him thus taken in his own
net, did help him ſaying, That was not wiſdome, but folly, but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95128:28"/>
God is the Author of all true wiſdome; we anſwered if <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
had ſaid ſo at firſt, we ſhould have eaſily conſented to it, then
<hi>Samuel Stone</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle ſpoke there improperly, but we
affirmed that the Spirit of God always ſpoke properly: After
this he raiſed another lying Argument, which was this; None
are ſaved without a promiſe, you have no promiſe in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and therefore are not ſaved; to which we replyed, the
Promiſe is, <hi>I will give him for a Covenant, a light, that he may be
my Salvation to the ends of the earth, to as many as beleeve in him;</hi>
we beleeve in him, and are in the ends of the earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are ſaved by him; to which he objected nothing, ſo after
ſome words the day being ſpent, one of their Magiſtrates read
us their Law, that we vvere not to ſtay in their Colonie: Thus
may all ſee how theſe four united Colonies, as they are called,
have agreed to baniſh Chriſt out of their coaſts by a Law; O
what a brotherhood is this, that thus uſeth the friends of God;
and abuſeth his ſervants ſons and daughters by whipping,
burning, and otherwiſe mangling their bodies! but it is that
the Scriptures might be fulfilled which ſaith, <hi>They ſhall hale you
before Rulers and Governours for my Names ſake, and as they have
done unto me, ſo will they do unto you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>becauſe they
know not the Father nor me;</hi> yet amongſt all the Colonies found
we not the like moderation as in this, moſt of the Magiſtrates
being more noble, then thoſe of the other Colonies; after ſome
dayes ſtay, we departed from that Town towards <hi>Road-Iſland,</hi>
and by this thou mayeſt ſee what husks the Prieſts of New-England
feeds their Flocks with: Thus in ſhort have I given
thee an account of ſome of the Doctrines of one of the higheſt
of the New-England Phariſees, who is accounted the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

                  <hi>Reader,</hi> I being one with the ſuffering ſeed, was after ſome
travels and ſufferings, as thou mayeſt underſtand, in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
parts moved to go to New-England, and was brought
to Road-Iſland according to the will or him who had moved
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95128:29"/>
me, and after ſpending ſome few dayes there, I was moved to
go into other parts of the land, where I met with the moſt
loathſome hypocriſie, and abominable deceit that ever I ſaw
or heard of, and that committed by thoſe who pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be no leſs then members of the Church of Chriſt, but
how diſagreeable their practices are, to the ſpirit of him whom
they profeſs, if thou art one who haſt taſted of it, thou wilt
eaſily judge; and I can truely ſay that under this pretence of
theirs, almoſt all manner of wickedneſs is covered, pride, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,
envy, deceitful dealings (as vvitneſs many of their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
the Merchants upon the Exchange in London and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
who for it hath often cryed out againſt it) bloodſhed,
luſt, and what elſe might be mentioned; and ſuch hypocriſie
have I ſeen amongſt the higheſt members of their chiefeſt Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
that I have ſometimes ſaid within my ſelf, A man that
hath a covetous and deceitful rotten heart, lying lips which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
among them, &amp; a ſmooth fawning flattering tongue and
ſhort hair, and a deadly enmity againſt thoſe that are called
Quakers and others that oppoſe their wayes, ſuch a hypocrite
is a fit man to be a member of any New England Church; a
plain demonſtration of which thou maiſt ſee in their character
of their Religion written in blood, wherein all is not written
that they have done, and we have ſuffered by them; but the
chiefeſt heads are gathered together, and preſented to publike
view, that the ſimple may be informed, and their cruelty and
oppreſſion laid open to the honeſt hearted, and God glorified
who hath counted us worthy to ſuffer for his names ſake, for
whoſe ſake we have been accounted as ſheep for the ſlaughter,
and killed all the day long by the Butchers, ſo that if thou
ſhould ask me who vvere the chief upholders of their Church
and Religion, I ſhould anſwer, their Goalor, Hangman, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and Deputy-Governor, and not their Paſtor and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and Elder, and Deacon, for if they can well avoid it, they
care not for coming where we are, unleſs it be when we are
called before their Court, to faſten ſome falſe accuſation on us
if they can, the which-they have not ſpared; and touching the
matter aud manner of their vvorſhip, it is moſt like the ridged
Presbyters, ſo called, but a little differing from the late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95128:29"/>
onely they uſe not their blind ſervice and ſurp-cloaths,
but in ſtead of them have inventions of their own, and in
cruelty are nothing behind them (for which God will take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
on them.) It was ſo ordered of the Lord, that I with my
beloved brother <hi>Humph. Norton,</hi> were moved to go to the
great meeting-houſe at Boſton upon one of their Lector dayes;
a little after the Goalor a member of their Church had nigh
murthered one of our friends that was then in priſon, where
vve found <hi>John Norton</hi> their Teacher ſet up, who like a babling
Phariſee, run over a vain repetition near an hour long (like an
impudent ſmoth-fac'd harlot, who was telling her Paramoors
a long fair ſtory of her husbands kindneſs, while nothing but
vvantonneſs and wickedneſs is in her heart) when his glaſs was
out, he begun his Sermon, wherein amongſt many lifeleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
he ſpake much of the danger of theſe who are called
quakers, and did much labor to ſtain their innocency, with
many feigned words; and did often call upon the people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

ſtrive to limit his ſpirit (by your unrighteous Laws) from the
gathering it home unto himſelf, having forged and invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Laws contrary to God, Chriſt, and the Scriptures, and
thereby hath acted ſuch things as is to be admired; (clear
your ſelves as wel as you can:) And ſeeing they are grounded
upon none of theſe three, examine from whence they have
their riſe, and from what ground, ſeeing the Devil onely is
the Author of all unrighteouſneſs, malice and lyes; the three
firſt lyes againſt us, is, That we are Curſed, a Sect, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
the fourth, That we take it upon us that we are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

I continue a ſlave to the Jaylor, which evill work and intent of

Caolor to take me away: the ſentence being paſt upon us both
to be ſeverely whipt, and not ſpared the ſecond day of the
week following, they executed their malice upon us ten ſtripes a
piece, cruelly laid on with a threefold cord, having knots
at ends for cauſing it to tare the fleſh, ſo to torment the

God for his preſence, at which the people was aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;

Robert Weſtcot of Warvvick in the Collony of Road-Iland.</p>
               <p>Alſo Horred Gardiner, a mother of many children, and
an inhabitant in. Newport upon Road-Iland, being moved by

that no fleſh that had looked upon it with the fleſhly eye,
could have expected (conſidering her condition) ſhe could have

the day following, before John Indicot Governor of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,

their cruelty, kneeled down ſaying, The Lord forgive you for
you know not what you do; a woman ſtanding by, ſaid, Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

theirs before the faces of all people; the other through
wrath, malice, cruel mockings, reviling language, ſcourgings

down, and coming into a lower room where the mill ſtood, he
haled me towards it, and bid me go to work; which refuſing for

and alſo the friend that vvas vvith me, ſo he lockt us up in the
room; again, but having been kept from food about five days,
and the body being weakened both for want of air and diet,
the fleſh and blood mixed together with the blows, ſo that ſoon
after it was laid down upon the boards, the natural ſtrength
being much ſpent, and the life over powred, it was near de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from him, ſo that the cry aroſe and fear poſſeſt the
hypocrites and guilt the murderer, ſo that the priſon doors
was ſet open, and all means uſed by themſelves to ſave life if
poſſible; but by the power of Jeſus was he raiſed up contrary and
beyond their expectation; the Governor ſent his ſon &amp; Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian
to ſee what might be done, great fear being fallen upon
them, but no uſe was made of them and leaſt they themſelves
ſhould be called in queſtion, they caſt the thing upon their
keeper, and although a member of their body, their intent was
if danger he ſhould ſuffer firſt, the generallity being much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with it, would not be ſatisfied till they dealt with their
brother the keeper for it, for which end the Governor publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a fooliſh paper, whereby to blind the eyes of the ſimple, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95128:41"/>
they would deal with him at their Court; but their chief
Prieſt <hi>John Norton</hi> taking part with their <hi>Judas,</hi> and juſtified
him therein, ſaying that <hi>William Brend</hi> indeavored to beat their
Goſpel Ordinances black and blew; and if he was beaten
black and blew, it was juſt upon him, and if they called the
Gaolor in queſtion for it, he would appear on his behalf (Mark)
if this Goſpel of theirs were but a figure, and bring this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
to his parable, and the by-word uſed amongſt the people,
<hi>True blew will not ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſubſtance nor figure, it will alter its die in to any colour. verily I
obſerved it, the Prieſts belonging to that office, as was the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of darkneſs that was over it, ſo was the habit and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they were clad with all, and as the grey of the morning
appeared, ſo changed they their coats: Firſt, the black Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
from the Biſhop to the pooreſt Sir <hi>John,</hi> that he licenced,
ſet forth all black; as theſe removed, then the greys appeared
the mingled pendant, and the outſide waſhing Anabaptiſt; thus
is the black and blew Goſpel beaten with every blow that God
gives unto the Kingdom of the devil, and reſt he will not untill
he have made the black white, and the darkneſs light before
him; and thus of a truth J will ſeal with my heart, that every
peoples condition is according to their colour; therefore let
<hi>John Norton,</hi> and all New England take heed of that Goſpel
that can be beaten black and blew, for the colour of the coat of
Chriſt is fair and beautiful and changes not.</p>
               <p>Again, it came to paſs that for ſix or ſeven days, a death or a
cruel ſuffering about <hi>Boſton</hi> followed <hi>Humphery Norton,</hi> the
ſenſe of which with the ſtrength of the emnity againſt the
righteous ſeed with weight of the burden, then upon him, took
from him the nouriſhment and comfort that is in the creatures,
and alſo the refreſhment that ariſeth from ſleep, and reſt; laying
his load (having freedom ſo to do) before his beloved brother
<hi>John Rous,</hi> an heir with him of the ſame promiſe, and a ſufferer
with him for the ſame ſeed, who willingly took it upon him to
draw with me in the ſame yoak, being ſenſible of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of our repairing thither, to bear our parts with the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of hope, which at that time ſtood bound for the teſtimony
of Jeſus, the Word of God, which after our travel day and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95128:41"/>
night to accompliſh, we came into <hi>Boſton</hi> the very day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>William Brend</hi> had been laid as one dead with blovvs;
and the firſt relation we had was concerning him, and how they
vvas laboring to ſave his life; an inhabitant of the Town ſeeing
us, being a ſober man and not addicted to blood, like the reſt,
underſtanding what we were, told <hi>Humphrey Norton,</hi> he had been
expected certain moneths, and wiſhed him if he loved his life
to depart, or otherwiſe he was a dead man; but ſuch was the
neceſſity, that if all that Town had been his, and he would have
given it me to depart thence, we could not, for the people lay
upon us, the ſeed lay upon us, and the ſuffering for which we
were appointed vvith the ſouls of the people; ſuch vvas our
load, that beſide him that laid it upon us, vvho alſo took it
from us, no fleſh nor place could caſe us, vvho according to his
vvill, and in the manner follovviag lead us into it, and through
it, it being their lecture day, ſo called, and alſo the market for
the Country; after the time of their meeting, thither vve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
after the hearing of the vvoſul ſacrifice of the dead,
vvhere the earth ſpake, and the grave uttered her voice, and
death fed death through the painted Sepulchre <hi>John Norton,</hi> and
the ſeed in ſorrovv mourned and ſuffered under it; after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of this, <hi>Humphery Norton</hi> ſtood up and ſaid, verily this
is the ſacrifice vvhich the Lord God accepts not, for vvhileſt
vvith the ſame ſpirit, that you ſin you preach, and pray and
ſing, that ſacrifice is abomination, ſuch vvas thrir order, that
before half of the vvords vvere uttered he vvas haled dovvn,
yet uttered vvere they all before they got him forth; that ſame
day in the heat of their fury, they called him vvith <hi>John Rous</hi>
before them in the ſame place, for vvhich vvords <hi>Humphrey
Norton</hi> (after a long and frivous examination) vvas charged
vvith blaſphemy, in vvhich time vve required of them either to
act according to the Lavv of God, or vvholeſome lavv of the
Engliſh Nation and ſpare us not; neither of which they would
come nigh, whereupon we required of them an appeal, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would refer our cauſe to the chief Magiſtrate, or whom he
pleaſed to appoint, this we did once and again, whereby to
leave them without excuſe; this they ſlighted and diſregarded
the Governor and Deputy with one conſent, ſaying, no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95128:42"/>
to <hi>England,</hi> no appealing to <hi>England,</hi> with other words
of deriſion, who forthwith after this ſentenced us unto whiping,
ſuch is the confuſion of their Law, that although their charge
was blaſphemy, yet they ſentenced us for another thing, alſo
tempting John Rous with flattering words ſeeking to inſnare
him, which he ſleighting and diſregarding, ſavouring the ſpirit,
and knowing the malice and cruel wickedneſs they had uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others, who then ſome of them were in bonds by famine
and cloſe keeping, laboring to conſume or ſtrangle them for
want of food and air, ſome three, four, and five dayes without
any manner of food; ſome eight, nine, and ten dayes without
one bit of bread allowed by them or ſuffered to come at them;
thus labouring for their lives, or in the leaſt to cauſe them to
blaſpheme, from both which the innocent was preſerved: ſo in
the nick of time Iohn Rous in the audience of all the people
required of them convenient food for our money, or otherwiſe
if vve periſhed, our blood be upon them; vvhich there vvas
granted, and the javves of their vvicked Lavves all rent and
broken: Thus vvere vve coutinued from the fifth untill the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day, being the Jevves Sabbath, they offered us tvvo poor
quakers (ſo called) upon their Altar-ſtocks, after vvhich tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
us to depart, if vve vvould hire their Convoy; vvich nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
needing it, nor in conſcience vve could not do it, vvere
continued in priſon the Week follovving; ſuch vvas their
malice, that they called their council as they ſaid, vvho gave
forth an Order for the Whipping of the quakers then in priſon,
(vvho vvere ten in number) tvvice a Week, the firſt time with
fiftten ſtripes with their three-fold cord; the ſecond time eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen;
and ſo from time to time to haue three added euery
time till further order: [By this Law they might have vvhipt
us unto death, and if ſo, unto the grave, and there alſo if they
had a minde.] We asked for a copy of this Ooder, but vvas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
it, for it vvas our deſire to have it, that the variety of
lies vherevvith it vvas filled, might have been preſented to the
vievv of all men: But ſuch is the ſubtilty of the Serpent among
them, that he will keep all he doth as much in darkneſs as may
be, leſt being brought to the Light, he ſhould be diſcovered in
the eyes of all, and condemned; So calling us to the execution
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95128:42"/>
of the firſt part of this their later Order, out of ten they chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
four vvhereupon to execute their Wrath, to vvit, John Rous,
William Leddra, Thomas Harris, (vvhom they had Whipped
once before, as vvell as vve, and contrary to Lavv beaten vvith
aboue tvventy ſtrokes) Humphrey Norton being the fourth, us
four they as barbarouſly beat, as a cruel man vvould beat his
horſe; the people beholding, and ſeeing us ſo uſed aboue our
old Wounds, the cry againſt cruelty increaſed, Sodome vvas
troubled, Aegypt vvas affraid, and all old Jeruſalem in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar,
Blood at that Seaſon, they had ſufficient; So that the
other ſix they touched not, though vvillingly they put off
their Clothes, and tendered their backs; their adverſaries ſlunk
avvay like dogs vvho had ouer-filled themſelues vvith Sheeps
blood, for vvhich they vvere afraid to be hanged; Who hauing
thus ſatiated their cruell appetites, turned us forth, to their
ſhame and contempt. This vvas one of the main Articles of
their Faith, contrary to that command in the Lavv vvhich ſaith,
<hi>Thou ſhale do no murder,</hi> (theirs ſaith, Thou ſhalt.)</p>

               <p>Again <hi>Nicholas Phelps</hi> an Inhabitant of Salem, although a
weak man through the infirmities of his body, for not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
their wills was called in queſtion by <hi>Daniel Deniſon</hi> and
ſome others, and by them was committed to priſon at Ipſwitch,
and there was whipt three times in five days, becauſe he refuſed
to work for them, which manifeſts that though a weak body,
yet a ſtrong faith, not in the leaſt beanding unto them, and when
they could not overcome him by cruelty, the ſhame and
guilt of what they had done lying on them, they went thus
to worke, agreeing with a man in the Towne to doe
as followeth: On a certain day a man who having had
former acquaintance and friendſhip with him came to <hi>Nicholas</hi>
and had him to his houſe, and after a while got him to walk
with him into his field, and after ſome ſpace of time ſpake to
<hi>Nicholas</hi> to this purpoſe, that he thought that he would bee
ſet at liberty ere long: <hi>Nicholas</hi> not knowing vvhich vvay it
vvould be accompliſhed; as for to vvork to fulfill their wills,
he could not: So after a vvhile the man fell to vvork about
a ſtone vvall, and coming to a ſtone that he could not lift,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95128:43"/>
it vvas ſo big, <hi>Nicholas</hi> (being charitable) aſſiſted him to lift
the ſtone, and lay it in the place vvhere it ſhould lie, for
vvhich doing he vvas releaſed, becauſe hee did ſomething
that they called vvork, although it did not tend any thing
to the fulfilling of their Law, but herein doth the hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
of their Magiſtrates appear.</p>
               <p>Again it came to paſs, that we two <hi>Chriſtopher Holder</hi> and
<hi>John Copeland,</hi> being moved by the Lord to go to Boſton, ſet
forth thitherwards on the third of the ſixth moneth 1658.
and the ſame day came to a town in that Juriſdiction called.
Dedham; it being neer evening, we turned into the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
where we lodged that night, and early on the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there came two Conſtables, with ſome others, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of us, Whither we were going? Our anſwer was,
We were paſſing towards Boſton; then they ſaid, they had
a Warrant to have us to Boſton before the Magiſtrates; then
we required to ſee it, but they would not ſhew it to us; ſo
after ſome hours, one Conſtable and two men with him,
had us to Boſton, and brought us to the Governors houſe,
who when he ſaw us, being perplexed in ſpirit, ſaid in a rage,
You ſhall be ſure to have your ears cut off: Then he asked
us our names; ſo we told him: then he ſaid, We had been
here twice before, and ſaid, What? you remain in the ſame
opinion you was before: Anſwer, We remain in the fear of
the Lord; He ſaid, you can ſpeak never a trne Word; and
further ſaid, He looked upon it to be a great judgement of
God to them, that we were ſuffered to come ſo oft amongſt
them to trouble them, and ſaid, We were the worſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
that ever he heard or read of; and asked us, Why wee
came? ſeeing we knew they would not receive us: Anſ.
The Lord God hath commanded us, and we could not but
com; then he ſaid, the Lord command you to com? it vvas the
Devil; &amp; urged us to prove our Cal by the Scriptures: we anſwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red,
our names are not vvritten in the Scriptures; he ſaid, he
did believe we ſpake true; for your names is not written in the
Scriptures; and he further ſaid, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> vvas ſomething if vvee
could make it appear that vve vvere ſent of God: We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvered,
That vvhil he ſtood in unbelief, though vve ſpake
never ſo plain to him, yet he vvould not believe; then one
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95128:43"/>
                  <hi>Nathaniel Williams</hi> ſtanding by, ſpake to this to this effect; Seeing
vve knevv that they vvould not believe us, it muſt needs bee
out of malice that vve came: Anſvver, The Lord God vvho
ſearcheth all hearts, knovves that vve came not in malice;
then the Governor asked us, Whether vve did believe Chriſts
Body vvas in Heaven? We anſvvered, Wee knovv that his
Body is in heaven; Then he ſaid, he vvould ſet <hi>Humphrey
Norton</hi> on our backs, for he vvould not ſay ſo, (vvhich thing
is falſe concerning <hi>Humphrey Norton:</hi>) So after ſome other
vvords, he ſent for the Goalor, and bid him take us avvay,
ſaying, You ſhall hear from us to morrovv; ſo hee had us
avvay, and put us in the houſe of Correction, (as they call
it, but vve knovv it to be the houſe of Oppreſſion) and on
the morrovv, being the ſift day, they had a Court, before
vvhich vve vvere brought; and when we came before them,
they cauſed our hats to be pulled off, and thrown on the
ground; then the Gouernor ſaid, You were before me ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday,
and I asked you to prove your Call hither, but you
did not, becauſe you ſaid I would not believe you; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I aske you to prove it before this people, and it may be
they will believe you; then we asked if they would belieue
us when we ſpake the truth? The Gouernor ſaid, Yes, if you
proue it by Scripture; We anſwered as before, to prove our
Call hither by expreſs words of Scripture, that we cannot;
becauſe our names (neither this place) is not mentioned in
Scripture; but that wee have examples in the Scriptures
from the Prophets and Apostles, who in obedience to the
Lord travelled from place to place as we do, that wee can
prove: Then John Indicot Gouernor, laughed and ſaid,
Are you Prophets and Apoſtles? Then he asked, Whether
we did belieue that Chriſt had a Body in heauen diſtinct
from the bodies of his members? Anſ. That Chriſts body
is diuided from his members, that we do not belieue; then
he ſaid to the people they mean his Myſtical Body; then we
ſaid, we know no ſuch word in Scripture as Myſticall, and
put him to proue by the Scripture, that Chriſt hath two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
then another man ſtood up and asked us, Whether we
did not belieue that Chriſt had a body in heauen made of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95128:44"/>
ſinews, fleſh and bone, diſtinct from the bodies of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?
Then we asked what the bodie of the members of
Chriſt is? To which they gaue no anſwer; but asked us
ſome other queſtions: but we ſeeing they ſought to inſuare
us, ſaid to them, It is beſt for us to be ſilent; for you ask que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
for nothing but to inſnare us, for you will not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with any anſwer: Then the Gouernor ſaid, Sure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
we do ſeek to inſnare yon; then the Secretary ſpake
to this effect, Theſe men haue been here twice before, and
hath receiued the Law, and was ſent out of this Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and now is come the third time to ſowe their damnable
Hereſies, and to infect the hearts of this people with their
poyſonous Doctrines; and wrote an Order, and deliuered
it to the Gouernor, who deliuered it to the Goalor, and
bid him take us away, and keep us according to his Order;
So he had us to the ſame houſe again, and the next morning
the Goalor came to us, and asked us to work; then we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to ſee his Order; ſo he ſhewed it to us, which was to
this effect:</p>

ſaying he had an order to have us whipt twice a week
if we would not work, and ſhewed us the order that was made
for the other friends, whereby four of them ten ws whipt,
contrary to their Law; but we gave them no anſwer at that
time; then he ſaid he would give us time to conſider of it till
noon; ſo ſome hours after he came to us againe, and asked us
as before; then we anſwered, that we were ſhut up, and were
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95128:44"/>
not at liberty to work; then he pulled us and ſhut us up where
the work was, where he kept us till evening, and then had us
into the common Goale; and in the morning had us down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
where the work was, and ſaid he would keep us there till
our backs was ſlaſht; ſo he ſet us bread and pottage by the
work, but we had no freedome to meddle with either. So at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
we were had in the common-goal again, where we were
ſhut up in a cloſe room, in which place we remained eight
dayes, they not knowing of any thing that we eat; then the
Goalors wife came to us, and ſaid, If you will have milk, you
may have it bought for you, and if we would have beer, wee
might buy it of her; ſo from that time the other friends which
were in the houſe of Correction, were ſuffered to put into us
at a window what we wanted.</p>
               <p>Sometime after <hi>Chriſtopher Holder</hi> and <hi>John Copeland</hi> was put
into priſon, I <hi>John Rous</hi> was commanded of the Lord to go to
Boſton alſo; and as way was made, according to the Will of
God I prepared to go thitherwards; and on the 25. of the 6
moneth, 1658. in the evening I came to Boſton, and after I had
got the horſe I rode on ſet up in a ſtable at an Inne, I went into
the houſe, and after ſome ſtay there, I being not deſirous to be a
ſnare to any man, I declared who I was to the man of the houſe,
who fetcht, the Marſhal, and he had me to the Governors houſe,
and when I was brought before the Governor, he came towards
me in a lofty manner, and ſaid, Put off thy hat; I anſwered, I
cannot; ſo my hat at his commandment was taken off: Then
the Governor asked me, Why I came to this Town? I ſaid, To
viſit my friends in priſon, and if I may have liberty, (if they
want any thing) to miniſter to their neceſſities; he anſwered,
in deriſion, That is a charitable Deed; Why did not Humphrey
Norton come? I replied, Thou had beſt ask him the next time
thou ſeeſt him; He asked me, Whether I had any Letters? To
vvhich I vvas ſilent; ſo he bid the Marſhall ſearch mee, vvho
did according to his command; and the Governor took ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Papers out of my Letter-Caſe, and kept them; and after
ſome queſtions about the Bodie of Chriſt, to vvhich I anſvvered
him according to the Scriptures; and after telling mee, That
this is no nevv thing that we held; and ſaid, If he had time, he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95128:45"/>
would ſhew me out of Books which he had in his houſe, That
ſeverall Hereticks before us held the ſame opinion; To which I
anſwered little, knowing that the Spirit of God is pure from
all Hereſie, whatſoever men who are blind may ſay of it: Then
he bid the Marſhal have me to priſon; the which was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Warrant or Mittimus that I did ſee or hear of.</p>
               <p>On the ſeven of the ſeventh moneth, we three was ſent for
from the priſon before the Court of Aſſiſtants held at Boſton,
who when we came, commanded our hats to be taken off; the
which being done, after ſome time of ſilence, the Goalor asked
us one by one, Whether wee knew the Law againſt quakers?
Then we anſwered, We knew their Law. Then he asked, Why
we came thither? We anſwered, The Lord God, whoſe Law is
juſt and equal, required it of us to come, and in obedience to
him we came. Then one called Major Deniſon asked us, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
every man is not Maſter of his own houſe? We anſwered,
The Lord God is Maſter of Heaven and Earth, and he can ſend
whither he will, and whom he will. Then the Governor ſaid,
Were you not here before, &amp; ſent away, &amp; now are come again?
To which Richard Bellingham added, In contempt of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
We anſwered, Amos muſt propheſie at Bethel, although he
be forbidden. Then Major Deniſon ſaid, If a man ſhould fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn
another man from coming into his houſe, and ſhould
ſtand with a pike or ſword at his door, and yet for all this, the
other ſhould attempt to come in, and ſhould be ſlain, Would
not this mans blood be upon his own head? Anſwer, If the
Lord ſent a man to ſuch a mans houſe to forewarn him, or any
in his houſe to repent of the Judgement that was to come; if
that man was ſlain, he was innocent in the ſight of God, and
had cleared his conſcience twards the man, and his blood would
be upon his head that ſlew him: Then ſome words paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, wherein the Governor was called by his name; then
Major Deniſon ſpake to this effect, that it was not fit for us to
call him by his name, for he hath another name by which he is
known, The Governor of Maſſathuſets Bay. Reply, Thou
mightſt have ſhewed more wiſdome; for his name is John Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot,
and mens names is given them to be called by. Then they
ſpake ſomething of our not putting off our hats, and brought
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95128:45"/>
ſeveral places of Scripture, whereby they pleaded for reſpect to
their perſons: We anſwered, He that reſpects perſons commits
ſin; Then one of them ſaid, That is in Judgment. <hi>Reply.</hi> Are
ye not in Judgment? Why then do you plead for it? Wee
further ſaid, If you be Magiſtrates of God, ſpeake in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of God. The Governor anſwered, We do I hope: <hi>Reply.</hi>
Nay; for thou doſt often laugh: The Governor asked, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Laughter is not lawful? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not ſuch laughter as thou
uſeft. The Governor asked, What is the honor you would have
given to men? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Love is the honor which is due unto all
men: And further ſaid, How can you believe which ſeek honor

Then Major <hi>Deniſon</hi> ſpake to this purpoſe, That it might be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
people might wonder, that they kept ſo much ado about
the putting off the hat, and ſeeking honour to their perſons, but
therein lies the ground of contempt of Authority; we put them
to prove that ever any Magiſtrats that are ſpoken of in Scripture
required any to put off their Hats; then the Governor ſaid you
cannot prove it by Scripture that any did wear Hats, the which
was proved falſe, for <hi>Dan</hi> 3 21. was brought by us, where it is
ſaid, <hi>Theſe men were bound in their coats, their hoſen, and their
hats;</hi> then he ſaid there was no ſuch word there as Hat, we took
forth a Bible, and read it to them, then they ſaid it was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſlated;
vve ſaid, If the Scriptures be miſ-tranſlated how
can they be taken for a rule; the Governour replyed, ſome vvas
and ſome vvas not: Then Major <hi>Deniſon</hi> ſtood up being about
to ſpeak, ſo the Governour made way for him ſaying to the
deputie Governour, (who vvas caſting forth a flood of falſe
accuſations againſt us) I pray let the Major ſpeak, vvho having
audience ſpake to this purpoſe; You ſay you own Governours

and both againſt Judah, and you ſay you ſhall reign, but we
are the ſtronger, and ſo look to your ſelves. <hi>Anſw.</hi> (Mark
Reader, vvhat this mighty man hath profited by his ſpeech)
you have not heard any of us ſay ſo, but the Lord is ſtronger
then all and he ſhall reign; ſo one of them vvas ſaying, That
we vvere deceived and deluded; vve ſaid, if we were deluded
and out of the way you had more need pity us, and not do as
you do; then one of them ſaid, We pitie you vvhile vve puniſh
you; vve anſvvered, That is as if a man ſhould ſet a Dog on
a Sheep, and be ſorry for it vvhile he is doing it; after ſome
more vvords they called us bold Boyes and Blaſphemers: The
Governour ſaid, You come in a ſhevv of love and humility and
the ſpirit of meekneſs, but you are ſuch as Chriſt ſpake of, who
have outvvardly ſheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening
Wolves. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt there ſpake of a people very like your
ſelves. After this the Governour made a Speech to us, and ſaid,
He ſpoke from heaven, but vve vvould not beleeve him.
<hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay, vve do not beleeve thee; ſo after ſome other vvords
he bid the Jaylor take us avvay, the vvhich he did; this being
the ſubſtance of vvhat paſt betvvixt us at that time, fo neer as
vvas remembred.</p>
               <p>Again on the tenth day we vvere called before the Court, and
when we came, our hats were pulled off as before; then <hi>Richard
Bellingham</hi> deputie Governor ſtood up and ſpake to this effect:
Theſe men have been here formerly, and have been ſent away,
and though they knew the Law, yet are they come again in
contempt to revile Magiſtrates and Miniſters, and to break all
Order in Churches, and to deceive the people, and ſo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
comes upon you, whether loſs of ears or loſs of life, your
blood be upon your own heads. To which we replyed, you
heap falſe accuſations upon us, and God will heap his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on your heads; and if we ſuffer loſs of members, or loſs of
life your blood will be required at your hands, for the Lord
hath ſent us hither: To which the Governour replyed, Prove
that, and ſaid, Chriſts Meſſengers were to pray for them that
perſecuted them; but you curſe us, and propheſie judgments
to us. <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have not done any thing ſince we came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that deſerves the ſpilling of one drop of our blood; Then
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95128:46"/>
the Governor ſaid, you are greater enemies to us then thoſe that
come openly, for you come under the pretence of peace to
poiſon the people; to which one of us ſaid, It grieves me to
hear thee ſpeak ſo many falſe things. Then they urged us to
prove that we were ſent of God; for the ſame things that
Chriſt ſaid ſhould be done to his Diſciples by thoſe that are
contrary to him, have ye done unto us a whipping, &amp;c. Then
Major <hi>Deniſon</hi> ſaid, Then evil doers that are whipt ſuffer for
Chriſt. To which <hi>John R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>us</hi> replied, if we vvere evill doers the
judgments of God vvould be heavier on us then that which
we ſuffer by you; but not being evil doers we have the peace
of God, and his peace keepeth us above all ſufferings; to which
Major <hi>Deniſon</hi> replyed, Maſter <hi>Rou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> (for ſo I may call, you having
heard that your father is a Gentleman) what Judgment do you
look for greater then is upon you, then to be driven from your
father houſe, and to run about here as a Vagabond with a
company of Seducers; except you look for a halter, or to be
ſtruck with a thunder-bolt? To which <hi>John Rous</hi> anſwered, I
vvas not driven from my fathers houſe, but in obedience to the
Lord I left it, and when the Lord ſhall clear me of this Land,
I ſhall return to it. Again, then the Governor called to the
Secretary to read the Law which concerned us three; ſo he read
the latter part which was to this purpoſe, <hi>That for coming
again, having once ſuffered the Law, we ſhould have each of us
an ear cut off;</hi> After the Law was read, the Governour did,
as he often doth, ſpeak very lightly, and uttered ſeveral words
in deriſion, the vvhich we ſeeing ſaid, More gravity vvould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
you; To which he replyed, Do you come to reprove us?
and another of them ſaid if you ſhould ſpeak thus in any other
Country, they would take you and hang you up preſently for
this, to reprove Magiſtrates in the face of the Country, doth
plainly tend to ſedition; the Governour ſpake in deriſion, and
ſaid, I know you come to reprove a proud and ſinful people;
then vve asked whether he would ſay they were not a ſinful
people? he anſvvered, we will not ſay ſo, though you ſay you
are not. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Then if a ſinful people, may not a ſinful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be warned to Repentance? So the Governour and Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
called to the Marſhal to have him gag <hi>Chriſtopher Holder;</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:95128:47"/>
then we asked vvhether we were not called hither to ſpeak, as
vvell as to be ſpoken to? the Governour ſaid Yes, vvhen vve
give you leave; then after ſome more vvords, Major <hi>Deniſon</hi>
ſaid, if you could ſhevv your Commiſſion to us as plain as vve
can ſhevv to you that you are evill doers in tranſgreſſing our
Lavv, it vvas ſomething. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whether you vvill beleeve us
or not, from the Lord we have received a command, and his
Spirit is our Commiſſion; then the Governour ſaid, They have
nothing to prove it by but by the Spirit which is within them,
and that is the Divel; we replyed and ſaid, Take heed of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming
the Spirit; he ſaid, vve came in contempt; we reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
The Lord God who knows the hearts and reins of all men
judge betvven us and you, whether we came in contempt; and
ſome other vvords we ſpake to them concerning their Law;
and ſaid, We have ſeen ſome of your Laws that have had many
Scriptures in the Margent: but what Examples have you in the
Scriptures for cutting off ears, the Governour ſaid, vvhat Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is there for hanging? then Major <hi>Deniſon</hi> ſaid in way of
deriſion, yes, they would be crucified; then they haſtened the
Governour to diſpatch us quickly, who ſpake to <hi>Edward Rawſon</hi>
again to read the Law to us three, who called us by our names,
and as he was going to read the Law again, the Governour and
Magiſtrates whiſpered together, and while we were expecting
to hear the Law read again, the Governour turned ſuddenly
about, and in great bitterneſs paſſed his ſentence on us three in
theſe words: It is the ſentence of the Court, <hi>That you thrée
all have each of you his right ear cut off by the Hangman;</hi>
then we ſeeing their unjuſt proceedings againſt us, and that they
vvere both our accuſers and Judges, and vvould not permit us
to ſpeak for our ſelves, as vve ought, but cryed out for to have
us ſilent, and to gag us if vve vvould not, vve vvere ſtirred in
ſpirit to appeal to the chief Magiſtrate of the Common-vvealth
of England, and to have our cauſe tryed and judged by him;
but they made a light thing of it, and haſtened the Keeper to
have us avvay; the vvhich he did, and put us into the common
Priſon again, So this is the ſum of vvhat paſſed betvveen us
the ſecond time we were before them, as neer as we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>

The ſame day was <hi>Laurence Southwick,</hi> and <hi>Caſſandra</hi> his wife,
and <hi>Joſiah Southwick</hi> their Son inhabitants of Salem, who have
been impriſoned in the houſe of correction twelve weeks, by
reaſon of which reſtraint from their houſe and families, their
outward eſtate is much waſted, it being in the time of Harveſt,
where they loſt a Meddow for want of reaping, wherein former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they have had twenty load of hay, for want of which, their
cattel they muſt either put to ſlaughter, or otherwiſe periſh, if
God provide not, ſeeing the enmity of their adverſaries hath
deſtroyed that which they had provided, by detaining them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the oppreſſion of their unrighteous wills; and yet cannot
be proved againſt them the breach of any Law which is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Scripture, as the Reader may plainly ſee when he reads
their Examinations, who being before them, began with them
on this manner: This man was a Member, and this woman
was a Member; to which <hi>Laurence</hi> replyed, that he had been a
Member within this year; and the reaſon why they gave me
admonition was, becauſe I entertained two men in my houſe;
they anſwered, they were Quakers: he anſwered it was <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher
Holder,</hi> and <hi>John Copeland,</hi> and my ſoul cloſed with every
thing they held forth; at which they made a ſcorn, and ſaid they
thought ſo; then <hi>Joſiah</hi> asked, what errour they held, they ſaid
that they did believe and hold forth, That there was that in
every man, that if he would he might be ſaved by it; to
which <hi>Ioſiah</hi> replyed, that there vvas power in no mans will
to ſave himſelf; then <hi>Ioſiah</hi> called to the Magiſtrates that they
would declare to the people what their ſin vvas, they ſaid you
deny Magiſtrates and Miniſters <hi>Reply.</hi> nothing of God in them
we deny; and ſaid you hold forth, a man vvas to keep his own
houſe; vvhy then ſhould we be driven out of our own houſes, but
to that they gave them no anſwer, but haftened away to their
dinner; ſo the Jaylor had them away, and put them into the
houſe of correction again; and the next day <hi>Laurence,</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi>
his Son ſent a Paper to the Magiſtrates in which they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that they might have ſome time of liberty to go home and
ſet things in order, and to pay ſome debts which they owed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſirous that every man ſhould have his due; which thing
they denied them ſhewing plainly that their intent was to rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95128:48"/>
them, who ſet a Bond for them to ſign: A Copie of which
is as followeth:</p>
               <p>We <hi>Laurence Southwick,</hi> and <hi>Caſſandra Southwick,</hi> and
<hi>Joſiah Southwick,</hi> do bind our ſelves jointly and ſeverally in the
ſum of 40. l. to the Treaſurer of the Countrey; the Condition
is, That we, and every one of us will forthwith depart the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
of the Maſsathuſets, or that We, or any one of us ſhall
publish or maintain any of the Diabolical Opinious of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
or entertain any of that Sect that reſort unto us from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts.</p>
               <p>The end of this Bond being conſidered, and that being
ſigned it would prove a Snare to them; for according to it
they either muſt leave what by hard labor they have gotten,
&amp; go where they have nothing, or elſe be bound to ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of God, or if they do, if it be contrary to the minds
of them unto whom they ſhould be bound, (though not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Scripture) they would ſtraightwayes be made
offendors; ſo they chuſe rather to ſuffer both in body and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
then to have their conſciences bound to do that which
is againſt the law of God; and let him that is honeſt hearted
judge whether this is not oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>So on the 16. of the 7. Month, the Marſhals Deputy, with a
company of blood-thirſty men, came to the priſon where we
were, and when they had let in ſo many as they would, (who
came as if they came to a ſport) they made faſt the door, and
did not ſuſter any friend to come in, though ſome did much
preſs for it, eſpecially one friend of <hi>Providence, Katherine

               <p>Reader, thou mayeſt take notice that this was their Bill,
and all the Charge they laid againſt us; for we had done
no evil: So they had us forth into another room where was
more light; then <hi>John Rous</hi> ſaid to the Marſhal, We have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
to the chief Magiſtrate of <hi>England;</hi> he ſaid, he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with that; then <hi>Chriſtopher Holder</hi> ſaid, Such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ectution
as this did uſe to be done publikely, and not in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;
one that ſtood by replyed, We do it in private to keep
you from tatling. So the Executioner took <hi>Chiſtophor Holder,</hi>
and when he had turned aſide his hair, and was going to
cut off his eare, the Marſhal being of a cowardly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
turned his backe on him, becauſe he would not
ſee it done; the which <hi>John Rous</hi> taking notice of, ſaid,
Nay, turn about, and ſee it done, (for ſo was his order)
ſo in the ſtrength of God we ſuffered joyfully, having freely
given up not onely one member, but all (if the Lord ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired)
for the ſealing of our teſtimony which the Lord hath
given us to finiſh, and ſaid theſe words, <hi>They that do it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly,
we do deſire from our hearts the Lord to forgive them; but
for them that do it maliciouſly, let our blood be upon their heads;
and ſuch ſhall know in the day of account, that every one of theſe
drops of our blood ſhall be as heavy upon them as a Milſtone.</hi> So
when they had done their bloody Work, they ſlunck away as
a dog when he hath ſucked the blood of a Lamb, and is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
               <p>So here is a Declaration of the dealings of theſe men who
account themſelves members of Chriſt, and the Church of
God; but let that of God in all judge whether theſe be the
fruits of the members of Chriſt; Did Chriſt ever do ſo? Or
did he leave any Precept that his ſervants ſhould do ſo? Or
rather did he not rebuke <hi>Peter</hi> for being too forward when he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95128:49"/>
ſmote the High Prieſt's ſervant, &amp; cut off his right ear? Did he
not tell him, They that take the ſword, ſhall periſh with the
ſword? And doth not the Scripture ſay, <hi>He that ſheds mans
blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed;</hi> and know this, that there is
nothing defileth a land or people more then the ſhedding of
innocent blood; and nothing brings down the judgments of
God ſooner on a People or Nation, then the cry of innocent
blood; therefore let not ſuch call themſelves the Church of
God, for God hath no union nor fellowſhip with ſuch that
acteth violence, and gather themſelves together, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the innocent blood; as ſaith the Scriptures; ſhall the
Throne of iniquity have fellowſhip with thee which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rameth
miſchief by a Law? They gather themſelves together againſt
the ſouls of the Righteous, and condemns the innnocent
blood: Let all ſober people judge whether theſe people are
not ſo, who hath ſhed our blood, againſt whom they could
prove no evil either in word or action, only the breach of
their Law which they have made miſchievouſly to enſnare
the innocent; but it is that they may be made manifeſt to be
of that generation that condemned Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>We have
a Law, and by our Law he ought to dye:</hi> But our deſire is, that
all in whom the Seed of God is, may be kept clear from the
guilt of innocent blood, that ſo they may be hid in the day
of the fierce Wrath of the Almighty God: For behold, The
Lord cometh out of his place to puniſh the Inhabitants of
the Earth for their iniquity, the Earth alſo ſhall diſcloſe her
blood, and ſhall no more cover her ſlain.</p>

not accounting any thing they had too good wherewithall

witneſs againſt your railing ſpirit. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I deny all railing,
and have ſpoken nothing but the Words of Truth and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſs.
He then called for Witneſs, but there appeared none.
The Governor asked if ſhe did not write to him. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Doſt
thou know me? If thou doſt know me, and will own it, I did
write to thee three times in love to thy ſoul, that thou might
ſee the wickedneſs of thy Ways, and return from it. He ſaid,
She is an old <hi>Quaker,</hi> take her away; yet he ſaid, Why did
you come here ſeeing, you had written? Anſ. If Writing
would have diſcharged me, I had not come. But why did you
com from <hi>Providence</hi> into this juriſdiction? <hi>A.</hi> Art not thou my
fellow-creature? Did not that God that made thee, make me?
And hath he not given me as good right to breath in his air,
and tread upon his Earth, as any of you? He ſaid, Take her

away till further Order. Anſ. The Lord look upon you, and
open your blind eyes, and ſoften your hard hearts; ſo taking
her away to the priſon, where ſhe was continued until the 1.
of the 8. Month, 1658. Then being brought to a private
Court, they asked her, Wherefore ſhe came into theſe parts,
ſaying her abode was at <hi>Providence,</hi> where for ought we know
you have led a blameleſs life? Anſ. as before, To bear witneſs
againſt your cruel ſpirits: With more ſuch like queries and
anſwers. Then one asked what I had to do to come into
their ground. Anſ. You take too much upon you, you Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
more then ever God gave you: Then they cryed out,
She had too much tongue; the Secretaries learned ſpeech,
(One who is a learned perſecutor in the Book of Damaſcus,
envious and malicious, hating that which is good) you have
a Family at <hi>Providence.</hi> Anſ. Yea, which I highly prize. He
ſaid, If I ſhould come into your ground, and into your houſe,
and eat of your meat, and drink of your drink whether you
would or no, though you ſhould ſay I ſhould ſay I ſhould not, do you
think this were well? Anſ. Did I come into any of your hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and eat any of your bread? Nay not into the Houſes of
my near Relations againſt their minds, or by force; but if I
ſhould make ſuch a Reſolution againſt thee or any one, that
thou ſhouldſt never come within my houſe or ground upon
no occaſion whatſoever, although thou were my bittereſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
I ſhould ſhew a dogged wicked ſpirit, contrary to the
Spirit of Jeſus. Then they ſtopped me, complaining of my
Words; then one ſaid, There is like to be a Law to hang you,
if you come again into theſe parts. Anſ. If God call us, wo
be to us if we come not; and I queſtion not but he whom we
love, will make us not to count our lives dear unto our ſelves.
He ſaid, VVe ſhall be as ready to take away your lives, as
you ſhall be to lay them down: Mark Reader, how learned
their anſwers is. She ſaid, Alas for your blindneſs! that Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he knew my Father, and called him Maſter <hi>Morbury,</hi> and ſaid
he was ſorry that I ſhould turn <hi>Quaker</hi> in my old age. Anſ.
Here is none here but I think is as old as I, and it is time for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95128:51"/>
you all to look after the things which belongs unto your
peace; I have trod all your ſteps—But here again they ſtopt
me: Then they put forth many more queries, whereby to
enſuare me: The anſwer was, I ſhall believe nothing, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
nothing but what the Scripture ſpeaks of. So the Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
returned her back to the priſon from whence ſhe was
brought, and the next day brought her to the VVhipping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt,
(their Altar) upon which being offered, ſhe received ten
ſtripes with their threefold Whip, which being unfolded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to thirty; which when they had done, the Goaler
told her ſhe might go forth paying her Fees. Anſ. If I might
go forth for two pence, I am not free, though I dye here.</p>

what we were accuſed of, we knew not, till after we ſaw the
Mittimus, in which we were called Quakers, and had not an
opportunity to ſpeak with them that ſent us, until now; and
finding the Law was made againſt a curſed Sect of Hereticks
that ſpeak and write blaſphemous Hereſies, and held Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Opinions, we found that we were wrong'd; for no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning religion was put to us, to try whether we were
ſuch; they anſwered, <hi>You did appear ſuch by your hats, &amp; company,</hi>
and if we have done you wrong you may appeal, ſo we deſired
to appeal to the general Court: They ſaid you muſt do it by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition;
we declared againſt the unrighteouſneſs of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
they asked, Whether they ſhould ſit in Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

that we were thus puniſhed for not putting off our Hats, and
demanded evidences to prove that vve vvere ſuch blaſphemous
Hereticks as hold Diabolical opinions; they anſvvered, you own
ſuch as doe: We ſpake to them again to bring Evidences that

of Sodomie or murther, or any other crime, and execute the
Law cauſeleſly upon us; <hi>Daniel Deniſon</hi> in deriſion told us,
You have léft being Doctors of Divinity, and now are become
Lawyers; and your words are very plauſible to take with the
people, as if you were ſuch righteous perſons, and we have done
you wrong, but you are ſuch as the Law expreſſes, or elſe you

that all the people would take notice, that we could not
have Juſtice done us (for we were ſent to the houſe of oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;)
and within half an hour the whipper was brought at the
beginning of Moon-light, and (without asking us to work)
contrary to their own Lavv, whipped us one by one, and while
one of us was vvhipt, the other tvvo vvas ſhut up; vve asked to
ſee what Order he had, but he would not ſhew it us: And
about the tenth hour in the night he ſent us a piece of Bread
and ſome ſmall Beer, the Beer we took, and ſent word to pay
for it, but ſent back the Bread. In the morning he came with
Bread and Beer again, and looked in at the window, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

might have the benefit of it, the which he refuſing told us, what
the Law would afford us (which was four pence in a ſhilling)
we ſhould have, but we refuſed ſo to doe, we deſired him to

               <p>SHe being formerly a Woman of a diſcontented mind, and
inclinable to be led aſide with a fretting earthly ſpirit, and
of a peeviſh nature when therein ſhe was croſſed, as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the firſt birth and nature are; and ſeeing the tryals, and
travels, and emptineſs of theſe tranſitory things, was diſquieted
in her ſpirit, groaning after that which is more durable, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
nor away; and I being a Traveller appointed by the Father
for that very end, to ſeek out the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
and ſo much as in me lyes, to gather together, and bring
home that ſeed which the Serpent in his ſervants hath ſcattered
and laid as waſt, and laboureth to deſtory; and I being drawn
by the Father into remote places where his ſeed lay hid and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
(according to the ſeed which ſuffered, and that ſpirit that
moved me forth) I preached liberty unto the captivated Seed,
and glad tydings of an acceptable day of deliverance unto the
whole Houſe of Iſrael; the which glad tydings the beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>Goodworth Horndall</hi> (as one diſtreſt and oppreſt in ſpirit)
gladly received &amp; believed, with many more in that place; which
ſhe (as one that had long offended a juſt &amp; terrible God) would
willingly have acted any thing whereby ſhe might have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Favour, and appeaſed his Wrath; but the Serpent being
more ſubtil then any beaſt in the Field, overcame the ſimplicity
in her, his power having had place and dominion over her, and
all fleſh in that firſt nature and birth, whereby he led her aſide
into the imaginations, to act ſtrange things, yea, even ſuch as
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95128:57"/>
were beyond her natural ſtrength, that ſuch as did labor to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawher
from, did admire at; ſhe being convinc't in her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
that in and after the courſe of her former converſation
ſhe had been led aſide, and grievouſly had offended, (although
in nothing beyond what others in the ſame nature have been
led into, which if not repented of, they muſt all likewiſe periſh)
and ſhe being fearful to offend further then already ſhe had
done, went about to act in her own Will, and in the ſame ſpirit
whereby ſhe had been captivated, ſuch things as were preſented
to her mind, (which by the Serpents ſubtilty was, and is always
ſeemingly good) whereby the ſimple hath been led aſide to taſt,
although bitter hath been, and is the end thereof) yet contrary
altogether to her knowledge of the evil that therein was, theſe
things ſhe did, expecting thereby to reap or merit peace and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
but none there was to be had, but on the contrary,
further thraldom; ſo that after information and further advice
from ſuch as had travelled through the like tryals and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſhe was prettily ſetled, and ſavour began to ariſe in her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
ſo that after hearing the truth further declared, ſhe ſaid
we ſpake the language of the heavenly Land; and it being ſo
that the ſervant of God at that preſent was called away into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remote places, where he laboured and ſuffered a certain
ſpace, in which time the ſaid <hi>Goodworth</hi> (being of a fretting, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conted
mind, not having been exerciſed with the patience and
faith of the Saints in the midſt of ſuch tryals) was again led aſide
into a ſecond relapſe, which the wiſe in heart knows is the worſt
part of a ſecond ſorrow; She being then in the mixture of the
Powers, [I ſpeak unto them that are wiſe, let them judge what
I ſay] the one having long had place, and the other having now
entered to take place; and ſhe not knowing the operation of
thoſe powers, and being too forward in acting, the ſimplicity
ſuffered a ſecond ſorrow, and withall, ſuch coming about her as
was not able to judge of theſe two powers, (there being judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due to the one, and mercy and help to the other, which
they willingly would have made help to her in this diſtreſs, like
the ſervants of the Lord, or houſholder, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

which cauſed the poor creature to ſay in my hearing, (although
at that time ſenceleſs) <hi>That the blood was ſpilt upon the Earth:</hi>
When according to the will of the Father I came to that place
again, and ſhe gone diſtracted ſo far that ſhe could not govern
nor guide her ſelfe at that preſent, which troubled me very
much; and I would gladly have ſeen her, but might not without
the drawings of the Father, for which I waited, and in due time
it came upon me, and I went to her, and ſate by her, waiting to
miniſter if it were the Fathers will; but there was nothing to
receive me, the ground being barren, and altogether left deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;
at which inſtant I was ſtruck exceeding ſorrowful, being
made ſenſible what the loſs of one ſoul was, even as if I had loſt
ſo much ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of my own ſide; and ſo in plain words from under
that ſence I ſpoke it forth, withall ſignifying what a loſs it was,
(where the power had reached to the Seed, raiſed the ſoul out of
death which long it had laid under, and then to be deprived of
it, and utterly fruſtrated and loſt by the wiles and ſubtiltie of
the Devil and Satan) more then over many who had never taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the like power and love, and alſo ſpoke it forth to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and ſiſters, that ſhe ſhould be viſited ſo often as there was
drawings to ſee if it were poſſible to beget a Seed where there
was none, by the vertue of that power wherein we ſtood, and
of that Faith I was, and am, and in it do remain, (this is as Food
fetcht from far to the pure and wiſe in heart, and unto ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this is communicated) and told them further, that their Image
would beget, and it put me in minde of <hi>Jacobs</hi> laying ſpeckled
ſticks before his fathers ſtock; and at ſeveral times I gave them
ſuch figures as theſe, that ſhe was like unto a veſſel heaving in
the Sea, whoſe compaſs was caſt off the needle, and there was
nothing to ſteer it by, neither could it move, but as it was heaved
to and again with the winde; for to order her ſelf in any thing
that was good ſhe could not, or like as over-worn ground
whoſe ſtrength is deſtroyed, ſo that it was capable neither of
ſeed nor weed; yet after a while let it alone and it will gather
ſtrength, and bring forth ſomething; but as concerning her I
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95128:58"/>
am jealous that the evill will come forth firſt, being ſenſible of
the nature of all mankind; thus it remained a certain ſpace,
wherein we did viſit her time after time, in which time again I
compared her unto a body or carcaſe which the Doctors and
Apothecaries of the Egyptian world begs or buyes, to anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize
or abuſe, from whence to reap vviſdome to add to their
rotten art; ſo that the vviſe in heart may ſee that they conjure
their vviſdome and knowledge and art from amongſt the dead;
but we being Phyſitians choſen of the Father, and by him made
partakers of his nature and name, he gave us a body whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to exerciſe our gifts which from him we had received, and
to that end was applyed; and being often drawn forth in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of her, her ſences being loſt, and filled with winde and air,
her tongue running in uſeleſs and ſenceleſs words; only in ſome
agonies wherein ſhe was not ſenſible, ſhe would have cryed out
againſt her ſelf and ſaid, I am that bloody Whore, and the blood
is ſpilt upon the earth, and there is no ſalvation for me; and
ſitting waiting by her I was made to take hold of ſuch words,
and beat them back upon her ſo much as ſhe was able to bear,
to bring her to the ſence of them; and one time I taxed her with
a lie, for there was ſalvation for her; ſhe ſuddenly asked me
where? I told her in God, and ſhe being full of Scripture
words, told me, <hi>That the fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no
God;</hi> (I asked her and ſaid) What will you beleeve a fool? Nay,
by no means; there is a God, and there is ſalvation for thee,
and beat it upon her, ſo much as ſhe was able to bear, and put
it upon her to remember what had paſt betwixt us, until I came
again, that ſo ſhe might have ſomething of ſavour wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to exerciſe her ſenſes, and ſometimes ſhe did, and ſometimes
I haſtened conſidering the weakneſs of her brain, and thus la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
again to raiſe the dead; which after ſome ſhort time
coming in this manner, Horror at times took hold upon her,
and much temptation to make her ſelf away; in which time I
coming to her, ſhe asked me, If I could not caſt out Devils
through Beelzebub the Prince of Devils; I told her nay, the
Devils ſaid ſo of Chriſt, (which was falſe) but I can caſt out
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95128:59"/>
Devils through Chriſt Jeſus, the power of God; then ſaid ſhe,
Caſt the Devils out of me; yea, if thou wilt do what I require
of thee; ſhe told me, yea, ſhe would, but at that time did not;
but according to my expectation the weed came up firſt, for
when I told her that God is a meek and quiet ſpirit, and that
ſhe might learn to know him within her, and to be guided by
him, vvho taught not to ſpeak ſuch fooliſh vvords as ſhe did,
and joyn her members to him, and I would joyn with Chriſt
both in me and her, and through his ſtrength the Devil ſhall
be diſpoſſeſt, which at that time ſhe could not bear but broke
forth into fooliſh laughter, which vainneſs continued with
her a certain ſpace; vvhich when that was off, her temptations
ſtraitly followed her ſtill to make her ſelf avvay, which thing
increaſed my confidence in her, and all vvho may beled into
the like; for ſuch are they that Satan hath little confidence in
that they will do him ſervice, but if they can by any means
eſcape his Wiles, they will follow the example of my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner,
and me his ſervant who was led of the Spirit to be
tempted in the Wildernes; which vainneſs ſhe hath confeſſed
to me ſince, that after my reproof, in telling her and giving
the example, that ſhe was more vain then her child, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in her ſhewed her that it was not fit for her to laugh;
and was in ſuch a ſad condition; After which, ſhe got forth
a doors, into the woods to have made her ſelf avvay, having
alſo been at the water-ſide to have done it before, and both
through the love and power of God was prevented; for when
ſhe vvas in the vvoods vvith an intent to have done it, ſhe told
me that ſomething ſpake unto her, and told her, That it was
not the deſtroying other ſelf that could ſatisfie. God for the
diſhonor ſhe had done him; After vvhich, ſhe ſavv that it was
the love and power of God that did, and had prevented her
from doing of it, and from that time ſhe ſetled and amended;
and I perceived by her Siſter that her earneſt deſire was to ſpeak
with me, and ſaid, That ſhe did beleeve ſhe ſhould be reſtored,
the which was accompliſhed, and after our meeting ſhe earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begged of me to tell her, Whether ſhe had not ſinned the ſin
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95128:59"/>
againſt the Holy Ghoſt? yea or nay: I told her nay, then ſhe
put it ſtrongly upon me to make it forth unto her; the vvhich
I did, and told her, Thou haſt not yet received the Holy Ghoſt,
and that there vvas many Diſciples vvho knew not vvhether
there vvere any Holy Ghoſt yea or nay, the which ſhe ſaw and
confeſſed; then hovv can thou have ſinned againſt it: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
in that vvhich thou haſt done againſt that vvhich thou haſt
received, thou did it not wilfully, for hadſt thou known better,
thou wouldſt not have done it, and ſhe told me vvith tears that
the Lord knew that ſhe had not done it wilfully, and if ſhe had
known better, ſhe would not have done it, and truſted in God
that he would ſhew mercy upon her; and the next time I came
again, ſhe told me the ſame words, and was ſtill the more ſetled;
and her child being lying ſick by her, I asked her if ſhe did not
pity that poor child, knowing that in her diſtemper, neither it,
nor any other thing was regarded? and ſhe cryed out, alas! ſhal
I not pity my own poor child; and I was moved to tell her, that
even ſo the Lord had pitied her, and his bowels earned towards
her, and ſhortly after her child was reſtored unto her, as a
figure unto her of what the Lord would do for her, if ſhe did
abide in his Counſel; and often ſince ſhe hath told me with
tears, that ſhe truſted that God would do good for her and
that he ſhould be honoured by her, in ſtead of that great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
that ſhe had done to him and us; which thing ſhe hath
often declared againſt her ſelf in, and ſaid, that we had ſuffered,
and God had been diſhonoured by her: Whereupon I told her,
that inſomuch as that of God had ſuffered in her, therein we
had ſuffered by her, and in her; and the wicked through
that have taken advantage to ſpeak evil of the way of God,
but thou being through the love and power of God made
ſenſible of thine own loſs, and alſo of the love of God
towards thee, we are therein fully ſatisfied, and greatly
can we rejoyce in the Lord God on thy behalf. And this I
can truly ſay concerning her, and as a Teſtimonie of her,
That ſince her Recovery, ſhe hath and doth make it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that it was not for, nor thorow any earthly or evill end,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95128:60"/>
that the ſad travel came upon her; for before that ſhe
was never a Licentious Liver; and ſince ſhe is more dead
to all thoſe things then ever ſhe was before, and her care
and induſtry ſet how to do juſt and honeſt things unto all ſorts
of People, and that which is well-pleaſing unto God, that
the dayes of her appointed Time may be ſpent to his
glory.</p>

            <head>Some Quaeries unto all ſorts whatſoever,
who wants that which wee have, by
which they may ſee themſelves, and
know from us where to find it.</head>
            <p>1.
WHERE the Hand is which can help one out of
Hell?</p>
            <p>2. Where is the Arm that can deliver one up
thither, and there bind him until his fleſh be deſtroyed, and
in the day of the Lord can fetch his ſoul from thence, and
ſet it upon his Throne?</p>
            <p>3. Where is the firſt and ſecond death, the loweſt, higheſt,
and nethermoſt Hell, ſeeing the Scripture ſpeaks of the loweſt
Hell, and the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and Tophet of old, which yet remains to the Wicked? Shew
us where theſe Hells are, and in, or under what Climate, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
or Planet, or in Earth, or Air, or where.</p>
            <p>4. What is that that torments the Wicked there? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is the Devil that torments himſelf, yea or nay?</p>
            <p>5. When, or how with ſafety a ſoul may be delivered up
thither? To wit, Whether before God hath left ſtriving with
him? or after? Or at what time or inſtant? Anſwer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly?</p>
            <p>6. Whether Chriſt and all theſe that have followed him
from death to life, have not paſt through all theſe deaths and
Hells, yea or nay, ſeeing it is ſaid, He can ſave to the utmoſt?
And whether they have ſeen the utmoſt (yea or nay) that
have not paſt through all theſe things? And let none ſay that
they may not be dived into, for it is truth that the ſpirit ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
all things, &amp;c. and the hidden things of <hi>Eſau</hi> muſt be
ſought out; if any ſay, Nay: let him tell me what it is may be
ſearched into, and ſeen, and what may not?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:95128:61"/>
7. And whether the eye of God ſeeth not, and ſearcheth
all things, yea or nay? And whether every man ought not to
ſee with this Eye, yea or nay? If not, Whether he may not
be blind in many things, yea or nay? As for example, <hi>Adam</hi>
gave Names to every Creature that ſtood in Covenant, and
ſeeing that there are Names, and Creatures, and Members,
with bloody Oaths and Actions vvhich <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency
named not, therefore ſhevv me hovv one ſhall diſcern and
knovv the innocent Names and Nature of every Member,
Creature, and created thing, and alſo that bloody ſpirit that
invented all theſe bloody Oaths, and beaſtly, and filthy, and
unclean Words and Actions. Anſvver expreſly, for ſo ſpeaks
the Spirit?</p>
            <p>8. If any man being a Preacher, (ſo called) and knovv
not theſe things, Whether he be able to judge of what he
ſpeaks, yea or nay? And if ſo, Whether he may not ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs,
and preach and ſpeak that which he ought not, and give
Names to Creatures and things which are not? If he be one
that ſays he knows the things that differ, and hath been led
into Viſions and Revelations, and things of the higheſt,
(lawful and unlawful to be uttered) let him anſwer all theſe
things both former and latter.</p>
            <p>9. What may be preached and publiſhed upon the houſe
top, and vvhat may uot? and vvhat things are lavvful, and
what not? And ſeeing there is a time wherein all things are
lawful, and a time wherein all things are not, diſtinguiſh
each time with its ſign, that all people may learn to know
the ſigns of the times, and the difference between all things
that are, and are not; if any may ſay that it will bring in
doubtful queſtions, and may drive them to dive into things
which may ſtrick them diſtracted or mad; I ſay, Nay, that is
mans Will that drives him thither, the light leads him to ſee
the ground and riſe of every time and thing, (and this is the
Word of the Lord God) and ſhews him the Spirit which muſt
be divided from the ſoul, from that which muſt not; (Mark,
the Eye of God ſhews and ſees a Spirit) and he that ſees not
with God's Eye, ſees not that which muſt be divided from
the ſoul, nor the ſoul which the Word reacheth and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
betwixt it and the Spirit.</p>

               </gap> of godlineſs having been hid from ages &amp; generations,
and this being now the day, and age, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
wherein God is revealing, and revealed in, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his people, and is leading them through all Lands, the
Land of darkneſs, ſin and death; the Land of light, life, and
peace; and having queried ſomething concerning the former,
and ſeen alſo the ſcituation of the latter, let us ſtretch forth
into the deep, and ſo fathom the whole circuit of Heaven
and Hell, Earth and Air, and all that therein is; Come up hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and I will ſhew thee the place where his Honor dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
come and ſee.</p>
            <p>11. Seeing the Scripture ſpeaks of the third Heaven, it
thence appears that there are three; my query is, Where are
they? In what place? Under what Planet? Or above in what
Circuit? Or below in what Region? and the infallible Way
to it? Which is the eaſieſt query of all.</p>
            <p>12. And ſeeing that there is War in Heaven betwixt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
and the Dragon, it ſeems then that the Dragon (that
old Serpent the Devil) is there? I ſay, Where is that Heaven
that he is in? Anſwer expreſly.</p>
            <p>13. And ſeeing that the Serpent was in Paradice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<hi>Eve,</hi> (before ever I heard of Hell) Tell me how he came
there, and what Heaven that is, and where it is?</p>
            <p>14. And ſeeing it is written that <hi>Adam</hi> was made of the
duſt, &amp;c. and that he and ſhe (to wit, <hi>Eve</hi>) was in this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
place called Paradice, tell me infallibly, (the wiſeſt of
you Wizards) How, and what way they came there? He who
can do this in truth, can preach ſalvation without Book.</p>
            <p>15. And ſeeing that a Heaven there is of a truth, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
nothing that defileth can enter, tell me expreſly where it
is, the entrance in, and how it may be obtained, and by
whom?</p>
            <p>16. What the Key of the Kingdom is? Seeing Chriſt is the
Door, who the Keepers, ſeeing I have heard both <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Peter</hi> was?</p>
            <p>17. And what the Gates of Hell is, which ſhall not prevail
againſt this Door? And what the Keys of theſe Gates is, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is written, He hath the Keys of Hell and Death? And
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95128:62"/>
who that <hi>He</hi> is, ſeeing it's called an Angel? My query is, What
the nature of an Angel is, ſeeing it is written concerning
Chriſt, That he took upon him the nature of Angels, &amp;c.
and concerning the Saints, that they ſhall judge Angels?</p>
            <p>Thou who ſees not with the Eye that ſurrounds theſe
things, and comprehends Death and Hell, and is in diſtreſs
concerning thy ſalvation, &amp; at a loſs, not knowing the truth,
