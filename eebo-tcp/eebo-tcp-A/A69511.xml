            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of <hi>Oxford,</hi> for the yeere above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning the queſtion of ſetting up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the Croſſe or other Crucifix in
Cheapſide, I am of opinion,
Firſt, that the godly and diſcreet zeal of
the worthy City is much to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
who, on juſt &amp; apparent grounds making a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of that which may be ſcandalous to many
good Chriſtians, have not raſhly nor tumultuouſly
proceeded therein, but are deſirous to be informed by
Divines of the Univerſities (which are under the
protection of Almighty God, and her moſt Sacred
Majeſtie, Schools of the Prophets) what they may,
and ought to doe, both unto the honour of Gods
Name, and to the ſetling of ſuch their brethren as be
in doubt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I am fully perſwaded, that the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95004:3"/>
God in his wiſdome hath offered unto this
reverend Citie this occaſion, to make tryall of their
piety and devotion, whether they doe love the intire
ſervice of himſelfe withall their hearts, and ſouls, or
no, for which matter, howſoever it ſeeme <hi>prima fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi>
to contain nothing of much moment in it, yet
now, ſince the expectation of the whole Realme, and
Church of <hi>England</hi> is, what will become thereof, it
cannot be ſuppoſed of leſſe conſequence, then that
either our Religion which is eſtabliſhed according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Canon of the Scripture, or elſe that Papiſtry
ſhould receive a wound, and blow thereby.</p>
            <p>Being then orderly and fairly demanded my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therein, I doe purpoſe according to the ſeverall
circumſtances in their ſeverall places, to touch divers
things,</p>
            <p>Praying that God would guide my Meditations
and pen aright, to the glory of his Name, and good
of their ſoules who deſire in this matter to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in theſe Crucifixes are reſembled God the
Father by an old man, the Holy Ghoſt by a Dove,
which are both of them unlawfull in true Divinity,
becauſe God is a Spirit, and he himſelfe forbids any
ſimilitude or ſhape of himſelf, when he gave the law,
intending that he filleth Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>Confirmed by <hi>Origen,</hi> who ſaith, we doe deſcribe
with no ſhape God who is without body inviſible.
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, God is infinite, unmeaſurable, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Heathens, and <hi>Numa</hi> in <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Lives, did
forbid his people to ſhape out any of their Gods
with the forme of a man.</p>
            <p>And this teſtimony <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95004:3"/>
Nay, <hi>Thomas Aquinas part. 3. q. 25. a.</hi> 3. But
unto God who is without any body, no bodily I-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
could be ſet up, becauſe as <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſaith, it is a
point of the higheſt folly or impiety to figure that
which is divine, but becauſe God in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is made man, he may be adored with the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Image of himſelfe, this <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>So Chriſt (the Frier thinketh) in his humanity
may be pictured, and not God.</p>
            <p>Long ſince, ſome of the choiceſt learned <hi>Sorboniſts</hi>
directly ſay, they deſire therefore that Images of the
Trinitie ſhould be removed from all publike and
private places, becauſe they are forbidden by the
Scriptures by Councils, by many men of excellent
worth and holineſſe.</p>
            <p>This ſhortly I ſpeak, but who liſteth to ſee more,
the refutation of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Cavils ſpeaking for
thoſe Superſtitions, as alſo the judgement of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
let him read Doctor <hi>Reynolds, de Idolatria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being then that the Image of the Dove for the
Holy Ghoſt was upon the Croſſe in Cheapſide, and
the retayning thereof is unlawfull, yea, one of the
higheſt points of Popery, whereof many learned
men of their ſide are aſhamed, I hold it a matter que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe
in a reformed Church, that the Croſſe is in
no ſort to be ſet up again, as it is was before with the
Dove, leſt we ſhould ſeem to perſiſt in that palpable
darkneſſe of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this point I being undoubtedly and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragably
reſolv<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, in that ſame burdenſome office of
a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, which now under my Lord I
doe beare, did upon ſound and mature advice this
laſt Summer burn and conſume with fire in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95004:4"/>
place of <hi>Oxford,</hi> amongſt others, a Picture where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
was the Image of God the Father over a Crucifix
ready to receive the ſoul of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The next conſiderable matter is for the Crucifix
it ſelfe, what is to be judged of the Image, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it may be retained at all.</p>
            <p>I doe not certainly finde when the firſt uſe in that
kinde was taken up amongſt men, although <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
did cauſe ſomewhat to be made, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
the two firſt Letters of Chriſts Name, as they
are written in Greek, and that which hee had made
was to be uſed only in Standards, but in this ſort, and
to that uſe, as now commonly is framed, if it
had never been began, I think I may boldly ſay, that
the Church had been freed of a great deal of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
which afterwards grew to little leſſe then
blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>It is very likely that they that firſt uſed it had this
to ſay for it, that there might be an Hiſtoricall uſe to
put us in mind of him that died for us, and in as
much as ſenſible and viſible things do much affect us,
this memoriall might ſtir our devotion to remember
him, by whoſe ſtripes we are healed.</p>
            <p>Now as this may be the only uſe thereof, much
may be diſputed, and held not to be <hi>ſimpliciter malus,</hi>
abſolutely evill: So in my opinion, there are far more
repugnant, and direct reaſons which may make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it altogether, as</p>
            <p>Firſt, the wiſdome of God, which directed us to
all things fit for our ſalvation, hath given not the
leaſt touch nor ſemblance, directly or by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
of any ſuch matter, which might ſerve to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
us unto Piety: but hath only appointed the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95004:4"/>
Word to be the meaſure thereof, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which are viſibly (but not ſo groſly as the
Crucifix) preſented unto us as reſemblances of
Chriſts paſsion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it implyeth great weakneſſe of faith
when we cannot think of our Saviour, either by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
or Prayer, or reading, or hearing the word,
or by receiving of the Sacraments, but wee muſt flie
unto ſuch means, as for the uſe whereof wee have no
warrant, but on the other ſide there is much danger,
leſt inconveniences ſhould grow thereby.</p>
            <p>It was a true obſervation of <hi>Philo Judaeus,</hi> that the
minds of women are the weaker, and they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
nothing but that which is ſenſible, ſpeaking of
Images which they deſire, but note hee aſcribeth it
unto weakneſſe in them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it was a very ready way unto Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which from a ſmall beginning creepeth on, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath it any way more increaſe then in Images,
as the Church by lamentable experience hath too
too much proved. Images (ſaith <hi>Cyprian)</hi> at firſt were
made in honour of them that were dead, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they became ſacred to their poſterity, &amp; were
at firſt taken only for comforts, this was true among
the Heathen, and ſo it was among the Chriſtians,
who at firſt made them, but offered not to bring
them into Churches, yet within a while that alſo was
attempted, but to the great griefe and indignation of
the godly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epiphanius</hi> comming into a Church, and ſeeing
a veile or hanging that had one of the Pictures of
Chriſt or ſome Saint, tore it, as being in the Church
contrary unto the Scriptures, and after in ſteed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95004:5"/>
of he ſent a new veile thither, but that which was
then ſo reſiſted by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> did in proceſſe of time
(as the purity of the Profeſſours of the Goſpel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed)
grow ſtronger, ſo that by the time of <hi>Gregory</hi>
the Great, Images grew to be ordinary in Churches,
yet notwithſtanding hee that was ſo earneſt for the
having them, could not like that they ſhould be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped,
but even then there were that repugned the
opinion of receiving of them into Churches, and ſo
defaced the Images themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> diſliked the worſhipping of them, but
thoſe that came after him they mayntained
the Adoration and worſhip given unto them,
appeareth by the ſecond Councill of <hi>Nice,</hi> among
many, no doubt, this of Chriſt hanging upon the
Croſſe was one of the principall, whereby Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
went ſo far, as that it was and is mayntained
that the reverence and adoration due unto God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
(called <hi>Latria)</hi> is to be given to the reſemblance
of Chriſt on the Croſſe, which is directly laid down
by <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> yea, and practiſed in their <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The perpetuall uſe of their adoration, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

many of them doe ſay a large part of their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yea, the moſt ſuperſtitious Papiſts are ready to
give veneration thereunto, whereſoever they ſee
it ſolemnly ſet up.</p>
            <p>I remember in that Colledge where I firſt lived,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95004:5"/>
a young man was taken praying and beating his breſt
before a Crucifix in a window, which cauſed the
Maſters and Fellows to pull it down, and ſet up other
glaſſe. Which example makes me nothing doubt but
that the Croſs in Cheapſide hath many in the twilight
and morning early which doe reverence before it.</p>
            <p>Beſides <hi>Campian,</hi> whoſe act is famous, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
for it, and I am informed, that ſo much hath
been ſignified by the neighbours, or inqueſt making
preſentments, concerning the circumſtances of this
cauſe. By all which I do conclude, that it is a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Superſtition, a great inducement, and
may be a ready way unto Idolatry, and that there
can be no tolerable uſe of this matter, which may be
able for to countervail the dangers and obloquie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing
upon the reteyning of it, and ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe it is perceived, that many evill affected
men doe make their advantage from hence to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
into the minds of their credulous hearers, that
it is a token of the returne of their faith againe into
into this Land, ſince their Monuments are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
in the chiefeſt ſtreet of our greateſt City.</p>
            <p>Upon which conſiderations I make no doubt but
the religious Magiſtrates are ſufficiently warranted
by the Word of God to remove it away, for the
Scriptures have laid before our eyes what ought to
be done to remaynders of Idolatry, Yea ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
their Altars, Pillars, graven Images, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But the deeds of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> being well looked into
doth put it out of all controverſie, for when hee ſaw
the foule abuſe of the brazen Serpent, hee cauſed it
to be defaced, and yet it hath other manner of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for it then this, it being commanded by God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95004:6"/>
by <hi>Moſes,</hi> a figure of Chriſt, in divers of which
moſt materiall circumſtances this Crucifix is moſt
defective.<note place="margin">Divers lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Miniſters then living do report. Though the judgement of both Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities was conſulted with about the Croſſe, and both deſired it might be taken down, yet they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with B. <hi>Bancroft,</hi> but he would have it re-edified, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with much adoe they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſwayed the Biſhop to leave off the picture of Chriſt on the Croſſe, that was ſet on the top of it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And here I pray the Reader to obſerve, that I ſay
the Magiſtrates are to redreſſe ſuch enormities, for I
doe not permit inferiour men to run headlong about
ſuch means, and to rend, breake, and teare as well
within as without the Churches, which was that
that <hi>Luther</hi> reprehended, but the advice and conſent
of Superiour powers is to be had herein, that all
things may be done decently and in order. In which
reſpect I hold it neceſſary that the Biſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> be ſought unto, who
doubtleſſe upon the ſober intention of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of that City will be pleaſed religiouſly and
gravely, according unto their manifold wiſdome
which God hath given unto them, to looke into the
matter, &amp; give inſtructions what is fitteſt to be done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HEre Maſter Vicechancellour at large proveth that
it was but omiſsion in our firſt Reformers, and
that our further reformation would not condemne or
checke them,<note place="margin">Take notice of the blinde zeale of the Prelate in this buſineſſe.</note> but commend, the preſent due occaſion
being offered, that it would be as the fact of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi>
and <hi>Joſias,</hi> that the further they went the more they
did ſtill raze remnauts of Idolatry, and eſtabliſhed Gods
true ſervice, then he ſaith, Man hath not ſought for this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
but God hath rather put it upon the Citie, in as
much as the Crucifix being worne out with time was ready to
fall, there was a neceſsity impoſed for taking it down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now it is a greater matter to re-edifie a ſcandalous thing
then to continue it, in as much as the one implyeth a winking
connivance or permiſsion only, but the other intendeth an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
and ratification, which giveth greater advantage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the adverſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95004:6"/>
This he confirmed by <hi>Marcus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arethuſe</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantines</hi> time the Great, and <hi>Julianus</hi> perſecuted him after
that he refuſed contribution to the rebuilding of overthrowne
Idols Temples, Saying, that it was ungodly to afford one half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny
to a wicked maker thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And out of that Author he citeth one more example of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
a <hi>Perſian</hi> Biſhop, pulling downe a Pyren or Temple dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the fire the <hi>Perſians</hi> god, and refuſing to build it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
at <hi>Iſdigerdes</hi> the Kings command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>Theodorets</hi> ſaying of him, I doe admire him, and thinke
him worthy of a garland, for in my opinion it is equall impiety to
adore the fire, and to build a Temple to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My advice therefore and judgement in the name of
God is, that the Crcifix ſhould not be erected there,
but that upon this opportunitie advantage ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to give ſuperſtition a further blow, which will be
very joyous to all that are already ſincerely affected,
and if there be any who truly love the Goſpel, and are
not yet ſo fully perſwaded in this point, they alſo will
in mildneſſe yield to reaſon, if the Superiour power
ſhall be pleaſed to give countenance to this deed of the
City.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhould be miſliked of hollow-hearted Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
or maligned by profeſſed Recuſants, it muſt be
expected and not wondred at.</p>
            <p>Now if it ſhall be demanded what ſhould be ſet up
inſteed of the other Monument. I thinke beſt to be
ſome <hi>Pyramis</hi> or matter of meere beauty, and not
any Angell or ſuch like whatſoever, for although in
truth that deſerveth no reprehenſion, yet by avoyding
of that the mouthes of the Adverſaries may be ſtopped,
who would otherwiſe ſtorme and ſay, that the Creator
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95004:7"/>
is taken down, and ſuch a Creature is ſet up in the place
where hee ſtood; and whereas it is ſaid, that evermore
it will be called the Croſſe in Cheap-ſide, yet it may be
poſſible that time may weare out the appellation, or if
it doe not, the name ſhall hurt no more then the name
of <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> or <hi>Candlemas</hi> doth, from which a godly
man may make that uſe as to prayſe the Lord, that the
matter of theſe Superſtitions are removed, and the
name onely remaynes as a memoriall of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
who hath done ſo great good things for us. And
by reaſon of the ſickneſſe and weakneſſe of him who
more learnedly and judiciouſly might have reſolved
this point, have I not after that hot and haſty humour
of ſome men who are moved rather by fancie then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but after Chriſtian and ſetled looking into the
cauſe, and ſatisfying of my owne conſcience, fully
therein ſet down my judgement upon the demand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
unto me, ſuppoſing that this ſhall alſo give acceſſe
unto the honour of God, her Majeſty, the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and that noble Citie, if it be ſo ſet up again as
a matter of meere beauty or Pyramide.</p>

                  <p>WE doe approve as ſound and true, the rather

ſame manner the brazen Serpent was by conſent and
authority of our gracious <hi>Hezekiahs,</hi> &amp; them whom cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
Eccleſiaſticall have authorized under her Highneſſe.</p>
                  <p>This only wee adde, that as example of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
be notably and ſufficient to encourage her Majeſty
and ſuch as be in authority under her zealouſly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
ſuch occaſions of Idolatry, and to remove
them out of the peoples way, for the examples of <hi>Gideon</hi>
is terrible if they be let alone, and continued ſtill.</p>
                  <p>Hee erected an <hi>Ephod</hi> in <hi>Ophra</hi> after his victory over
the <hi>Madianites,</hi> both to teſtifie his thankfulneſſe unto
the true God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for his victory obtained, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to ſhew the <hi>Midianites,</hi> that the God whoſe ſervice
in an <hi>Ephod</hi> without Idoll or Image they did refuſe
had given unto them the overthrow, and thus
farre <hi>Gideon</hi> is not reproved, but when hee grew
old and knew that the people did worſhip before the

In like manner, the fact of Conſtantine, after his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over <hi>Maxentius,</hi> in erecting the ſigne of the Croſs

the Croſſe hath been, and is abuſed to Idolatry and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
therefore if the chief Magiſtrates erect ſuch
things now, when they be well taken away, and if they
pull them not downe, when with peace and quietneſſe

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95004:8"/>
THis worthy Miniſter preaching on <hi>Eſay</hi> 10. Verſ. 5, 6. Shews di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ſignes of Gods wrath againſt a Nation, among others hee
ſhews this to be one Plague token.</p>
            <p>When God gives over a Land to hainous ſins, when hee ſuffers a
Land that hath been delivered from Idolatry, againe to bee given up
unto Idols. This is a certain ſigne of Gods wrath aginſt a Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For this is a ſtanding rule, that when any Idoll is ſuffered to bee
in a Land, though it be not worſhipped, yet it is a remarkable ſigne,
that they are a people of his wrath. See what the Lord ſaith,</hi> Pſal. 81.
8, 9. Heare, ô my people, and I will testifie unto thee, ô Iſrael, if thou wilt
hearken unto me, there ſhall no ſtrange god be in thee, neither ſhalt thou wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
any ſtrange god. <hi>(Marke) he doth not only ſay thou ſhalt worſhip
no ſtrange god, but there ſhall be no ſtrange god in thee, as the Lord
commands them,</hi> Exod. 34. 12. <hi>ſaying,</hi> Take heed to thy ſelf, that thou
make no covenant with the inhabitants of the Land, whether thou goeſt,
lest they be cauſe of ruine among you: but yee ſhall overthrow their Altars,
and break their Images in pieces, and cut downe their groves, for thou ſhalt
bow downe to no other god, becauſe the Lord whoſe name is <hi>Jehovah</hi> is a
jealous God. <hi>For when ever Idols goe before, then certainly warre
will follow after, and therefore to ſuffer an Idoll to be in a Land, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
unworſhipped is no ſmall ſin, as the Lord ſaith,</hi> Hoſ. 6. 10. I have
ſeen villany in the houſe of Iſrael, there is whoredome in Ephraim, Iſrael
is joyned to Idols, let her alone, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee how greatly we provoke God to anger, when we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
an Idoll to be among us.</p>
            <p>And though the Lord had formerly freed this Land from Idolatry.
Are not the Images of <hi>Baal</hi> againe re-edified among us? this never
went before, but a Plague came after it. For by this, if by any thing,
a Land breaks covenant, nay, goes about to breake their Marriage
bond with God. Therefore may I ſay to this Land, nay, to you of
this Citie, (to goe no further into other places,) where the Word of
God is moſt powerfully preached among you, that you are in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
manner guilty of this lewd crying ſin. Witneſſe the Croſſe in
Cheap-ſide, that is lately beautified by you. I am troubled to think
how God expreſly hath beene provoked, and wrath I feare will be
poured out upon you for this ſame golden Croſſe. For whereas the
Lord ſaith, <hi>Iſaiah 30 22, 23. Ye ſhall defile the coverings of your graven
Images of ſilver, and the ornaments of your molten Images of gold, and cast
them away as a menſtruous cloth:</hi> and then ſhall he give you a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
You on the other ſide, have adorned the covering of your Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
now, all men know that the Croſſe is that which the Papiſts
make an Idoll of: and yet you have not ſtained the covering thereof
but have beautified and adorned it. So that as a bleſſing came on
them that ſtained the covering of their Images; ſo a curſe will moſt
certainly follow the beautifying of the covering of thoſe Images of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95004:9"/>
that Croſſe. For it is that which doth become a ſnare unto the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
people: As <hi>Gideon</hi> made an <hi>Ephod of gold,</hi> and put it in his City,
Judges 8 27. <hi>and all Iſrael went thither, a whoring after it,</hi> which thing
became a ſnare unto <hi>Gideon,</hi> and to his houſe: And ſeeing Papiſts will
worſhip a Croſſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſurely they will then worſhip it alſo in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and your ſelves know alſo what reſpect hath been ſhewed to this
Croſſe, by Popiſhly affected amongſt us. Beſides the beautifying of this
Croſſe, was a lauiſhing of your gold. And though you laviſhed it
not on it, as on an Idoll, but as an ornament, yet it being an Idoll,
your gold was laviſhed on it, as on an Idoll. O, this Croſſe, is one
of the Jewels of the Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; its left and kept here as a Love-token,
And gives them hope, one day, that they ſhall enjoy it; and us
again. Therefore this is one of the ſpeciall plague tokens of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and it ſhews this Land in generall, nay, this City in particular,
to be a people God is angry with.</p>
            <p>What this Reverend man feared then, and was much troubled at
in his owne ſpirit, (as his often expreſſions yet, in the memory of
his familiar friends teſtified) namely, that the wrath and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God ſhortly would fall down upon this Kingdom and City,
we have found, and with ſad hearts have cauſe to acknowledge, having
felt the ſmart of it not only in this the great decay of trade which
hath occaſioned the ſinking of many chief Citizens amongſt us, but
that which is more then either our trades or lives, the great decay of
the Goſpel, the faithfull Preachers thereof being hunted out from
amongſt us, And this religious pious man, a leſſed light, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
in the midſt of his dayes to breath his laſt in a ſtrange Land.</p>
            <p>If more Arguments in this kind are deſired, you
may read at large a new Treatiſe of Maſter <hi>Gurney</hi>
againſt Images, extracted out of the Homilies.</p>
            <p>There is not ſuch a ſuperſtitious Monument in
<hi>Spain, France,</hi> no not in <hi>Rome,</hi> nor in any part of the
Chriſtian World as this Croſſe is, as Travellers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port:
&amp; that we ſhould gild it, &amp; Papiſts adore it on
their knees, (as many witneſſes teſtifie) is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
wee doubt not but our Worthies in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
Houſes of Parliament will take away the
memory of it.</p>
