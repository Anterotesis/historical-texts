            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>In the firſt place, we preſent our friends with an obſervation of the power of the living God, from the year <hi>41.</hi> till <hi>59.</hi> with a Compariſon between the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Iſraelites, and the back-ſliding Army and Judges of <hi>England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>DEar Friends, and Fellow-ſufferers, if you do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the power of the living God, you cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, That unleſſe the Lord had been on our ſides, when men roſe up againſt us, they had ſwallowed us up quick; and if you obſerve the Kingly Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 14. how he declares the mercies and wondrous works of God, who reproved Kings for their ſakes, how he delivered them out of bondage, bringing forth his people with joy, and his choſen with gladneſs, giving them the lands of the Heathen, and they inherited the labours of the people: you may ſee the reaſon wherefore he did it, at the 45. verſe of the 104. <hi>Pſal.</hi> viz. <hi>That they might obſerve his Statutes, and keep his Laws.</hi> But take notice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 13, 39, 40. verſes, they ſoon for at his works: <hi>They waited not for his counſel: They were defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the wrath of the Lord kindled againſt his people, and he delivered them into the hands of thoſe that hated them.</hi> O. C. Nevertheleſſe he remembred for them his Covenant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
            <p>Now compare and call to mind, had not the enemy, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane enemy (which neither feared God nor reſpected man) ſwallowed us up quick, if the Lord, the Lord of hoſts, had not delivered us, reproving Kings for our ſakes, bringing us
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119093:3"/>
forth with joy and gladneſſe? Ought we not to have executed judgement and juſtice? Was it not our duty to have delivered the oppreſſed, to have broken every yoke? But alas! you may read our condition firſt and laſt, 106. Pſal. 10, 11. <hi>He ſaved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. The waters covered their enemies.</hi> And thus the Lord deliver'd us, in 46, 47, 48. Then obſerve how exactly we imitated them at the 12. verſe, <hi>Then believed they his words, they ſang his praiſe:</hi> ſo did <hi>Oliver.</hi> But Mark! at the 13. verſe, <hi>They ſoon forgot his works, they waited not for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, but lusted,</hi> &amp;c. And as the Iſraelites made a calf in <hi>Horeb,</hi> and worſhipped the Molten Image: So the Judges of this Nation made a Protector, and waited upon his counſel; and when he died, they made an image of him in whom they truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and brought it into the houſe of their prieſts at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> where it remains to this very day: 106. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21. to the 29. <hi>They forg at God their Saviour: Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions, and the plague broke in upon them,</hi> verſ. 30, 31. <hi>Then ſtood up</hi> Phinehas <hi>and executed judgement, and ſo the plague was ſtayed: And that was counted unto him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, unto all generations for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this example therefore of <hi>Phineas</hi> ſtir up all faithfull hearts, both in Parliament, Army and Common-wealth, ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to execute Judgement and Juſtice upon evil doers without partiality. Conſidering that the Lord may juſtly bring a plague upon us, for our notorious wickedneſſes and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

whereof, after we had ſo undauntedly, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly ventured our lives and eſtates; Nevertheleſſe, like the children of Iſrael, we were reduced and carried back from that good work; and when we lookt for Judgement and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, behold oppreſſion, and Tyranny; for Righteouſneſſe, and behold a cry.

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen and Fellow-Commoners:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the beginning of that unnatural War, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. We were called forth and conjured by ſeveral Declarations of Parliament, to the defence of your, our own and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples juſt Rights and Priviledges. And, as you may read in the beginning of a Remonſtrance of many thouſand Citizens, and other Free born people of <hi>England,</hi> directed to their own Houſe of Commons, occaſioned through the illegal and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous impriſonment of that famous and worthy Sufferer for his Countreys Freedom, Lieutenant Colonel <hi>John Lilburn;</hi> You may there finde the power we intruſted you withal, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <note rend="inter">Vide a Remonſtrance <hi>Anno 1646.</hi>
               </note> We are well aſſured, yet cannot forget, that the cauſe of our chuſing you to be Parliament-men, was to deliver us from all kinde of bondage, and to preſerve the Commonwealth in peace and happineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, we poſſeſt you with the ſame power that was in our ſelves to have done the ſame: For we might justly have done it our ſelves, without you, if we had thought it convenient; chuſing you (as perſons whom we thought fitly qualified, and faithful) for avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome inconveniences.</p>
            <p>But ye are to remember, this was onely of us but a power of truſt (which is ever revokable, and cannot be otherwiſe) and to be imployed to no other end, then our own well-being: nor did we chuſe you to continue our truſt longer then the known eſtabliſh'd conſtitution of this Commonwealth, will
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119093:4"/>
juſtly permit; and that could be but for one year at the moſt: for by our Law, a Parliament is to be called once a year, and oftner (if need be) as ye well know. We are your Principals, and you our Agents; it's truth which you cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: For if you or any other ſhall aſſume or exerciſe any power that is not derived from our truſt and choice thereunto, that power is no leſs then Uſurpation, and an oppreſſion from which we expect to be freed, in whomſoever we finde it; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether inconſiſtent with the nature of juſt Freedom, which we alſo very well underſtand, &amp;c. But how ye have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged this our truſt, let the righteous God judg between you and us; for though we are willing to go backward, and cover your ſhame, yet we know your works: be watchful aud ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the things that remain, that are ready to die, for we have not found your works perfect before God: Remember there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how ye have read and heard; and hold faſt, and repent, for behold, the Lord hath heard our cries, and is come down to deliver us. And you are brought back, either to perfect that Good Work which hath lyen ſo long in your hands, or elſe that the Lord may make known to you (as he did to <hi>Pharaoh)</hi> his Almighty power and Omnipotency.</p>
            <p>Therefore take heed that you harden not your hearts, leſt the Lord bring upon you as great plagues, as he did upon <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh:</hi> let juſtice and truth be countenanced, and not Laws made, making men offenders for a word, laying ſnares for them that reprove in the gate. Let not <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> (who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the widow and fatherleſs) riſe up in judgement againſt you, and condemn you.</p>
            <p>Finally, we complain at this preſent, as the good people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained 1646. <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that ye are extreamly altered in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor towards us: In the beginning, you ſeemed to know what Freedom was, made a diſtinction of honeſt men, whether rich or poor, all were welcom to you, and ye would mix your ſelves with us, in a loving and familiar way, void of courtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance or behaviour.</p>
            <p>Ye kept your Committees doors open, all might hear and judge of your dealings; hardly you would permit men to ſtand bare-headed before you, ſome of you telling them, ye more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded their health, and that they ſhould not deem of you as of their domineering Courts: ye and they were all one, all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119093:5"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> and the like ingenuous carriage; by which Ye wan our affections, to that height, that ye no ſooner demanded any thing, but it was effected: Ye did well then, who did hinder you? To paſs by the multitude of pretious Lives have been loſt, and the maſs of monies which have been raiſed, and for all that, the noble, patient, faithful Souldier's forced to ſell his Debenters (the price of his blood and travels) at 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> pound, or 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> at moſt, would make rational men almoſt mad to conſider. The Cuſtomes were thought an oppreſſion at the beginning, nevertheleſs is now confirmed with many aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations; truly it is a ſad thing, but too true. A plain quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded man in any place in <hi>England,</hi> is juſt like a harmleſs ſheep in a thicket, can hardly move or ſtir but he ſhall be ſcratched, and loſe his wool: and none are ſo ill uſed, as honeſt Godly men. And now if ye believe there is a God, ye muſt believe it; and if you do believe it, and conſider the wayes ye have trod, and truly repent, ſhew it by walking contrary to what ye have done, and let us quickly and ſpeedily partake thereof; For God is a God that taketh vengeance, and will not ſuffer you to go on to our Ruine.</p>

            <p n="2">2. That Juſtice and Equity may be equally, impartially and ſpeedily diſtributed; that the honeſt people be no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded and ruined: and let this be your work, and go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with it; refer it not to this day and that day, for it is the greateſt oppreſſion this day in <hi>England,</hi> and far more inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

then either King or Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That none may be impriſon'd for conſcience ſake, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as Malefactors, but by due proceſs in Law, and a Jury of their equals. And that all ſuch as have been ſpoiled, illegally impriſoned, baniſhed or abuſed, may be forthwith recal'd, the impriſon'd freed or condemn'd, their caſes heard, their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ruines repair'd.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That ſuch as have purchaſed vaſt Eſtates by defrauding the ſouldiers of their Debenters (the price of their bloods) or have by any unjuſt wayes or means, couzened and cheated the Nation, either as Committee-men, Exciſe-men, Treaſurers, Sequeſtrators or Collectors, may be examined how they have gotten ſuch Eſtates, and by the mouths of two Witneſſes and a Jury of their neighbours, they may ſtand and abide ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence as ſhall be agreeable to Equity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That ſuch as have betrayed the Liberties of the People ſo long contended for, and ſuch as have been impeached and ſecluded the Houſes of Parliament for Treaſon, may be brought to Judgement.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the Eſtates of all diſhoneſt unconſcionable perſons may be ſold, who have put themſelves priſoners into the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Bench, of purpoſe to defraud their honeſt Creditors, who out of love and good will, in their neceſſities, truſted them with their monies, and goods; in thankfulneſs whereof, they thereby cheat and couzen them, inſtead of a recompence. There they lie drinking, ſwearing, and conſuming other mens Eſtates: and in our judgements, are far worſe then thieves, or high-way men; What think you Engliſh men? ought not this to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, and ſatisfaction made to honeſt Creditors?</p>
            <p n="7">7. That none be impreſſed or compelled to ſerve as ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the Wars, (except in caſe of neceſſity, by reaſon of forraign Invaſion) nor yet be forced out of the Nation upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Services.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That ſpeedy courſe may be taken for paying and ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Army, who are ſo much in arrear, that ſome of them are forced to great wants and extreamities; that ſo they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Quarters honeſtly, and not be beholden to Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Oſtlers.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That all differences in Law may be heard and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in every County, without fraud or delay; to the end that

all honeſt laborious people in this Nation, may enjoy that little which is juſtly their own, with peace and content: which will be the greateſt good any Parliament can do.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That trading (the externall life of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth) may be reviv'd and encourag'd; and ſome preſent courſe taken for the advance thereof: which will add new life to this languiſhing Nation, and induce the people to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their callings with delight and comfort.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That all poor, old, blind, lame, ſick, and impriſoned, which lie begging and crying in the ſtreets, may be carefully provided for, both as members of Jeſus Chriſt, and your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſtians; That there may be no more groning, nor complaining in our ſtreets.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That this preſent Parliament may have bounds, and be ſubject to the Laws of this Nation, as well as others; and that ſome period and term of time be ſet down (as a year) when they ſhall be diſſolved: That thereby they may taſte of ſubjection as well as rule; and know how to conſider other mens caſes, as what may come to be their own. Otherwiſe, in ſtead of one Tyrant, we ſhall have a thouſand.</p>
            <p>And you ſhall perceive, we have not yet left our true En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh confidence, but are willing, that both you and all our neighbour Nations, ſhoud know, that we both ſee and know all ſtratagems and policies that are laid in wait to entrap, and ſo to enſlave us; and that we bid defiance (now, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to the worſt our enemies can do. And we would not have you to be diſcouraged in attempting whatſoever is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently juſt: for we will therein aſſiſt you to the laſt drop of our blouds. Fear neither the <hi>Anakims,</hi> nor the ſons of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, for the Lord our God, he will ſtand by you in all things that are juſt, and will bleſſe and proſper you therein. Forſake and utterly renounce all crafty and ſubtil intentions; hide not your thoughts from us, and give us encouragement to be open breaſted unto you.</p>
            <p>And now, if ye ſhall conſcionably perform your truſt the year enſuing, and order the Parliaments to ſucceed as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, then we ſhall not doubt to be made abſolute freemen in time; and become a juſt, plenteous, and powerfull Nation. All that is paſt will be forgotten, and we ſhall have cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in your wiſdome and fidelity.</p>

            <head>We conclude with a Call to all thoſe that will follow the Lambe.</head>
            <p>ANd we hereby cry and call to all thoſe that will follow the Lambe Jeſus Chriſt, and own him to be King, Prieſt, and Prophet: O come, come quickly, and his Banner over you ſhall be love: ſtand no longer diſputing and catching at ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, but unite as one man for Juſtice and Righteouſneſſe: O how good and joyfull a thing it is for brethren to live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in unity! Love and unity, like arrows in the Quiver, are not to be broken; one by one, is the conqueſt of a finger. But if no arguments can move you to love, we pronounce that you have no Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, you are none of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. You know many brave Engliſh ſpirits which would yet never bow their knees to <hi>Baal,</hi> who have ſuffered both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, baniſhment, and death it ſelf: And ſhall we now give over? ſhall we now give over the work of the Lord? ſhall any thing ſeparate us from the love of Jeſus Chriſt? ſhall tribulation or perſecution? we are perſwaded, neither life nor death, principalities nor powers, Parliament nor Army, things preſent, or things to come, ſhall be able to hinder us from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that Lambe. And now to the end we may, like true Engliſh men, conſider and compaſſionate one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and ſufferings, we deſire that thoſe noble ſpirits would meet every Thurſday or Sunday, about 7. of the clock in the morning, at the Tomb of Mr. <hi>Jo. Lilburn,</hi> in order to concord and unity; and that we may be better known one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that we may comfort and encourage one another in the work of the Lord, as the Lord hath commanded by the Prophet <hi>I ſay,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees, ſay to them that are of a fearfull heart, Be ſtrong, fear not: Behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence, he will come to ſave you,</hi> Iſa. 35. 3, 4.</p>
