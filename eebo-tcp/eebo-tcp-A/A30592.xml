            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS <hi>thoſe who have been of late, and in theſe days yet are of the Antichriſtian party, may well be accounted men born in an evil time; becauſe howſoever heretofore was the time of Gods long ſuffering towards ſuch,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57146:3"/>
               <hi>the time of permiſsion of them to prosper, the ſet time of Antichriſts downfal then be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing further off then now it is. But now</hi> Gods <hi>time of ſetting his face against Antichriſt, and all the Antichriſtian party, is come, wherein GOD is determined to fight against them, and to ruine them; most wretched men therefore are they who now have ſpirits ſet for the upholding, the pleading for that which</hi> God <hi>hath ſet himſelf against. So happy eſpecially now are thoſe whoſe hearts have been, and still are ſet to countenance, main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain, to further and honor the truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpel, in the power and purity of it; Theſe are born and raiſed up by</hi> God, <hi>and for</hi> God, <hi>in a most bleſſed time, wherein God stretcheth out his holy Arm together with them, their hearts are guided by</hi> God <hi>himſelf, to the furtherance of that work which is the greatest work that</hi> God <hi>hath to do in this latter age of the world; namely, To bring in his Truth and Ordinances with glory and power, to ſet up</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>as the praiſe of the earth, to make godlineſs, and the powerful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of it, as honorable as ever it hath been contemptible. And now (Right Honorable) God hath been pleaſed to bleſs your Noble Family for many years past, with this ſo great a bleſsing,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57146:3"/>
               <hi>as to make it instrumental to this great work of his, and your ſelf have had a plentiful ſhare in this ſo great a happineſs: Your Honor hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced ſuperſtitious time-ſerving ſpirits, but as for the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, and the most ſincere and godly of your Countrey, your Honor hath caſt much reſpect upon them, and been the encourager of them, which reflects Honor, as upon</hi> Gods <hi>name and his truth, ſo upon your noble Family; I believe there hath not aſcended to Heaven more praiſes to</hi> God <hi>from any County in</hi> England <hi>for any Noble Family, in regard of the placing of a godly, painful, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Miniſtery, as hath aſcended from that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in which your Honor, and your truly Noble Father, hath had ſuch a large opportunity of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for</hi> God, <hi>and doing good to his people: And I may further confidently affirm, That no Noble Family in</hi> England <hi>hath more prayers of the Saints aſcending to Heaven for a bleſsing upon it, then that family of yours; neither is there any Noble Family this day, ſhall I ſay in</hi> England? <hi>I may without preſumption reach it further, which the Lord hath bleſſed, in regard of ſome Branches of it, with more beauty and power of godlineſs then he hath bleſſed yours; in regard whereof, it</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57146:4"/>
               <hi>would be the most miſerable thing that could be, if ever the ſucceſsion of the countenancing and honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ways of godlineſs, ſhould be cut off from ſuch a noble</hi> Family. <hi>Curſed be that man who ſhall be the cutter off of the ſucceſsion of ſo great an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to ſuch an Honorable Family.</hi> Pſal, 72. 17. <hi>it is ſaid,</hi> The name of Chriſt ſhould endure for ever; Filiabitur nomine ejus, <hi>ſo the words are, it ſhall be</hi> begotten, <hi>as one generation is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of another, and ſo there ſhall be a ſucceſsion of Chriſts name. It is a moſt bleſſed thing when in a Family there is a begetting of the name of Chriſt, and ſo it is left unto the ſucceeding generation, as the name of the Family is left unto it:</hi> Pliny <hi>tells us, that it was accounted a great honor, yea the height of felicity, that in one houſe and Race of the</hi> Curio's, <hi>there were known to be three excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Plin. lib. 7 c. 41.</note> Orators <hi>one after another, by deſcent from the Father to the Son; and that the</hi> Fabii <hi>afforded three Preſidents of the Senate, in courſe one imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſucceeding the other. If this ſucceſsion be ſo honorable, ſo happy, how honorable, how happy doth the ſucceſsion of Religion from Father to Son, make Families to be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This ſucceſsion in your noble Family, is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the prayers of many precious ſpirits, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb facs="tcp:57146:4"/>
dear to God: And my Lord, although God hath made you exceeding instrumental for much good to his people, which is one of the greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſings under heaven, yet let not your Lordſhip rest in this:</hi> Gods <hi>warning to</hi> Solomon, 1 Kings 9. 4. <hi>is very obſervable, after</hi> Solomon <hi>had finiſhed that glorious Temple for the honor of the Lord, after he had aſſembled all the Elders of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to bring up the Ark of the Lord with all ſolemnity, after he had made ſuch an excellent Prayer before all the people, after he had offered to the Lord two and twenty thouſand Oxen, and one hundred and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſand ſheep, and in his rejoycing in this great work done to the honor of</hi> God, <hi>he made a great Feast to all the people ſeven days, and to them he added ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ven days more, and ſent away the people with joyful and glad heaets; yet after this, God ſays to him,</hi> If thou wilt walk before me as David thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther walked, in integrity of heart, and up rightneſs, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, then I will eſtabliſh the throne of thy kingdom. <hi>Though the things that you have done be great things, yet I expect</hi> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to all that I have commanded thee, <hi>or elſe all is nothing. It were infinite pity, and</hi> God <hi>forbid ſo great an evil, that any one</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57146:5"/>
               <hi>way of ſin ſhould ever ſtand up, to hinder the bleſsing upon a noble ſpirit, and ſuch worthy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices for the Church as you have done, well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming that true nobility of ſuch a ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Honor hath appeared much for the</hi> Honor, <hi>the</hi> Safety, Peace, Liberties <hi>of the Saints and your Countrey; and how many now have their conſciences check them, and ſhame is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their faces for that baſe cowardiſe and vile time-ſerving, that the true nobility of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips ſpirit (ſcorning ſuch baſeneſs) delivered you from. God hath now appeared for his people more then ever, in our or our Forefathers time, do you now appear more then ever for them; As</hi> God <hi>hath mightily enlarged the opportunity of ſervice, ſo the good</hi> God <hi>enlarge and heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with true Nobility and Chriſtian generouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs your Noble ſpirit, that you may be as a choſen ſhaft in the Quiver of the Lord, reſerved to theſe times, to be in a high degree instrumental to his praiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is now near three years ſince that your Lordſhip lying ſick, not without apprehenſion that</hi> Gods <hi>time to call you from the Land of the living was come,</hi> I <hi>was then for ſome time daily with your Lordſhip, and all the deſires you expreſſed for life</hi>

               <hi>were,</hi> That you might live to do God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice here: God <hi>then ſpared your life, and now my Lord, I beſeech your Honor to give me leave to minde your Lordſhip of theſe deſires, and thoſe Covenants you made with</hi> God <hi>if ever he reſtored you. Surely the Vows of</hi> God <hi>are upon you,</hi> God <hi>hath now put an opportunity into your hand to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil them, and all other you have ever made unto him, and now he expects the performance of them; now there are opportunities of that ſervice that may draw forth all that nobility of your ſpirit, wherein you may give teſtimony of thankfulneſs for all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſo abundantly heaped upon you, and be faithful in performing of all your vows, and bleſſed be</hi> God <hi>for this opportunity: This is your honor, to account opportunity of ſervice for</hi> God <hi>and his people your greatest honor upon earth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57146:10"/>
Yet he might have had many reaſonings in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that might have drawn his heart another way; he might have thought, that in his keeping of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and power he had in the <hi>Court,</hi> he might have done a great deal of ſervice for God, in the improving of his favor with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Nobles</hi> for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; he might have been of great uſe for them, that it was a thing of great conſequence, for them to have a friend in the <hi>Court,</hi> that might do them ſo much good, as it was probable he might have done: Yea, he might have thought with himſelf, Surely God intends to uſe me here in ſome great ſervice for his people, for how wonderful hath his Providence been towards me, in bringing me to, in raiſing of me up, and continuing me in this honor? what a ſtrange and extraordinary Providence of God was it, to diſpoſe of my Parents hearts, to <hi>hide me</hi> in ſuch a maner as they did amongſt the <hi>ruſhes?</hi> and that the <hi>Daughter</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> muſt come at that time to the River, and that I muſt be found by her, and no body elſe; and that God ſhould diſpoſe of her heart ſo, as to commiſerate my condition, and to be ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined towards me as ſhe was, that ſhe ſhould not onely preſerve my life, but have me brought up as her own Son; that ſhe ſhould have care, that my edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation might be ſuch, as I might be meet for honor and advancement in her Fathers houſe, whereas ſhe might have brought me up in ſome baſe and ſervile maner, according to the quality of a Bondſlaves childe, of an Hebrew childe, ſo much abhorred and hated by the Egyptians; and that God ſhould give me that underſtanding and capacity, that I ſhould come to be learned in all the learning of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57146:10"/>
and that God ſhould encline the heart of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> to me likewiſe, that he ſhould countenance me, and prefer me; and that the favor of <hi>Pharaohs daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelf, ſhould continue ſo long as it does, even to my growth up to forty-years; that I ſhould have favor in the eyes of his <hi>Nobles,</hi> and of all the <hi>Court,</hi> none of them ſeeking to undermine me, to alienate <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart from me? ſurely God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to uſe me in ſome great ſervice here in the Court; if I ſhould now do any thing to provoke <hi>Pharaoh</hi> againſt me, to loſe that favor, that honor, that power I have, what a loſs would this be to the people of God? what would become of them? lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hope then of any good to them: yea, if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Court ſhould frown upon me, it is like they will be more enraged againſt them, and rather make their burthen heavier, and their bondage ſorer: Now then what a grievous thing would it be, that ſuch an opportunity as I have in my hands ſhould be loſt?</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeeing Gods minde, that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have him venture himſelf in joyning with his people in affliction, and that this was the way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God would honor himſelf by him, he was content to let go all thoſe reaſonings, and yield up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Gods own way: God will ſometimes rather be honored by the ſufferings and afflictions of men in great Places (who one would think had large op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſervice) then in any ſervice that they ſhall or can do; and ſuch men ſhould be willing to ſubmit to God herein: It is not what I or others think, how God may be honored this way or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but what the will of God is, which way he will be honored; and God expects from men, not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57146:11"/>
onely that they ſhould ſeek his honor, but that they ſhould ſeek it his own way: All the intentions and ayms at the glory of God that can poſſibly be, are nothing; God cares not for them, if they be out of his own way. It was an excellent reſolution of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 25, 26. <hi>If I ſhall finde favor in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me back again, but if he thus ſay, I have no delight in thee; behold, here I am, let him do to me as ſeemeth good to him.</hi> We reade of <hi>Heman,</hi> a man of admirable wiſdom, one of the wiſeſt upon earth in his time, as appears 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 31. and yet <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. <hi>God kept him down, and low by afflictions</hi> all his days <hi>from his youth.</hi> This God doth;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to ſhew his ſoveraignty over his creature, that he hath the abſolute diſpoſe of all, to uſe them as <note place="margin">1.</note> he will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to ſhew that he hath no need of any for his ſervice, for the bringing about his own ends, he <note place="margin">2.</note> hath thouſand thouſands of ways to effect his own will, without help from men, although in never ſuch eminent places.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe he would not have us to put any confidence in man, to think that the work muſt needs <note place="margin">3.</note> be done by ſuch and ſuch; God will caſt them aſide, and bring the work about by other means, that we leaſt thought of.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that he might have a proof of the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial of theſe men, of their abſolute ſubjection to <note place="margin">4.</note> him; in the exerciſe of which grace, God takes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding delight.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, that he might teach ſuch, whileſt they do enjoy their opportunities of ſervice, to walk in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence <note place="margin">5.</note>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57146:11"/>
upon him, humbly before him, not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting much to themſelves: wherefore let ſuch men learn not to ſet too high a price upon their condition, that God hath raiſed them unto above others: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is true, that it is one of the greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſes under heaven, to have large opportunities of ſervice for God and his Church, yet we ſhould not ſo value them, as to ſtretch conſcience in the leaſt degree, for the continuance or improvement of them: look to the word, keep cloſe to it, and then regard not what men ſhall ſuggeſt, what a deal of good you might do, how much ſervice, what honor you might bring to God; why will you hazard your ſelf and the loſs of all?</p>
                  <p>There is much danger in liſtning to theſe reaſonings, becauſe the opportunities for ſervice, and the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up your ſelf in that condition in which you are, being involved together, there may lie much ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, under the pretence of doing ſervice, and that ſo ſecretly, as without diligent and faithful ſearch into your own hearts, you ſhall not perceive it your ſelves; wherefore while you ſee God offering opportunities of ſervice, while you ſee his minde in improving you thus, follow it on with all your might, let no opportunity ſlip, do to the utmoſt you can for God; and when you ſee his minde to lay you aſide, and to uſe you in another way, although it be of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and grievous ſufferings, yet be as willing to yield to God in this, as in the former way; and thereby,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, you ſhall ſhew the moſt glorious work of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial that may be; it is more to deny ones ſelf here <note place="margin">1.</note> then in outward things, there is nothing goes more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57146:12"/>
near to a true generous heart, then to be laid aſide, and to be denyed to be uſed in ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may be, if you bring your hearts to lie at Gods diſpoſe in this, he will uſe you the rather, <note place="margin">2.</note> and you ſhall not be taken off; this may be the means of continuance of you in his work.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if you go on with ſuch a diſpoſition as this, it is more like that God will bleſs your ſervice, while <note place="margin">3.</note> he does uſe you.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, or if you ſhall be taken off for a while, <note place="margin">4.</note> and put into an afflicted condition; wherein it ſhall not appear that you are of any great uſe, (although ſometimes <hi>ſufferings</hi> are the greateſt <hi>ſervices)</hi> yet your afflictions ſhall but prepare you for higher ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice afterwards, as it did in <hi>Moſes:</hi> How did God uſe him afterwards in great and high employments? few men that ever lived upon the earth, were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more for God then he was. The <hi>Magdeburgenſes Centuriatores</hi> think that <hi>Barnabas</hi> the Apoſtle was the ſame that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was, who was one of the two, upon whom the lot was caſt for the Apoſtleſhip, when it fell upon <hi>Matthias,</hi> and he was refuſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. which <hi>Joſeph</hi> was afterwards called <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> by the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 36. in ſtead of <hi>Barſabas;</hi> they making <hi>Joſes</hi> to be the ſame with <hi>Joſeph: Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> was a gracious man, and when he ſaw it was Gods minde not to uſe him in that work, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to go on in that way which God would have him, although it were in a far lower condition, then in the work of an Apoſtle, and therefore afterwards God called him to that high and honorable work.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, howſoever, your reward ſhall be as great, as if you were uſed in the greateſt ſervice, in the higheſt <note place="margin">5.</note>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57146:12"/>
higheſt work you could have deſired to be uſed in: But if you ſhall not be willing to lay down all when God calls you thereunto, and to be put into any low ſuffering condition that he ſhall pleaſe to put you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it is an evident ſign that you went on before in your way with ſelf-confidence, that you aymed at your ſelf, that you did not give God the glory of your ſervice; and if ſo, although God might uſe you for the good of others, yet there will come no bleſſing of it upon your ſelves. This in the general.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>BUt for a more particular handling this verſe, I ſhall firſt give a ſhort paraphraſe of it; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſhew the ſeveral doctrinal concluſions contained in it. <hi>[He choſe] Choyce</hi> notes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of one thing with another, and the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of the minde about the things compared, and at the laſt a free determination of the will which way to go. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> compares the eſtate of Gods people, and the pleaſures of ſin, one with another; he deliberates in his minde, which is the ſafeſt, and the beſt way for him to go, and at laſt freely, yet throughly and fully determines the caſe; <hi>He choſe rather to ſuffer affliction:</hi> he did not chooſe <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> abſolutely, for affliction in it ſelf is an evil, but <hi>rather</hi> then the <hi>pleaſures of ſin,</hi> afflictions are to be choſen: <hi>Job</hi> 36. 21. <hi>Elihu</hi> charges <hi>Job,</hi> that he choſe <hi>ſin</hi> rather then <hi>affliction;</hi> this choyce is an ill choyce,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57146:13"/>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> his choice was a wiſe and gracious choice; he chooſes <hi>affliction</hi> rather then <hi>ſin. [Affliction]</hi> that is, any affliction, not this or that affliction, but whatſoever affliction God ſhould think fit: Many think themſelves willing to ſuffer affliction in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, until they be called unto ſome particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and then they think, Oh, if it were any other we could bear it, but this we know not how to bear; whereas the true ſubjection of the heart to God, is to bear what God himſelf ſhall appoint. He choſe <hi>[to ſuffer affliction,]</hi> not to bring affliction upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Religion teaches no man, raſhly and headily to bring himſelf into miſery. <hi>[To ſuffer affliction with the people of God:]</hi> That is, either in joyning with the people of God in the ways of godlineſs, in which they were; or in appearing for them; or in joyning in communion with them. <hi>[Then to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin.]</hi> The words are in the Original, <hi>Then the enjoyment of ſin. [The pleaſures of ſin;]</hi> that <note place="margin">A <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> is, either ſuch pleaſures as are in themſelves ſinful: or ſecondly, ſuch as cannot be enjoyed, or maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but in a way of ſin: or thirdly, ſuch us would be means to draw the heart unto ſin. <hi>[The pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon:]</hi> that is, either for a ſhort ſeaſon, or for an uncertain ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>The doctrinal Concluſions in the words are theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the uſual condition of Gods people in the <note place="margin">1.</note> world, it is an afflicted condition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when Gods people in Gods way are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grievous afflictions, wicked men in the way of ſin <note place="margin">2.</note> have much pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, afflicted godlineſs is to be choſen, rather then pleaſant wickedneſs. <note place="margin">3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57146:13"/>
Fourthly, a ſpiritual eye can ſee an excellency in <note place="margin">4.</note> Gods people, though they be in never ſuch a low af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted condition.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, a gracious heart is willing to appear for <note place="margin">5.</note> Gods people, to be on their ſide, although it be with much hazard to its ſelf.</p>

                  <p>FOr the firſt: Gods people, although dear and precious in his eyes, yet they have uſually been an afflicted people in all generations unto this day. When God was making his Covenant with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15. 12. at the going down of the Sun a deep ſleep fell upon him: and lo, a horror of great darkneſs was on him, and <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>a ſmoking fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi> and <hi>a burning lamp</hi> paſſed between his ſacrifice, and the Lord tells him of the <hi>bondage</hi> of his ſeed in <hi>Egypt.</hi> The afflicted condition of Gods people who were to come from <hi>Abraham,</hi> was ſhewn by the <hi>horror of darkneſs,</hi> and the <hi>ſmoking furnace:</hi> And this is obſervable, As at the firſt great Promiſe that was made for Gods chooſing of a people to himſelf
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57146:14"/>
out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> loyns, their afflicted eſtate was ſet out; ſo where we have the great promiſe of the Goſpel, the largeſt of any in the Goſpel, for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe who are willing to part with any thing for Chriſt, even there perfecution is annexed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſo the words are, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 29, 30. <hi>There is no man that hath left houſe, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my ſake, and the Goſpels, but he ſhall receive a hundred fold now in this life, houſes, and brethren, and ſiſters, and mothers, and children, and lands,</hi> with perſecutions, <hi>and in the world to come eternal life;</hi> Perſecutions come in amongſt all thoſe great things that are there promiſed. <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a people afflicted <hi>from their youth, Pſal.</hi> 129. 1. When God appeared to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſend him a deliverer of his people, he appeared to him in <hi>a burning buſh,</hi> to ſet out the afflicted eſtate of his people.</p>
                  <p>If the people of God might have a Herald to give Arms to them, as ſome other Profeſſions and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have, the beſt and moſt ſutable, would be ſuch as Mr. <hi>Hooper</hi> that holy <hi>Martyr</hi> had, when he was made Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter, A Lamb in a flaming buſh,</hi> with rayes of the Sun <hi>from Heaven</hi> ſhining on it: a <hi>Lamb</hi> for <hi>meekneſs,</hi> in a buſh burning, amongſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, who are as brambles and thorns, burning with malice, and yet the ſweet influence and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able light of heaven let out upon it.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Ignatius</hi> came to the wilde beaſts, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of them, and his bones cruſhed between their teeth; Now (ſays he) I begin to be a Chriſtian: Bleſſed Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> writing to the Town of <hi>Walden,</hi> to encourage them to ſuffer, ſaith, that that Chriſtian
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57146:14"/>
hath not learned his A. B. C. in Chriſtianity, who hath not learned the leſſon of the Croſs. <hi>A. Chriſtian is a Croſs-bearer,</hi> ſays <hi>Luther.</hi> As God made the evening and the morning to be the firſt day, and ſo <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chriſtianus Cructanus: Qui non eſt Crucia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, non eſt Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>in Gen. c.</hi> 29 <hi>Eccleſia cſt haeres Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi>
                     </note> the ſecond, &amp;c. So the day of Gods people, God hath made to be the evening of troubles here, and the everlaſting morning of glory and happineſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. It is an expreſſion of Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> The godly (ſays he) have their dark ſhadow of troubles before them, and their brightneſs of glory behinde to come hereafter, but the men of the world have their bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before them.</p>
                  <p>Men uſe to bring out their beſt firſt, and reſerve the worſt till afterwards, but Gods dealing with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is otherwiſe, their worſt is firſt with them. The way to <hi>Canaan</hi> is through the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> even after a ſore and tedious bondage; yea, and when God brought his people into <hi>Canaan,</hi> he brought them into the worſt part of <hi>Canaan</hi> firſt, into the ſouthern part, which was the moſt dry and barren part of the land. The way to <hi>Zion</hi> is through the valley of <hi>Baca, Pſal.</hi> 84. 6. <hi>Many are the troubles of the righteous,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 34. 19. According to that of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 22. <hi>Through much tribulation we muſt enter into the kingdom of God. Pſalm</hi> 22. is a prophetical <hi>Pſalm</hi> of Chriſts ſufferings, and the title is upon <hi>Aijeleth Shehar,</hi> which ſignifies the morning Hart or Stag, ſuch a one as the Huntſmen ſever out in the morning from the reſt, to hunt for that day. Such was Chriſt, and ſuch is his Church, as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stag ſevered out to be hunted and worried by the world. <hi>In the world ye ſhall have tribulation,</hi> ſaith our Savior to his diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 16. 33. <hi>we cannot</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57146:15"/>
                     <hi>follow Chriſt, and be his Diſciples,</hi> but <hi>upon theſe terms, Mat.</hi> 16. 24. Others uſe to invite Followers with promiſes of honors and riches, but Chriſt tells the worſt at firſt, what we are like to finde; we muſt be <hi>content</hi> to take up our croſs, not to endure it by <hi>compulſion,</hi> and conſtraint, but to take it up willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cheerfully: Secondly, not what croſs we will, we muſt not chooſe our croſs, but what is appointed for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He muſt take up his croſs.</hi> But this croſs it may be ſhall be but now and then.</p>
                  <p>Yes, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 23. <hi>He muſt take up his croſs</hi> daily.</p>
                  <p>But if every day, I hope it is an eaſie croſs.</p>
                  <p>Nay, it is a killing croſs; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 31. <hi>I dye daily,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet I hope there may be refreſhings ſome part of the day.</p>
                  <p>Not ſo neither; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 36. <hi>For thy ſake are we killed all the day long;</hi> that is, in regard of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death: Secondly, in regard of ſome beginnings that we ſuffer: Thirdly, in regard of our willingneſs to undergo it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Since the days of John Baptiſt the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers violence, and the violent take it by force, Mat.</hi> 11. 12. this is ordinarily taken for the greedineſs of the peoples embracing <hi>Johns</hi> Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but it rather ſeems to be ſpoken of another kinde of violence, namely, the violence of oppoſition and perſecution, in which the enemies of the Goſpel ſeek to lay violent hands upon it; for he tells them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, <hi>Verſe</hi> 16, 17, 18. that the Jews were as way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward children, that nothing would pleaſe them, but ſaid that <hi>John</hi> had a Devil; they were therefore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57146:15"/>
violent againſt his Miniſtery, then violent in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of his Miniſtery.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>All that will live godly, muſt ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution:</hi> Firſt <hi>all]</hi> Every one muſt expect it, although <note place="margin">1.</note> it is true, God calls not all to the like ſufferings, yet he exempts none from ſome degree or other, let him be as wiſe, and as diſcreet as he will, yet if godly, he ſhall not eſcape. Chriſt was the beſt Preacher that ever was, he lived the moſt inoffenſively that ever any did, and yet while he was preaching, the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> blew their noſes at him in ſcorn and deriſion; <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> for ſo the word ſignifies in the Original, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 14. which is tranſlated, <hi>derided him.</hi> And at another time they would have broke his neck, <hi>by caſting him from a ſteep hill,</hi> after he had done his Sermon. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the moſt famous Preacher next to Chriſt, that ever was, and yet he was accounted a <hi>babler,</hi> a <hi>peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fellow,</hi> his Sermons were accounted <hi>factious</hi> and <hi>ſeditious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He that</hi> will <hi>live godly.]</hi> The Devil <note place="margin">2.</note> will let a man have many wiſhes and deſires, theſe are not perſecuted; but he that <hi>will,</hi> if he be ſet upon it, abſolutely reſolved that he <hi>will,</hi> and nothing ſhall hinder, then he muſt make account to <hi>ſuffer:</hi> When the <hi>woman</hi> in the <hi>Revelations, Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>was ready to bring forth her Childe,</hi> the <hi>Dragon</hi> ſought to devour it, he medled not with her all the while ſhe was <hi>a breeding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he that will <hi>live.]</hi> If he keep his <note place="margin">3.</note> godlineſs in his heart, and not diſcover it in his life, he may go on well enough, but theſe ſhews of godlineſs the world cannot endure. Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt appear with open face, but godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57146:16"/>
muſt keep within doors: Wickedneſs trades openly, but godlineſs muſt keep in as a bankrupt, that dare not be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he that will live <hi>godly.]</hi> Not civilly one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">4.</note> for a man to live fairly, lovingly, juſtly amongſt men, to keep from crying ſins, and here to reſt, this man perhaps may eſcape ſufferings; but if he begins to live <hi>godly,</hi> to go beyond <hi>morality</hi> in his profeſſion, then he muſt expect to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, he that will live godly in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> that is, in the vertue, ſtrength and power <hi>of Chriſt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>Jeſus;</hi> The other may be done without knowledge of <note place="margin">What it is <hi>to live godly</hi> in Chriſt.</note> Chriſt, but this godlineſs <hi>in Chriſt Ieſus</hi> is that which is perſecuted in the world <hi>[godly in Chriſt Jeſus.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, firſt <hi>real</hi> and true godlineſs, not the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow <note place="margin">1.</note> of godlineſs: A Wolf flies not upon a painted ſheep, we can look upon a painted toad with delight: There are ſome forms, and ſhadows of godlineſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in the world, but the reality and truth of godlineſs is that which is hated, and oppoſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, godlineſs in Chriſt Jeſus, is exact god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <note place="margin">2.</note> it carries a ſoul to a higher pitch then morality doth; now a man begins to live in a higher courſe of Religion, to be ſtrict in his ways, to tremble at the leaſt ſin, to devote himſelf wholly to God, this man muſt expect to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the godlineſs that is in Chriſt Jeſus, is a <note place="margin">3.</note> ſtirring godlineſs: if a man will be lukewarm, and as <hi>Gallio,</hi> not caring which way things go, then many will ſpeak well of him, <hi>he is no buſie-body,</hi> not <hi>ſo hot,</hi> and <hi>fierce as others are.</hi> We reade <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> was content <hi>to let the people go,</hi> onely <hi>he would not have them go far;</hi> ſo, many are content that men
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57146:16"/>
ſhould be Religious, ſo be it they do not go too far, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 2. Chriſt ſaith to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, I know thy labor and thy patience;</hi> mark how theſe two are joyned: If the Angel had not labored ſo much, it is like he had not ſuffered ſo much: If Miniſters and Chriſtians will be idle and do little, they are not like to ſuffer much, a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience will ſerve turn; but thoſe who put forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who are ſtirring, active, who labor much, they muſt expect to ſuffer much. It is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that of the <hi>ſeven Churches</hi> we reade of in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> there are onely <hi>two</hi> of whoſe troubles there are no mention; and which are they? the firſt is <hi>Sardis,</hi> of which it is ſaid, <hi>She had a name that ſhe lived, and was dead:</hi> the other was <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that was <hi>neither hot nor cold:</hi> Theſe two eſcaped trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but none of the other.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the godlineſs that is <hi>in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> is a <note place="margin">4.</note> powerful godlineſs, that will not yield and give in; ſuch as the Lord requires in <hi>Ieremy, Let them come in to you, do not you go to them:</hi> Let men ſay what they will, let them threaten, rail, flatter, perſwade, yet this yields not. Now the world judges this to be <hi>pride, ſtubbornneſs,</hi> not knowing what the power of godlineſs means: A reed that yields, is not ſhatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the wind: So thoſe who will be time-ſervers, whoſe conſciences will bow any way, thoſe ſhall ſuffer no great matter; but if men be unyieldable, eſpecially in things that are counted ſmall, as many of the Chriſtians in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, who <hi>would not caſt one grain of frankincenſe into the fire to ſave their lives,</hi> theſe are hated, contemned and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the World: Antichriſt is content to let the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57146:17"/>
name and profeſſion of Religion alone, but he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes the power of godlineſs, it is that which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth againſt him, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 8. He ſlays the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but he lets their carcaſſes lie openly; he cares not for the name and profeſſion, ſo be it the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing power be ſlain.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Godlineſs <hi>in Christ Jeſus,</hi> is world-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning <note place="margin">5.</note> godlineſs; <hi>Noah</hi> condemned the world by that he did: Other men ſhould be accounted well of, were it not for theſe; but this darkens their light, and condemns their way, which they are not able to abide, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Beloved, think it not ſtrange</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>concerning the fiery tryal, as though ſome ſtrange thing happened unto you;</hi> be not moved at it, as at the coming of <hi>a ſtranger</hi> unexpectedly, you muſt entertain troubles <hi>as ordinary</hi> daily gueſts.</p>
                  <p>It hath been, is, and will be the order of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards his people, that they ſhall be in an afflicted condition, and that many times in great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities; and hence, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 10. the Apoſtle prays, <hi>That the God of all grace would make them perfect, after they had ſuffered a while;</hi> as if prayer might not be made for <hi>perfection,</hi> until we have ſuffered a while. As ſoon as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was manifeſted to be a choſen veſſel for the honor of God, it was ſhewn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>what things he ſhould ſuffer for the name of Chriſt,</hi> as if that were a neceſſary concomitant to the profeſſion of godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>Look over the whole Book of God, and conſider the hiſtory of the lives of Gods people in all ages, both in Scripture, and in other records, and you ſhall finde them uſually in a poor afflicted condition; as ſoon as we hear of any work of Religion, we hear
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57146:17"/>
of the <hi>perſecution of Abel. Noahs</hi> Ark on the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> was a type of the condition of the Church in afflictions. What hard things did <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> endure in their generations? How ſore was the bondage of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt?</hi> Their paſſage through the <hi>Red ſea</hi> and the diſmall <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> was a type of the afflicted condition of Gods people in after ages, through which they were to paſs to Heaven: How was <hi>David</hi> hunted as <hi>a Partridge in the wilderneſs?</hi> What bitter and ſore complaints do we hear, of the grievous ſuffering he met withal? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129. the Church there bemoans her condition, that <hi>from her youth up ſhe had been afflicted:</hi> What hard uſage did the bleſſed Prophets of the Lord finde? <hi>Eliah</hi> was perſecuted, and muſt flie for his life, while <hi>four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred falſe Prophets</hi> were fed <hi>at Iezabels table: Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah</hi> muſt be fed with <hi>the bread of affliction, and the water of adverſity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hiſtories tell us, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſawn aſunder with a wooden ſaw; <hi>Ieremy</hi> was put into a dungeon, ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mire (as ſome ſtories ſay) even up to the ears, and after was ſtoned to death in <hi>Egypt; Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> was ſlain in <hi>Babylon; Micah</hi> was thrown down a ſteep place, and his neck broke; <hi>Amos</hi> was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a club, and ſo brained: The Story of the perſecutions of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> propheſied of, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 36. and recorded by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. from the 35 Verſe to the end, is exceeding lamentable; the Texts ſays, That they were <hi>tortured,</hi> that they had the tryal <hi>of cruel mockings</hi> and <hi>ſcourgings,</hi> of <hi>bonds</hi> and <hi>impriſonment;</hi> they were <hi>ſtoned,</hi> were <hi>ſawn aſunder,</hi> ſlain with the ſword, <hi>wandred up and</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:57146:18"/>
                     <hi>down in Sheep-skins and Goats-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented, they wandred in deſerts, and mountains, and dens, and caves in the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after, for the Chriſtian Church, we know what <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, the great leader of his people ſuffered, what <hi>contradiction of ſinners?</hi> what <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts? miſeries? ſcorns? ſcourges? curſed, cruel, ſhameful death?</hi> When <hi>Stephen</hi> the firſt Chriſtian <hi>Martyr</hi> was ſtoned, <hi>Dorotheus</hi> witneſſeth, that <hi>two thouſand others which believed on Chriſt, were put to death the ſame day.</hi> All the twelve Apoſtles after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſore and grievous afflictions endured, ſuffered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny violent deaths, <hi>John</hi> onely excepted: who yet, as the Scripture teſtifieth, was baniſhed into <hi>Patmos,</hi> and as ſome Hiſtories, that he was by <hi>Domitian</hi> thrown into a Tun of ſcalding lead, yet as they ſay, delivered by a miracle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> was crucified with his heels upward, becauſe he would not be as Chriſt was, thinking himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of that honor: <hi>Andrew</hi> was crucified by <hi>Egeas</hi> King of <hi>Edeſſa: Iames</hi> was ſlain by the ſword of <hi>Herod,</hi> as we finde <hi>Acts:</hi> 12. the beginning: <hi>Philip</hi> was crucified, and ſtoned to death at <hi>Hieropolis,</hi> a City in <hi>Phrygia: Bartholomew,</hi> after divers perſecutions, was beaten down with ſtaves as he was preaching in a City of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and then crucified, and after his skin flead off, and beheaded: <hi>Thomas</hi> was ſlain with a Dart at <hi>Calamina</hi> in <hi>India: Matthew</hi> was run through with a ſword, or as ſome write, ſlain with a ſpear: <hi>Iames</hi> the ſon of <hi>Alpheus,</hi> who was called the <hi>juſt man,</hi> was ſet upon the pinacle of the Temple, and thrown down, and yet having ſome life left in him, he was brained with a Fullers club; ſome Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57146:18"/>
ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion, had a ſpecial hand in this: <hi>Lebbeus</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Agbarus King of Edeſſa: Simon</hi> the <hi>Canaanite</hi> was crucified in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or as others ſay, he and <hi>Iude</hi> was ſlain in a tumult of the people: <hi>Matthias</hi> that came into the number in ſtead of <hi>Iudas,</hi> was ſtoned, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed: <hi>Paul</hi> was beheaded at <hi>Rome,</hi> under <hi>Nero.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe ten fearful Perfecutions in the Primitive times, from the time of <hi>Domitius Nero,</hi> unto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> doth ſet out fully unto us the truth of this argument: for three hundred years together, the name of a Chriſtian was death, except now and then, the Churches had ſome little breathings. <hi>Brightman</hi> ſpeaking of the ſtories of thoſe times, ſays, that <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry page, and leaf, is as it were all red, coloured in blood:</hi> the Covenant of grace is a bloody Covenant, both in regard of the blood of Chriſt, firſt ſealing it, and the blood of the bleſſed <hi>Martyrs,</hi> adding likewiſe their ſeals in confirming of it. In that Treatiſe that goes under the name of <hi>Cyprian, de duplici Martyrio;</hi> ſpeaking of that place, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Three bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on earth,</hi> the <hi>Spirit, water</hi> and <hi>blood;</hi> the <hi>third</hi> is applyed to the blood of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> in thoſe times.</p>
                  <p>It is a moſt heart-breaking meditation to conſider the ragings, madneſs and fury of the Heathens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſtians in thoſe times. <hi>Ierome</hi> in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to <hi>Cromatius,</hi> ſays, that there was no day in a whole year, unto which the number of five thouſand Martyrs cannot be aſcribed, except onely the firſt day of <hi>Ianuary.

invention, of men and devils, were exerciſed and ſtretched out to the utmoſt, for deviſing the moſt miſerable torments, and exquiſite tortures; as plates of Iron burning hot, laid upon their naked fleſh; pinſers red hot, pulling off the fleſh from the bones; bodkins, pricking and thruſting all over their bodies: caſting into lime kilns, and into caldrons of ſcalding lead: whippings until almoſt all the fleſh was torn off their bodies, and their bones and bowels appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then laid flat upon ſharp ſhels and knives: their skins were flead off alive, and then their raw fleſh was rubbed with ſalt and vineger: their bodies were beaten all over with clubs, until their bones and joynts were beat aſunder: they were laid upon grid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irons, roſted, and baſted with ſalt and vineger: one member was pulled from another; by faſtening them to the boughs of trees, they rent their bodies apieces: they were toſſed upon the horns of Bulls, with their bowels hanging out; they were caſt among dogs to be devoured; they were put under the Ice naked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rivers; they were tortured on the rack, on the wheel, and on the gibbet, with flaming fire under them: they made it their ſports, to ſee them devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by wilde beaſts; and in the night, in ſtead of torches, they burnt the bodies of the Saints, to give them light for their paſtimes.</p>
                  <p>To give you an inſtance or two, that you may ſee the miſerable extremities the Saints of God in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times paſſed through. I read of one <hi>Sanctus,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom when ſuch intolerable tortures were inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Perſecuters thought, ſurely they ſhould have heard ſome words of blaſphemy coming from him, yet they could get nothing but this, <hi>Sum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57146:19"/>
I am a Chriſtian;</hi> at which they being mad, they clapt on plates of braſs red hot, to the moſt tender parts of his body, wherewith although his Spirit ſhrunk not, but ſtill continued conſtant, yet his body was ſo drawn together, that it loſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhape of a man; and after he lying in priſon a while, they brought him forth again to the common ſcaffold in the face of the people, and put him to all kinde of torments they could deviſe, as though he had been put to none before, as <hi>ſcourgings, tearings by wilde beaſts;</hi> his body being thus torn, they brought an iron chair red hot with fire, and ſet him in it, and ſo fryed and ſcorched him as upon a grid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iron: Thus he being made the whole day a ſpectacle to the people, in ſtead of their games and ſights, they could get nothing from him, but his firt confeſſion, <hi>Chriſtianus ſum, I am a Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The example of <hi>Romanus,</hi> who was of noble birth, but more noble in his <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> is very famous; he was firſt whipped with knaps of lead at the ends of the cords; he deſired them not to ſpare him for his Nobility, <hi>Not the blood of my progenitors,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but Chriſtian profeſſion makes me noble:</hi> then they lanced him with knives, until the bones appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed white, his face was buffeted, his eye-lids torn with their nails, his hair pulled from his face; the Captain being aſtoniſhed at his conſtancy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to ceaſe from tortures; he was after brought forth and ſcourged again upon his old ſores; they plucked out his tongue by the roots: the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain being yet more aſtoniſhed to ſee him continue conſtant, commanded him to be brought into priſon, and there be to ſtrangled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57146:20"/>
The example of <hi>Vincentius</hi> is as remarkable as any; he was firſt wracked, all his joynts being ſtretched out of their place; then his body was indented with grievous and deadly wounds; then they tortured his fleſh, by ſaking upon it with iron combs ſharply filed; and then they laid his body upon a grate of iron, opening his fleſh with iron hooks, they ſeared it with fiery plates, ſprinkling it with hot burning ſalt; then they drew him into a dungeon, where the floor was ſpread with the ſharpeſt ſhells that could be gotten, they laid his body upon them, and ſo left him without all ſuccor.</p>
                  <p>Take an example of a <hi>woman</hi> or two; one <hi>Blandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> was miſerably whipped, tortured by wilde beaſts, tormented, and ſcorched upon a gridiron, and then put into a net, and caſt unto the wilde Bulls to be gored, and ſo ſlain. We read of one <hi>Eulalila</hi> a yong Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, famous for her godlineſs and conſtancy, who was pulled away from the ſeat of her Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by the hair of her head, then one joynt was pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from another, and the fleſh from the bones by cuſhes and claws of wilde beaſts; then they harrowed her fleſh with an iron hurdle, they burnt her body on every ſide before and behinde with flaming torches, and at laſt caſt her into fire, and conſumed her body unto aſhes.</p>
                  <p>How lamentable is the hearing of theſe things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nice and curious women? who now muſt not have the wind to blow on them, who are ready to dye if they be but croſſed a little of their wills. It was an excellent ſpeech of a woman Martyr, <hi>Iulitta</hi> by name, who being to be put into the fire, ſpake unto other women thus, <hi>Ceaſe to acouſe the fragility of</hi>

                     <hi>the feminine ſex: What? are not we made of the ſame matter that men are? yea, after Gods image are we made as well as they; God did not uſe fleſh to make women of in token of infirmity, we are bone of his bone, in token we muſt be ſtrong in the living God.</hi> Theſe were the ſufferings of thoſe times; we ſhrink at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, at every ſcorn and frown.</p>
                  <p>As for after times, it pleaſed God to ſtir <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> a Chriſtian Emperor, and then the Church had ſome reſt; to which ſome apply that place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 2. <hi>Satan was bound a thouſand years,</hi> not to rage for a thouſand years after, ſo as he then did, until <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> got ſtrength: but the Text will not bear this interpretation; we read <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 1. at the opening the <hi>firſt ſeal,</hi> there was ſilence in Heaven <hi>half an hour;</hi> that is, a ſpace of intermiſſion, wherein the Church had ſome little breathing for a while, but yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not long; for <hi>Licinius,</hi> who firſt joyned in the maintenance of Chriſtian Religion, fell off and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an outragious perſecuter. After that the Church endured infinite troubles by the hereſie of <hi>Arrianiſm,</hi> that ſpread it ſelf mightily abroad, ſo that the whole world almoſt was become an Arrian; at this time ſays <hi>Hilary,</hi> the Church was ſo obſcured, as it was not to be ſought in any external pomp in publique places, but in priſons and dens; <hi>Non in tect is, &amp; exteriori pompa, ſed potius in carceribus &amp; ſpeluncis. Arrius</hi> was a man of excellent parts, and forward in good, but through pride, being diſappointed of his expected preferment, fell off. Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> upon <hi>Revelations</hi> 8. 11. thinks it was <hi>he,</hi> that was meant by that <hi>Star</hi> which <hi>fell,</hi> which was called <hi>wormwood,</hi> by which <hi>the third part of the maters</hi>

                     <hi>were made bitter, and many dyed of the waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> began to riſe more and more, and to bring a fearful darkneſs over the face of the Church; of which times the holy Ghoſt propheſies, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>The moon, ſun, and ſtars were ſmitten.</hi> The firſt open and bloody perſecution of Antichriſt, was that of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> in the year 1160. and 1260. and ſo on: there is a whole volumn written of the lamentable extremities that theſe poor people endured, the reading whereof might cauſe the hardeſt heart that lives to break. A ſpecial agent in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution was one <hi>Dominick,</hi> father of the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> of whom his mother dreamed when ſhe was with childe with him, that ſhe had <hi>a Wolf flaming with fire out of his mouth in her body.</hi>

                  <p>In after times we read of the moſt famous inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods glory, what hard things they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured: as <hi>Wickliff, Huſs, Ierame</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and others. The firſt time that ever any Law was made for burning thoſe that oppoſed the Pope in <hi>England,</hi> was in <hi>Henry the Fourths</hi> time: ſo it went on to thoſe bloody <hi>Marian</hi> days; What impriſonments? what ſtarvings? ſtranglings? gibbets? fire? baniſhments were there then? What grievous miſeries did Gods people endure in <hi>France,</hi> eſpecially in that bloody ſavage <hi>Maſſacre</hi> in the year 1572? the Hiſtory of it tells us, that near the Archbiſhops Priſon in <hi>Lyons,</hi> the blood ran warm reeking in the ſtreets, into the River: in thirty days ſpace, there were an hundred thouſand poor orphans, widows, and ſuccorleſs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wandring about without relief.</p>
                  <p>Thus both Scripture, and the Hiſtories of all times, hold forth unto us the truth of this point, that <hi>the</hi>

                     <hi>eſtate of Gods people is an afflicted eſtate;</hi> they cry out aloud unto us, that <hi>through many tribulations we muſt enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> This hath been the way of God even towards thoſe who have been deareſt to him, and it is ſo at this day, but yet a great difference hath God made, between us, and thoſe in former times, in regard of the degree of afflictions; yea, between us and others of his Servants, in other places now: we feel but little of thoſe hard things that many of Gods people have felt, and ſtill do feel: we ſit <hi>under our vines, and fig-trees, in peace and plenty,</hi> not onely under <hi>the ſhadows of them,</hi> but we taſte and eat plentifully of the fruit of them, they are not empty <hi>vines,</hi> nor empty <hi>fig-trees</hi> unto us.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>NOw what uſe ſhould we make of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? Firſt, we had need examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our proſperity be in love or not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſanctified unto us or not; for we have a great deal more then Gods people uſe to have: And we ſhall know it by this, if the chief thing we rejoyce in, in the enjoyment of our proſperity, be the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſervice for God, that we have by it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let us admire Gods goodneſs to us, and bleſs his name: How favorable is the Lord to us, who ſpares us, that we ſuffer little or nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what others have done? We are weak,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57146:22"/>
and if we ſhould have felt ſuch things as others have, what ſhould have become of us? They endured <hi>ſpoiling of their goods, impriſonment, tortures,</hi> but we may go to Heaven, and have <hi>peace, comfort,</hi> the uſe of the <hi>creature, houſes, lands, friends:</hi> had we onely the bleſſings of the upper ſprings, although we wanted wholly the bleſſings of the nether, we were happy; but oh the goodneſs of our God unto us, we do plentifully enjoy both! Though a man do loſe all the world, and win his ſoul, although he beg his bread from door to door, if he be ſaved at laſt, he is a happy man, happy that ever he was born: but we may ſave our ſouls, and yet have the good things of the world too.</p>
                  <p>But it may be ſaid, A ſuffering condition is the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condition, why then ſhould we thus bleſs God that we are freed from it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>Sufferings</hi> in themſelves have no good, but as God uſes them, and turns them unto good; now God can uſe and turn <hi>proſperity</hi> into good as well if he pleaſe, and proſperity hath good in it ſelf, and in the uſe of it too.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames, Cap.</hi> 1. 6. calls for joy in both conditions; <hi>Let the brother of high degree rejoyce, when he is abaſed, and the brother of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, in that he is exalted;</hi> it ſeems we are not fit for ſufferings, and therefore our preſent condition is a mercy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſeeing God ſpares us ſo much from ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and calls us not to ſuch <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience as formerly he hath called his ſervants, let us therefore labor to be more abundant in <hi>active</hi> obedience, in giving God the glory of that peace and many liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57146:22"/>
and thoſe comforts that we do enjoy, which we might have been deprived of by the malice of men; let our ſtrength now be employed for God, in <hi>doing ſervice,</hi> which might have been ſpent in <hi>ſuffering</hi> the rage of man, yea, might have been ſpent in <hi>bearing</hi> the wrath of God himſelf: O how much better is it, that we have it to ſpend it in doing ſervice for God in an active way, for his praiſe and our own comfort! The more peace and outward comforts, the more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is due to God. It is obſervable that <hi>Solomons</hi> Altar was four times as big as <hi>Moſes</hi>'s. We read <hi>Exod.</hi> 27. 1. That <hi>Moſes</hi> was to make an Altar five cubits long, and five broad, and three high, but <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> made an Altar twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits broad. <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the wilderneſs, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled condition, full of troubles: <hi>Solomon</hi> on his Throne, in a peaceable condition, full of proſperity; as our peace and proſperity is more then others, ſo our ſervice ſhould be more then theirs, and that in a due proportion.</p>

Naturaliſts tell us, that while the Halcyon bird is brooding her eggs, and bringing forth her yong ones, there is uſually fair weather; from whence we call pleaſant weather, Halcyon days; ſhe neglects not any of thoſe days, but is diligent in bringing forth her yong: God gives us fair weather, much peace, that we may be diligent in our work, to provide for after-times: let none of thoſe Halcyon days be loſt.</p>

                  <p>BUt what are the reaſons why it muſt needs be, that the eſtate of Gods people muſt be an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted eſtate? <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, as long as there is a Devil in the world it muſt needs be; he in his inſtruments is that red Dragon, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.</note> red with fury and rage; he is that old Serpent, full of poyſon and deadly malice. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks of the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Si videris iliquando perſecuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem tuum nimis ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vientem ſcito quia ab aſcenſore ſuo daemone er urge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Ber. de Inter. domo c. 52.</note> Scorpion, that there is not one minute, wherein it does not put forth the ſting, as being unwilling to loſe any opportunity of doing miſchief. He is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Satan, an adverſary, the deſtroyer, roaring Lyon, he infinitely hates God, and ſins that ſin, that is the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, every moment: he hates the holineſs of God, and the glory of God, (which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57146:25"/>
eſpecially ſhines in his Saints) with deadly hatred: he is caſt out himſelf, and therefore envies and vexes at the Salvation of any: as one that had committed the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt ſaid, he wiſhed that his wife, and children, and all the world might be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together with him: hence he is reſolved, that if any be ſaved, it ſhall be with as great difficulty as he can procure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the poyſon of this old Serpent, ungodly men have ſucked up, they ſwell with it, and by it are <note place="margin">2.</note> enraged againſt godlineſs. It is reported of Tygers, that they enter into a rage upon the ſcent of fragrant ſpices; ſo do ungodly men at the bleſſed ſavor of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. I have read of ſome barbarous Nations, who when the Sun ſhines hot upon them, they ſhoot up their arrows againſt it; ſo do wicked men at the light and heat of godlineſs. There is a natural antipathy between the ſpirits of godly men, and the wicked; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. I will put enmity between thy ſeed, and her ſeed; <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 27. An unjuſt man is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the juſt, and he that is upright in the way, is an abomination to the wicked. Now the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of antipathy is:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, deep rooted, in the very natures of the things: a contrariety of act is not ſo much, as a contrariety <note place="margin">1.</note> of nature; two ſheep may oppoſe one another, but there is not that oppoſition between them, as between a wolf and a ſheep.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is an active oppoſition, that will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtir at the firſt appearance; the wicked will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <note place="margin">2.</note> diſcern a godly man, and their hearts do quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſe up againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a ſtrong vehement oppoſition. <note place="margin">3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:57146:25"/>
For firſt, it breaks all bonds of nature, the bond between father and childe, between brother and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and all bonds of love and kindeneſs: we have a remarkable example for this, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 3, 4. <hi>Moab</hi> was irked becauſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or did fret and vex, ſo the words; the ſame with that, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 12. There was no cauſe for the Moabites thus to fret, they were allyed to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for <hi>Moab</hi> was of <hi>Lot,</hi> to whom <hi>Abraham</hi> was Uncle: <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſed by them in peace, and by the ſlaughter of the <hi>Amorites</hi> they had freed them from evil Neighbors, which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taken away part of their Land, and were likely in time to take away more; yet being of a different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, malice breaks all theſe bonds. The like <hi>ver.</hi> 4. of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> who came of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 25. 1, 2. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had freed them from <hi>Sihons</hi> yoak, and yet they conſpire againſt them, and ſeek their ruine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is mighty bitter where it is: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. 13. it is ſaid, that God hath ordained his arrows againſt the perſecutors; the word ſignifies, ſuch as burn in danger and malice againſt the godly; and the word tranſlated <hi>ordained,</hi> ſignifies God hath wrought his arrows: he doth not ſhoot them at random, but he works them againſt the wicked. <hi>Illiricus</hi> hath a ſtory, which may be a Commentary upon this Text, in both the parts of it. One <hi>Felix</hi> Earl of <hi>Wartenburg,</hi> one of the Captains of the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, ſwore in the preſence of divers at ſupper, that before he dyed, he would ride up to the ſpurs in the blood of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans; here was one that burnt in malice, but behold how God works his arrows againſt him: that very night the hand of God ſo ſtruck him, that he was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57146:26"/>
ſtrangled and choaked in his own blood; ſo he rode not, but bathed himſelf, not up to the ſpurs, but up to the throat, not in the blood of the Lutherans, but in his own blood before he dyed. Saint <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 26. 11. ſays of himſelf before his converſion, that he was exceeding mad againſt the Saints of <note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> God; this bitter malice that is in the hearts of wicked men, againſt the godly, puts them upon ways of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt all reaſon and common ſence. After <hi>John Huſs</hi> was burnt, his adverſaries got his heart, which was left untouched by the fire, and beat it with their ſtaves. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 2. deſires the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to pray, <hi>That they might be delivered from unreaſonable and wicked men;</hi> the word is, <hi>abſurd</hi>

                     <hi>men.</hi> The malice of wicked mens hearts againſt the godly, makes them break all bounds of humanity, and go againſt Laws or any thing, in way of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the ſervants of God. In the Hiſtory of the perſecution of the <hi>Merindolians,</hi> we read of the Biſhop of <hi>Aix,</hi> being full of rage againſt them, when the Preſident <hi>Caſſaneus</hi> would have allayed it a little, telling him that the arreſt of <hi>Merindol</hi> was not defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive, and that the Laws and Statutes of the Realm did not permit the execution thereof without further proceſs; then ſaid the Biſhop, <hi>If there be either Law or Statute that do hinder or let you, we carry in our</hi> ſleeves <hi>to diſpenſe therewithal:</hi> the Preſident anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, It were a great ſin to ſhed innocent blood; then ſaid the Biſhop, <hi>The blood of them of Merindol be upon us, and upon our ſucceſſors;</hi> then ſaid the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I am very well aſſured, that if the arreſt of <hi>Merindol</hi> be put in execution, the King will not be well pleaſed to have ſuch deſtruction made of his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57146:26"/>
Subjects: the Biſhop anſwered, <hi>Although the King at the firſt do think it evil done, we will ſo bring it to paſs, that within a ſhort ſpace, he ſhall think it well enough, for we have the</hi> Cardinals <hi>on our ſide,</hi> and eſpecially the moſt reverend Cardinal of <hi>Tournon.</hi> We read likewiſe of the unreaſonableneſs of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of wicked men againſt Gods ſervants, in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the <hi>Waldenſes:</hi> they petitioning, that ſeeing it was permitted to the <hi>Turks, Saracens,</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> (who are mortal enemies to Chriſt) to dwell peaceably in the faireſt Cities of Chriſtendom, that pity and compaſſion might be ſhewed to them, who have their whole Religion founded upon the Goſpel, and worſhipping the Lord Jeſus; and that they might be ſuffered to live quietly in deſolate Mountains, and deſarts, and valleys, proteſting that they would live in all fear and reverence of God, with all due ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and obedience to their Lord and Prince, and to his Lieutenants and Officers; and yet this Petition could not be granted. We read likewiſe, that when that worthy Servant of God, <hi>John Frith,</hi> who was a learned and godly Miniſter, was burnt at the ſtake, together with one <hi>Andrew Hewet;</hi> that one Doctor <hi>Cook</hi> a Parſon in <hi>London,</hi> openly admoniſhed all the people, that they ſhould in no wiſe pray for them, no more then they would for a dog. O what bitterneſs and rage is there in the hearts of wicked men, againſt Gods ſervants! No marvel then, ſeeing they live amongſt them, they ſuffer ſo much affliction as they do. The Lord tells <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that he lived amongſt bryars and thorns, and that he dwelt amongſt ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions. <note place="margin">Ezek. 26.</note> Thus all Gods people, living with the men of the world, may be ſaid to live amongſt bryars and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57146:27"/>
thorns, and to dwell amongſt Scorpions; no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel then though they be ſo torn and ſtung as they are; ſome have onely ſnarling, wrangling, railing ſpirits, and there is all they can do; the worſt is but to prick and tear the fleſh, as a bryar and thorn; but others are ſcorpions, able to do a great deal more miſchief.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this oppoſition of wicked men againſt <note place="margin">4.</note> the godly, is an univerſal oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, oppoſing all that do belong unto the ways of godlineſs: as <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 53. it is ſaid of the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, that they would not receive Chriſt, becauſe his face was as though he would go to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> their hearts were againſt any inclination, againſt any thing that tended that way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if they can have advantage againſt any one, who makes any ſhew of Religion, they let flye againſt all, they rage againſt all, as <hi>Haman</hi> againſt the whole people of the Jews, when he was provoked againſt <hi>Mordecai.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea thirdly, they even hate their children after them, they ſhall fare ſomething the worſe for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of their Parents.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is a ſecret oppoſition, for ſo Antipathies <note place="margin">5.</note> are, there can be no reaſon given for it, but as he ſaid, This onely can I ſay, I do not love thee, but I cannot <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum dicere quare: hoc tantum poſſum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere non am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> te. Bonus vir</hi> Caius Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius, <hi>ſed Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
                     </note> ſay wherefore: they are convinced that they are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then themſelves, in their moſt ſerious thoughts, they wiſh to dye their death, to be in their condition, and yet their hearts do riſe againſt them: as they were wont to ſay of <hi>Caius Seius,</hi> he was a good man, but he was a Chriſtian. But it may be ſaid, there is a reaſon for our oppoſition, we do not oppoſe them for their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57146:27"/>
goodneſs, but becauſe they oppoſe Laws, and we would ſee the Laws to be obeyed; we do not oppoſe them for their godlineſs, but for their hypocriſie. For anſwer, the Devil never oppoſed Religion, but under ſome colour. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> cryes out of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that they were idle. <hi>Haman</hi> ſays, that it was not for the Kings profit to ſuffer the Jews. <hi>Tobiah</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat</hi> cryes out of them, that they were enemies to Kings and Government. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was accuſed of ſedition. But ſurely it is not for the execution of Laws, that mens hearts do ſo riſe againſt ſuch as are forward in the ways of Religion, for in other things they count men too buſie, when they ſeek the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Law. It was <hi>Tertullians</hi> appology in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Chriſtians againſt the Gentiles, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the ſame thing againſt them; O ſays he, there <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tertul.</hi> Apol. ad verſus gentes. c. 6.</note> are other Laws more for the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that you do not execute; as he inſtanceth in Laws that were made to reſtrain men from ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſneſs in feaſtings, and in apparel, and houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuff, and in their exceſſive coſts about their Shows and Games, yea, and many ancient Laws about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they regarded not. And as for that plea of hypocriſie, take this one evidence, that it is not that which is oppoſed, but Religion it ſelf: if it were hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie that were oppoſed, then the better they did grow when they were in their moſt ſerious moods, the more they would oppoſe it; for that which is evil muſt needs be ſo much the more oppoſed, by how much the more any grows better; but it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that howſoever men in the heat of their pride and luſts, ſet themſelves againſt the ſervants of God, under that name of hypocriſie, by which they blinde
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57146:28"/>
their own conſciences; yet when at any time they are in any ſerious mood, and their hearts grow into any better diſpoſition, then they are not ſo ſet againſt them as before; whereas if it were evil that they hate them for upon their ſick beds, and death-beds, they would hate them moſt of all; but we know it is not ſo.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly and laſtly, the oppoſition that comes from <note place="margin">6.</note> Antipathy, is an irreconcileable oppoſition; it may be curbed and reſtrained a little, and for a time, but reconciliation can never be made, except one of the natures be changed; no arguments, no perſwaſions, no means can do any good here, it is onely change of nature that can help. Now then ſeeing that there is ſuch an antipathy between the people of God, and the men of the world, with whom they live, how is it poſſible but that while they live with them, they muſt needs be afflicted by them?</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>BUt though it be true, that the Devil and world are malicious; yet, does not God rule over all? why then will God ſuffer his beloved ones thus to be troubled and afflicted?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Pſal.</hi> 97. 1. The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoyce; it is well for us that the Lord reigneth, or elſe his people could never ſtand before the rage of the world, and Devil; one or two wolves, were
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57146:28"/>
able to devour a flock of ſheep, what then would many wolves do amongſt ſheep, if there were not an over-ruling hand? but as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 10. Surely the wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee, the remainder of wrath ſhalt thou reſtrain; God ſuffers, and orders this ſo, that he might turn all to his own praiſe. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſometimes by this means, he ſcatters his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple abroad in the world to diſperſe his truth, to ſpread <note place="margin">1.</note> his Goſpel further then otherwiſe it would be; as <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 3, 4. it is ſaid, <hi>Saul</hi> made havock of the Church, haling men and women, committing them to priſon, therefore they that were ſcattered abroad, went every where preaching the Word; according to the propheſie of <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 12. 4. propheſying of the times of the troubles of the Church, he ſays, Many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this God ſuffers for the manifeſtation of his glorious power, and that four ways, <note place="margin">2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the continuing of his Church, and the profeſſion of his truth, notwithſtanding all the rage <note place="margin">1.</note> of men and devils; Gods power was ſeen in preſerving the buſh from being conſumed, though it were all on a light fire: to preſerve a ſpark of fire alive, in the midſt of the waves of the ſea, and to keep a light ſet up, in the midſt of ſtorms and tempeſts, is a great work; there appears as great a power of God, in preſerving his Church in the midſt of ſo much oppoſition, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their grievous afflictions and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as there did appear in the preſervation of the three Children in the fiery furnace. <hi>Eliah</hi> would have water poured upon the ſacrifice, he would have it covered with water, that the power of God might

more appear in the fire that came down from Heaven upon it; ſo God will have afflictions, perſecutions, troubles, to befal his people, that he may manifeſt his power ſo much the more in their preſervation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the power of God appears not onely <note place="margin">2.</note> in the upholding, but in the raiſing the ſpirits of this ſervants in their afflictions, with what courage, holy magnanimity, heavenly chearfulneſs that appeareth in them: even weak women and children, triumphing over the moſt ſore afflictions, and grievous diſtreſſes, which made a Heathen, one <hi>Calocerius</hi> beholding <note place="margin">

The glory of Gods power is as clear in the raiſing the ſpirits of his ſervants in ſuffering, as if he ſhould deliver them from ſuffering by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. And therefore <hi>Rupertus</hi> ſaith, that God did more gloriouſly triumph in St. <hi>Laurence</hi> his patience and conſtancy when he was broiled on the Gridiron, then if he had ſaved his body from burning by a miracle.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The power of God is glorious, not onely in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his Church, in raiſing the ſpirits of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in their greateſt afflictions, but in increaſing his Church by them: if it be a wonder to be upheld in <note place="margin">Plures effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timur quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties meti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</note> them, it is much more to be encreaſed by them; the more we are cut down, the more ſtill we are, ſaith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> The Church never grew ſo faſt, as when it was under moſt affliction. <hi>Sulpitius</hi> ſays of the Chriſtians in the primitive times, that they then were
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57146:29"/>
as greedy of Martyrdom, as in his time men were greedy of Biſhopricks. The blood of Martyrs was the ſeed of the Church. <hi>Pliny</hi> reports of the lilly, that it is increaſed by its own juyce that drops from it: ſo the Church which is the lilly that grows among the thorns, the very blood that falls from them, multiplies them; the ſufferings of one begets many to the love of the truth. Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Scotland,</hi> reports of a Gentleman one <hi>John Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> familiar to Biſhop <hi>James Bettoun,</hi> that he ſaid to the Biſhop upon the occaſion of the burning of Mr. <hi>Patrick Hamilton,</hi> My Lord, if you burn any more, you will deſtroy your ſelves; if you will burn them, let them be burnt in hallow cellars, for the ſmoak of Mr. <hi>Patrick Hamilton</hi> hath infected as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as it blew upon.

                  <p>Fourthly, God ſhews the glory of his power, in doing ſuch great things as he doth, by a few afflicted, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, perſecuted, contemptible people: The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things that ever God hath done in the world, have been by theſe: the more afflicted, the more mean and deſpiſed they have been, the more hath the arm of the Lord appeared in them.

Fire tryes mettals what droſs is in them; ſtrong winds, ſtorms, and tempeſts, try what our foundation is, whether we be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rock, or upon the ſands: they diſcover what ſap the leaves have from the root; withered leaves when the wind riſes, fall off, the green leaves that have ſap holds on: they try what ſoundneſs is in us: if you hang heavy weights upon the boughs of trees that are rotten, they preſently break, but if upon ſound, they bear them: hard weather tryes what ſoundneſs and health there is in the body; ſo affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and troubles, what ſoundneſs the Spirit hath.

Hence the Hebrew word that is uſed for Winter, comes from a word, that ſignifies diſgrace and ſhame, becauſe winter takes away the glory and beauty of the earth, and puts a kinde of ſhame and diſgrace upon it. The deformities and diſtempers of mens hearts, are much diſcovered in the winters of their affliction: although there was much glory and beauty on their profeſſion before, yet now they appear moſt vile and baſe. We read <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 35. That Chriſt was appointed for the fall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57146:31"/>
of many, and for a rock of offence, that is, in regard of the ſufferings that ſhould follow upon the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel: and mark what God ayms at in this, it is that the thoughts of mens hearts might be revealed; there are many ſecret thoughts, ſecret haunts of evil in mens hearts, ſecret windings and turnings of mens ſpirits, that are not revealed until then: when the cauſe of God, and our own ends come in competition, when they muſt part one from the other, then is the tryal what we are: as when a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-man follows two Gentlemen, you know not whoſe he is, until they part one from the other: as we read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 21. the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſtood at the parting way, at the head of the two ways, to uſe divination; the beſt divining of men, is at the parting way: although the times of afflictions, in regard of the darkneſs of them, one way be called the night of afflictions, yet they have light in them, and may be called a day, in regard of the diſcovery they make of a man what he is. In proſperity a man is apt to judge amiſs of himſelf, not onely becauſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance deceiveth the minde; but becauſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent contentment he hath, he is unwilling to be diſquieted with any thoughts of diſparagement: Adverſity though it be a hard Tyrant, yet it is a true Judge; though it ſpeaketh roughly, yet it ſpeaketh truly.</p>
                  <p>We read <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. that God led his people through the wilderneſs to humble them, and to prove them, and to know what was in their hearts: God knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">Orat. 28.</note> but he would make themſelves and others to know. I read of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> walking by the Sea ſhore, ſeeing how the ſea wrought in a ſtorm, that

it caſt up light and empty things, but not things ſolid and heavy; he applies this to afflictions, and ſays, that light and empty ſpirits are toſſed up and down by them, and keep not their conſtancy; but ſolid ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are like the rock that ſtands firm, and abides the ſame: men do not know their own hearts, they finde their hearts otherwiſe when troubles come, then ever they thought before; they never thought they had had ſo much pride, ſo much impatience, ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; they thought before they could have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the hand of God, that they could have born more then is now upon them with patience and meekneſs; but now they finde their wretched hearts murmure, repine, fret, vex; now they finde corruptions ſtir exceedingly: they had thought they could have depended upon God in ſtraits; but now they finde their hearts ſinking, they finde they have baſe ſhifting hearts. When the fire comes to green wood, there comes out abundance of watery ſtuff that was not diſcerned before; ſo when the fire of affliction comes, much evil runs out that you ſaw not, that neither you nor others thought to be in your hearts before. When a Pond is empty, then appears the mud and the filth, and Toads in the bottom: ſo when God em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pties men, when he takes from them his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, then much filth, many crawling luſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that did not before: ſometimes more grace appears in afflictions then did before: ſome of Gods people are low in their own eyes, they ſuſpect and fear themſelves, they think their graces will fail them in trouble, that their peace is falſe; yet when it pleaſes God to bring them
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57146:32"/>
into trouble, they finde more peace, more aſſurance, more ſtrength then ever they did before, or then they thought they ſhould have done; never ſuch ſweet joy, never ſuch full aſſurance, never ſuch uſe of faith, and patience, and love, as in the ſoreſt and ſtrongeſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. This indeed is very rare, there are few that finde more good in their hearts in afflictions, then they thought they had before; but where this is, it may be a ſweet ſeal to the ſoul, of the ſincerity of it ever after. When Corn ſtands in the field we may gueſs what it may yield, but we cannot know fully, till it come to the flail, and then it yields ſometime more, though often leſs then we made account of. When grapes come to be preſſed, then is diſcerned what is in them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, an afflicted condition gives opportunity for much exerciſe of grace, it calls forth whatſoever <note place="margin">4.</note> grace there is in the heart to the exerciſe of it. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 10. St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaking of the ſufferings of the Saints, Here (ſays he) is the faith and the patience of the Saints; here is matter for their faith and patience to be exerciſed about, this calls for the working of their faith and patience; and ſo for other graces, as humility, ſelf-denyal, love to God. Phyſick ſtirs up natural heat, and makes it active; ſo afflictions the ſouls Phyſick. What mighty prayers, and lively ſtirrings of ſpirit are there many times in afflictions? <hi>Eſay</hi> 26. 16. <hi>They pour out a prayer, when thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening was upon them:</hi> our prayers do but drop out before, now they are poured out, and one work of heart do's ſo follow another, that there is no intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it is all but one prayer they have poured out, not prayers, but a prayer; and it is obſervable, the word
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57146:32"/>
that here is tranſlated prayer, is a word that is uſed for inchantment <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> becauſe ſuch words were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be full of efficacy, containing much in a little room. So the prayer now is not an empty thing, but full of efficacy, containing much in a few words. The graces of Gods Spirit are the moſt lovely things in the world in Gods eyes, and therefore God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights much to ſee the exerciſe of them. When ſpices are beaten, then they ſend forth their fragrant ſmell; ſo when Gods ſervants are in afflictions, then their graces ſend forth their ſweetneſs, in the active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them: when the box is broken, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious oyntment is poured forth, then it ſends forth its delightful ſavour; ſo when the heart is broken with afflictions, and the grace is poured forth, then they give a ſweet ſmell in the noſtrils of God and men. A tool that is daily uſed, is kept bright and ſhining; and ſo grace, when it is moſt exerciſed, it it is moſt beautiful: The glory of the things of the world miniſhes in the uſe of them, but grace is ever better for the wearing.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in afflictions the power of grace does much appear; the abiding ſtrong againſt oppoſition, is a <note place="margin">5.</note> true argument of ſtrength: this was the honor of <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſtrength in his bleſſing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 23, 24. <hi>The archers have ſorely grieved him, yet his bow abode in ſtrength.</hi> It is nothing for a man to go on in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, while all things are well about him, while he feels no trouble, but God hedges about his way: if God ſhould always proſper his people in outward things, who would not be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of godlineſs? When the people ſaw how <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> was raiſed, then many became Jews. I read of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57146:33"/>
one <hi>Pamachius</hi> a Heathen, that he ſaid to the Pope, Make me a Biſhop, and I will be a Chriſtian. Every <note place="margin">Fac me Pontificem &amp; ero Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> bird can ſing in fair ſun-ſhine weather: but here is the power of grace, not to be offended in Chriſts ſufferings: <hi>Bleſſed are they who are not offended in me,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>to deſire to know nothing, but Chriſt and him crucified:</hi> To embrace Chriſt in his rags, in his poverty, in his ſhame, in his afflictions and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; this argues a power of grace indeed: it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues the power of love, that much water cannot quench it. It is a note that <hi>Joſephus</hi> hath, writing <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joſeph.</hi> l. 18. c. 4.</note> the Hiſtory of the time of Chriſt; At that time, ſays he, Jeſus a wiſe man did many miracles, and although he was condemned to the croſs, yet did not thoſe that followed him from the beginning forbear to love him, notwithſtanding the ignominy of his death; He notes it is an argument of great love in his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, as it was indeed, that they did not forbear to love, notwithſtanding his ignominious death. As it is a ſign our love to ſin is ſtrong, when we have many afflictions to quench our love, when we meet with much trouble and oppoſition in a way of ſin, and yet our love to it is not abated; ſo it argues our love to God and godlineſs is very ſtrong, when the greateſt oppoſition cannot prevail againſt it: to account Chriſt precious as a tree of life, although we be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to him as to a ſtake to be burned, this is love indeed. It was the glory of <hi>Scipio,</hi> in which he much boaſted, that there was not any of his Soldiers, but would venture his life for him, if it were to leap into the Sea, to caſt themſelves from a high Tower, or any other way that he ſhould require of them, this argued their ſtrong love to him; and it is the glory
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57146:33"/>
of the Lord in which the Lord delights, that he hath a people whoſe hearts are cloſely knit to him, in the moſt afflicted diſtreſſed condition that can befal them, who are content to ſuffer any thing for him, to ſubmit to his bleſſed will, to honor him any way that he ſhal pleaſe, though it be in the loſs of deareſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and ſuffering the ſoreſt and hardeſt afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, by afflictions the graces of the Saints are <note place="margin">6.</note> much increaſed, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> never increaſed ſo much as when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> moſt oppreſſed; for two hundred and fifteen years before, they increaſed but to ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but in leſs time, when they were oppreſſed, they increaſed to more then ſix hundred thouſand men fit for War, beſides women and children: thus the ſpiritual increaſe of the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God is much in afflictions more uſually then at other times. Gods people to whom afflictions are ſanctified, never thrive ſo much in grace, as when they are watered with their own tears. The Roſe is ſweeter in the Still, then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtalk. Fiſh thrive better in cold and ſalt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then in warm and freſh: the largeſt fiſh are not in the freſh Rivers, but in the coldeſt ſalt Seas. The ground is moſt fruitful that is moſt harrowed. The moſt plentiful Summer, follows after the hardeſt Winter: The face of Religion is never ſo beautiful, as when it is waſhed with its own tears. The Walnut tree is moſt fruitful when it is moſt beaten: Camomel flouriſheth moſt, when it is moſt trodden on, and preſſed down: ſuffering for truths does much confirm men in them; that which a man hath bought at a dear rate, he is loath to part with: thus we finde it in men who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for errors, they are ever the more ſtiff in them:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57146:34"/>
like the Merchants, holding up their commodity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it coſt them dear. All oppoſitions, if they do not overcome, they ſtrengthen that which they do oppoſe: as water caſt upon the fire, it makes that fire <note place="margin">

Thus the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations of the godly, and the perſecutions they ſuffer, do oppoſe their graces, but becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overcome them, they ſtrengthen them: As we read <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45. when the Church forſakes all, when ſhe leaves her fathers houſe, and her kindred, then doth the King greatly delight in her beauty, her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is great then, and exceeding delightful in the eyes of the Lord: <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>O my dove</hi> (ſays Chriſt to the Church) <hi>thy voyce is ſweet, thy countenance is comely: let me hear thy voyce, let me ſee thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:</hi> This is ſpoken of the ſtate of the Church, after her deliverance from great afflictions, after her return from captivity; before her captivity ſhe was loathſom and vile in Gods eyes; God hateth her, as appears, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>Mine heritage is unto me as a Lyon in the forreſt; it cryeth out againſt me, therefore I have hated it:</hi> but now ſhe is delightful; Chriſt bids her ariſe his love, his fair one, and come away. God before cared not for her ſolemn meetings, they were a burthen to him, as appears <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. 11, 12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but now he expreſſeth his deſire of their ſolemn meetings, <hi>O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rocks, in the ſecret places of the ſtairs,</hi> thou who worſhippeſt me in ſecret places, in holes and corners, <hi>let me ſee thy face,</hi> let me ſee thee aſſembled into the face of a Church in my Sanctuary; <hi>let me hear thy voice,</hi> let me <hi>hear thee there calling upon me, ſinging</hi>

                     <hi>praiſes unto me,</hi> Pſal. 66. 12. <hi>We went through fires, and through waters</hi> (ſays the Church) <hi>but thou broughteſt us into a wealthy place.</hi> Thus God deals with his Church ſpiritually, by bringing them through the fire and water of afflictions, he brings them to a wealthy place, a wealthy eſtate. The Church of <hi>Iudah</hi> before the Captivity, was as a Vine that brought forth wilde Grapes, upon whom the Lord reſolved to command the clouds not to rain, and from whom he would take the hedge of his protection, <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. but after the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity he ſpeaks otherwiſe of it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 27. 2, 3.

                     </note> that at noon-day is cold, at midnight it grows warm: it is thus with many, they are coldeſt in their proſperity, and the nights of afflictions contract their heat, and intends it: fire never burns ſo hot as in froſty weather.

Chapters of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> there are onely two which he charges no evil upon; the Church of <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Philadelphia:</hi> and theſe two were exerciſed with much trouble; as the Church of <hi>Smyrna, cap.</hi> 2. 9. is ſaid to have endured much tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, and to be in poverty, yet Chriſt commends her, and ſays ſhe is rich: her poverty made her rich, her tribulations made her glorious in the eyes of Chriſt.

Eightly, by afflictions, decayed grace comes to be recovered: Theſe are Gods files, that file off the ruſt <note place="margin">8.</note> of ſecurity. Phyſitians uſe to cure a Lethargy, by putting their patient into a feaver: the ſpiritual Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy of ſecurity, is often cured by hot and ſtrong afflictions. When men are in a ſwound, we uſe to nip and pinch them, and ſtrike them, and caſt cold <note place="margin">

God opens their ears in oppreſſion; many mens ears are clogged up with the world, but when God gives them up for a while to the oppreſſions of men, then their ears are opened. <hi>It is good for me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, that I was afflicted, for before I went aſtray, but now have I learned thy word.</hi> In the 2. <hi>Hoſea,</hi> God threatens the Church to ſtrip her naked, and to ſet her as in the day that ſhe was born, and to make her as a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to hedge her way with thorns; and thus the Lord did to that Church: but mark what he ſays ſhal be the fruit of all, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>Then ſhall ſhe ſay, I will go and return unto my firſt husband, for then was it better with me then it is now.</hi> When <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſent for <hi>Joab</hi> once and again, yet he came not unto him, until <hi>Abſolom</hi> cauſed his corn fields to be ſet on fire, and then he comes: God ſpeaks and calls to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who are grown ſecure, once and again, but they neglect God, until God comes with the fire of afflictions, and then they come. Afflictions are like the prick at the Nightingales breſt, that awakes her,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57146:37"/>
and puts her upon her ſweet and delightful ſinging. <hi>Gulielmus Pariſenſis</hi> ſaith of Musk, when it hath loſt <note place="margin">

                  <p>Ninthly, afflictions are of great uſe to mortifie luſts, to purge out filth and corruption. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 9. <hi>By this ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit thereof.</hi> When Phyſitians purge the body, they purge out that which is good, as well as that which is evill, but when God purges in the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified <note place="margin">9.</note> uſe of afflictions, he onely purges out the evil, this is all the fruit thereof.

                     </note> do bitter afflictions crauling luſt in the heart. Cold and hard winters do deſtroy much vermine, which otherwiſe would be very noiſom: ſo cold and hard afflictions vermine luſts. Violent ſtorms and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der clear the air, ſtrong afflictions clarifie the heart; by them we are as it were poured from veſſel to veſſel, from whence the ill ſavour of our heart-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers comes to be taken away. <hi>Ier.</hi> 48. 11. Foul and ſtained cloathes are made white by laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in cold froſty nights, ſo the defiled heart. Salt marſhes purge rank humours, ſo do the ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of afflictions rank luſts. Men let their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour lye ruſting by them in the time of peace, but in the time of war they ſcour all bright, to make fit for ſervice: ſo mens hearts in the time of peace grow foul, but in times of trouble, they are then cleanſed. It is a great mercy to have the act of ſin hindered; afflictions are very uſeful for this, and therefore, <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 2. 6. they are; as you heard,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57146:37"/>
called a hedge of thorns; whereby the ways to ſin are hedged up: but to have the inward luſts mortified, this is a greater good. All the Prophets preachings could not purge the Jews from idolatry, ſo as the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh captivity: it is obſerved, never ſince that time have idols been found amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Gods people are often in an afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <note place="margin">10.</note> as chaſtiſements for their ſins, they bring many evils upon themſelves, by their looſe walkings, by their indiſcretions, by their pride, by their ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeking, by their forwardneſs, by their wilfulneſs, and worldlineſs: God chaſtens even whom he loves: the Apoſtle tells the Corinthians, that they were cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened of the Lord, that they might not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the world. Thoſe whom God would never condemn, yet he will chaſten: God will have his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren feel ſomething of the evil of their ſins, and will have them and others ſee how diſpleaſing ſin is to him, in the fruits of his diſpleaſure, upon thoſe who are his beloved ones, who are exceeding dear, and precious in his eyes: becauſe the Lord is careful of his honour, therefore if his children ſin, he will chaſtiſe them, hence the Greek word for <hi>chaſtiſement,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <note place="margin">

Eleventhly, that which God ayms at in the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his people, is to make them conformable to Chriſt their head, that they may enter into their glory, as Chriſt did into his. <hi>Ought he not to ſuffer theſe things, and ſo to enter into his glory?</hi> Luke 24. 26. We read of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3. 10. that he earneſtly deſired to be partaker of the fellowſhip of Chriſts ſufferings, and to be conformable to his death; God will have a conformity to the death of his Son. We read of <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloin,</hi> that he would not be crowned in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with a crown of gold, where Chriſt was crowned with a crown of thorns; becauſe he would not have ſuch a great diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between him and Chriſt. It is reported of <hi>Origen,</hi> when <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> the Emperor ſent for him, he appearing to be meanly cloathed, there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers coſtly garments prepared for him, and ſent to him, but he refuſed them, and when he came near to <hi>Rome,</hi> there was a Mule and a Chariot ſent for him, that he might chooſe which liked him beſt, but he refuſed them likewiſe, and would not go in pomp to the Emperor, ſaying, <hi>He was leſs then his Maſter Chriſt, of whom he never read that he rode but once.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, the afflictions of Gods people are in <note place="margin">12.</note> juſt judgement a rock of offence, and a ſtumbling block to the ungodly. Chriſt in regard of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that attend the profeſſion of the Goſpel, is ſaid to be <hi>a rock of offence,</hi> and ſo appointed <hi>for the fall of many,</hi> Luke 2. 34. How many thouſands periſh, becauſe they are offended at the mean, afflicted, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted eſtate of Chriſt in this life? Thy heart is ſet upon vanity and outward pomp, this perſecuted
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57146:38"/>
eſtate of godlineſs is thy <hi>ſtumbling block,</hi> at which God in his wrath lets thee ſtumble, that thou mighteſt fall, break thy neck, and periſh for ever: hence is that ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>Bleſſed are they that are not offended in me:</hi> O its a great mercy of God, not to let this be a ſtumbling block, it is a mercy that God grants but to a few; here and there a poor ſoul, who is able to ſee the beauty and glory of godlineſs, through all the dark clouds of <hi>troubles, afflictions, perſecutious,</hi> that attend it: but for the generality of men, this is that which hides the glory of it from them, unto their everlaſting perdition.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Gods people are here afflicted, that Chriſt <note place="margin">13.</note> in them, and they in Chriſt, may in the concluſion of all be the more glorified.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the overcoming of all evils, in the final deſtruction of all their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in their happineſs after ſo many evils endured: the bitterneſs of foregoing grief, commends <note place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, hence it appears, that <hi>proſperity</hi> is not always a ſign of love and favor from God. <hi>Rome</hi> makes it a note of the true Church: if that were ſo, <note place="margin">2.</note> then the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were in a righter way then the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites:</hi>

Epiſtle of <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57146:40"/>
their gods, then the Chriſtians did in the worſhipping of theirs. Certainly, the ancient godly Fathers could not have heard this argument of outward proſperity, of outward pomp and glory in the world, pleaded as a ſign of the true Church, and of Gods love, but with much indignation; How croſs is this to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? where we finde the eſtate of Gods people hath uſually been a poor afflicted eſtate. And ſurely, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> could not always plead this argument; time hath been when the <hi>Goths, Vandals, Hunnes,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> have been more proſperous then they. The <hi>Emperor, Henry</hi> the <hi>fourth,</hi> was much hated by the <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> and yet he was not unproſperous in his way: when the <hi>Pope</hi> curſed him, and made another <hi>Emperor,</hi> namely, <hi>Rodulphus</hi> King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via;</hi>

                  <p>Let none amongſt us deceive themſelves, by reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon outward proſperity, as an argument of Gods love, for their everlaſting eſtates. Many have no other hold to lean upon for their ſalvation but this; all thoſe ſolemn proteſtations of God againſt this in his word; all the works of Gods providence towards his own people, in leading them on in an afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and towards the wicked in giving them the fat of the earth, will not take mens hearts off from this falſe reaſoning, but ſtill they will think, if God did not love them, ſurely he would not let them proſper ſo as he doth. A painted face is as certain an argument of a good complexion, as this is of a good condition. When God ſhall come hereafter, to take up his own to himſef, he will not look ſo much amongſt the great ones of the earth, the rich, the gorgious attires, ſumptuous houſes, furniſhed tables, as amongſt the the perſecuted, contemned, ſcorned company; out of them he will finde his own; <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>In that day when I make up my jewels,</hi> ſaith the Lord: the phraſe notes, that <hi>Gods jewels</hi> now <hi>do lie ſcattered in the dirt,</hi> and God hath his time to make them up; God paſſes by <hi>Pallaces,</hi> and looks in at <hi>cottages;</hi> he paſſes by the <hi>rich,</hi> and takes the <hi>poor;</hi> he paſſes by the <hi>honorable,</hi> and takes the <hi>deſpiſed ones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hence we have a confirmation of another life after this; certainly theſe things cannot always <note place="margin">3.</note> continue, it is impoſſible that the godly ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be in this poor, afflicted, diſtreſſed condition: it is not againſt the rule of juſtice to ſuffer this for a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57146:41"/>
while, that way may be made to other of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, but that there never ſhould be any righting of their cauſe, that there ſhould never be ſeen a difference between him that feareth God, and him that feareth him not; that God ſhould never appear to judge in the Earth, that there ſhould never be a reward for the righteous, this cannot be. The ſouls that are <hi>under the Altar,</hi> which were of thoſe who were put to death for the Teſtimony of Chriſt, they cry, <hi>How long, O Lord, holy and true, will it be before thou avengeſt thy ſelf for the blood of thy Saints?</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> reaſons ſtrongly from this argument, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. to prove the reſurrection; <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if in this life onely we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> When therefore we ſee the godly to be wronged, and perſecuted, when we ſee iniquity to be in the place of righteouſneſs, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes in the place of judgement, let us not be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſay in our hearts, <hi>God ſhall judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time for every purpoſe and every work;</hi> And as <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>When thou ſeeſt the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi>

                  <p>In the times under the <hi>Law,</hi> God did uſually more proſper his people in outward things, then now he does, and the reaſon may be becauſe then Chriſt was but darkly revealed, the riches of ſpiritual mercies were not much made known; there was but little

mention made of that eternal life, which is to come hereafter, we have very few texts of Scripture in the <note place="margin">

It is an excellent expreſſion that <hi>Luther</hi> hath to this purpoſe: <hi>Bodily promiſes,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is as the ſhell or husk that covers the nut,</hi> which is Chriſt, and eternal life; <hi>wherefore Chriſt coming, the ſhell,</hi> the husk, <hi>is broken and taken off,</hi> that is, <hi>temporal promiſes ceaſe, and the ſpiritual ſucceed;</hi> he means in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that it was under the <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reaſon why the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſcorned at Chriſt preaching againſt ſeeking the things of the world, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 14. was, becauſe the promiſes were ſo large for temporal things. Wherefore when Chriſt would teach them not to ſeek thoſe which they conceived the chief bleſſings of God contained in the promiſes, they deride him; hence Chriſt tells them <hi>ver.</hi> 16. The <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> were till <hi>Iohn,</hi> till then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ran much upon temporal things, but now <hi>the Kingdom of heaven ſuffers violence,</hi> there is now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other maner of kingdom revealed, ſought after in another way then ever formerly. I dare appeal to thy conſcience, whoſoever thou art; canſt thou think otherwiſe in thy conſcience, but that thoſe who walk cloſe with God, ſubjecting their hearts and lives unto his fear, muſt be moſt beloved of him? they muſt needs be nearer that eternal good, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57146:42"/>
of all happineſs, then vile wretched ſinners, who walk according to their luſts, who are vile and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable in their ways. When thou ſeeſt Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be ſo low, ſo diſtreſſed, ſo afflicted, either thou muſt be convinced ſtrongly that there is a time, wherein all ſhall be called over again, or elſe thou art an <hi>Atheiſt;</hi> God will convince thee another day by this argument, Did you not ſee what were the ways of my providence towards my people? Might you not have gathered from thence, that there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time a coming?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Learn we hence to judge wiſely of the <hi>poor,</hi> of the <hi>afflicted,</hi> and perſecuted. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 41. 1. Far be it from us to think they are forſaken of God: let us not be offended at Religion, becauſe troubles follow the profeſſion of it; the bleſſing that comes by profeſſion of the truth, conſiſts not in ſuch a peace as frees from trouble, but in giving peace and reſt <note place="margin">Pacem tu quaeris &amp; effect as, led praepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterè, qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>You ſeek and affect peace, but prepoſterouſly, ſuch as the worlds peace, not Chriſts, who gives peace in the middeſt of troubles; as he ſaith, Rule thou in the middeſt of thine Enemies. Now the cauſe of the Church calls for a wiſe judging: How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny carnal people are ready to think that <hi>Popery</hi> is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the truth, and that the Religion of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> is not right, becauſe God hath of late years ſo grievouſly afflicted his <hi>Church?</hi> What, would God ſuffer his own people (ſay they) his own truth thus to be beaten down? As they formerly ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Let him ſave him, ſeeing he delighted in him,</hi> ſo
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57146:43"/>
if God delighted in this way, ſurely he would have ſaved it, he would not have ſuffered oppoſition ſo far to have prevailed againſt the profeſſors of it. It is no argument that Chriſt is not in the ſhip, becauſe <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts</hi> and <hi>ſtorms</hi> ariſe. It is no argument that our cauſe is not Gods, that Chriſt is not with us, becauſe of our afflictions, it may be we have not <hi>awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him</hi> by our prayers, we are not yet fit to enjoy the ſweetneſs of a calm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salvian</hi> was fain to write a whole Treatiſe, above eleven hundred years ago, to anſwer this argument that men had againſt the people of God, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpel. <hi>Turks</hi> judge all things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to outward ſucceſs, and ſo did the heathens of old.

                     <hi>vertue, are but meer toys and fancies; for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune rules in all humane things:</hi> but it beſeems not Chriſtians to judge by this rule. <hi>Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> cites <hi>Plato,</hi> expreſſing himſelf thus, <hi>Although a righteous man be tormented, although his eyes be dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out, yet he remains a bleſſed man.</hi> Let none judge worſe of himſelf meerly becauſe of afflictions: before you were of the world, it may be you proſpered, it ſhined upon you; but now ſince you have given your name to Chriſt, many troubles and afflictions follow you: this is no other but that hath been, is, will be the eſtate of Gods people in this life: we muſt not draw ill conſequences from, or make ill conſtructions of our afflictions, for this is to charge God fooliſhly, which <hi>Job</hi> did not, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 22. There are ſome kinde of ſufferings that a man meets with, that have a kinde of ſweet ſeal of God with them, even in the time of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57146:43"/>
ſuffering, by which a man is more confirmed in his way to be from God, then ever he was before.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, what ſhall become then of ungodly and wicked men? Thus Saint <hi>Peter</hi> argues, 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4. 17, 18. <hi>Iudgement muſt begin at the houſe of God, and if it firſt begin at us, what ſhall the end of them be, that obey not the Goſpel of God? If the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly and ſinners appear?</hi> If it be done thus to the green tree, what ſhall be done to the dry? <hi>Behold, they whoſe judgement was not to drink of the cup, have aſſuredly drunken, and art tbou he that ſhall go altogether unpuniſhed? thou ſhalt not go unpuniſhed; but thou ſhalt aſſuredly drink of it, Ier.</hi> 49. 12. certainly there is ſhame and confuſion for you, there are tortures prepared for you. You heard what the <hi>Martyrs</hi> have ſuffered, but all that is nothing to the leaſt ſpark of Gods revenging wrath, when it is mingled with hatred.</p>
                  <p>That is a fearful expreſſion that we have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 6. <hi>Let their way be ſlippery, and the angel of the Lord perſecuting them.</hi> It is a more fearful thing to have the <hi>Angel of the Lord</hi> perſecute, then to be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>men;</hi> but how fearful a thing is it, when God himſelf, that infinite Deity, when he perſecutes a man? when Divine juſtice follows a man from one place to another and perſecutes him? You look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe poor deſpiſed miſuſed Servants of God, and you think vilely of them; let thoſe ſpectacles ſtrike terror into your hearts every time you ſee them! O what is reſerved for me then?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, if this be the uſual eſtate of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, let us learn then to prepare for afflictions before they come; although we have eſcaped many
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57146:44"/>
years, yet we may be called to ſuch an eſtate at laſt. <hi>Polycarpus</hi> eſcaped till he was fourſcore and ſix years old, and then he was called to <hi>Martyrdom.</hi> In the firſt <hi>ten perſecutions</hi> in the primitive times, the Chriſtians in <hi>England</hi> eſcaped all the <hi>nine,</hi> although the Goſpel not many years after Chriſt was profeſſed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> yet the <hi>tenth</hi> and laſt perſecution fell heavy upon them. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> eſcaped fifty ſeveral battels, in which he was perſonally preſent, and yet at laſt in the <hi>Senate houſe,</hi> he was unexpectedly murthered.</p>
                  <p>Now all is well with you, lay up for times of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: this is a gathering time, that will be a ſpending time; know that that which will ſerve turn <hi>now,</hi> will not ſerve turn <hi>then:</hi> many are not able to hold out now, what will they do then? O what will you do in the day of your viſitation? <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>If the</hi>

Oftentimes we are thinking of, and ſeeking after great things, when we ſhould be preparing for ſuffering hard things: as <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 20. when Chriſt had been ſpeaking to prepare for ſufferings, <hi>Zebedees children</hi> moſt unſeaſonably come, ſeeking for the higheſt places in his kingdom.

As is reported of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> that when news came to him of the death of his <hi>Son,</hi> and it was thought he would have been much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it; he anſwered, <hi>I begat him mortal:</hi> ſo when any troubles befal us, we ſhould entertain them with theſe thoughts, <hi>I knew my condition was to be an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted condition,</hi> I entred upon the ways of godlines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe terms, to be willing to be in an afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; this is Gods ordinary way towards his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is Gods mercy, it is no worſe, I expect yet greater tryals then theſe.</p>
                  <p>If we make uſe of the Scriptures, foretelling troubles beforehand, we cannot for ſhame complain, when we meet with thoſe we acknowledge we were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of. It is a good expreſſion <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath, in one of his Epiſtles to <hi>Victorianus,</hi> We muſt not be ſo contrary to our ſelves, as to believe what we read, and yet to complain when the ſame things are fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

                  <p>Secondly, the rule of Chriſt that we have <hi>Matt.</hi> 16. 26. is of great uſe; <hi>If any will follow me, let him deny himſelf, and ſo take up his croſs.</hi> Where <hi>ſelf</hi> is renounced, the <hi>croſs</hi> is eaſily born: it is <hi>ſelf</hi> that makes <note place="margin">2.</note> the <hi>croſs</hi> pinch: things puft up with wind, break when they come to the fire, ſo thoſe who are puft up, and filled with <hi>ſelf;</hi> the ſoul emptied of its <hi>ſelf,</hi> is onely fit to ſuffer: there is a ſix fold <hi>ſelf</hi> that muſt be denyed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>ſelf-opinion:</hi> We muſt be willing to lie quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the truth, to be convinced, and to be guided by it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>ſelf-counſels,</hi> and ſelf<hi>-reaſonings,</hi> muſt be denyed; we muſt take heed of conferring <note place="margin">1.</note> with fleſh and blood: as it was the care of Saint <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1. 16. immediately I conferred not with fleſh and blood, if he had begun to do it, he had been in danger.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>ſelf-excellencies;</hi> our <hi>parts,</hi> our <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> our <hi>credits,</hi> and all thoſe things that are great <note place="margin">3.</note> in our own eyes, and that make us great in the eyes of the world.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>ſelf-will:</hi> We muſt not think it ſo grievous a thing to have our wills croſſed, we muſt <note place="margin">4.</note> not expect to have our conditions brought to our

wills; and therefore it is our wiſdom, whatſoever our condition be, that we bring our wills unto them. As it is reported of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that when the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant threatned death unto him, he anſwered, <hi>He was willing:</hi> nay then, ſays he, You ſhall live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your will; he anſwers again, <hi>Nay whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you do with me, it ſhall be my will:</hi> How much more ought Chriſtians to have <hi>their</hi> wills bow to the holy and bleſſed <hi>will</hi> of God in every thing? the providence of God diſcovers his will, as well as his word.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>ſelf-comforts:</hi> Thoſe who give liberty to <note place="margin">5.</note> themſelves, to ſatisfie themſelves to the utmoſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">

                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>ſelf-ends</hi> muſt be denied; we muſt aim at God, and not at our ſelves, in all our ways, and then how eaſie will it be for us to bear croſſes, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Gods ends do go on, though our ends be <note place="margin">6.</note> croſſed?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, be ſure to lay a good foundation, in a <note place="margin">3.</note> through work of humiliation: the more thou art willing to bear Gods hand in the work of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſin, the lighter will all the burthens of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be unto thee; <hi>the ſeed</hi> that fell upon <hi>the ſtony ground</hi> withered; and although for a while it was <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with joy,</hi> yet when tribulation and <hi>perſecution ariſeth,</hi> by and by he is offended, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. Mark the expreſſion of the Holy Ghoſt there, <hi>by and by,</hi> he is preſently <hi>offended,</hi> and all becauſe there was not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57146:46"/>
                     <hi>depth</hi> of earth, there was not a through work of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation. We read, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 16. that God would ſhew S. <hi>Paul,</hi> what great things he muſt ſuffer for his Names ſake: and how did God prepare his heart? You ſhal finde in the former part of the Chapter, that <hi>God ſmote him down to the ground,</hi> his heart was ſmote lower then his body; he comes trembling and aſtoniſhed before the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> He was three days without ſight, and neither did eat nor drink; this was a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of his heart, to thoſe great things he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterwards. You think the burthens of afflictions great, becauſe you never felt what the weight and burthen of ſin meant; I dare pawn my life for that ſoul, who conſtantly exerciſeth it ſelf in the work of humiliation for ſin, who burthens it ſelf with the weight of its ſins, and is willing to lie under it, for the further breaking of ſpirit, that it ſhall be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure croſſes, and ſtand under ſtrong afflictions; and this muſt needs be ſo,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the ſoul is acquainted with the ſenſe <note place="margin">1.</note> of an evil, infinitely greater then any evil it can meet withal in afflictions; the ſenſe whereof muſt needs <note place="margin">Deep hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation fits us to endure great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> ſwallow up the ſenſe of leſſer evils: as thoſe who are acquainted with the pains of the ſtone, and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury, and other dreadful diſeaſes, account leſſer pains (which yet are very grievous unto others) as nothing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a ſoul exerciſed in the work of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by it is put under the power of Gods ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <note place="margin">2.</note> dreadful authority, and infinite majeſty: it is not man that can terrifie that ſoul from duty, that lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:57146:46"/>
Thirdly, this burthen of ſin, felt in the work of humiliation, mortifies thoſe inward luſts, puls down <note place="margin">3.</note> the ſtrength of them, which are ſo ready to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and withdraw the heart from the truths, and ways of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this ſoul knows how dear comfort is, if <note place="margin">4.</note> it hath any comfort, it coſt dear before it was got, and therefore it will not eaſily be parted withal.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, where conſcience by this is throughly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <note place="margin">5.</note> and deeply ſtruck, it cannot eaſily gather any ſuch film upon it, as not to remain tender, but it ſoon feels the evil, yea it is ſenſible of the danger of the leaſt ſin.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, if ever God hath manifeſted any love in <note place="margin">6.</note> Chriſt unto it, the ſouls love to God and Chriſt muſt needs be exceeding great.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, be careful to preſerve your <hi>inward peace,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> your peace with God, and your own conſcience: If vapours be not got into the earth, and ſtir not there, they are not all the ſtorms and tempeſts abroad that can make an earthquake; but if vapours be within, and work there, an earthquake is cauſed: ſo where there is peace <hi>within,</hi> all troubles and oppoſitions <hi>without,</hi> cannot ſhake the heart; but if there be no peace within, every little thing troubles the ſpirit: terrours without, and terrours within, both are very hard, <hi>Be not thou a terrour to me, O Lord,</hi> ſays <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> chap. 17. 17. for <hi>thou art my hope in the day of evil.</hi> I care not though all the world be a terrour to me, ſo be it thou beeſt not a terrour; if I have peace with thee, it is enough, what ever evil befal me: Oh therefore maintain, and keep this peace above all, it is no matter whether you have peace or no with the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57146:47"/>
world, ſo be it you have the peace of the Goſpel in your hearts: it is one ſpecial part of that ſpiritual ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory we read of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. to be <hi>ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of peace:</hi> that is, that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed peace of the Goſpel, which is a ſtrong prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to endure any troubles or afflictions that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians meet withal: the reaſon of that phraſe <hi>to be ſhod,</hi> is this, becauſe we are to go amongſt <hi>briars</hi> and <hi>thorns,</hi> in our way to Heaven; we are to meet with many hard things we are to paſs through, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had need be well <hi>ſhod;</hi> if a man be not ſo, he will be as one that goes upon ſharp flints bare-foot, or a mongſt thorns, or buſhes, ſo that the blood tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles down his feet every ſtep he takes, ſurely ſuch a man cannot hold out long; thus it is with the ſoul that is not fenced with the Goſpel of peace: <hi>Be careful in nothing, let not your ſpirits be divided</hi> (for ſo is the word) <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6, 7. <hi>And the peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, ſhall keep your hearts and mindes;</hi> the word is, <hi>ſhall guard your hearts:</hi>

                        </gap>
                     </note> afflictions and troubles are as enemies, compaſſing us about, but the peace of God <hi>guards</hi> our hearts from the evil of them: this enables Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though not in the letter, yet in ſome ſort <hi>to tread upon the Adder</hi> and <hi>Aſp,</hi> to ſhake off Vipers, and receive no hurt. <hi>Having peace with God, we glory</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1, 2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>in tribulations;</hi> we are not onely <hi>patient</hi> under them, but we <hi>glory</hi> in them; How were the ſpirits of thoſe bleſſed <hi>Martyrs,</hi> we read, and hear ſo much of, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with this bleſſed peace of the Goſpel?</p>
                  <p>Take heed therefore, that you never maintain peace with any ſin. <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Law, and nothing ſhall offend them,</hi> Pſal. 119. 165.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57146:47"/>
Oh, how many of you have broke your peace with God! at leaſt the comfort of it is exceedingly dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: you would fain have outward eaſe, and peace, but you have neglected the comforts of this peace, and that is the reaſon you have no ſtrength, to ſuffer any thing for the truth, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength,</hi> that joy that comes from this <hi>inward peace,</hi> but where this is not, there is nothing to ſweeten ſorrows, and therefore they muſt needs be very bitter. That time therefore that God gives you yet reſpite from afflictions, let it be ſpent in making up your peace more with God then ever, and getting clearer evidence, and ſenſe of his love. If ever you knew what peace with God meant, I appeal unto you, when at any time, the ſenſe of it hath enlarged your hearts with joy; whether then, have you not found your ſelves willing to ſuffer any thing for God? you could then go through fire, and water, your ſpirits could triumph with the Apoſtle, <hi>I am per ſwaded that neither life, nor death, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, ſhal ever be able to ſeperate me from the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, labour to ſee more into the fulneſs of all <note place="margin">5.</note> good in God: the Lord told <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he was <note place="margin">The ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</note> 
                     <hi>God all-ſufficient,</hi> as the onely means to ſtrengthen him, againſt whatſoever evils he was like to meet withal. Labour to have the inſight into Gods fulneſs, in theſe three particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, look at all the <hi>excellency, beauty, comfort,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> and good in the <hi>creature,</hi> and know that it is all in him, in a moſt eminent and glorious maner. There is no good in the effect, but the cauſes together have it in them: now God is the firſt cauſe, and ſo all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57146:48"/>
cauſes have their principle in him, and therefore all good muſt needs be in him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, all poſſible good is in the Lord; that is, <note place="margin">2.</note> as there is no actual good, but is for the preſent in him; ſo there can be none, but it is in him already; there is ſuch fulneſs of good in him, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that there ſhould be any good added to him in the leaſt degree.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, look at God as taking infinite delight in <note place="margin">3.</note> communicating himſelf, in letting out his goodneſs to his creature; let God be ſeen thus, and let theſe three meditations of the fulneſs of good in God, be wrought upon the heart, and they will mightily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſpirit in all afflictions: for what is the loſs of any thing to me, when I ſee where I can have it made up? what is any bitterneſs, when I ſee ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſweetneſs to ſweeten all. When tempeſts come upon Mariners, and they be in narrow ſeas, where they want ſea-room, there is danger, but if they have ſea-room enough, there is no fear. Thus if we are acquainted with the infinite fulneſs of good in God, we ſhould ſee our ſelves ſafe in the midſt of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, we ſhould feel our ſpirits quiet under the ſoreſt afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly: A ſixt preparation, for the bearing further <note place="margin">6.</note> croſſes, is an humble cheerful bearing of <hi>preſent</hi> affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and an humble ſubmitting to the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: That ſoul that is willing to yield to God in the preſent condition, God will fit it for the future: many caſt about in their thoughts what they ſhall do hereafter, if troubles ſhould befal them, and yet in the mean time they neglect the duties of their preſent condition. Go on therefore humbly, and patiently
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57146:48"/>
in the performance of the duties that God calls <hi>now</hi> for, and they will prepare you for whatſoever duties ſhall be required of you <hi>hereafter:</hi> there is no good to be expected from any in a new condition, who are not careful to perform the duties of the preſent: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are ready to promiſe, When we ſhall be in ſuch a condition, then we will do thus or thus; but what do you in your preſent? never think to be able to ſuffer, if God call you to a new condition, if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be patient under the troubles you meet with now, eſpecially when theſe troubles are ſmall and petty, in compariſon of thoſe you are like to meet withal. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Bilney</hi> the Martyr uſed to put his finger into the candle, to prepare him for the burning of his whole body; A patient bearing of leſs troubles for the preſent, will prepare the heart for the bearing of greater afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, enjoy all your comforts of proſperity <note place="margin">7.</note> as from God, and God in them, and them all for <note place="margin">How to enjoy all <hi>our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in, from,</hi> and <hi>for</hi> God.</note> God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from God: therefore whatſoever he takes away, it is but his own; and what are we, that we muſt always have comfort, and content, who are poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly <note place="margin">1.</note> creatures, who have nothing of our own?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, enjoy God in all: the enjoyment of <note place="margin">2.</note> God in all, is a myſtery the world is not acquainted with, onely a gracious heart knows what it is; it looks at all creatures but as the pipe of conveyance, the ſweet, and comfort, and bleſſing, is God in them; therefore in any affliction that befals, ſo long as God may be enjoyed, the comfort, and ſweet, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all is not loſt, although the creature be loſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all for God: Why then ſhould not God <note place="margin">3.</note>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:57146:49"/>
have the glory of all his own way? We in the general acknowledge God ſhould have glory from all that we are or have, but we would have him have it our way, ſo as may ſtand with our eaſe, with our liberties, peace, and ends: but God muſt have the honor of all, that way that is good in his own eye.</p>
                  <p>And againe, if all we have be for God, then when he is honored by any thing we do enjoy, it hath its end and perfection: a comfort is then the moſt perfect comfort, when God hath the glory of it, when it is reſigned to him, either in a way of ſervice, or ſuffering, as he calls for it.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, if our comforts be enjoyed for God, then our hearts are not let out to any of them, further then leads us to God; and if ſo, then when God calls for the parting with them, in a ſuffering way, the enjoyment of them cannot lead to God any further, but would draw off the ſpirit from God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a heart is willing now to part with them, it is not grievous to it to leave them, becauſe the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of them is not now in the enjoyment of them, but in the parting with them.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, be often renewing your reſignations of <note place="margin">8.</note> all unto God, and your covenant with him, to be at his diſpoſe, that ſo when any trouble comes at any time, this reſignation of heart, and renewal of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, may be freſh upon your ſpirits: the ſoul will be ready to ſuffer much, if it be called to it, when an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual reſignation, and renewing of covenant hath been a little before, and the power of it is now freſh upon the heart: ſometimes immediately after a day of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn humiliation, where this hath been, the ſoul thinks then it could do or ſuffer any thing; but in a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57146:49"/>
little time, except this be renewed again, the heart grows droſſie, and cleaves to preſent things, and mingles it ſelf with them: the often renewing of this, keeps the heart very looſe from the creature; a thing that hangs looſe from another, may ſoon be taken off from it, but if it cleaves to it, it is not taken off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty, it oftner rends in the taking off: thus it is when the heart cleaves to any creature-content.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, lay up proviſion againſt an evil day: There <note place="margin">9.</note> is a threefold proviſion we ſhould treaſure up to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <note place="margin">How to be prepared for any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note> us for our afflictions;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, treaſure up the <hi>conſolations</hi> of God that he affords upon occaſion, that at any time you feel in the performance of duties, in the exerciſes of graces, in the uſe of Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, treaſure up the <hi>experiences</hi> of Gods ways towards you, and his gracious dealings with you in former ſtraights.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, treaſure up <hi>ſoul-ſupporting,</hi> ſoul-quickning, ſoul-reviving, ſoul-comforting <hi>promiſes,</hi> and that of ſeveral kindes, ſutable to ſeveral afflictions, for thou knoweſt not what kinde of afflictions thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt meet with.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, labor much to ſtrengthen every grace, it <note place="margin">10.</note> is ſtrong grace that is ſuffering grace: a ſtrong wing will flye againſt the wind: as it is ſaid of the horſe, <hi>Job</hi> 33. becauſe he hath ſtrength, he mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted, neither turneth he back for the ſword, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. A candle will hold light in the houſe, but if we go abroad in the air, there is need of a torch, there muſt be a ſtronger light there; weak grace may ſerve turn to uphold us now, but in time of afflictions it had need be ſtrong, a little grace will
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57146:50"/>

                  <p>Laſtly, ſet much before you the example of Chriſt <note place="margin">11.</note> and Gods people, who have endured very hard <note place="margin">The ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt deſcribed.</note> things. In the example of Chriſt, conſider, firſt, who it was that ſuffered: the Son of God, who was God bleſſed for ever, the glory of the Father; when we ſuffer, baſe worms worthy to be trodden under foot, ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what he ſuffered: even the wrath of <note place="margin">2.</note> God, and the curſe of the Law, he was made a curſe in the abſtract as the Scripture ſpeaks, which was another maner of thing, then any of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for whom he ſuffered: it was for us vile <note place="margin">3.</note> worms, wretched ſinful creatures, who were enemies to him: we ſuffer for God, who is infinitely bleſſed, to whom we owe all we are or have.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, how freely he ſuffered: it was of his own <note place="margin">4.</note> accord, his own free grace moved him to it, he laid down his life, none could take it from him: it is not in our liberty, whether we will ſuffer or no, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of another.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, how meekly he ſuffered: he was as a ſheep <note place="margin">5.</note> before the ſhearer, his ſuffering no way diſquieted his ſpirit, but it kept in a ſweet quiet frame in the middeſt <note place="margin">6.</note> of all.</p>

much, to become the Son of man, how much more ſhould we be willing to empty our ſelves, that we may be the Sons of God? Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, he is worthy of all honor from us, who being Lord of all, was content to be in the form of a ſervant, to ſuffer for us, and how can we expreſs our honoring of him, our reſpect to him, better then in being to ſuffer for him? I have read of a <hi>Roman</hi> ſervant, who knowing his Maſter was ſought for by officers to be put to death, he put himſelf into his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters cloaths, that he might be taken for him, and ſo he was, and was put to death for him: whereupon his maſter, in memory of his thankfulneſs to him, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of him, erected a brazen ſtatue. Chriſt who was not a ſervant, but our Lord, yet when he ſaw we were like to dye, he took upon him the form of a ſervant, he came in our likeneſs, that he might dye for us, and he dyed; he requires not us to erect up brazen ſtatues in memory of him, in honor to him, but that we ſhould be willing to ſuffer for him, when he calls us thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; let not us put off the cloaths of our Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that we may avoid ſufferings for him (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do) who put on the cloaths of our humanity, yea of our ſervility, that he might ſuffer for us.</p>

                  <p>SEeing God hath ſo ordered things, that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt be in an afflicted eſtate in this world, when God calls us to ſuffer afflictions, let us know there are three duties required of us.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, that we behave our ſelves Chriſtianly with all humble ſubmiſſion, patience, contentedneſs, in this condition.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that we labor to improve our affliction that ſhall be layed upon us.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, when our croſs comes, we muſt be <note place="margin">1.</note> willing to take it up freely, and readily to ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">The croſs ſhould be ſubmitted to readily.</note> it. It was the honor of the three children in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> that they yielded their bodies to thoſe fiery flames they were caſt into, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 28. Let us not ſeek to put off ſufferings by diſtinctions; certainly the beſt policy in dangerous times, is the greateſt purity. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were wont to ſay, It is a ſhame for
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57146:52"/>
any man <hi>to flye,</hi> in time of danger; but for a <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian,</hi> it is a ſhame for him <hi>to deliberate:</hi> How much more truly may this be ſaid of a Chriſtian, when God calls him to ſuffer? he ſhould be ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved man beforehand, that it ſhould be a ſhame now for him even <hi>to deliberate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is argument enough for a Chriſtian to ſuffer any thing, becauſe it is the will of God, out of bare ſubmiſſion to God; but when it is not onely ſo, but in the cauſe of God, in witneſs to his truth, in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating his honor, this call to ſuffer comes with ſtrength indeed: it is unworthy of a Chriſtian, once to deliberate the avoyding of this; How much better is it, to ſuffer a little to prevent a ſin, and ſo prevent Gods wrath, then by avoyding ſufferings to fall into ſin, which being once committed, Gods <note place="margin">Siquidem etiam ſi hac ratione non affigaris, alia tamen ex cauſa, ea<expan>

Our condition is ſuch, that we muſt ſuffer one way or another, while we live here; Is it not better then to ſuffer for God then any other way? This was <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> argument in his Sermons upon the 2 <hi>Cor. chap.</hi> 12. Sermon 26. If you ſuffer not for Religion, you will ſuffer for ſome other unprofitable light cauſe: Seeing then, ſays he, we following this or the other courſe of life, we muſt ſuffer affliction, why do we not chooſe ſuch a ſuffering, which with the affliction brings unſpeakable glory? Certainly it is infinitely better to ſuffer for Chriſt, then for our ſin. We read of Peace-offerings that were offered, there might be oyl mixed, but not ſo in Sin-offerings: in thoſe afflictions we endure for Chriſt, we offer up our ſelves as Sacrifices of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57146:53"/>
Peace-offerings, and in them there is joy, much oyl of gladneſs is mixed in ſuch offerings; but when we ſuffer for our ſins, there is no oyl of gladneſs mixed there; Let us take heed, that we be not found guilty before the Lord, when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be opened, of being ſhy of the ways of Religion, becauſe of affliction; many when they ſee they muſt ſuffer in thoſe ways, although they be convinced of them, yet they are ready to ſay with <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as <note place="margin">Non placet tranſire per iſtas angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtias.</note> he confeſſes of himſelf, <hi>I do not love to paſs through thoſe ſtraits, it is too hard and narrow away for them.</hi> If ſuch thoughts work in thee at any time, take theſe conſiderations, for the rebuking of thy ſelf, and the raiſing of thy heart, to a more Chriſtian magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, at what a low rate doeſt thou prize the ways <note place="margin">1.</note> of God, the glory of God, that ſuch and ſuch more low comforts muſt not be laid down for them, that ſuch light afflictions muſt not be endured for the maintenance of them?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider if Chriſt had ſtood upon ſuch <note place="margin">2.</note> terms, as to have ſaid, I could be content indeed that theſe poor creatures might be delivered from miſery, but ſeeing ſuch grievous evils muſt be ſuffered for their deliverance, let them periſh; I am not willing to be their deliverer upon ſuch hard terms; What had become of us, if Chriſt had reaſoned thus, if this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument had prevailed with him againſt us, as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails with us againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thou who art ſo ſhy of ſuffering, mayeſt <note place="margin">3.</note> be forced to ſuffer in ſpight of thy heart; and what a ſad thing will that be to thee? What a ſad thing was it to <hi>Cranmer?</hi> after he had recanted for fear of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57146:53"/>
ſufferings, yet he was forced to ſuffer; what a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was it to this ſpirit, his cauſe, and name? Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> relates of a <hi>Smith</hi> in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, who was the means of converſion of a friend of his, who in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> time was caſt into priſon; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſends to this <hi>Smith,</hi> who had been the means of his converſion, wondring that he hears not of his apprehending and impriſonment; this <hi>Smith</hi> ſends him word again, that it was true, that he had taught him ſuch and ſuch things, and thoſe things were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truths; but for his part, <hi>he could not burn;</hi> but a while after, the houſe of this <hi>Smith</hi> was on fire, <hi>and he was burnt in it;</hi> God made him burn whether he would or no: and ſo may he make you ſuffer, whether you will or no, who refuſe to ſuffer for his truth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whatſoever proſperity thou enjoyeſt when <note place="margin">4.</note> God calls thee to ſuffer for him, is curſed unto thee, if thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf in thy eſtate, thy liberty, thy name, thy life that thou enjoyeſt, having avoided the way of ſuffering that God called thee unto, thou deceiveſt thy ſelf, for there is no bleſſing in them, they are all accurſed unto thee.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, all duties of Religion that now thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeſt <note place="margin">5.</note> out of a ſuffering condition, are not now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God; thou muſt not think now, having avoided ſuffering for Gods truth, that becauſe thou art willing to perform duties, to be diligent in ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for God, that God now accepts of thee; No, it was another work that God called thee unto, a work of ſuffering; ſeeing thou haſt refuſed this, do what thou canſt, God caſts it as dung in thy face and regards it not; this is a ſad condition, What joy
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57146:54"/>
can ſuch a man have of his life, if he hath an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned conſcience?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, what intolerable pride, and delicacy is this in thee, that thou wilt not venter the loſs of <note place="margin">6.</note> any thing, the enduring of any thing for God, and his truth? the leaſt truth of God is worth more then <note place="margin">Nimis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licatus es Chriſtiane, qui volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptatem hoc ſeculo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcis.</note> heaven and earth; and what is thy <hi>eaſe,</hi> thy <hi>liberty,</hi> thy <hi>name,</hi> thy <hi>life</hi> to it? <hi>Thou art too delicate, O Chriſtian,</hi> ſays <hi>Tertullian, who muſt have pleaſure in this world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, How vile is the unbelief of thy heart, <note place="margin">7.</note> who dareſt not truſt God with thy name, eſtate, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty? How canſt thou truſt God with thy ſoul, thy eternal eſtate? How lightly doeſt thou regard all the faithfulneſs, the mercy, goodneſs, wiſdom, power of God, working for his people in their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering conditions? Of what little account are all theſe gracious bleſſed promiſes of the Lord, for their encouragement herein? thy baſe ſhyneſs, and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe of ſpirit is ſuch, as if there were no God, no faithfulneſs, mercy, wiſdom, power to help, as if there were no promiſe to ſupport and relieve thee.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, there is a neceſſity of thy miſcarrying in <note place="margin">8.</note> the ways of eternal life; for if God hath ſo ordered things in his providence, as that ſuch ways muſt be in ways of affliction; and thy heart cannot bear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, how is it poſſible, but that thou muſt needs miſcarry in them? It is a woeful thing, to have a mans heart oppoſite to Gods order, in any thing, but much more in things of infinite conſequence; if affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be a block to thee in the way of life, you muſt have this block.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:57146:54"/>
Ninthly, How little love is there in thine heart to God, when thou art ſo ſhy of any thing to be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for God? love rejoyces in ſuffering for the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <note place="margin">9.</note> The avoiding hell, and the getting Heaven, are no great things, ſays <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> where the love of God is: then ſurely the avoiding outward troubles, <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. <hi>de amore Dei &amp; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerantia in adverſis.</hi>
                     </note> and the enjoyment of outward comforts, would be no great matter to us, if the love of God were in us.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Did you never ſuffer affliction in your <note place="margin">10.</note> ways of ſin? and will you not now be willing to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as much in the ways of God? Shall your ſins have a greater teſtimony of reſpect to them from you, then God himſelf? Art thou nor confounded at the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the thought of ſuch a thing as this, ſo unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, ſo vile?</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, What honor ſhould God have in the world? where would there be any witneſs to truth, <note place="margin">11.</note> againſt the rage and malice of devil and wicked men, if all ſhould do as thou doeſt? If there be any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian blood left in thee, if any ſpirit worthy of thy profeſſion, be aſhamed of thy baſeneſs this way, and be not ſo ſhy of afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when thou art under afflictions, let there <note place="margin">2. Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite under affliction.</note> be an humble contented frame of ſpirit, as beſeems a Chriſtian; ſeeing thou art now under an Ordinance of God, take heed of the leaſt murmuring, repining againſt God, as if he were a hard Maſter; or as if his ways were hard and burthenſom, becauſe of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions thou meeteſt withal: when thy ſpirit begins any way to riſe in ſuch workings, charge thy ſoul to be ſilent unto God; it is a great ſhame for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, not to be well skilled in that art, inſtructed in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57146:55"/>
that myſtery of Chriſtian contentation. Say with thy Savior, <hi>Shall not I drink of that cup my Father hath given me to drink?</hi> It is Gods appointment, that his people ſhould be in an afflicted eſtate in this world; it is the cup of my Father, and ſhall not I quietly, and contentedly drink of that cup? Now thou haſt an opportunity to manifeſt the power and excellency of thy grace, to ſhew what thy grace can enable thee to do; ſtrength of reaſon wil go far, in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting and calming of the heart under afflictions; but grace ſurely, where it is true, will go farther.</p>
                  <p>It is the moſt unſeemly ſight in the world, to ſee a murmuring fretting Chriſtian; if thy God, if Chriſt, if Heaven were loſt, it were not much to ſee wringing of hands, and ſinking of heart; but to ſee this upon loſs of a few outward comforts, upon enduring of a few outward afflictions, this is a moſt unſeemly, a vile and an abominable thing in thee. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon the 12. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> brings in God, rebuking a diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Haeccine eſt fides tua? haeccine tibi promiſi, aut ad hoc fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus es Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus, ut ſeculo flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reres?</hi> Aug. in enar. 2. in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 12.</note> Chriſtian, thus: What is thy faith? have I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed thee theſe things? what, wert thou made a Chriſtian, that thou ſhouldeſt flouriſh here in this world? Well may God, and Conſcience, and all the Saints, upbraid a murmuring fretting Chriſtian; What didſt thou expect in the entrance upon profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſtianity? what was thy aim? what, didſt thou make account to live at eaſe? to have no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the fleſh? Where there is not quiet of ſpirit in paſſive obedience, the ſincerity of active obedience may be ſuſpected: How far art thou from rejoycing in tribulations, who haſt not a quiet contented ſpirit in tribulations?</p>
                  <p>I will not enlarge my ſelf in this argument now,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57146:55"/>
intending a Treatiſe by its ſelf of Chriſtian conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: onely for the preſent take this one argument, which ſurely hath much ſtrength in it, to quiet the heart under any affliction; It is this, God is willing to accept of thy ſervice, that thou tendreſt up to him, though it be mixed with much ſin; why ſhouldſt not thou accept of his ways towards thee, though there be a mixture of much affliction? The ſin of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhould be a greater cauſe for God to be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with what comes from us, then the ſorrow and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction that comes in the ways of his providence, can be to cauſe us to be diſpleaſed with what comes from him: that ſurely is worſe that is mixed with ſin, then that which is mixed with ſorrow; yet as the one is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by God from us, let then the other be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by us from God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, let us not onely be contented under Gods <note place="margin">Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be improved.</note> afflicting hand, but labour to thrive under it, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all our afflictions that befal us; Certainly, there is a bleſſing in every Ordinance of God, if we have wiſdom and care to draw it forth, to make it our own; and ſo in this way of God towards his people, it is indeed a gracious work, to get our hearts lye quietly under affliction, but it is too low a work for a Chriſtian to reſt there, he muſt look to improve every affliction for his advantage. By improving them we make our <hi>Benonies,</hi> our <hi>Benjamins;</hi> that is, <hi>the ſons of our ſorrow, the ſons of our right hand.</hi> Although waters in the Sea be ſalt, yet if they be raiſed up to the Heavens, and ſent down again, then they are ſweet; ſo though afflictions be brackiſh, yea brine-ſalt, yet a ſpiritual heart can ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize them, and make them ſweet, and wholeſom.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57146:56"/>
Afflictions are great opportunities for ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, if we have hearts to improve them; and the loſs of an affliction is a great loſs. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his ſecond book of the City of God, cries out againſt ſuch, who did not profit by Gods judgement; <hi>You,</hi> ſays he, <hi>have loſt the profit of the calamity:</hi> he ſpeaks <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Perdidiſt is utilitatem calamitatis</hi> Auguſt. de civit. l. 2. c. 33.</note> of it as a great loſs to them, that it was over, and they had got nothing by it: As it is a ſign of great wickedneſs, to turn <hi>bleſsings</hi> into curſes; ſo it is a ſign of great grace, to turn <hi>curſes</hi> into bleſſings. By this improvement we ſhall not onely get <hi>water,</hi> but <hi>honey</hi> out of the rock.</p>
                  <p>But how ſhould we improve afflictions? <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, be jealous of your ſelves, leſt it ſhould paſs <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> How to improve our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> away unſanctified; be more afraid of the affliction <hi>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> of you thus, then of the <hi>continuing</hi> of it upon you; and therefore, lay out your ſtrength more for a ſanctified uſe of it, then for deliverance from it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, labor to know Gods minde in your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. <note place="margin">2.</note> The man of wiſdom ſees Gods name upon this rod, and underſtands what God intends. Firſt, whether he ſends them for ſin, or for other ends; and if for ſin, for what particular.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, it is true, God ſends affliction ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">1.</note> for trial, and other ends, rather then for ſin, yet it is ſin that makes us capable of ſuch a way of trial; were we not ſinful, God would not deal with us that way, he would bring about his purpoſes by us ſome other way, therefore it is good in all to be humbled for ſin; you may be helped in the knowledge of Gods end.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if the affliction be extraordinary, and come <note place="margin">1.</note> in an extraordinary way, and upon examination you
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57146:56"/>
finde your ſelf not guilty of any ſpecial evil, beſides daily incurſions, then you may comfortably hope, <note place="margin">How to diſcern Gods <hi>end</hi> in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting us.</note> Gods intentions are not ſpecially for ſin, but for ſome other end; ſo it was in <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, you may know from the work of the affliction, which way it tends, and how God follows <note place="margin">2.</note> it, whether in it God ſettles not ſin upon your heart, for humiliation, more then ordinary: or whether the work of Gods ſpirit be not rather for the ſtirring up of the exerciſe of ſome other grace; for God in his dealings with his people, will work for the attaining the ends he aims at.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, much may be learned from the iſſue of an affliction; when God comes chiefly for trial, in <note place="margin">3.</note> the iſſue his grace does much abound towards his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as it did in <hi>Joſeph</hi> and in <hi>Job;</hi> what honor was <hi>Joſeph</hi> advanced unto? and <hi>Job</hi> had given him twice as much as he had before, <hi>chap. ult. ver.</hi> 10. <hi>In all the land there were no women ſo fair as the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Iob,</hi> ver. 15. but when the afflictions is for ſin, it doth not uſe to have ſuch an iſſue, it is well if the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may be reſtored into ſuch a comfortable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as he was in before: When <hi>David</hi> was afflicted for his ſin, ſome ſcars ſtuck by him after his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, he ſcarce ever was brought into that comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition he was in before.</p>
                  <p>But how may we finde out the particular ſin? <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, look what ſins and afflictions the word hath <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> coupled together; although every ſin deſerves all <note place="margin">How to know the <hi>particular ſin</hi> which cauſeth our trouble.</note> kinde of affliction, yet the word joyns ſome ſpecial correction, to ſpecial tranſgreſſions; as God ſorts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral promiſes to ſeveral graces, ſo he ſorts ſeveral af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to ſeveral ſins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:57146:57"/>
Secondly, conſider what ſins and afflictions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence couples in reſpect of ſimilitude; God often <note place="margin">2.</note> ſtamps the likeneſs of the ſin, upon the judgement, <hi>Iudges</hi> 1. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, enquire at the mouth of God, by prayer <note place="margin">3.</note> and humiliation, as <hi>David</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. and <hi>Job cap.</hi> 10. 2. and thoſe in <hi>Jeremy, cap.</hi> 16. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hearken to the voice of conſcience, that <note place="margin">4.</note> is Gods officer in your ſoul, eſpecially in time of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, conſcience will deal impartially; and take this rule for your help herein, After much humiliation, and ſeeking of God, then liſten to the voice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: for as it is with an Officer whom you would have ſearch the Records, if you would have him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent indeed in the ſearch, you muſt give him his fee, elſe he will do the work but ſlightly: ſo you muſt give conſcience, Gods Regiſter, his fee; that is, let conſcience have much prayer, and humiliation which it calls for, and then it will tell you Gods minde more fully.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, conſider what truths have been moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">5.</note> upon your hearts before the affliction, for affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions do uſe to come <hi>as ſeals</hi> to inſtructions, as <hi>Iob</hi> 33. 16. A writing hath not that authority with it before it be ſealed, as it hath after; but when the <hi>ſeal</hi> is ſet on, <hi>then</hi> it comes with authority: ſo it is in regard of Gods inſtructions; before, they did not come with power to your hearts, now God ſeals them, that they may prevail; and by conſidering what thoſe inſtructions were, you may be helped to finde out what God aims at in your afflictions.</p>
                  <p>A third Rule is, when you have found out your <note place="margin">3.</note> ſin, ſtir up your heart againſt it with indignation:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57146:57"/>
This is that which hath cauſed me all this wo, that hath brought all this trouble and ſmart. As <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 28. the <hi>Jews</hi> took hold on <hi>Paul,</hi> crying, <hi>Men of Iſrael, help, This is the man, that teacheth every where againſt the people:</hi> So ſhould we take hold on our ſin, that we have found out, and cry to the Lord, <hi>Help, O Lord, this is</hi> that <hi>ſin that hath made the breach, this is</hi> that <hi>ſin that hath been the cauſe of ſo much evil unto me.</hi> As we read of <hi>Antonius,</hi> after <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was murthered, he brought forth his coat all bloody and cut, and laid it before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Look here,</hi> ſays he, <hi>you have your Emperors coat thus bloody and torn:</hi> whereupon the people were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in an uproar, and cryed out to ſlay thoſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, and they took their tables and ſtools that were in the place, and ſet them on fire, and ran to the houſes of thoſe who had ſlain <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and burnt them. Thus the looking upon our afflictions, and conſidering what miſchief ſin hath done us, our hearts ſhould be raiſed to flye upon our ſin with indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not to be ſatisfied without the deſtruction of that which would have deſtroyed us.</p>
                  <p>A fourth rule is, when God ſtirs your heart in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, to promiſe and covenant reformation; begin <note place="margin">4.</note> the work while the affliction is upon you, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>now</hi> preſently, do not put off all till you be well, till you be recovered, and think <hi>then I will do it:</hi> there is much deceit of the heart this way, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſcarry in their vows to God upon this ground, becauſe they put off all till they be out of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and by that time, the impreſſion that was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſpirits is abated, their hearts are cooled, and ſo the duty is neglected; wherefore do ſomething
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57146:58"/>
                     <hi>preſently,</hi> and be always in doing, till that which is vowed be fully performed.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, let every affliction drive you much to God <note place="margin">5.</note> in prayer. <hi>Is any man afflicted? let him pray,</hi> ſays S. <hi>James.</hi> It is a ſimilitude of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> As clouds <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chryſt.</hi> in Hom 5. de in comp. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Dei.</note> darken the heavens, &amp; cauſe lowring weather, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtilled into drops, then ſweet Sun-ſhine and fair weather follows: ſo ſorrows and cares in the ſoul, cloud the ſoul, till they be diſtilled in prayer, into tears, and poured forth before the Lord, then the ſweet beams of Gods grace come in, and much bleſſing follows.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, treaſure up all the experiences you have had <note place="margin">6.</note> of God, and your own heart in the time of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, keep them freſh in your heart, and work them upon your ſpirit, and make uſe of them as God offers occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, what you wiſhed you had done then, be ſure now to ſet about, and never reſt till it be done; <note place="margin">7.</note> that when affliction comes again, it may not finde it undone, if it does, it will make the affliction very bitter unto you. It was the advice of one <hi>Theodori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> to <hi>Segiſmund</hi> the <hi>Emperor,</hi> who asked him how he ſhould be happy, <hi>Do,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that now, which when you have been tormented with a fit of the ſtone or the gout, you would wiſh you had done:</hi> that which he ſaid of that particular afflictions, is true of others: We ſhould have glorious reformations, if this rule were well obſerved; ſurely, that which is true <hi>in</hi> times of affliction, is true <hi>out of it,</hi> and that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience upon ground judges to be right and good <hi>then,</hi> is right and good <hi>now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, take heed of truſting to your own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <note place="margin">8.</note>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:57146:58"/>
that you have made to God for obedience, rather then to his promiſes that he hath made to you for aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, often call your ſelf to account after the <note place="margin">9.</note> affliction is over; What is become of it? how was it with me then? and how is it now? have I more peace now, then I had then? and how comes it about? Hath my peace grown upon good grounds, ſo as it may-hold? I had workings of Spirit then, what are become of them? have I been faithful to God, and to mine own ſoul? And thus we have finiſhed this doctrine of affliction, which by Gods ordinance is the portion of his people in this world. They have been, are, and ſhall be an afflicted people.</p>

                  <p>But why does God thus ſuffer wicked men, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their pleaſure thus in the ways of ſin? <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, here is their portion, they are never like to have any other conſolation, but that they have here, <note place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, God hath time enough hereafter to torment them, to make ſin bitter unto them, and <note place="margin">2.</note> therefore he does not care though they have their pleaſure, and go on for a while in the enjoyment of their delights: And God hath time enough to glorifie his Saints, to give them everlaſting conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and therefore although here they be cut ſhort of the pleaſures of the fleſh, God does not regard that.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God hereby would ſhew to all the world, his own fulneſs, and how little he eſteems of theſe <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>carnal things;</hi> they are but <hi>bones,</hi> therefore he gives them to <hi>dogs;</hi> they are but <hi>ſwill,</hi> even the very cream of them, therefore he lets <hi>ſwine</hi> have them. <hi>Luther</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, God grants pleaſure and proſperity in juſt judgement to them, to ripen their ſin, to harden them in it. The Sun-ſhine of proſperity ripens the <note place="margin">Luth. in Gen. cap. 21.</note> ſins of the wicked apace, and ſo fits them for deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; this hardens them againſt the ways of God, it makes them bleſs themſelves in their way, <hi>They ſpend their days in wealth, therefore they ſay to God, depart from us, we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways; What is the Almighty, that we ſhould ſerve</hi>

It is true, godly men may have them, but never as their portion, God hath afforded you better pleaſures, hath he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved better things for you? As when we enjoy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity, we muſt not bleſs our ſelves in it, becauſe it is that which wicked men have; ſo when we are afflicted, our hearts muſt not be dejected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are onely deprived of that, which God gives moſt many times to thoſe that he hates moſt.

                  <p>Secondly, let us learn, not to envy the men of the

                  <p>Beſides, there is little cauſe we ſhould envy all their jollity, they muſt give an account for it, and dear.

                  <p>Thirdly, let not wicked men bleſs themſelves in the enjoyment of their pleaſures; you have no other then thouſands have had before you, who are now in Hell.

                  <p>Thus a godly man, a gracious heart conſidering and muſing of things, and laying one thing with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had rather have affliction with the people of God, then enjoy all the pleaſures of the world for a ſeaſon.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57146:62"/>
himſelf, and his thoughts to this iſſue, to chooſe rather afflicted godlineſs, then all the pleaſure of ſin.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, a gracious heart conſiders the ways of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. <note place="margin">1.</note> If I walk in them, then I walk with God, I live to the honor of the bleſſed God, who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely worthy of all honor and praiſe from his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; thoſe ways are the ways of infinite wiſdom, they are the ways of holineſs, of righteouſneſs, in thoſe ways I attain to that end for which I was made.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in thoſe ways I enjoy <hi>peace,</hi> peace of <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>conſcience</hi> to my ſoul; whatſoever trouble I meet withal abroad, I am ſure I ſhall have peace <hi>within:</hi> a little with outward peace, is better then a great deal where outward peace is wanting; <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Better is a handful with quietneſs, then both the hands full with travel, and vexation of ſpirit:</hi> A little with outward quiet, is better then a great deal with vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if a man be in a quiet family, a little there, is better then to be where there is a great deal with fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and vexation; ſurely, a little is better with <hi>inward</hi> peace, with peace of conſcience, then a great deal without; wherefore theſe ways wherein I walk

with Gods people, though the world may rage and perſecute, I ſhall have joy in my own ſpirit; <hi>A good conſcience will be a continual feaſt:</hi> while they rail, conſcience will encourage.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, again, when I walk in theſe ways, my ſoul <note place="margin">3.</note> ſhall enjoy the love of God, and that little I have, I ſhall have it in love, and from the love of God; Now thy love, O Lord, is better then wine, better then all the comforts of the world. The Lord ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies his people with love, as with marrow and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; a little that the ſoul hath that comes from the love of God, by vertue of a promiſe, how ſweet is it? how ſweet is ſleep when it comes from that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? Thou wilt give thy beloved ſleep, and all comes this way; I have all in the love of God, though I have but a little in the world, and though I be in affliction, &amp; am ſhort of that which others have.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and in thoſe ways, my ſoul ſhall enjoy <note place="margin">4.</note> communion with God; God will let out himſelf to me in a gracious maner, he will reveal the ſecrets of heavenly joys to my ſoul, and one beam of the light of his face, is more worth then all the world, and is able to carry through all the hardſhips of the world. My ſoul ſhal have communion with Jeſus Chriſt; and <hi>Curſed is that man,</hi> ſays that noble Marqueſs <hi>Galea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, that counts all the world comparable to one days enjoyment of communion with Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, while I walk in theſe ways, I ſhall be ſafe <note place="margin">5.</note> for eternity, I ſhall not be in danger there; and when the fear of eternity falls upon the heart, it ſees it is a moſt dreadful thing to miſcarry to eternity; the thoughts of eternity work mightily upon my ſpirit, let me be ſafe for eternity, whatſoever become of me
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57146:63"/>
in theſe ways. It is reported of one <hi>Myrogenes,</hi> when great gifts were ſent unto him, he ſent them back, <hi>I onely deſire this</hi> one thing <hi>at your Maſters hand, to pray for me, that I may be ſaved for eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Now in theſe ways of godlineſs, I ſhall walk with God, I ſhall have peace of conſcience, I ſhall have that I have in love, I ſhall enjoy communion with the Father, with Chriſt, and with the holy Ghoſt; and I ſhall be ſafe for eternity: ſurely there can be no evil that can countervail this good, whatſoever I ſuffer, whatſoever I endure in this world, yet my ſoul ſhall ſay, It is good for me to draw near to God; ſure I ſhall chooſe, and like well of the ways of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, whatſoever I endure.</p>
                  <p>But you look onely upon the beſt ſide of godlineſs, <note place="margin">Obj.</note> but turn the other ſide, you ſhall finde a great many afflictions that attend the ways of godlineſs, and when you ſee them, you will not be ſo in love with theſe ways.

                  <p>What are the afflictions you ſpeak of, that will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> any from delighting in Gods ways?</p>

                     <hi>and Veſſel, that contains another thing;</hi> yea, the word in the Greek, that <hi>Clemens Alex:</hi> hath, relating the Story, ſignifies a husk; his body was to him but as a husk: A Heathen counted his body but the Caſe, the husk; he counted his ſoul himſelf: If a man had a precious Jewel in a Caſe, and the Caſe was torn in pieces, and the Jewel be ſafe, it is no matter; and ſo by all theſe afflictions a gracious heart knows, it is but the Caſe that is torn in pieces, the Jewel is ſafe. <hi>Fear not,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>thoſe that can kill the body, and do no more;</hi> Chriſt would have us know, afflictions that do but reach the body, are but ſlight things.</p>
                  <p>And for theſe troubles, let them be the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible that can be, they are ſuch as may ſtand with Gods love, the deareſt of Gods love, ſuch as the deareſt of Gods people have met withal: ſays God in <hi>Ieremiah, I gave the dearly beloved of my ſoul, into the hands of her enemies.</hi> Indeed if they were ſuch as could not fal, but from Gods hatred, it were another matter; but they may ſtand with Gods love, yea, with the very ſame love wherewithal God the Father did love Jeſus Chriſt, and would you have better love then that? you may be ſure that all your afflictions that you do endure for godlineſs, and the ways of godlineſs, they are not ſuch but you may have them in the ſame love that God loved Jeſus Chriſt, and one would think that were enough to ſatisfie any ſoul in the world. <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>ult.</hi> there Chriſt prays, that his Diſciples might be loved, with the ſame love wherewith he was loved: now notwithſtanding the love of the Father
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57146:64"/>
to the Son, he was afflicted, and ſuffered as much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as you are like to ſuffer; and if you in ſuffering may be in no worſe caſe then he was, and may have the ſame love that he had, notwithſtanding your ſufferings, ſure your ſufferings are no great matter; there is no more evil in your ſufferings, then may ſtand with the love of God to your ſouls, the ſame love wherewith God loved Chriſt: and if a ſoul knows this, it will not be diſcouraged from the ways of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, notwithſtanding afflictions: indeed if in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction there were the venome of Gods wrath, and the curſe of the Law, it were ſomething, but the ſting and venome is taken out, and there is no great evil.</p>
                  <p>Again, theſe afflictions that the world ſo ſpeak of, they may not onely ſtand with Gods deareſt love, but are ſuch as may proceed from <hi>Gods deareſt love;</hi> as thus, they may come as fruits of the love of God, and therefore ſure they are no great diſcouragements from the ways of godlineſs; you heard what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of good God brought out of the afflictions of his people, and therefore there may be abundance of love from whence they come, they may be onely but to fit, and ſquare, and faſhion the ſoul, to be fit to be laid in the higheſt place of new Jeruſalem: The ſtones that are laid below in ſome mean place, are not hewed and hacked, as the ſtones that are in the higheſt part of the building, or the forefront of the building, to the view of all; thoſe that are moſt for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the building, are moſt hacked, and framed; and ſo thoſe that God does intend to be the moſt beautiful ſtones in that glorious Temple that is in Heaven, God ſuffers them here to be faſhioned and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57146:65"/>
hacked, moſt afflicted, and therefore they may come from love.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, they are no great matter, take them at the worſt, they are but little things; <hi>theſe light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions:</hi> there is no ſuch grievous burthen in them, as the world thinks there is, for there is the hand of Chriſt, to hold them up in all their afflictions: they are but ſuch things, as rather ſeem grievous then are grievous indeed, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>No chaſtening for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous;</hi> they are things that are grievous in appearance, and in ſhew onely, rather then in truth; as the proſperity of the wicked is but in ſhew, ſo the affliction of Gods people are rather ſhews, they do rather ſeem grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, then have any realty of grief in them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not ſo much to be feared.</p>
                  <p>Again, they are but for a little time, but <hi>for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>

                     <hi>ſeaſon;</hi> it is <hi>now</hi> the very ſeaſon to be afflicted, and ſhall we be troubled to have affliction in its ſeaſon? this time of our life is appointed for this end, it is our winter time; will a man be troubled to ſee froſt and ſnow in winter time?

in <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February:</hi> ſo while we are in the body, the winter of affliction is in ſeaſon, it is not the time to be delivered from affliction now, that is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and therefore why ſhould we be troubled that we meet with affliction?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, theſe afflictions that you ſay will diſcourage, <note place="margin">7.</note> they will bring forth a <hi>gracious end,</hi> they are but as a dark entry into your Fathers houſe, a dirty lane to a Palace; do but ſhut your eyes, and there will be a change, and as a Martyr ſaid, Though we have an ill breakfaſt, we ſhall have a good dinner: Now put all theſe together, what great matter is there to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage any from the ways of God?</p>
                  <p>But now come to the other part: A gracious heart <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Miſery</hi> of a ſinful way.</note> diſcourſes of <hi>the ways of ſin,</hi> what if I ſhould chooſe the pleaſure of ſin, and ſhould go on that way? 1. If I go on in thoſe ways, I ſhall be ſure to go on in a way of direct oppoſition againſt the God of all the world, and ſo treaſure up to my ſelf the wrath of an infinite God. And is it nothing for a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to go on in a way of oppoſition and enmity to an infinite Diety? how much better were it for me if I had never been born, then thus to do? 2. I ſhall be ſure to have no peace in thoſe ways, in my own ſpirit, in conſcience; I ſhall have within me a conſcience galling, girding, and laſhing of me, the worm gnawing of my heart, my conſcince continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally damping of my ſoul, telling of me, Surely I am not in thoſe ways an immortal ſoul ſhould walk in; I ſhall never have any pleaſure, but when my conſcience ſhall be ſtopped; and what curſed pleaſure is this for a man that he can never have it, but onely when he can ſtop his conſcience? if his conſcience had but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57146:66"/>
the mouth open, he could not have pleaſure, and all the pleaſure that he hath, he muſt ſteal it at that time, when his conſcience is aſleep, he can never have it upon other terms; if a mans conſcience be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and awaked, it is impoſſible to have pleaſure in the ways of ſin: it is poor living, when a ſervant or childe can get no victuals, but as they ſteal it, when the maſter or miſtreſs is aſleep, or is on the to ſide; and ſo it is poor pleaſure that the world hath, when it muſt be ſtoln when conſcience is aſleep; What good is it for a man to have a broken leg, and a ſilken ſtocking? and what great content is it for a man to have outward pleaſure, and inward dampings of ſpirit?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again, in theſe <hi>ways of ſin,</hi> as I ſhall have no peace, ſo do what I can, I ſhall have ſome trouble in ſpight of my heart; let me go on in the ways of ſin as I will, and ſeek for my contentment, I ſhall have ſome trouble in ſpight of me; and how grievous will that trouble be, that ſhal come with the curſe of God, and the wrath of God, and the hatred of God? what ſhall I have to ſupport me in trouble? A little water in a leaden veſſel is heavy, ſo a little trouble in an evil conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And in theſe <hi>ways of ſin,</hi> I ſhall be ſure to be a ſtranger from God, never to know what any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God means, go up and down in the world as a forlorn, forſaken creature of God; that when as others of Gods people have communion with God, and with Chriſt, and have the light of Heaven, and the joy of Angels, I ſhall be ſet to my ſwill.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And as for my eternal eſtate, I ſhall hazard to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57146:66"/>
miſcarry therein; and oh my ſoul, doſt know what it is to miſcarry to eternity? Surely there need be ſome great matter, that ſhould procure the leaſt peace to a man in the way of ſin, much more to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure delight to a man.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, You take ſin at the worſt ſide at <note place="margin">Obj.</note> firſt, ſin hath a delightful ſide, and that will pleaſe you, and allure you, though the other would not; therefore let us ſee the faireſt ſide of ſin; a gracious heart will look on every ſide.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>pleaſures</hi> that you ſpeak of, what are they? <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> are they not fleſhly? onely reach to the ſenſual part? <note place="margin">1.</note> What, muſt <hi>God, Heaven, eternal life</hi> be neglected for theſe?

                  <p>Secondly, it hath been the care of all Gods deareſt ſervants to keep down their bodies, to deny content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">2.</note> to the fleſh, and wilt thou give it all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thou canſt? <hi>Daniel</hi> was afraid of taking liberty to his fleſh, in eating the <hi>Kings</hi> meat; and the time when he had his, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Fifthly, There is an evil of ſoul-abaſement, they make men become vile. <hi>Cicero</hi> a Heathen, thought not that man worthy of the name of a man, who ſpent a whole day together in ſenſual pleaſures. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells of <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> that he caſt off voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pleaſures to his ſlaves, as better beſeeming a baſe quality and ſervile nature, then himſelf. Thou mayeſt think to live in pleaſure is a brave life, but it is the baſeſt life that is; ſo God judgeth it: Hence the ſame word which <hi>the</hi> Scripture uſeth for <hi>the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual glutton, Deut.</hi> 21. 20. is uſed for <hi>a vile perſon, Jer.</hi> 15. 19. the word is the ſame in the Hebrew.

                  <p>Sixthly, The evil of nouriſhing of all maner of wickedneſs: All ſin in Scripture is called fleſh, and the work of the fleſh, becauſe the pleaſure of the fleſh is the cauſe of ſo much ſin in us.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57146:71"/>
what is left but bitter humors in the body, and a ſting in conſcience? what wiſe man can pleaſe his thoughts after his pleaſures are over, in thinking what pleaſures he hath had? much leſs will any man of wiſdom, glory in what he hath eat or drunk, or that he hath filled his ſenſual appetite with all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights he could: Who can at night, after a day of ſports, and fulneſs of delights to the fleſh, bleſs God from his ſoul, that he hath had a day ſo full of pleaſure in his fleſh?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Morals</hi> hath an excellent diſcourſe upon this argument, to prove, that according to the Rules of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> No man can live a true pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life; not that by his Rules no man can live a <hi>vertuous life,</hi> that perhaps would be granted by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but that no man can have <hi>a life of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> by thoſe Rules, that is the thing that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to prove, and amongſt other arguments he hath theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That it is not probable for any modeſt and temperate men, to give way to let their thoughts abide upon any ſuch pleaſures, he accounts them ſo vain and ſlight; for the pleaſures of the minde, men that are wiſe and ſober, delight in the thoughts of ſuch.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond argument that he uſeth, is, That never, as he ſays, to this day, were known any that would offer ſacrifice to their God, in thankfulneſs for the enjoyment of their pleaſures with their Minions; but wiſe men have offered ſacrifices, in thankfulneſs for the pleaſures of their minde; as he inſtances in <hi>Pythagoras.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third argument that he uſes, That we never heard
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57146:71"/>
of any ſo given to their appetite, that would boaſt of their pleaſure, that they had devoured ſo much, or given to their luſts, that would <hi>boaſt of their luſt, how they had ſatisfied it:</hi> (although if he lived in theſe days, he might hear of ſuch men; it ſeems men are grown more ſenſual, then they were in thoſe times) but for the pleaſures of the minde, many would break forth in rejoycing and glorying expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that they had had them: as he inſtances in <hi>Archimedes,</hi> when he had found out a Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical experiment, that he was ſo filled with joy, that he ran up and down, crying, I have found it, I have found it.</p>
                  <p>A fourth argument, That no man would ſo prize their pleaſures in belly-chear, as to be willing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to dye, that they might be filled therewith; for the pleaſures of the minde, many have ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in them, ſo prized them, as they have been willing preſently to dye for the enjoyment of them: as he inſtances in <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> who would be willing to be burnt up by the Sun preſently, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he might be admitted to come ſo near it, as to learn the nature of it. Thus <hi>Heathens</hi> could argue againſt the ſlightneſs and vanity of ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and the ſolidneſs and excellency of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the minde.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, as they are <hi>ſlight</hi> for the preſent, ſo <note place="margin">7.</note> they are <hi>ſoon gone,</hi> they are not onely <hi>vain,</hi> but <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing</hi>

away, and the luſt of it; it does not onely paſs away at the laſt, but the luſt of it paſſeth away, before the thing it ſelf be gone. Although at firſt ſenſual things delight, yet within a while they come to be uſed as neceſſaries, not as delights, the delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is over, and yet they cannot be without them: in this, ſuch are more miſerable then other men, for thoſe things that are ſuperfluous to others, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to them. The more things a man wants that he cannot be without, the more miſerable he is. It is Gods infinite happineſs, that he hath need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of himſelf: and the leſs need a creature hath of any thing out of its ſelf, the nearer it comes to happineſs: all their pleaſurable things do but ſerve to make up that imperfection in them, which is not in others; their pleaſures now are but to help againſt the diſeaſes of Nature, now theſe cannot be ſo delightful as the true natural delights, that are ſurable to the principles of Nature, which others enjoy.</p>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57146:72"/>
upon thee, then thou muſt bid a farewel to all; never laugh more, never have merry meetings more, never be in jollity more; All, All, now is gone, as the Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> ſaid, when he was to dye, O my ſoul, whither goeſt thou? thou ſhalt never jeſt it, ſport it out more; when thou ſhalt be called to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, then all thy delights will leave thee, and bid thee farewel for ever: if you ſhould call to them, O now go with me, now I have moſt need of you; alas, they cannot, all now is but a ſhadow, but a dream that is paſſed away; Alas, I was made for eternity, and what good is it for me to have ſuch pleaſures for a ſeaſon? What is it to be jocund, to trifle up and down a year or two, and there an end? O how doleful will this ſound be to you, Your ſeaſon is done, you have had your time, it is gone, it is paſt, and cannot be recalled!</p>
                  <p>And yet this is <hi>not the ſeaſon</hi> neither, that ſhould <note place="margin">9.</note> be for pleaſure. <hi>Son, remember in thy life time, thou hadſt thy pleaſure;</hi> it ſhould not have been then: St. <hi>James, cap.</hi> 5. lays it as a great charge upon thoſe in his time, that <hi>they lived in pleaſure upon the earth;</hi> this is a charge of folly. This is a time for vertuous actions, to do the great buſineſs for which we were born. It is a notable expreſſion we finde in that Tractate, in <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s <hi>Morals,</hi> before quoted; he puts this caſe there: Suppoſe (ſays he) any man were to dye, and either <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>King,</hi> who had power of his life, ſhould lengthen it out one hour, that he might make uſe of that hour, either to do ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous action, or to ſpend it in pleaſure, and when that hour is at an end, then to dye again; What is it like that this man would do? What, would he
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57146:73"/>
rather have his luſt with <hi>Lais?</hi> (that was in thoſe times a famous Whore) or would he rather drink ſtrong and delightful Wine? or not rather do ſome famous exploit for his Countrey; as to ſlay <hi>Archias,</hi> and to deliver <hi>Athens?</hi> and he determines the caſe; I am perſwaded, ſays he, no man in ſuch a caſe, but would rather chuſe the latter: Surely our lives are in Gods hands, we know not whither ſo much as an hour be granted us or not, we may be gone to our long home the next hour; but what do we chooſe to do?</p>
                  <p>Certainly, did we know that our eternity depended upon this little uncertain time of our lives, we would not think ſenſual pleaſures to be in ſeaſon now; this time ſhould be ſpent, in ſeeking to make our peace with God, to humble our ſouls, to get off the guilt of ſin: this is a time of ſuing out our pardon, of mourning, of ſorrow, and trouble of ſpirit, and not the time for jollity and fleſhly delights. If a condemned man had two or three days granted him, that he might ſue out his pardon, were that a time for pleaſure? and ſports? thus it is with thee, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death is upon thee, onely a little uncertain time is granted thee to get a pardon; know then what is thy work thou haſt to do, and apply thy ſelf to it.</p>
                  <p>And were it that thou hadſt thy pleaſure freely, it were another matter; but they muſt all be called for <note place="margin">10.</note> again and thou muſt give a ſtrict account for them all; <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 19. <hi>Rejoyce O yong man in thy youth, walk in the way of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes,</hi> live after thy luſts, and do what thou wilt; a thing that yong men love as their lives: it is an Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical confeſſion: but remember withal, there muſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57146:73"/>
be an account for theſe things; know then this is certain, it is no fancy, a conceit; know it, be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced of it, as a thing moſt certain: for all theſe things, there is not one merry meeting, not one hour ſpent in pleaſure, yea, not one pleaſurable act or thought, but an account muſt be given for it; God will bring thee, though thou be unwilling to come, yet thou canſt not avoid it, God will bring thee to judgement. You think ſuch delights as you have, are no ſuch things as God takes notice of, they are but matters of ſport; thou thinkeſt thou haſt liberty in them, to do what thou liſteſt, thou ſhalt never hear of them again; but aſſure your ſelf, God will bring you to judgement, to be examined, condemned and puniſhed. Of all men, voluptuous men leaſt think of judgement, they put far from them the evil day, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 2. but above all men, God hath an eye upon them, to bring them to judgement, and therefore 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9, 10. <hi>The Lord reſerves the unjuſt unto the day of judgement to be puniſhed, but chiefly them that walk after the fleſh, in the luſt of uncleanneſs;</hi> mark, <hi>chiefly them;</hi> if it were poſſible for any to eſcape, it is impoſſible for you, for God looks at you chiefly. Thou now art riotous, and calleſt for all the delights thou haſt a minde to, but there comes a reckoning behinde that will damp all.</p>
                  <p>There are three heads, upon which the enquiry at the day of judgement will be concerning thy pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, What <hi>kinde of pleaſures</hi> they were, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wicked in their own natures, or not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What <hi>time was ſpent</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How far thy <hi>heart was let out</hi> upon them.</p>

Laſtly, let the fearful end of theſe delightful things be conſidered. Thoſe morſels which were ſo ſweet in going down, they muſt come up again as bitter as gall: <hi>Job</hi> 20. 12, 13. <hi>Though wickedneſs be ſweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue, though he ſpare it, and forſake it not, but keep it ſtill within his mouth, yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of Aſps within him.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 31, 32. it is ſaid of the wine that moveth its ſelf, ſparkling in the cup, <hi>at the laſt, it biteh like a Serpent, and ſtingeth like an Adder.</hi> The yong man that follows the enticings of the Whore, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 22, 23. <hi>He goes as an Ox to ſlaughter, and as a fool to the ſtocks, till a dart ſtrike through his liver, he knows not that it is for his life.</hi> And <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 11. he is ſaid to <hi>mourn at the laſt, when his fleſh and his body is conſumed;</hi> and he cryes out, <hi>How have I hated inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof? and have not obeyed the voyce of my teachers, nor enclined mine ear to them that inſtructed me?</hi> Senſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure leads to, and fits for deſtruction. <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Hell hath enlarged her ſelf, and opened her mouth without meaſure, he that rejoyceth ſhall deſcend into it:</hi> Job 21. 12, 13. <hi>They take the Timbrel and Harp, and rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ, they ſpend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fiſh ſwim down pleaſantly in <hi>Jordan,</hi> but fall at laſt into the dead ſea: the black ſea of eternal horror, is the concluſion of all theſe ſweet delights. As <hi>Abner</hi> to <hi>Ioab,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 26. <hi>Knoweſt thou not that it will be bitterneſs in the latter end?</hi> Theſe are they who come to a fearful end, yea many times in this life; as <hi>Eſay</hi> 50. 11. <hi>Behold, all ye that kindle a</hi>

                  <p>And how grievous will eternal pain be to thee, who art now altogether for delight and pleaſure?

                  <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Who are the truly wiſe men; with the encouragement to the Saints in the happy choice they have made.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HEre you ſee who are the wiſe men in the earth; wiſdom does moſt diſcover its ſelf in <hi>choice,</hi> for <hi>choice</hi> requires underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to compare and weigh things: The will of every man is for ſome good he would have; every man wills to be happy; this is as natural for every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creature, as for the fire to burn: But herein appears wiſdom, to make a right <hi>choice</hi> of thoſe means that may bring us to that happineſs that we do will; here is the infinite miſtake of the world, they would be happy, but they chooſe means that are quite contrary to happineſs; but thoſe that chooſe right, and pitch upon the means that will indeed bring to that happineſs that an immortal ſoul is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, ſurely thoſe are wiſe; this is the wiſdom that is from above, that can diſpoſe of ſuch means, as to obtain this end, and the greater the means are, and the more excellent the end is, the greater is the wiſdom that orders thereunto, &amp; guides therein: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one can propound an ordinary end to himſelf, and means to attain it; but if the buſineſs be of high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as for a <hi>General</hi> to manage an Army, his end is a high end, that concerns the proſperity of a whole Countrey, and becauſe his end is ſo high, that wiſdom that can order means to attain this end, is admired in the world, it is not an ordinary skil that is able to do this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:57146:75"/>
Now the attaining of God himſelf, the being bleſſed to all eternity, if there be any end that is high, this muſt be it; for one therefore to be able to order and diſpoſe of means, ſo as not to miſcarry in ſuch a high end as this, ſuch a glorious and great work as this, it muſt be wonderful wiſdom. The men of the world think themſelves wiſe men, and bleſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their wiſdom, becauſe they can order and diſpoſe of means to get money and fine cloaths; they are poor, and baſe, and low ſpirits, who minde and regard no higher, and no better things then theſe baſe things that are below; whereas the godly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath let the fear of eternity fall upon them, and they regard nothing but in ſubordination to that, therefore they ſometimes miſcarry in the things of the world; hereupon the men of the world looking at them, and ſeeing no higher end but the enjoyment of pleaſure, and the like, they count them a company of fools that will undo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and prove to be beggers, and ſo ſlight them in that reſpect.</p>
                  <p>But there is an infinite miſtake in this; were it that Gods ſervants did propound that end to themſelves, and had no higher then that which other men have, they would ſhift as well as they; but becauſe they have a higher end, therefore their thoughts in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are drawn out about that: As St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>We have not received the ſpirit of the world;</hi> we cannot <hi>ſhift</hi> and <hi>plot</hi> in the world; but we have received the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> that ſpirit that ſhall order us, and diſpoſe us to enjoy communion with God and his Angels for ever. A ſwine that wanders up and down, can make better ſhift to get
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57146:76"/>
home to the trough, then a ſheep that wanders to get home to the fold: The men of this world are indeed wiſer in their generation then the children of light, but the children of light have their ends and ways, wherein their wiſdom appears to be full of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and glory.</p>
                  <p>The wiſdom of <hi>Politicians</hi> is ſeen in this, They will let go things that are low, and be content to be croſſed in things that are mean, if their great plots may go on; ſo it is in all true ſpiritual wiſdom: A gracious heart, when it looks at the enjoyment of God in the way of godlineſs, ſo be it that great plot may go on, it does not ſo much look at things that are under: and therefore let men know that there is a miſtake in this, one day God will make it known, who are thoſe that are wiſe on the earth. Surely the world did not commend <hi>Daniel</hi> for his wiſdom, that he would not <hi>omit prayer</hi> one day to ſave his life, but had rather loſe all: Would not the worldly-wiſe ſay, What a fooliſh thing is this, not to omit prayer <hi>one day</hi> to ſave a mans life, and he muſt open his window too; that ſpiritual wiſdom which God gives unto his people, it is fooliſhneſs to a carnal heart; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall have ſome Parents themſelves, when children come to be ſtrict in their way, will ſay, <hi>What, ſhall we have a fool of you?</hi> And one neighbor to another, when they ſee any have a tender conſcience, who before gave himſelf to the pleaſure of the fleſh, <hi>We ſhall have a fool of you now:</hi> Though you count them fools, they know your way is folly. They think the matters of Religion are but niceties, and and to venture the loſs of ſo much for ſuch niceties, what a fooliſh thing is it? As <hi>Pilate</hi> wondered at

people in their way and <hi>choice</hi> that they have made. Hath God given you a heart to make choice of his ways? O bleſs God! There was a time when you went on in giving pleaſure to the fleſh, and you ſaw then no better thing then ſuch a kinde of life, and the Lord hath been pleaſed to diſcover better things to you, ſo as to make you renounce your former ways, and to make choice of another way, in which your ſouls have found other maner of comforts, and ſatisfactions, and contentments then ever you did before: bleſs God as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord that hath given me counſel, and made me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand aright:</hi> So may ſuch a ſoul ſay, for <hi>had I been left to the counſels of mine own heart, I know what ſhould have become of me.</hi> I have as vile a heart as any, and my heart did take as much delight in the fleſh as any, and I ſhould have gone on, God knows whither, and might by this time have plunged my ſelf into the bottomleſs pit: my friends would have given me other counſels to harden me in my ways of ſinful pleaſure, but bleſſed be God that hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered my heart. How many do I ſee every day, whoſe parts of nature exceed mine, and yet they are miſtaken in the things that concern their everlaſting welfare; they minde no other things but the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the fleſh, and ſtumble at the meanneſs of Gods people, and this hides the beauty of godlineſs from their eyes; and what a great mercy is this, that God hath taken this ſtumbling block from me, and that he hath opened mine eyes to ſee pearls, though wrapped up in rotten rags, and to ſee the excellency of godlineſs, notwithſtanding all afflictions that do attend upon them? Certainly it is no other but a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57146:78"/>
beam of Gods own light from Heaven, that hath ſhined into thy heart.</p>
                  <p>It is a remarkable paſſage that we have <hi>Eſay</hi> 44. 20, 21. where God ſhewing the difference between thoſe who <hi>forſook the true God,</hi> and his people who choſe him to be <hi>their God;</hi> ſtirs up his people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member for ever this mercy of God towards them, that they ſhould be delivered from the deceit and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity whereby others were deluded, and guided in a right and ſafe way, to be the ſervants of the bleſſed God; As for the <hi>Idolater,</hi> he feedeth upon aſhes, a deceived heart hath turned him aſide that he cannot deliver his ſoul, nor ſay, <hi>Is there not a lye in my right hand?</hi> Now mark what follows, <hi>Remember theſe, O Jacob and Iſrael, for thou art my ſervant, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Do you ſee how others have left God, and God hath left them? <hi>They feed upon aſhes,</hi> a ſeduced heart hath <hi>deceived them;</hi> but it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>with you,</hi> God hath put it into your hearts to be <hi>my ſervants,</hi> to chooſe me for your God: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member for ever theſe things, O <hi>Jacob!</hi> here is a mercy indeed, never to be forgotten; How comes it to paſs that your hearts ſhould not be ſo ſeduced as theirs? it is Gods free grace and rich mercy towards you.</p>
                  <p>And his mercy is the greater, in that it is in ſuch a weighty thing, that the Lord hath given thee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to make a right <hi>choice</hi> in: If a man makes an ill choice in a matter that is of moment, that will bring him trouble in his life, how is he grieved? as in <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> when he is to make choice in that one thing, upon which he knows, the comfort or trouble of his life does much depend; if the Lord hath ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57146:78"/>
for him, that he hath made a good choice one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that, how does he bleſs God? it is that which ſweetens all his life: If it be ſuch a mercy, to be guided to make a good choice in <hi>marriage;</hi> what a mercy is it to be guided to make a good choice for ones ſoul, to be happy to all eternity? if the Lord ſhould leave a ſoul in that choice, what a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition had the ſoul been in? And therefore, thoſe that have any ſavour of godlineſs, if they be to change the condition of their lives, they will ſeek God, and be earneſt that God would guide them, and not leave them to themſelves, and take advantage to puniſh their former ſins, in their choice now. If you be to make a choice that concerns the outward comforts of your lives, you will earneſtly deſire God, not to leave you there; Now you are to make your choice for your eternal condition, if God ſhould leave you now, what a lamentable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would you be in, as he does leave moſt in the world?</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as we come to years of diſcretion, we come to make our choice, to go on in the ways of God, or in the ways of death; How many yong ones make a woful choice in the beginning, and go on, and are hardened in their <hi>choice,</hi> and periſh for ever? And hath the Lord looked upon you, and conſidered how like you would be to fail in your choice? And hath the Lord been pleaſed to come in with his Spirit, and a light from Heaven to ſhew you the way? Have you <hi>heard a voyce from heaven,</hi> ſaying, <hi>This is the way, walk in it?</hi> Though God ſhould leave you in all outward things, yet you are made for ever; and therefore thou mayeſt ſay as

Bleſs God for it; and bleſs him the rather, becauſe he hath begun with you betimes: If the Lord hath given you a heart when you are yong to make this <hi>choice,</hi> what a great mercy is this? what abundance of ſin does ſuch a one prevent? If one that is <hi>yong,</hi> goes on in the ways of Religion, though he ſuffers much in the family wherein he lives, his brethren ſcorn at him, and his Parents hate him; yet he hath cauſe to rejoyce, and bleſs himſelf in the goodneſs of the Lord.</p>

man who loved his pleaſures, ſtanding by St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> and ſeeing his excellent death, he turned to other yong men by him, and ſaid, <hi>O that I might live with you, and dye with him!</hi> Thou haſt little cauſe to envy them that will chooſe <hi>vanities</hi> for their portion, let them have them: though thou haſt loſt ſomething of thy bravery, of thy carnal delight for this <hi>choice,</hi> be content, it is made up infinitely here, and ſhall be made up more hereafter.</p>

                  <p>Many in their yong time are very zealous in the ways of Religion, while all is well with them, and now they meet with other things then they looked for, and they begin to think they were too forward, and wiſh they were not ſo far engaged as they are:

Therefore go on, and be eſtabliſhed in your choice, and the Lord confirm you in it, and give my ſoul part with you in that choice you have made: let <hi>fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>world,</hi> and <hi>temptations</hi> ſay what they will, peace will be in the end.</p>
                  <p>You have found ſome good already, that might make you ſay with <hi>David, Surely it is good for me to draw near to God:</hi> and though I do meet with ſome troubles and temptations that do cry down this way, yet let my ſoul ſay, It is good for me <hi>to draw near to God:</hi> it is good for me <hi>that I left ſuch and</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, thoſe who do neither of theſe, they chooſe not to themſelves the pleaſures that are ſin, nor the pleaſures that come in by ſin, but ſuch pleaſures, in the enjoyment of which they do ſin, though the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures be in themſelves lawful, they chooſe to let out <note place="margin">3.</note> their hearts unto them, and ſpend the ſtrength of their ſpirits on them; they think becauſe there is no hurt in them in themſelves, therefore they may give liberty to themſelves; there is a great deal of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in this: we may ſin exceedingly in things that are lawful; when men ſhall ſpend ſo much time (as <note place="margin">Licitis pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> many that are profeſſors do) in giving themſelves content in ſome <hi>ſports</hi> and <hi>delights</hi> to the fleſh, as they cut God ſhort of his time; that time that ſhould be ſpent in examining their hearts, humbling their ſouls, ſeeking the face of God, is ſpent in ſome ſlight, vain, idle ſport.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:57146:85"/>
Many are guilty of this, eſpecially thoſe that have means, and their callings do not require ſuch a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of continual attendance: How is that time ſpent wherein you have liberty from your callings? Certainly, no good account can be given of that time, much might be gained to your ſouls in it, and much converſe and communion you might have with God; and what ill choice do you make, when as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor Chriſtians would bleſs God, if they could have a little liberty from their callings? On the one ſide there is this liberty for you to enjoy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and furniſh your ſouls with heavenly excellencies: On the other ſide, there is a little vain delight and carnal content, and eaſe to the fleſh, and you rather chooſe this. It may be, though God hath helped you in the main, you choſe right, yet be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced this day of the evil of this particular choice, in giving ſuch inordinate contentment to your ſelves, in giving that eaſe to your bodies, <hi>liberties</hi> to the ſluggiſhneſs of your ſpirits, and reform. You have not honored God as you ought, and therefore your lives are not ſo beautiful: In the general you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the ways of Religion, but there is not that convincing luſtre and beauty in your lives; you do not draw others to that love of godlineſs, becauſe your hearts become ſo vain, and ſo ſlight, in chooſing inordinate liberties to your ſelves, in ſpending your times and ſtrength in the pleaſures of the fleſh, and therefore when you come to ſpiritual employment, you have no ſtrength, but your hearts are dead. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your conſciences, when you have given your ſelves leave to have content to the fleſh, when you come to communion with God, what dead flat hearts
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57146:85"/>
have you? Let me ſpeak to ſuch this day from the Lord, this liberty you take to your ſelves in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the fleſh, hath been the root of the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of many; as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. thoſe who fell off were allured through the <hi>luſts of the fleſh;</hi> even though they are ſaid to be <hi>clean</hi> eſcaped from them who live in error, yet through <hi>wantonneſs</hi> they were drawn aſide. Wanton profeſſors ſeldom prove laſting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, at leaſt in any power of godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>Take this one note about this, That man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ſhall not eſteem the hardeſt work of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs at a higher rate, then the moſt delightful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to the fleſh, hath not choſen right, and may ſuſpect that yet he is to chooſe in the way of eternal life. It is true, that the hardeſt duty of godlineſs, may be burthenſom to the fleſh for a while, yet there is no gracious heart, but eſteems of this duty at an infinite higher rate, then the pleaſures of the fleſh, though never ſo lawful; it looks upon the pleaſures of the fleſh as mean low things, though lawful, but looks upon the duties of godlineſs as precious things, though hard, and thoſe are the things that are moſt ſuitable to a gracious frame of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Again, fourthly, thoſe come under this reprehenſion of making an ill choice, who have had ſome ſtirrings <note place="margin">4.</note> of the Spirit of God, ſome workings of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that their way hath not been good, and right, and theſe have been but for ſome time, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they have given themſelves, and do give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too too much liberty in ſatisfying the fleſh. Theſe are like the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> of whom we read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 11. according to the note that ſome have upon this place, <hi>They ſaw God, and did eat and drink;</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:57146:86"/>
That is, ſay they, although they had ſeen God, yet they turned again to temporal pleaſures, to <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> in a <hi>ſenſual way,</hi> as if it had reference to that ſenſual <hi>eating and drinking, and riſing up to play;</hi> upon the dedication of their Calf they ſate up, which was preſently after.</p>
                  <p>Thus many, although they have ſeen the Lord, and this ſight of God hath wakened conſcience, their hearts have been much ſtirred for a while, yet they have after faln to eating and drinking, to ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, all their good beginnings hath come to nothing. Theſe when they have been in company, and come away, they have had many ſad thoughts, and next day, or in the night many ſad ſighs and groans have come from their ſpirits, becauſe their ſpirits are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and make them fear all will not be well in the end; and yet theſe continue ſtill in giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pleaſure, and delights to the fleſh inordinately; if company call, they cannot refuſe: when they are ſtirred in their conſciences, they will take a book and <hi>read,</hi> or <hi>pray;</hi> yet they are preſently weary, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear ſuch a kinde of life, they think they ſhall grow melancholy, and they muſt again go to their former ways.</p>
                  <p>Many have the <hi>pleaſures</hi> of the fleſh, and their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi> ſtrugling together; and many times the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the fleſh, and conſcience ſtruggle a great while, before there be a victory on either ſide: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſcience gets the victory, and there is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious work upon the ſoul, eſpecially if God ſet on conſcience, by ſome great affliction or ſickneſs: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſcience is overcome, though conſcience does propound a better way, and they ſee, and are
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57146:86"/>
convinced of it, yet at length <hi>luſt</hi> overcomes, and conſcience yields, and they become meer ſots, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in the way of the luſts of their hearts; and this is a moſt dreadful thing, when ever this befals any.</p>
                  <p>Again, there are others that have had ſome <hi>taſte</hi> of the ways of God, have begun to make a <hi>choice,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> and have tryed the ways of Religion, and continued a while in them, and yet come to be weary and tired: yea, it may be ſome upon their ſick-beds, and death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds, have cryed out of the folly of their former choice; and yet, when God hath delivered them again, they have gone on in the ſame exceſs of riot, and giving liberty to the ſatisfying of the fleſh, in the ſame way, if not in a further degree then ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; what a dreadful thing is this! To all thoſe that are thus deluded, in making this evil choice, let me ſpeak a word or two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Wouldſt thou be willing at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">1.</note> to be accuſed and found guilty before the <note place="margin">Miſery of a <hi>ſinful choice.</hi>
                     </note> Lord of this; that thou haſt eſteemed more pleaſure to be had, either in <hi>ſin,</hi> or in any lawful content, then in all the pleaſures that are to be had in God, ſo as it ſhould be ſaid before men and Angels, <hi>Lo! this is the man that made not God his portion;</hi> Lo! here ſtands the man, that for many years together did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count more good to be had in the pleaſures of the fleſh, then in all the good that was to be enjoyed in all the artributes of God, and all the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, in all the promiſes of life, in all the ways of grace? What doeſt thou think will be thy condition, when as thou ſhalt be brought as guilty before men and Angels, that all ſhall look upon thee as a <hi>curſed</hi> fool in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> God and his Angels look now upon
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57146:87"/>
thee as <hi>a fool in Iſrael;</hi> when thou ſhalt be brought to have all the world look upon thee as guilty of ſuch a curſed folly as this, how bitter will it be to thee? wouldſt thou be willing to be in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this?</p>
                  <p>Again, Wouldſt thou be willing at the great day <note place="margin">Who are haters of God.</note> to be found guilty of hating the ways of God? I I hope I do not ſo, (will ſome ſay) though I give pleaſure to my fleſh. Yes, that man or woman that chooſeth the way of giving content to the fleſh, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the ſtrict ways of godlineſs, ſuch a one hates Gods ways, and ſo hates God himſelf in hating Gods ways: as, mark that place in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. <hi>For that they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the fear of the Lord;</hi> How was it proved they <hi>hated knowledge?</hi> They hated that truth of God, and that which ſhould bring them into the ways of God, and guide them in it; How does that appear? They did not <hi>chooſe the fear of the Lord;</hi> if thou doeſt not chooſe the ways of God, thou hateſt the ways of God, and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent art a hater of God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Wouldſt thou willingly have God reject <note place="margin">3.</note> all thy ſervices, and account them as abominable to him? Thus he threatens againſt thoſe who chooſe their own ways, <hi>Eſay</hi> 66. 3. <hi>He that killeth an Ox, is as if he ſlew a man; he that ſacrificeth a Lamb, as if he cut off a dogs neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered ſwines blood; he that burneth incenſe, as if he bleſſed an idol;</hi> and the reaſon of all is given, <hi>They have choſen their own ways, and their ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in their abominations.</hi> There are not ſuch four expreſſions of Gods rejecting a mans ſervices that he tenders up unto him, in all the Book of God,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57146:87"/>
and this is given as the reaſon of all, becauſe <hi>they have choſen their own ways.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, Wouldſt thou not be loath, that in the time of greateſt anguiſh of ſpirit, and affliction of <note place="margin">4.</note> body, when thou ſhalt be crying to God for mercy, that God ſhould take pleaſure in thy miſery, and be ſo far from relieving of thee, as to mock at thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? now thou canſt laugh, and be merry, and jocund; but what if it does prove, that this way of mirth and delight to the fleſh, ſhall procure unto thee Gods laughing, and Gods mocking at thee in thy anguiſh, and greateſt diſtreſs that ever thy ſoul ſhall be in? Certainly, if thou walkeſt in the way thou art in, this will be thy portion: mark that place in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. what God ſays, <hi>I have called, and you refuſed; I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have ſet at naught all my counſel, and would none of my reproof: I alſo will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be it known unto thee, that in whatſoever ſin thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf, the more thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf in it, the more curſed ſhall it be unto thee. What comfort will the pleaſures of the fleſh be to thee, when as Chriſt ſhall come and ſay, Was I content to part with the pleaſures of Heaven, the boſome of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to redeem poor man? and was it not the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a little meat and drink thou couldſt be content to part with for me? Could I be content to part with my blood, and couldſt not thou be content to part with thy luſts? Was not all my ſufferings worthy of enduring thoſe little things thou wert called to ſuffer in thy life? What, was not all that glory of mine that I revealed in my word, and works, ſufficient to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57146:88"/>
ſhew me to be worthy, that thou ſhouldſt have given ſuch a teſtimony of thy reſpect, and honor to me, as to be willing to part with ſuch empty, poor, ſlight things, and to ſuffer ſuch poor little things? When God ſhall bring the Saints before thee that did make a better choice, and thou ſhalt ſee them to be in a moſt glorious bleſſed condition, and thou thy ſelf caſt off for ever; how will this confound thee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day? Conſider of this, you that have made an ill choice, now while it is time; conſider of the evil, of the folly, of the danger, of the curſedneſs of that choice that you have made, in that you have choſen rather to give content to your fleſh, then the ways of godlineſs. Wherefore for the following of this in a word of exhortation.</p>

O that this may be the day of your new choice, that you may bleſs God for this day, that God did this day dart in ſome truths, to turn the ſtreams of thy ſoul another way, to make
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57146:88"/>
another, choice! that there might be before thou goeſt out of the preſence of God, a ſecret frame of ſpirit, ſurrendring thy ſoul unto God, being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of thy <hi>evil choice,</hi> and ſay, O Lord, how have I lived? What hath my courſe been? the Lord knows my courſe hath been to give content to my fleſh, and to live bravely in my life; now God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to make me afraid, leſt I have been in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous falſe way; the Lord have mercy upon me, what have I done? Is it not time to look about me? I have all this time miſcarried in the choice of my ſoul for my everlaſting eſtate, I have choſen the ways of death all this while.</p>
                  <p>O that the fear of God might fall upon your hearts this day! and then the promiſe of God is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 12. <hi>Who is the man that feareth the Lord, him will he teach in the way that he ſhall chooſe.</hi> The fear of God will put you into a teachable frame, and the Lord delights to teach ſuch; and ſurely it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable bleſſing of God, to be taught in the way of our choice. How happy were it, if the Lord would put a reaſoning frame into your hearts, that you might begin to ponder, and weigh things, and if ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual arguments cannot prevail, yet let us ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they you reaſonable Creatures or no; <hi>Eſay</hi> 46. 8. <hi>Remember, and ſhew your ſelves men, bring to minde, O ye tranſgreſſors!</hi> Come, let us reaſon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; Is there not infinite reaſon for Gods ways more then thoſe ways you have walked in? Is not God infinitely worthy of honor and praiſe from you, other maner of honor and praiſe then he hath had from you, your own conſciences being judges? Hath not God given you immortal ſouls? and are they not
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57146:89"/>
capable of better things then theſe things that you have choſen for your chiefeſt good? Hath not God made you for a higher end, then to <hi>eat,</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> and <hi>play?</hi> What, did the bleſſed Trinity conſult to make a glorious creature, <hi>Come, let us make man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our own image:</hi> and when this great work is done, is he made for no other end <hi>then</hi> to eat and drink, and commit wickedneſs? What, is not man to live by rule? indeed no creatures but <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> have a rule to walk by, no creature is capable of knowing a rule but they.</p>
                  <p>What if ſo be that now thou wert to dye, what would comfort thee? if God ſhould put an end to thy days, and call thee to an account for thy ways, what account couldſt thou give to the great and dreadful God, of thy ways and life? would thy ways be peace? It may be thou thinkeſt thou mayeſt have thy pleaſure, and that which is ſpoken out of the word by the Miniſters, thou canſt avoid, and there are no ſuch things as thou heareſt; but what if thoſe things that we deliver, concerning the evil of ſin, and the danger of that way of ſin, ſhould prove true? then wo unto thee, if all thy comfort depends upon this, thou hopeſt theſe things that we preach are not true; and is not this all the ſupport of thy comfort, which if it fail, thou art loſt for ever? Certainly, if that glory of God, and that eternal eſtate we preach ſo much of be true, it is worth the venturing of the loſs of greater pleaſures and delights, then any thou haſt in thy ſeeking after them: make but a ſuppoſition, What if it ſhould be ſo, is it not worth the venturing? You will do ſo in other things, the very ſuppoſition of a great gain, or poſſibility of great evil, will make
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57146:89"/>
you venture much: God does not call you to venture much, they are poor things that you are perſwaded to leave, and be not too confident in your way, all that is written in the word may be true, and if it be but poſſible, yet be ſo wiſe as upon a ſuppoſition to venture.</p>
                  <p>O that you would make tryal of the ways of God! If once your hearts were in them, whereby you would <note place="margin">Non Iſaac, ſed Arics morietur; non peribit tibi laetitia ſed contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macia: non mactabitur Iſaac, ſed vivet: ſi vocem Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris ut offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras Iſaac, id eſt, ut gaudium immoles, conſtauter obedire ne timeas.</note> be ſatisfied, as to want none of theſe pleaſures, it would make the moderation of them more pleaſant then the exceſs: You would finde more pleaſure in the very act of ſelf-denial, then in all the pleaſure of your lives; and if there be ſo much pleaſure in the denying falſe pleaſure, what then is there in the enjoying true? Surely God hath pleaſure enough for you, if you had a heart to truſt him with your pleaſure; you ſhall onely loſe your ſin, not your pleaſure. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath a notable expreſſion in a declamation of his <hi>De bonis deſerendis;</hi> If you be willing, ſays he, to ſacrifice your <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies laughter, that is your <hi>pleaſure,</hi> your <hi>Iſaac,</hi> your pleaſure <hi>ſhall not dye;</hi> it is the Ram, that is, your ſtoutneſs of ſpirit, your ſelf-willedneſs that ſhall dye; <note place="margin">

Do not harbor ill thoughts of God, to think that God is an enemy to your pleaſure, and delight, he does not delight to grieve the ſpirits of men; if you would truſt him with your pleaſure, you ſhould have pleaſure, it may be in this world, but howſoever in the concluſion you ſhall have pleaſure enough, my ſoul for thine. You muſt truſt God with your ſouls, and eternal conditions, and will you not truſt him with your pleaſures? Do you think Chriſt came to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57146:90"/>
dye, and ſhed his precious blood to bring men into worſer conditions then before? O no, certainly Chriſt did not come to take away any pleaſure from his people, but to bring them the pleaſures of Heaven, and of earth too, ſo far as they are needful. Is it not more like thou ſhouldſt have pleaſure when thou art reconciled to God, then when thou art an enemy?</p>
                  <p>We read of <hi>Cajus</hi> the <hi>Emperor, (Agrippa</hi> having ſuffered Impriſonment for wiſhing him to be <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror)</hi> that afterward when he came to be <hi>Emperor,</hi> the firſt thing he did was to prefer <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and gave him a Chain of Gold, as heavy as the Chain of Iron that was upon him in Priſon: And ſo if any do ſuffer for God, do you think that God will let him loſe by him? Suppoſe you have a Servant about your buſineſs, and he ſuffers much trouble and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, will you not recompence him for that which he ſuffers for your ſake? Do you think that God will let his people ſink in their ſufferings for him? God forbid we ſhould have any ſuch thoughts of him.</p>
                  <p>Do not judge of the ways of God by outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but judge according to the true value and worth of things: Shall we in other things judge according to the value and worth of things, and onely in the ways of God, judge by outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and not according to the worth? Do but come near to the ways of godlineſs, you will finde them other things then you imagine: As <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> had a ſpeech in his Sermon, that was the means of that Marqueſs <hi>Galeacius</hi> his converſion: <hi>If ſo be,</hi> ſays he, <hi>one ſhould ſee a company of Muſitians, that are</hi>

St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Confeſſions hath this notable expreſſion: How ſweet was it to me of a ſudden, to be without thoſe ſweet vanities?

                  <p>Now if you have any conviction at all, tell me,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57146:91"/>
Are you willing to enter into the ways of God? Do you think them worthy of regard, if it were not for trouble and affliction? Then ſo it ſtands, if you were not to ſuffer affliction, you would embrace them; and what an ignoble ſpirit is this, unbeſeeming a Chriſtian, whoſe ſpirit ſhould have true Nobility and Magnanimity, and you come off thus baſely, If you ſhould never ſuffer, if have no trouble! Truly God is much beholden to you (as we may ſpeak with holy reverence;) you would have God chooſe you, notwithſtanding all your ſins that are grievous to him: Why will not you chooſe God and his ways, notwithſtanding the afflictions and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that are grievous to you? Do you think the ſufferings you are like to meet withal in Gods ways, are more grievous to you, then your ſins are to him? Yet notwithſtanding your ſins, he chooſes you; Why notwithſtanding the ſufferings you may meet with, ſhould not you chooſe him? Suppoſe Chriſt had ſtood upon theſe terms, and ſaid, It is true, I ſee poor wretched ſinful man ready to periſh, and muſt lie under the wrath of an infinite God, and it pities me to ſee his miſery, and I could be content to redeem him, but I muſt ſuffer ſo much, be in the form of a ſervant, and be deſpiſed, and perſecuted, and ſuffer a curſed death, and therefore let him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther periſh: If Chriſt had ſtood at this, what had become of you? Yet you ſtand at this. Gods ways are <hi>good,</hi> my ways are <hi>evil;</hi> I could be content to embrace Gods ways; but I muſt ſuffer: If Chriſt did not make a ſtand at this, when he ſaw thy miſery, but was content to redeem thee, and brake through all ſufferings; Why ſhould not you be content to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57146:91"/>
embrace him in his ways through all ſufferings? Why ſhould not your hearts be convinced by that which hath ſo much reaſon in it?</p>
                  <p>It is reported of one <hi>Marinus</hi> a Soldier, when it fell to him to be preferred in ſome place, he was like to loſe it becauſe he was a Chriſtian, and he began to ſtagger, and to have thoughts rather to leave off Religion, then to loſe his place: Then came one <hi>Theodiſtus,</hi> and brings him into the Temple, and laid by him the <hi>Sword</hi> and the <hi>Teſtament,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and bade him take his choice: Here is the <hi>Sword,</hi> which is an emblem of thy place, and here is the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> chooſe the one, you muſt have but one: Then his heart gave in, and ſo left the Sword, and <hi>choſe</hi> the Goſpel. <hi>The wiſdom of God</hi> this day hath ſtood, and ſtill ſtands before you, pleading with you, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you to come in and embrace her, to make a happy choice for thy ſoul; <hi>folly</hi> likewiſe hath her pleadings, and perſwaſions to draw thee to the luſts of the fleſh, <hi>both</hi> make their offers unto thee; as they ſay of <hi>Hercules</hi> when he was yong, he ſaw <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>vice</hi> in the likeneſs of <hi>two Virgins</hi> wooing him, <hi>vice</hi> like a painted <hi>Harlot,</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> like a ſober chaſte <hi>Virgin,</hi> both preſenting themſelves with wooing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers unto him.</p>
                  <p>It is very obſervable that we finde, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning wiſdom and the fooliſh woman, both pleading to draw the hearts of men to them, and they begin in the ſame maner, they both make offers to draw the heart, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Who ſo is ſimple, let him turn in hither; as for him that wanteth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſhe ſaith to him;</hi> and verſe 16. the fooliſh woman uſeth the ſame words to draw after her:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57146:92"/>
and as <hi>wiſdom</hi> is upon the high places of the City, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. ſo is <hi>folly, ver.</hi> 15. yet wiſdom is above the fooliſh woman, for the Text ſays of <hi>wiſdom,</hi> ſhe is upon the higheſt places, and of the <hi>fooliſh woman,</hi> it is onely ſaid, ſhe is in the high places: And obſerve further, <hi>Wiſdom</hi> calls to eat her bread, and drink her wine, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and the <hi>fooliſh woman</hi> makes her offer, <hi>her delights are ſweet,</hi> ſhe ſays; but they are but <hi>ſweet waters,</hi> and that ſtoln too; and her <hi>bread,</hi> ſhe ſays, is <hi>pleaſant;</hi> but it is ſecret, ſuch as ſhe is even aſhamed of her ſelf: In the <hi>choice</hi> that wiſdom preſents, and that which <hi>folly</hi> preſents, you have life and death ſet before you; as <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore ſaid to the people, ſo I to you, <hi>I have ſet before you this day life and death:</hi> Now what anſwer will you give to God? Will you go on in the ways of the pleaſure of the fleſh? Are your hearts ſo bold and venturous, that you dare venture to go on in theſe ways? Wo unto you for the curſed hardneſs of your hearts. Were it indeed that you never heard the ways of God opened to you, it were another matter, but in that you have, and yet you go on in your choice after this Sermon, God may ſay, Be it unto thee as thou haſt choſen; God may ſet to his ſeal, thou haſt choſen <hi>vanities,</hi> and a <hi>lye,</hi> and baſe pleaſures; and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and a lye, and baſe pleaſures to thy fleſh thou ſhalt have.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore that thou mayeſt be delivered from this ſeal this night, O conſider what a mercy of God it is that thou haſt yet time to make thy choice. How many hath God caſt off? And now it is too late to chooſe; God hath determined the buſineſs; O that yet there ſhould be time! O that this would move
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57146:92"/>
your hearts! We are fain thus to labor, and ſtrive with mens ſpirits to take them off from vain pleaſures, to urge the ſtrength of all arguments we can, with all our might; were it that mens hearts were not very ſenſual, and hardened in their ſenſuality, it would not be needful thus to ſtrive, the very propounding ſome one argument, might be ſufficient to prevail. It was a ſpeech of <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> who lived al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt thirteen hundred years ago; He that does but hear of Hell, is without any further labor or ſtudy taken off from ſinful pleaſures: Mens hearts are grown harder ſince.</p>
                  <p>But what if I ſhould come in now? I who have <note place="margin">Quest.</note> given ſo much pleaſure to the fleſh, would God accept of me, and regard me?</p>
                  <p>Be it known unto thee, thou that haſt given thy ſelf <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> liberty in injoying the pleaſures of the fleſh to the utmoſt, thou that haſt been moſt wretched, if thou haſt a heart to come in this day, and turn thy choice, God is yet ready to embrace thee; we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to offer grace and mercy to thee upon thy recalling thy ſelf, yea, we have a promiſe, you ſhall have abundance of mercy, if you have a heart to come in. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 22, 23. <hi>How long ye ſimple ones will ye love ſimplicity? and the ſcorners delight in their ſcorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof, behold I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</hi> If any of you have gone ſo far when we have ſpoken againſt the pleaſures of the fleſh, and for the ways of godlineſs, you have ſcorned the word of the Lord; if you have been ſcorners, and contemners, yet turn and make your choice better. <hi>Behold, I will pour out my Spirit to</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:57146:93"/>
                     <hi>you;</hi> When God pours forth his Spirit, he pours forth his <hi>grace,</hi> and mercy and goodneſs; you ſee <note place="margin">Mercy to be had for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſinners</note> the offer of God, if you have hearts yet to make choice of his ways.</p>
                  <p>And conſider, the longer you have ſtayed in the ſatisfying your ſelves in the pleaſures of the fleſh, the more unfit will you be to ſuffer hard things for God. O give in your anſwer, and ſay, The Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid I ſhould go on in my former ways; I ſee other things I have to regard, peace with God, pardon of ſin that I have to look after, let God reveal to me what his good will and pleaſure is, and though I ſhould never enjoy good day in the fleſh, yet I give my ſelf up to that way of God. O that there might come this voice up to Heaven this night, that your ſouls may be bleſſed for ever in this days choice! And if God do begin to ſtir your hearts, now take the opportunity, chooſe the things that pleaſe him, and take hold of the Covenant; if you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the good ways of God, now cloſe with them, cleave to them, let your hearts faſten, take ſuch faſt hold of the Covenant, as you may never let it go. Obſerve how theſe two are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 56. 4. <hi>Chooſe the things that pleaſe me, and take hold of my Covenant;</hi> Take hold now, for it is your life.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>NOw that you may be further convinced that in the choice of the ways of godlineſs, you ſhall not loſe, but <hi>change</hi> pleaſures; you ſhall finde pleaſures ſweet and ſatisfying, of a higher nature in them then ever before your ſouls were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; conſider what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the ways of <hi>wiſdom; Solomon,</hi> who had experience of all other pleaſures whatſoever, yet of them he ſaith, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Her ways are ways of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the yoke of Chriſt was an <hi>eaſie yoke,</hi> and the ways of godlineſs had eaſe in them, we have ſpoken largely: As they have <hi>eaſe,</hi> ſo they have <hi>pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> all the ways of godlineſs are <hi>pleaſant,</hi> to that at this time. Ordinarily we cannot expect any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in theſe Proverbs, but yet in this you have, there is a dependence of theſe words upon the 13. <hi>ver.</hi> and ſo from thence there is a connextion of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proverbs.</p>
                  <p>In the 13. <hi>ver.</hi> you have the commendation of wiſdom, and the bleſſed eſtate of that man ſet out, that findes wiſdom: <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is commended by many arguments, and amongſt the reſt, not to ſpend time about the other, this is one, becauſe <hi>all her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs;</hi> and therefore happy is the man that findes it out. <hi>All her ways,</hi> that is, the <hi>ways of wiſdom,</hi> the ways of godlineſs, they are <hi>ways of pleaſantneſs,</hi> not onely <hi>ſhall be,</hi> but they <hi>are</hi> ſo,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57146:94"/>
they are ways in <hi>themſelves</hi> pleaſant, and lead to pleaſantneſs: They are ways not onely pleaſant, but ways <hi>of pleaſantneſs</hi> in the abſtract. Wherefore the point that is to be the ſubject of this exerciſe, is, as you have it plain in the words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the ways of godlineſs are delightful ways, full of pleaſure, yea, they are pleaſantneſs it ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is nothing that mans heart is ſet more upon then pleaſure; and nothing hinders a man from the ways of godlineſs, more then fear he ſhall not finde pleaſure in them: Wherefore it is an argument of great concernment for us, throughly to be convinced that there is pleaſantneſs in the ways of godlineſs, <hi>they are ways of pleaſure;</hi> and I hope I ſpeak unto ſuch, whoſe hearts cloſe with the point as ſoon as it is named, who can ſay, Yes, and we finde it ſo. The ways of wiſdom are either the ways of Gods <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> or the ways of exerciſe of grace, or ways of <hi>obedience;</hi> all theſe are the ways of pleaſantneſs. <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord! they ſhall be ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe, the beauty of holineſs;</hi> And the like is ſaid of the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God: The <hi>exerciſes of the graces</hi> of the Spirit, they are the ways of wiſdom, and are full of delight and pleaſure: <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 13. <hi>The Mandrakes give a ſmell,</hi> and at our gates are all maner of fruits, new and old, <hi>which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved:</hi> In the Church of God the exerciſe of the graces of Gods Spirit among them is pleaſant. The duties of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience are pleaſant: <hi>O how I love thy Law!</hi> Thy Law <hi>is my delight:</hi> and a hundred ſuch expreſſions in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture ſets out the pleaſantneſs of Gods
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57146:94"/>
ways, by all maner of pleaſure that men finde in the world, the pleaſure of the <hi>eye,</hi> of the <hi>taſte,</hi> of the <hi>ſmell,</hi> of the <hi>ear.</hi> The way of the righteous is <hi>as a light that ſhines more and more, to a perfect day:</hi> Now it is a good and pleaſant thing for an eye to behold the light; no ſuch beauty as in the ways of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>The ſavour of oyntments and ſpices,</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſets out the fragrancy of Gods Spirit. The melody of the <hi>ear,</hi> that is alſo for the ſetting out of the <hi>joy</hi> of Gods people; <hi>Bleſſed are they that hear the joyful ſound.</hi> The <hi>taſte,</hi> O come <hi>and taſte how ſweet the Lord is.</hi> And the delight that Gods people have with the Lord in his ways, is ſet out by the <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage delight,</hi> that is the greateſt natural delight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the children of men.</p>
                  <p>But wherein does the pleaſantneſs of the ways <note place="margin">Quest.</note> of wiſdom appear? what kinde of pleaſantneſs is it?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall anſwer ſome <hi>quaeres</hi> about this, and make <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſome <hi>application</hi> of it, and ſo proceed. Then a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is like to prevail with his Scholars, and make them good Scholars, when he can make them love their Books: and it is the duty of Miniſters, not only to convince people, that they ought to walk in the ways of godlineſs, but to make them love them; that we may make you in love with the ways of godlineſs, <note place="margin">The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of Gods ways.</note> we ſhall ſhew what pleaſantneſs is in them: Surely they muſt needs be ways of pleaſantneſs,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe they are the ways <hi>of wiſdom:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> if they were but onely <hi>rational ways,</hi> ſuch ways as were ſuitable to the principles of right reaſon, there were abundance of delight in them: certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there are <hi>rational</hi> delights, as well as <hi>ſenſual</hi>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:57146:95"/>
delights; he is not worthy of the name of a man, that does not think there are rational delights, as well as ſenſual: Many of the <hi>Heathens</hi> that knew what rational delights were, thoſe things ſuitable to the rules of right Reaſon, ſcorned ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, as inferior to them; give me that man that hath but the rules of right Reaſon, and I dare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to convince him, that all the ways of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs are ſuitable to thoſe principles, though ſome be above them: But being ways of wiſdom there is more pleaſure, becauſe they are not onely ſuitable to the rules of right Reaſon, but are able to elevate Reaſon: Wiſdom does make the face of a man to ſhine, and puts a luſtre upon a man, and puts a glory upon any thing; the beauty and glory that wiſdom hath, is put upon the ways of godlineſs, therefore pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are pleaſantneſs, becauſe in them <note place="margin">2.</note> the ſoul of a man is in the true and right temper and frame of it: Now the delight of nature, it is the right temper and frame, ſuitable to the principles of nature in every thing; And therefore, that Text that you all know, where it is ſaid, <hi>A good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience is a continual feaſt;</hi> the word is in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, a <hi>good heart,</hi> a <hi>merry heart,</hi> and ſome tranſlate it, a heart that is in a <hi>right temper,</hi> that is, in ſuch a frame and temper, that is the true right temper of the heart, that affords a continual feaſt to any. That place in <hi>James</hi> 5. <hi>If any man be merry, let him ſing;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> the word is, <hi>if any ones minde be right,</hi> if his minde be in the <hi>right temper,</hi> then let him <hi>ſing:</hi> For there is no true mirth, no true joy, but that which ariſes from the <hi>true temper</hi> of the ſpirit. <hi>Senſe</hi> hath no
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57146:95"/>
delight, but when the ſenſitive part is in the right temper; and ſo it is in the ſoul: Now the ſoul in the ways of godlineſs is in the right temper, theſe put the ſoul into the right frame, and ſo comes to be pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are pleaſantneſs, becauſe they are <note place="margin">3.</note> the higheſt actions of the higheſt faculties, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the higheſt principles, about the higheſt objects, and therefore muſt needs afford a great deal of pleaſure. This is a ſpecial conſideration of the pleaſantneſs of the ways of godlineſs, and will let much of the excellency of them into your hearts. What is the higheſt pleaſure of ſenſe, but the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt exerciſe of the ſenſitive faculty about ſuch an object as is ſuitable to ſenſe? as there is a great deal of pleaſure in meat and drink: Whence comes this? It comes from that exerciſe of the <hi>Salinal humor</hi> in the tongue and frame of the mouth, meeting with another humor in meat and drink, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it, that is all the pleaſure in the taſte, which is the ſpecial pleaſure that is ſought for in the world.</p>
                  <p>Now I beſeech you conſider, if there be pleaſure in joyning two ſuch mean things together, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the humor in the ſpittle, meeting with a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in meat and drink ſuitable to it; what pleaſure muſt needs be in the exerciſing, and acting of a creature, that is of the higheſt nature that ever God made creature; and theſe creatures raiſed with the higheſt principles for the kinde that any creature is capable of, and exerciſed about the higheſt objects that it is poſſible for a creature to be exerciſed about for the kinde, God, and Chriſt, and Eternity? if
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57146:96"/>
we ſee pleaſure in the other that is ſo low, and not in this, certainly we muſt pull out our eyes, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly beſot our own hearts, if we yield not that the pleaſure herein is abundantly more, and more glorious. So the pleaſure of the <hi>eye,</hi> what is it but the viſive ſpirit that is in the eye? meeting with colour abroad, it hath pleaſure therein: If the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſpirit in the eye, which is a poor mean thing that brute beaſts have as well as our ſelves, meeting with ſuch a poor thing as the colour is, becomes ſuch delight; what delight muſt be in exerciſing the higheſt faculties, about the higheſt objects? And ſo the <hi>ſmell</hi> is nothing but that humor in the noſtrils, meeting with another humor that is without: And ſo of the ear, and of the touch; we might inſtance, there the delight comes from nothing but the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the faculty about mean things; but if god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs exerciſes ſuch glorious faculties, ſo elevated about ſuch glorious objects, there muſt needs be a great deal of pleaſantneſs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the ways of wiſdom muſt needs be <note place="margin">4.</note> ways of pleaſantneſs, becauſe they are <hi>the life of God</hi> himſelf, the ſoul in the ways of wiſdom does live the very life of God: The Scripture ſpeaks of the <hi>Life of Grace,</hi> it is the life of God: Now all pleaſure and comfort, is according to the life that a creature lives; comfort is nothing elſe but the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a kinde of life: Senſitive comforts is the feeding of that life, rational comforts the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that life; and the life of God being a higher life then any other, then ſenſe or reaſon, that muſt have its comforts too, and there muſt be delight and pleaſure for the filling up of this; now the work
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57146:96"/>
of Grace in the hearts of Gods people, &amp; in their lives, it is the life of God, and therefore there muſt needs be a great deal of comfort in the exerciſe of ſuch a life.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, much pleaſantneſs there is in the ways of godlineſs, becauſe in them the people of God do communicate unto God their ſouls, in all that they have or do, by a letting out of the ſoul into God that is the fountain of all good: Now there is an infinite delight in this. All the delight that there is in God, or in the creature, is in communication. In God himſelf: becauſe God would have delight in himſelf, therefore he would have <hi>that</hi> that he might communicate himſelf to; and becauſe he would have infinite delight, according to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite nature, therefore he would have <hi>that,</hi> that he might infinitely communicate himſelf unto; and therefore the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, is the infinite delight of his Father, becauſe the Father does infinitely communicate himſelf unto him.</p>
                  <p>And now becauſe God would have further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, though there be nothing that he can infinitely communicate himſelf unto but his <hi>Son,</hi> yet that he may have ſuch delight as his creature may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, he makes a world; and the ſpecial end why God made the world, is, that he might have crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to communicate himſelf unto, in his wiſdom, and goodneſs and glory; and therefore thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are moſt capable of Gods communicating himſelf unto, are called <hi>Gods delight;</hi> God rejoyces in the habitable parts of the earth, becauſe there are creatures that he can communicate himſelf unto, and eſpecially his pleaſure is among his people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are creatures that are capable of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57146:97"/>
of himſelf: Thus you ſee that the delight of Gods is communicating himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And ſo the delight of the <hi>creature</hi> is in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating themſelves; and therefore of all natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, that of <hi>marriage</hi> is the moſt, becauſe there is the greateſt communication of one creature to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Now when as Gods delight is in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and our delight is in natural communication, then much more when we come to communicate our ſelves ſpiritually to God. There is a delight in the life <hi>of friendſhip,</hi> becauſe one friend communicates himſelf to another, but in <hi>marriage</hi> greater, becauſe that communication is greater; and according to the degrees of communication, the degrees of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light are; then the delight in the ways of God muſt be the greateſt, becauſe there is the greateſt, and higheſt, and moſt glorious communication of a creature, it communicates it ſelf, and lets out it ſelf fully into the infinite Ocean of all good: If there were nothing but a letting out of it ſelf into an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary good, it were delight, but to let out it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an infinite Ocean of all delight, this is pleaſure, and this is a myſtery; this is a ground why no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite hath the delight of the ways of godlineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he does not communicate himſelf fully unto God; but when the heart comes off fully to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it ſelf to God, there is infinite delight in them: The ways of godlineſs ſurely are ways of pleaſure, if this be in them, as it is.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, the ways of godlineſs are ways of <note place="margin">6.</note> pleaſure, becauſe in them the ſoul hath the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God,</hi> and walks with God, walks up and down in the light of his face: There is a bleſſed

ſhine of Gods countenance, and of his love upon the ſoul, and influences of his graces unto the ſoul in thoſe ways; as the ſoul hath delight in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of its ſelf unto God, ſo they are ways of pleaſantneſs, becauſe in them there is a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God unto the ſoul: That place in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 19. hath a notable expreſſion of the ſweetneſs of the ways of godlineſs, and the delight that Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have in thoſe ways: <hi>Bleſſed is the people that know the joyful ſound, they ſhall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.</hi> God is in them, and lets out himſelf unto them; now the quinteſſence of all good put together, is in every beam of Gods face, and therefore when God ſhall let out himſelf, and be thus the portion of a ſoul, it muſt needs be a great deal of delight.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, ways of godlineſs are the ways of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, becauſe the principles of them all is <hi>love:</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <note place="margin">7.</note> comes from love, hath much delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the principle of every way of God is <hi>love:</hi> God would have nothing from us but out of love, and that may carry us unto love of God himſelf, and that <hi>love</hi> by which the heart is carried unto God, is the chariot of love: There is a ſweet expreſſion for this that we have in <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 9, 10. the eſtate of the Church is ſet out by <hi>Solomons</hi> making himſelf a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of the wood of Lebanon: <hi>He made the Pillars thereof of ſilver, the bottom thereof of gold, the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it of purple, the midſt thereof being paved with love.</hi> A ſtrange expreſſion, that the midſt of Chariot ſhould be paved with <hi>love:</hi> the chariot whereby <hi>Chriſt</hi> does carry his people up and down in the world, and bring them to himſelf, is ſuch a Chariot, as the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57146:98"/>
midſt thereof is paved with <hi>love.</hi> At the 7. <hi>ver.</hi> he ſpeaks of the <hi>bed</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and here of his <hi>Chariot;</hi> Divines interpret theſe two places, his <hi>bed</hi> to ſet out the reſt and glory that the Saints ſhall have with Chriſt eternally; and the <hi>Chariot</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that is, thoſe ways wherein Chriſt carries his people up and down in the world to himſelf, and the midſt thereof is love; there muſt needs then be delight in thoſe ways.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, the ways of God are full of pleaſantneſs, <note place="margin">8.</note> becauſe they are ſuch as are <hi>delightful</hi> to God: Now they muſt be pleaſant, when they are ſuch as God takes delight in, they are ſuch as the Church knows Chriſt takes much delight in. What admirable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions hath that Book of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> of Gods delight in the graces of his people, and in the ways of godlineſs? Now there is no man loves a friend, but accounts every good thing that his friend loves, to be a double good: Now that which God himſelf accounts pleaſantneſs, and is his delight, muſt needs be the delight and pleaſure of a gracious heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſo much nearneſs between God and a gracious heart.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Yet further, there is abundance of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs <note place="margin">10.</note> in the ways of God, in regard of the many <hi>encouraging</hi> delights that God hath provided for his people while they do live here, and walk with him in theſe ways, to make their lives to be ſweet unto them; God provides his Paradiſe here for them, to encourage them, they walk in the garden of God; God hath his <hi>Eden,</hi> his garden, <hi>The Covenant of Grace,</hi> and the glorious things prepared, are as the <hi>Eden</hi> and <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of God, in which the ſouls of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57146:98"/>
his people walk, wherein they have delightful hills and dales. In the Scripture there are the high myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of godlineſs, and the plain and eaſie truths of Religion, as valleys and hills to delight them in their way. They have the ſweet ſprings and rivers of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> that are appointed as ſweet ſtreams to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh them; and the bleſſed promiſes, delightful trees to behold, <hi>The tree of life,</hi> Chriſt himſelf, and a feaſt of fat things in the Ordinances, wine upon the lees, making melody in their hearts, they go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that, and therefore ſure their ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, there being ſo many <hi>encouraging</hi> delightful things that God hath provided for them in their way.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Further, ways of pleaſantneſs they are, <note place="margin">9.</note> becauſe that Religion does enable them to draw out more delight and pleaſure from the creature it ſelf, then any other poſſibly can do; there is no principle that can enable to draw out delights from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as godlineſs does enable a man to do; for take any other carnal natural man, he can draw out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the creature but that which is carnal and natural; but Gods people have a principle to draw out more, and we are to know this, that every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath a natural delight in it, and there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more in it to a gracious heart, then a natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; as it was with <hi>Manna,</hi> when <hi>Manna</hi> fell, there was a <hi>dew</hi> that fell together with it; and ſo with our meat, and drink, and clothes, and eſtate, and delights in the world; it is true, they are <hi>Manna,</hi> and we feed upon them as the carnal <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fed upon <hi>Manna,</hi> but we do not ſee the <hi>dew;</hi> a carnal heart is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>dew</hi> that fals with the <hi>Manna,</hi> but
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57146:99"/>
thoſe that are godly and religious, and walk in theſe ways of wiſdom, they have a principle to diſcern and reliſh the <hi>dew</hi> that falls with this <hi>Manna,</hi> a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret bleſſing of God that their ſouls are enabled to cloſe with in the enjoyment of the creature; in <hi>meat,</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> and <hi>clothes,</hi> and <hi>recreations,</hi> they finde a ſecret influence of GOD together with them.</p>
                  <p>Take a flower, if a flie come to it, it cannot get out that good which a <hi>Bee</hi> can do: If we take a flower, we can get out the ſmell, but there is a honey dew, and if we had that principle a <hi>Bee</hi> hath, we might get out more then the ſmell: So carnal people have many ſweet flowers, which are pleaſant to the ſmell, but there is a honey dew that onely the godly can get out: So that he hath not onely the uſe of all lawful pleaſure to the full that any other hath, but he can go and take them as his own, as thoſe that are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by the blood of Chriſt, as thoſe his Father allows him: If he ſee the glory of the creature, and delights in it, he looks upon it as Gods own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that he gives him, and looks upon all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as his Fathers; he ſees no ground, but he ſays it is his Fathers ground; and he ſees ſprings and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and delights in the creatures as they are his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>A wicked man that takes delight in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he travels and walks up and down, and ſees other creatures; but it is as if a man were walking in the Orchard and Garden of his deadly enemy: Suppoſe a man have a deadly enemy, and he hath a pleaſant garden, that hath many fair walks and trees in his garden, and he walks in it as others do;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57146:99"/>
But where am I now? I am walking here, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed in the garden that is mine enemies, and what if he meet me here? it may coſt me my life: And ſo it is with all carnal men in the world; but the people of God enjoy the outward delights of the world, and ſee the ſweet walks, and delightful pleaſures that are here, and it is their Fathers garden, the garden of him that is their God, that they have an intereſt in, ſo that they have more delight in the creatures then any elſe.</p>
                  <p>Yea not onely ſo, godlineſs does not only enable to draw more delight from the creatures then others, but <hi>raiſes</hi> all natural pleaſures on high, and makes them ſpiritual, it puts a ſpiritual excellency upon that which is natural, it does not reſt in having content to the eye, or ear, or taſte in any natural delight, but ſpiritualizeth all; there is that vertue in godlineſs to ſpiritualize all natural things, to raiſe the excellency of them.</p>
                  <p>Yea not onely ſo, but in the laſt place there is that vertue in godlineſs, to turn all evil into good, if it meet with any thing that hath bitterneſs; godlineſs is like that wood, that made the bitter waters ſweet, it hath that excellency to turn evil, and make it not onely profitable, but delightful. So that all theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put together concerning the commendation of the ways of wiſdom, we muſt either put out our eyes, or acknowledge we do not know what the ways of wiſdom mean, if we do not ſubſcribe to this truth, <hi>that her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs:</hi> Ways of pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they are, and this pleaſantneſs that is in her ways hath abundance of excellencies in it. Very many I thought to have ſpoken of, and enlarged, take
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57146:100"/>
onely the very mention of them, (becauſe I muſt not be too long) and then we will anſwer to ſome <hi>quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> and apply all, and ſo conclude. For the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent properties of this pleaſantneſs, it is that which is the ſweeteſt ſoul-ſatisfying pleaſantneſs, the very rule it ſelf is <hi>ſweet,</hi> ſweeter then <hi>honey;</hi> oh how ſweet is the ſouls acting by it! it hath the very quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſence of all other delights extracted in it, it is the moſt ſolid, ſuch as hath not vanity and froth in it, as other delights have; it is ſuch a delight as ennobles the ſoul, it ſpiritualizeth the heart, it is immixt, not dangerous as others are; it is abiding, not vaniſhing, it is continually virid and freſh; though there is a fulneſs in it, yet it grows not to ſatiety by uſe, but grows more and more ſweet, for it raiſeth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth the faculty; it is Heavenly, it is divine, it is independent in regard of the creature, there needs no ſharking out to the creature for the upholding it, all other delights depend on this; there is no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure had but in the ways of godlineſs: <hi>Una guttula malae conſcientiae totum marae mundani gaudii abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet:</hi> One drop of an evil conſcience ſwallows up the whole Sea of worldly joy, ſays <hi>Luther;</hi> but one drop of this delight is enough to ſweeten all ſorrows; one drop of gall will imbitter much ſweet, but one drop of ſweet cannot ſweeten much gall; but here it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, one drop of this ſweet ſweetens all bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of afflictions, but all the bitter of afflictions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imbitter one drop of this delight. Yea this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is the rule of all pleaſure, and the end of all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, whatſoever pleaſure is not regulated by this, and ſubordinate to this, is evil.</p>
                  <p>But how are the ways of wiſdom the ways of <note place="margin">Queſt. 1.</note>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:57146:100"/>
pleaſantneſs? It appears otherwiſe, for the ways of godlineſs do abridge men of abundance of pleaſure and delight in many things in the world; What is ſo great an enemy to the pleaſures of men and women as Religion? It cauſeth them to be cut ſhort of abundance of delightful things that others rejoyce in.</p>
                  <p>To that I anſwer, firſt, Suppoſe it were ſo: you <note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> heard in the commendation, that the pleaſantneſs of the ways of godlineſs was exceeding great, that it hath that excellency in it, to make up whatſoever pleaſure it wants: Though it ſhould cut you ſhort of abundance of pleaſure, if it ſhall put a principle that ſhall enable you to ſtand in no need of that pleaſure it cuts you ſhort of, what have you loſt? As ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <note place="margin">How the ways of <hi>wiſdom</hi> ar ways of <hi>pleaſantneſs.</hi>
                     </note> a man that is weak, and hath little blood or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in him, and is chill, and cold, and puts on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny clothes to keep himſelf warm; if theſe clothes ſhould be al taken away, ſave only his inward garment, if there could be put into him ſpirits, and blood and marrow, and that which ſhould make him not to be ſenſible of the want of his clothes, it is a great deal better; What man that is weak and ſickly, and is fain to have abundance of clothes to keep him warm, would not be willing to part with his clothes, if he might have ſpirits and blood put into him, not to feel the want of thoſe clothes? So, why is it that your hearts are ſet upon the delight of the creature? becauſe you want a principle within to ſatisfie your ſouls withal, and therefore you are fain to ſeek the cloathing of the <hi>creature,</hi> and to keep your ſelves warm with the cloathing of the creature; but if Religion take away thoſe things, and give you a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57146:101"/>
principle not to feel the want of them, but have them made up another way and better, you have no cauſe to complain of the want of pleaſantneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that godlineſs abridges us of <note place="margin">2.</note> no lawful pleaſure; if it abridges of any, it is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to want thoſe delights that godlineſs abridges us of: What, haſt thou delight in <hi>that</hi> which is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? if it be not ſinful, Religion does not abridge thee of it, onely ſuch delights in which thou diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noreſt God, and provokeſt him againſt thee.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, How are the ways of God ways <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi>
                     </note> of pleaſantneſs, when they require <hi>abundance</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, <hi>trouble</hi> for ſin; and is not that bitter and <note place="margin">2.</note> grievous?</p>
                  <p>To that I anſwer, Firſt, there is more ſweetneſs in <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that which thou calleſt bitterneſs, then in all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfulneſs of the world beſides: thoſe waters Chriſt does turn into wine. And to convince you that theſe are not bitter waters, but that the tears of repentance and humiliation, are ſweet refreſhing waters of life; conſider from what fountain they come.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the work of humiliation if it be right, the principle of it is the <hi>melting work</hi> of the Goſpel in the <note place="margin">1.</note> ſoul, the ſweetneſs of the goodneſs, and mercy of God in Jeſus Chriſt melting the heart, and cauſing it to diſſolve, and fall down under the hand of God; certainly that which comes from ſuch a ſweet prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, cannot have much bitterneſs in it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſoul in the work of humiliation, melting before the Lord, eaſes it ſelf in that <hi>melting</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> of abundance of ſin; and much ſweetneſs there muſt needs be in thoſe tears that eaſe the ſoul of, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the ſoul from much ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:57146:101"/>
Thirdly, in the work of humiliation there is much delight, becauſe the ſoul hath much delight in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">3.</note> back to that ſorrow it hath had; and if godlineſs <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Si adeò dulce flere prote, quàm dulce erit gaudere de te?</hi> Ber.</note> makes mourning to be delightful, what does it make rejoycing to be?</p>
                  <p>But if it be ſaid in the third place, But there are many <hi>hardthings</hi> that Gods people do meet withal in the ways of godlineſs, and the ways of godlineſs <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> put them upon ſuch things as cauſe them to meet <note place="margin">3.</note> with ſore temptations and trials here in the world; how then can the ways of godlineſs be ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant?</p>
                  <p>To that I anſwer, Here is a mighty commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> to the pleaſantneſs of the ways of Religion, notwithſtanding the hardeſt, and ſoreſt things a godly heart meets with; there is <hi>that</hi> delight in the ways of godlineſs, as upholds the heart under all, and carries the heart ſweetly on. What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation was it to the grace in the hearts of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> that did uphold their hearts, and carry their hearts ſweetly in the enduring of ſuch hard things?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, theſe being hard to fleſh and blood, <note place="margin">2.</note> hinder not the pleaſure of a gracious heart; it is the higheſt improvement of all our eſtates that can be, the higheſt teſtimony of giving your reſpect to God, whereby the ſoul enjoys moſt of God all times: <hi>The Spirit of God and glory reſteth</hi> upon the ſoul while it is enduring ſuch things. And how oppoſite is thy heart, and what difference between Chriſts heart and thine? Chriſt bids you <hi>leap for joy,</hi> when you meet with ſuch things, and you think they take away all joy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:57146:102"/>
But we ſee it in experience contrary; when people come into the ways of godlineſs, they do not finde <note place="margin">Quest.</note> 
                     <hi>that delight</hi> and joy you ſpeak of, their ſpirits are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, <note place="margin">4.</note> and lumpiſh, and ſad.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer to that, It may be it is but ſeriouſneſs, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and thou thinkeſt it is ſadneſs. <note place="margin">1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may be they are not in their element, and therefore they do not expreſs chearfulneſs: If <note place="margin">2.</note> the fiſh be upon the earth, it cannot take delight; the bird does not ſing when it is upon the ground, but when it is got up to the air: Thoſe that you ſay are melancholly and lumpiſh, put them to religious and gracious exerciſes, and get up their hearts to God, and they will be merry.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it may be it is your company makes <note place="margin">3.</note> them ſo, becauſe they ſee ſo much diſhonor to God in your company, let them be among their own company, and they know how to be joyful.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is not becauſe of Religion, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are no more religious, becauſe they finde <note place="margin">4.</note> ſo much want of godlineſs in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is not becauſe they have ſo much cauſe of ſorrow as you, but they come to <hi>ſee more</hi> then <note place="margin">5.</note> you; not becauſe their hearts are not ſo pleaſant as yours, but becauſe God hath diſcovered the danger of their condition more to them, and the things that concern their ſouls and eternal eſtates, ſuch things as if thou didſt but ſee, would ſink thy heart into diſmal, bottomleſs ſorrow and deſperation. Thou thinkeſt much to ſee them ſo ſad as they are, If thou didſt but ſee that <hi>they</hi> ſee, thou wouldſt ſink down into the gulf of deſperation among the damned ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:57146:102"/>
It is a mighty argument, they have ſome mighty work of God to uphold them, and that grace comes from a mighty principle, that they have ſome chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, notwithſtanding they ſee ſuch things, as if one that were meerly natural ſhould ſee them, he would ſink down into hell, and yet they can hope in God; and ſometimes, notwithſtanding all unbelief, do rejoyce in God. Alas, thy pleaſantneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is ſuch, as every little toy is enough to damp; if thou beeſt croſſed in the leaſt thing in the creature, thou art damped: But what if God ſhould ſhew thee all his terrors, the infinite evil of ſin, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite danger thou art in, in regard of thy eternal eſtate, that would damp thee indeed; and therefore acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that <hi>that</hi> joy that the godly have, conſidering what they ſee, is exceeding ſtrong, that upholds them as it doth.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, their joy is a ſecret inward thing, which <note place="margin">6.</note> ſtrangers ſhall not intermeddle withal, thou haſt no skill in it. What was it for <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> to ſay, No Nobleman had ſuch pleaſure as he, when he was among the beaſts; thou haſt no principle to judge of it, and therefore art no meet Judge.</p>
                  <p>For Application.</p>
                  <p>Hence we ſee one ſpecial and great reaſon, why <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1.</note> Gods people are taken off ſo much from <hi>carnal</hi> pleaſure as they are; they have met with <hi>better;</hi> and the ſweet of the world is not <hi>ſo</hi> much to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have met with that which is abundantly more ſweet. It is the ſweet ſavor of Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious oyntment, that draws the hearts of the Saints after him, <hi>that</hi> makes them cry out, <hi>Draw us, and we will run after thee, Cant.</hi> 1. 3, 4. But the ſavor
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57146:103"/>
of baſe pleaſures draws vile hearts after them:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>—Trahit ſua quem<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> voluptas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The light of the Sun darkens the light of the candle, and puts out the light of the fire; The light that Gods ſervants do meet with in the ways of God, do darken all, and take away the luſtre of all carnal delight; and this is the reaſon that Satan does not go that way to work, to tempt a gracious heart with ſenſual pleaſures, becauſe he is ſo far above them, and therefore he is fain to tempt them with ſpiritual pride, and luſts of a higher nature: It were a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful diſhonour for any that profeſs godlineſs, to have their hearts taken with any pleaſures of the fleſh, but onely in order to better pleaſures that are to be enjoyed in the ways of godlineſs, in the ways of wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place; What infinite cauſe have we to bleſs the Name of God that gives us ſuch pleaſant ways unto glory? Though his ways were never ſo full of torment, we had cauſe to bleſs God; but for to pave our way to Heaven with ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and to afford unto us ſuch ſoul-ſatisfying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, here while we live in this our poor pilgrimage, this is praiſe-worthy: If we were to aſcend to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a fiery Chariot, we were to praiſe God; but this is the Chariot of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the midſt whereof is paved with love, as you heard; How are we to bleſs God for this?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if it be ſo, here is an aggravation of the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 3.</note> wickedneſs of thoſe that ſhall take delight in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſures: God ſees it is impoſſible for any of his creatures, but they muſt ſeek for pleaſures ſome way, and that God might take our hearts to himſelf,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57146:103"/>
he hath provided ways wherein we may have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and an infinite aggravation it will be to your wickedneſs, to ſeek for pleaſure in the ways of ſin, in diſhonoring God, when thou mayeſt have pleaſure in honoring of God: Conſider this, and let thy ſoul upbraid it ſelf for abominable wickedneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude: There are ways of delight wherein God may be honored, and my ſoul ſatisfied; there are other ways that have delight, but ſuch ways as God will be diſhonored in them, and my ſoul endangered. Now when as God does give me a cup full of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy to ſatisfie my thirſt with, for me to take a cup of poyſon to ſatisfie my thirſt with, this is folly, and this is abominable wickedneſs of mens hearts. God ſets his <hi>cup of ſalvation,</hi> and tenders it in his ways to ſatisfie your ſouls withal, and the <hi>Devil</hi> comes with his cup of poyſon, and do but ſpeak of delight, and when you are athirſt, you rather take the cup of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then the cup of Salvation: the more delight there is in Gods ways, the more abominable is thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to forſake them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hence the great ſcandal of the ways of godlineſs, that the world ſtumbles at, is taken away, they call them dumpiſh ways: The Saints of God never knew the minde of God if this be ſo. The world deals with the ways of God in this caſe, as they did with the Chriſtians in the Primitive times; they uſed to put Chriſtians into <hi>Bears</hi> and <hi>Dogs</hi> skins, or <hi>ugly creatures,</hi> and then bait them; and ſo the men of the world put Religion into ugly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and then ſpeak againſt them: and truly that they ſpeak againſt, is only their own conceits, and not any thing in themſelves; they are lovely and excellent,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57146:104"/>
and glorious, onely they appear to be ſad and evil, by the conceits thou haſt put upon them.</p>
                  <p>In the fifth place, by that which hath been ſaid, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 5.</note> let all be drawn to the love of the ways of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I have often hinted upon ſuch an argument as this, and therefore will paſs lightly over it. Fear not pleaſure, truſt God with it, thou ſhalt finde enough. Wouldſt thou never be ſad? live well, ſays <hi>Bernard:</hi> Tell me, wouldſt thou embrace the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vis nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam eſſe triſtis? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vive.</hi> Bern. de intern. dom. c. 45</note> ways of Religion, if thou wert ſure of pleaſure? I call Heaven and Earth to record this day, that which I have ſpoken of the ways of wiſdom are truths of God, they are not notions, not conceits, but certain realities. God hath engaged himſelf to make this good, and abundantly more; Oh come and taſte how ſweet the Lord is, do not ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loof off; they may ſeem to be unpleaſant ways a great way off, but when you come near, you will ſee delight. Wherefore all you that have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ways of wiſdom, manifeſt this, that God hath brought you into bleſſed paths, that theſe things are true: Religion does mightily ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by the Profeſſors of it, when thoſe that look on, ſee no ſuch things manifeſted: It is our duty <hi>to rejoyce in the Lord,</hi> and to walk in the ways of wiſdom, as it may appear <hi>they are ways of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs,</hi> to carry ous ſelves <hi>delightfully</hi> in theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ways. Delightfulneſs in the ways of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs puts a beauty upon them; It is an excellent ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> hath to expreſs this, <hi>As,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a beautiful face at all times is pleaſing to the eye, but then eſpecially when there is joy manifeſted in the countenance:</hi> joy in the face puts a new beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57146:104"/>
and makes that which before was beautiful, to be exceeding beautiful, it puts a luſtre upon beauty; ſo, though the ways of Religion be in themſelves beautiful, yet when there is ſpiritual joy added, they appear then beautiful with a double beauty. We have a ſweet promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 18. Oh that we could ſee it fulfilled! <hi>I will create Jeruſalem a rejoycing, and her people a joy;</hi> a joy even in the abſtract, not onely joyful, but a joy, and God will create this, it muſt be Gods work; and though to the eye of fleſh and blood there be no matter of joy, yet God will create her people a joy. You know what charges the Prophet lays upon this; what a comely thing it is, and ſee that in any caſe you rejoyce. Onely take heed you do not miſtake in pleaſantneſs; many that are godly may be pleaſant in their way upon that ground, becauſe Chriſtians muſt be pleaſant, but do not miſtake natural pleaſantneſs for ſpiritual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs.</p>
                  <p>How ſhall we know the difference between natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> pleaſantneſs in a Chriſtian, and ſpiritual pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>There may be a great many of temporal pleaſures <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that God gives forth to Chriſtians in its place; but <note place="margin">Difference between <hi>natural</hi> pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> you muſt riſe higher then that, and put another maner of luſtre upon the ways of Religion then natural pleaſantneſs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if it be a ſpiritual pleaſantneſs, it will be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſuch as becomes Chriſtian gravity; Yea, not onely ſeriouſneſs and gravity is to be mixed with <note place="margin">1.</note> pleaſantneſs; but if it be ſpiritual pleaſantneſs,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is ſuch as can ſtand with fear, and the <note place="margin">2.</note> work of repentance and humiliation; theſe do not
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57146:105"/>
hinder a ſpiritual pleaſantneſs, though it hinders that which is natural: You know the Scripture that ſays, <hi>Rejoyce with trembling;</hi> and <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord, and greatly delights in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:</hi> That is a ſpiritual pleaſantneſs, which hath a gracious mixture of ſeriouſneſs and other graces of Gods Spirit with it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Again, if it be a gracious pleaſantneſs, it <note place="margin">3.</note> is a delight in <hi>all</hi> the ways of wiſdom; many can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſome ways of wiſdom, <hi>the ſtony ground</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome truths with joy, but others they cannot cloſe with; but when the pleaſantneſs is ſpiritual, there is rejoycing in all.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Again, if the pleaſantneſs be ſpiritual, it <note place="margin">4.</note> is our ſtrength, it carries on the ſoul in the ways of God more fully, it is oyl that cauſes the wheels of thy ſoul to go on more freely in the ways of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I appeal to thee, Does thy pleaſantneſs carry thee on more ſweetly in the ways of Religion? Thou haſt been merry in company, but does this carry thee on more fully in the ways of God? If you have had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in natural things, and when you come to ſpiritual things, your hearts are dead, certainly you went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond your bounds.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Again, if it be ſpiritual pleaſantneſs, it <note place="margin">5.</note> will bear up the heart in the want of all outward plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and though all outward content be taken away. <hi>Habbak.</hi> 3. 17, 18. <hi>Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vines, the labor of the Olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat; the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls: Yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> When
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57146:105"/>
all is dark abroad in the world, the ſoul does rejoyce in God alone: A ſoul that hath but natural pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, is all amort and down when any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction befals him. You that have the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſpirits, when you have friends, and all that you like, you are jocund and merry, but when affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction comes, how quickly are your ſpirits down? and how are you vext and troubled? whereas if there were this ſpring of pleaſantneſs in the heatt, it would bear up the heart joyful in affliction; though ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and friends ſhould croſs, this delightfulneſs of ſpirit within would carry the heart on chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But thoſe that are delightful when they are well pleaſed, yet every little thing that croſſes them, makes them dumpiſh. This is another argument, it is not ſpiritual pleaſantneſs their hearts are filled with, it is not from the delight they have found in the ways of God that makes them ſo merry. This by way of Caution.</p>
                  <p>But if we be ſure that our pleaſantneſs is ſpiritual, let us expatiate our ſelves to the utmoſt: It is a work of grace to moderate all carnal pleaſures, and to keep them down; but it is the ſpecial work of grace to expatiate the ſoul to the utmoſt in all ſpiritual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Therefore if God hath given thee this ſpring of delight and pleaſure, expatiate it to the glory and praiſe of God. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that greatly delights in the ways of Gods Commandments:</hi> And if God takes pleaſure in thee, how much more ſhouldſt thou take pleaſure in him! God gives out his pleaſure to be joyned to our pleaſantneſs, and if we ſhould not carry on the ways of Religion pleaſantly, it will be a diſhonor to God, and a diſgrace to our
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57146:106"/>
ſelves, and we cannot expect that acceptance from God of what we do, as otherwiſe we might; for as <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Si quid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni triſtis feceris fit de te potius quam facis</hi> Proſper</note> God loves a chearful <hi>Giver,</hi> ſo a chearful <hi>Server.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How ſhall we carry on the work of God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, be ſure to keep the heart right within, be ſure <note place="margin">Quest.</note> to keep all at peace within thy ſoul; you know ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> to the temper within, ſo there is the reliſhing of things without; He that hath peace within, can eaſily go through the duties that are required with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with joy.</p>
                  <p>Further, exerciſe <hi>faith</hi> in the work and office of the <note place="margin">How to carry on the work of God <hi>pleaſantly.</hi>
                     </note> holy Ghoſt, that office that the holy Ghoſt is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned unto by the Father and the Son, to be the Comforter of his people, to bring joy and comfort to them; look upon the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> as deſigned by the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> to bring joy and delight to the ſouls of his people. What an infinite difference there is between the comforts of a carnal heart, and the comforts of the godly? The one come from a little meat and drink, and the other come from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of faith about the office of the holy Ghoſt that is deſigned to this work.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in all that thou doeſt, be ſure to be upright: <note place="margin">3.</note> Though thou beeſt able to do but a little in any way of God, if thou beeſt upright, God accepts of it, and and thou wilt finde comfort: Thou ſayeſt thy duties are mean; it may be ſo, but if thou beeſt upright, thou mayeſt have comfort, it becomes the upright to be joyful; whereas the moſt glorious performances, if they be not in uprightneſs, are but abominable.</p>
                  <p>Again, ſweeten all your duties by ſpiritual medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; <note place="margin">4.</note> a Chriſtian that treaſures up ſpiritual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57146:106"/>
and every duty that he performs brings it in by meditation, and hath a great many meditations to rowl his duty up and down; in this is delight: To go to duty, and to have a barren heart to act, there is no delight; but to go to a duty, and to exerciſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual meditation, this is ſweet.</p>
                  <p>Again, labor to principle thy heart aright in the <note place="margin">5.</note> ways of godlineſs, to underſtand what they are; if thou underſtoodeſt what they are, they would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful; and the reaſon why many do not go on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully is, becauſe they do not underſtand what is in the ways of God to cauſe delight.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, What is there in the ways of God, to <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> cauſe delight?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, every work of godlineſs, and that ability that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1.</note> grace hath to exerciſe, is a beam of that infinite, choice, eternal, electing love of God upon thy ſoul; if thou lookeſt upon it ſo, it will be wonderfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, look upon every duty of godlineſs, as <note place="margin">2.</note> having more of the glory of God in it, then the <note place="margin">What there is in the ways to cauſe <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi>
                     </note> whole frame of heaven and earth beſides: Take all Gods works in the Creation, in Providence, in the Heavens, the Sun, Moon and Stars, in the Earth, and the Seas, there is not ſo much of the glory of God in them all, as in one gracious action that a Chriſtian performs; and if you looked at it thus, it could not but have pleaſure in it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, look at that action of grace, as <hi>that</hi> in which God attains his end in creating heaven and earth, <note place="margin">3.</note> more then in other things beſides; as there is more of God in it, ſo God attains more in it; the end of God in his counſels is more attained by any gracious act,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57146:107"/>
then by any thing elſe that can be done, ſave of the ſame nature: How delightful ſhould we be in the ways of godlineſs, if we looked thus at them?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, look upon every gracious act, as the ſeed <note place="margin">4.</note> of glory and eternal life: Every work of grace in the heart and life of Gods people, is a ſeed of glory and eternal life. And theſe four conſiderations being put upon every gracious act, do confirm that which was ſaid in the opening of the point, they muſt needs be <hi>full of pleaſantneſs:</hi> Be not ſatisfied in doing any thing in the ways of God, till you do it pleaſantly; I hear the ways of God are pleaſant, I have gone on being haled by conſcience, but little have I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the pleaſantneſs of them, there is more to be looked after then I have attained to: By this thou ſhalt come to be mightily ſtrengthened, and it wil be a marvellous help to make thee continue in the ways of godlineſs: And as I ſaid in handling that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the <hi>eaſineſs</hi> of the ways of godlineſs, thoſe that are continually thinking of the hardneſs of Gods ways, will fall off; but by having them pleaſant, it will carry thee on againſt temptations, and the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of all arguments.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Uſe of all, is, If the ways of <hi>wiſdom</hi> be ways of <hi>pleaſantneſs,</hi> what is the <hi>end</hi> of wiſdom? If the neather ſprings be ſo ſweet, what will the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be? If the lower <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be paved with gold, <note place="margin">Bonus es Domine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimae quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renti; quid invenienti?</note> ſurely that upper <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is paved with pearls. It is an excellent ſpeech of <hi>Bernard, Good art thou, O Lord, to the ſoul that ſeeks thee; what art thou then to the ſoul that findes thee?</hi> How ſweet and pleaſant are the ways of wiſdom then? How ſweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful is the <hi>end</hi> of wiſdom? If <hi>grace</hi> be pleaſant, how
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57146:107"/>
pleaſant is glory? therefore the Saints dye ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, becauſe there is a meeting of grace and glory: <hi>Grace</hi> is delightful, <hi>glory</hi> more delightful; but when theſe both meet together, what delight will there then be? It is a ſpeech of <hi>Jerome,</hi> ſpeaking of carnal delights; <hi>None can go from delight to delight;</hi> but it is not ſo ſpiritually, the more delight we have here, the more we ſhall have hereafter: and therefore let this be all our prayer, <hi>Lord give us evermore this pleaſure,</hi> ſatisfie our ſouls with this pleaſure; if the drops be ſweet, the rivers of pleaſure and joy that are at Chriſts right hand, how ſweet are they?</p>

in the greateſt afflictions, then to abide <hi>in Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>Court,</hi> in the enjoyment of all worldly delights; let the world caſt what dirt they will upon them, and darken their glory what they can, yet they are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and honorable in the Saints eyes, <hi>The excellent of the earth,</hi> and the glory of the world. <hi>Job</hi> ſcraping his ſores upon the <hi>dunghil,</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſinking into the mire in the <hi>dungeon,</hi> are more beautiful and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, then the great men of the earth, when they are crowned upon their Thrones; <hi>Though you have lien amongſt the pots,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, yet <hi>you are as the wings of a Dove covered with ſilver, and whoſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are covered with yellow gold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We read of the Chriſtians that lived in the time between the Prophets and Chriſt, in the latter end of this Chapter, that were as mean as almoſt the rage of men, and poverty, and diſgrace could make them, wandring up and down in <hi>Sheep-skins,</hi> and <hi>Goat-skins,</hi> and <hi>in the dens and caves of the earth;</hi> and yet, ſays the Text, <hi>they were ſuch as the world were not worthy of: Chryſoſtom</hi> carries it thus, <hi>Take all the men of the world, they are not worth one of the people of God, though never ſo mean in regard of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:</hi> But I rather take it thus, <hi>The world was not worthy of ſuch a priviledge, to have them live amongſt them, they are fitter to be ſet as Stars in Heaven, and to be continually before the Throne of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many times under mean outſides, there are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things within; in earthen veſſels, rich treaſures. The <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of God, covered meanly outwardly, and yet precious within. It is ſaid of Chriſt himſelf, that <hi>he had no form and comelineſs at all outwardly,</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:57146:109"/>
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>No beauty to a carnal eye:</hi> And yet in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. where the Church is put upon the deſcription of Chriſt, ſhe ſays, <hi>He is altogether lovely;</hi> altogether <hi>deſires,</hi> ſo it is in the Original: See what a different eſteem is of Chriſt in the thoughts of the world, and the thoughts of a gracious heart: And as of Chriſt, ſo of Chriſtians, Chriſt is precious to them that do believe; To you <hi>he is precious</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) but <note place="margin">Why a gracious heart ſees ſo mueh excellency in Gods people, under outward meanneſs.</note> to others <hi>a rock of offence;</hi> ſo to a godly gracious heart, the godly are precious, though contemned of thoſe that are ungodly. The arguments that a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart goes upon, or reaſons why a ſpiritual eye ſhould ſee ſo much excellency in Gods people, under their outward means, are,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe they judge as God judges; it is of <note place="margin">1.</note> the Spirit of God that they have received, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt needs judge of things as God judgeth. A childe eſteems of things uſually as his father doth; if there be any of you manifeſt a ſlight eſteem of any among whom you live, before your children, your children will have the like eſteem of them; if you manifeſt a high eſteem of any, your children will do the like: Hence it is, if thoſe that are prophane, do deſpiſe and ſcorn at Gods people before their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, their children will quickly learn to deſpiſe them: Now becauſe Gods people have Gods Spirit, and God is their Father, they judge as their Father does. Righteous men and Kings, in Scripture phraſe, are made all one; thoſe who are Righteous, God looks upon as <hi>Kings,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>Kings,</hi> are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of God, if they be not <hi>Righteous:</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thoſe two Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 17. and <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 24. in the one it is thus, <hi>Many Prophets and</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

men, <hi>have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee:</hi> But in the other it is, <hi>Many Prophets and</hi> Kings, <hi>have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God does not judge of men in regard of outwards; what are outwards before the Lord? What is it to have gold, and fine clothes before God? Thoſe things that are braveries in the world, and take up the eyes of men to admire at them, what are theſe to God? God does not eſteem of men at all for theſe things, neither doth he diſeſteem them for the want of them; the want of clothes, and of money, and of the things of the world, what is this to God? Does God look at any man the worſe for want of theſe things? God is no reſpecter of perſons; if he looks at any with high eſteem, he looks at the poor, and humble, and contrite: God delights to look down into the world upon thoſe that are poor; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a poor people that ſhall truſt in his name, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 12. The Lord paſſeth by the great things of the <hi>world, he brings down the mighty,</hi> and <hi>regards the low eſtate of his handmaid,</hi> the low eſtate of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: It is <hi>a poor and contrite ſpirit,</hi> that he that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth on high <hi>looketh at;</hi> the prayer of <hi>the deſtitute he regards, Pſal.</hi> 102. 17. The word in the Original is, <hi>A poor ſhrub,</hi> that which is in the Wilderneſs, and the beaſts tread upon, that no man regards, that ſeems to be altogether worthleſs. It may be, one comes with brave words, and hath mighty expreſſions, God throws them as dirt in his face: There comes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and can hardly groan out his meaning, and yet there being grace, God regards him. If a proud ſcornful ſpirit, ſhould hear a poor gracious heart groan out his complaints to God, he would think
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57146:110"/>
it non-ſence; but God, knowing the meaning of his Spirit, and ſeeing his grace, he hath reſpect to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A broken and contrite heart thou canſt not deſpiſe;</hi> God can deſpiſe <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Emperors</hi> of the earth, when they ſit upon their Thrones, but a broken and a contrite heart <hi>he cannot deſpiſe;</hi> let him be never ſo deſpicable in the eyes of the world, God cannot deſpiſe him, no more then he can deny himſelf, and ceaſe to be God. It is Gods judgement of men, that <hi>the righteous is more excellent then bis neighbor, Prov.</hi> 12. 26. Let his neighbor be the moſt excellent, in regard of parts, riches, honors, and other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and the godly man deſpiſed, and every way contemptible in regard of outwards, yet he is more excellent then his neighbor.</p>
                  <p>It is obſerved, that the <hi>Eagle</hi> and the <hi>Lyon,</hi> thoſe brave creatures, were not offered in ſacrifice to God, but the poor <hi>Lamb,</hi> and <hi>Dove;</hi> God regards the <hi>Lamb</hi> and the <hi>Dove,</hi> before the <hi>Eagle</hi> and the <hi>Lyon,</hi> to note that your great and brave ſpirits of the world, that are as <hi>Eagles,</hi> high, and lofty, and as the <hi>Lyon,</hi> God regards not thoſe; but your poor <hi>Lambs,</hi> and <hi>Doves,</hi> your poor <hi>meek</hi> ſpirits, that are contemptible in the eyes of the world, thoſe are precious to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not many mighty, great and noble;</hi> but <hi>God hath choſen the baſe things of the world, the fooliſh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible things of the world, to confound the wiſe, and the great things of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is very obſervable, when <hi>John</hi> ſent to Chriſt, to know whether he were the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> or no, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould look for another, he did not ſend him a direct anſwer, but, ſays he, <hi>Go tell him, The</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:57146:111"/>
                     <hi>blinde ſee, the lame go, the dead are raiſed, and the poor receive the Goſpel:</hi> Mark how Chriſt puts the <hi>poors</hi> receiving of the Goſpel amongſt the reſt; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were arguments of Gods power and glory, but what argument of Chriſts glory was this, that the poor, a contemptible people, received the Goſpel? Yes, God does as much glory in the <hi>poors</hi> receiving the Goſpel, as in raiſing up the dead: Some would think that this ſhould be an offence to <hi>John,</hi> that the poor receives the Goſpel; one would rather think he were the Meſſiah, if the rich had received the Goſpel; No, ſays he, <hi>the poor receive the Goſpel;</hi> he knew that <hi>John</hi> had a gracious heart, and would eſteem of things as he did, and would not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods people, by a ſpiritual eye, are very <note place="margin">2.</note> highly eſteemed, becauſe ſuch an eye looks at ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual excellencies: God hath made a gracious heart acquainted with true ſpiritual excellencies, and ſuch a one beholding the beauty and the glory that there is in ſpiritual excellencies, all the outward glittering glory that there is in the world is darkned: It is true, men and women, ſo long as they know no better things, judge onely according to theſe outward mean things. Children that know no better things then a gay coat, count it the greateſt preferment that can be, to be put into ſuch a coat; and ſo a man that knows no better things then the things of the world, he counts it the greateſt excellency to have them: But when a childe comes to have reaſon, and ſees higher things, he does not prize ſuch things; ſo a ſoul that comes to ſee the things of Heaven, God, and Chriſt, and Grace, and ſees into the realities of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57146:111"/>
them, and not as imaginary, he will never admire at any thing below, but onely at grace; and where there is grace, nothing can darken the light of it, it is ſo glorious as the light of the Sun; a little ſmoak cannot darken the light of the Sun, when it ſhines bright; a little ſmoak will darken the light of the <hi>candle,</hi> but cannot darken the light of the <hi>Sun:</hi> And ſo a little affliction will darken theſe outward things, to thoſe that eſteem them at a high rate; but ſpiritual excellencies are of ſuch a nature, that afflictions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not darken them.</p>
                  <p>But what ſpiritual excellencies are thoſe that a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <note place="margin">Quest.</note> eye ſees in Gods people, that make them to be ſo precious in its eſteem, notwithſtanding all their outward meanneſs?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Image of God. Secondly, the relation they have to God. Thirdly, their ſpiritual priviledges. <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Fourthly, the preciouſneſs of that which comes from them. Fifthly, the great uſe that they are of here in the world. Sixthly, their ends.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the work of grace, they have the image <note place="margin">1.</note> of God upon them: Now the image of a thing, is not the repreſenting of a thing in ſome under excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, or in ſome mean thing that concerns that which it is made to reſemble; but it is a reſemblance of it in that which is the chief excellency. As if I would draw the picture of a man, I would not draw it for to reſemble fleſh meerly, <hi>that</hi> a beaſt hath as well as man, but as near as can be, the very countenance, and life of man; I will not draw the back parts of a man, but his <hi>face,</hi> and countenance to life; ſo the image of God is not that which hath ſome little likeneſs to God, but that which hath
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57146:112"/>
a likeneſs to God in the higheſt excellency, in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and righteouſneſs, which is (to ſpeak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The ſaints <hi>likeneſs</hi> to God.</note> as we are able to conceive) the higheſt excellency of God; ſo that a gracious heart hath that which makes him like unto that which is the top of Gods excellency, that which is the image of GOD himſelf, and therefore it hath theſe four titles, The <hi>Image of God,</hi> The <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> The <hi>Life of God,</hi> and the <hi>Glory of God.</hi> The <hi>Image of God, Gen.</hi> 1. 26. That of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> you have in the 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe you may be partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi> And the <hi>Life of God, Eph.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Being alienated from the life of God,</hi> that is, from his grace. And the <hi>Glory of God, Rom.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>For all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God.</hi> The work of grace in mens ſouls, hath that excellency in it, that there is more of God to be ſeen in it, then in all the works that ever God did make from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, not onely if you take one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle work (onely excepting the hypoſtatical Union of the humane nature of Chriſt) but take all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that God hath made in heaven and earth, they have not ſo much of the glory of God to be ſeen in them, as there is to be ſeen in the work of grace; ſo that take the pooreſt, meaneſt Chriſtian, that hath the work of grace, though parts be never ſo weak, and outwardly he be never ſo contemptible, there is more to be ſeen in this poor man or woman, then in the whole frame of Heaven and earth, then in the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> then in all the creatures of the world beſides, except <hi>Angels;</hi> and therefore ſurely outward meanneſs can never take down the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57146:112"/>
eſteem that a gracious heart hath of Gods people; Yea, it is the greateſt excellency that ever God did beſtow upon, or will beſtow upon any for the kinde, if it were grown up to the greateſt degree, ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that hypoſtatical Union of the Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt with the Divine, and therefore muſt needs gain a precious eſteem.</p>
                  <p>It is a <hi>principle</hi> of eternal happineſs, it is that which will grow up to an eternal glory: Take all moral and natural excellencies, let them grow up to the higheſt height they can, they can never grow up to glory; but this is that eternal ſeed, if it be let to grow up, it wil grow up to the height of glory: Now if <hi>Grace</hi> be thus, if it be that principle whereby a creature is raiſed to ſuch a high condition, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel though thoſe that have a ſpiritual eye, and can ſee into the things of God, and judge ſpiritually of things, muſt needs eſteem thoſe very precious and honorable, that have the work of grace upon them. Moral excellencies have been highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Heathens; as the <hi>Fabii</hi> and <hi>Fabritii,</hi> that were taken from their dinner and ſupper of Turnips, to rule and govern great armies, becauſe they ſaw ſuch great excellencies under their mean outſides: If ſo be the knowledge of moral excellencies can raiſe the eſteem of men in the world, much more then the true and glorious excellencies of grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of the relation they have to God: Gods people have a near relation to God; the nearer <note place="margin">2.</note> relation one hath to great ones, the more high he is in the eſteem of men; now Gods people though never <note place="margin">The ſaints near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God.</note> ſo mean, have a wonderful near relation to God; for,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they are the choſen of God, they are thoſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57146:113"/>
which the Lord in his eternal counſels, hath ſet apart for himſelf; the counſels of God from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have wrought for their good; and this is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto a gracious heart, <hi>The Lord hath ſet apart a godly man for himſelf,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. They are thoſe that are the conſecrated ones of God; conſecrated and devoted things, though they were never ſo mean, were exceedingly eſteemed of; if it were but leather, or wood, or never ſo mean a thing that was in the tabernable, and conſecrated to God, it was highly eſteemed: Thoſe that are ſuperſtitious, if there be any thing they think is a holy relique, though never ſo mean, what a high eſteem they have of it?</p>
                  <p>It is reported of <hi>Apries,</hi> a King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who was of a baſe birth, for which ſome deſpiſed him; wherefore of a great Baſon of gold, in which he and his gueſts were wont to waſh their feet, he made an <hi>Image,</hi> and ſet it up in an eminent place in the City, and obſerving the ſuperſtitious devotions of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereunto, <hi>Now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>though the King be of mean birth,</hi> he <hi>is not to be reſpected the leſs:</hi> It is true, the Saints of God for their outwards are mean, but their conſecration puts glory upon them. I have read of the people of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> in the <hi>Iſle Zey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> who having an Apes tooth got from them, which was a conſecrated thing by them, they offered an incredible maſs of treaſure to recover it; and if ſo be a conſecrated thing, though ſo baſe in it ſelf, be ſo highly eſteemed for the conſecration ſake, how much more an immortal ſoul, that hath ſo many graces, as pearls ſet glittering in it, being conſecrated unto God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:57146:113"/>
Secondly, they are thoſe that are entred into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and therefore in nearer relation (then others) to God; therefore they are called <hi>The portion of God, The treaſure of God, The peculiar ones of God;</hi> they are thoſe that God ſatisfies himſelf in; what high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then ſuch expreſſions as theſe? They are thoſe that God hath ſet his heart upon, the beloved ones of God: They are the children of the high God; The ſpouſe of the ſon, that are married to the ſon; In ſome reſpect nearer then the Angels themſelves, for they are not in a myſtical Union ſo married to Chriſt, as Gods people are; and Gods people having ſuch rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God, as in theſe &amp; many other reſpects might be named, they are worthy of honorable eſteem.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for priviledges; they are thoſe that are <note place="margin">3.</note> freed from the evil of ſin, the evil of puniſhment. <note place="margin">The ſaints Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</note> They are thoſe that have whatſoever is in God to be theirs, working for their good: All the Attributes of God, and the ways of God in his Providence: If there be any thing in God to make a man happy, it is theirs. And all the good that is ſpoken of in the Word, all the glorious promiſes are theirs: And all that is in the world is theirs, the world continues for their ſakes; ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>All is yours, for you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> It is a great argument to ſhew Gods greatneſs, that all the creatures in the world are his, and for him; what an argument then is it, to ſhew the greatneſs of a Chriſtian, that Heaven, and Earth, and Chriſt, and God, and all are his, and for him? They have free acceſs to the Throne of grace, and welcom too: They have that priviledge, to come and put their hands into Gods treaſure, and take what they
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57146:114"/>
will, God gives them the key, giving them the ſpirit of prayer, he gives them the key of his ſpiritual trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: They are the heirs of Heaven and eternal life; yea, and the heirs of the world too, for being the children of God, they inherit their Fathers riches; now <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to be the heir of <note place="margin">4.</note> the world. <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, conſider the precious things that come from them: as there are more excellencies in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then in all creatures in heaven and earth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Angels; ſo in every gracious action that comes from them, there is the greateſt excellency the world hath. <hi>Luther</hi> hath many high and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent expreſſions of the worth of the acts of <hi>grace,</hi> whereby he ſhews, though he was a mighty advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſo he was no enemy to <hi>good works: No man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>can commend good works magnificently enough; for one work of a Chriſtian, is more prcious then heaven and earth, and therefore all the world in this life, cannot ſufficiently reward one good work.</hi> And in another place, <hi>If I might have my deſire, I would rather chooſe the meaneſt work of a Country Chriſtian, or poor Maid, then all the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Triumphs of</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great, and of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar. And again, <hi>Whatſoever the Saints do, though never ſo ſmall and mean,</hi> it is great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, <hi>becauſe they do all in faith, and by the word.</hi> And yet further, <hi>Let our works be ſmall, ſervile, womaniſh, yet let this title be added,</hi> The Word of the Lord, <hi>and</hi>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:57146:114"/>
                     <hi>they are all glorious, ſuch as ſhall remain eternally.</hi> Surely they are precious, from whom ſuch precious things do come; it is a precious fountain, that ſends forth ſuch precious ſtreams: Theſe the Saints of God ſend forth plentifully, the excellency of them a ſpiritual eye ſees, and therefore muſt needs ſee thoſe to be the excellent of the earth, from whence theſe come.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the great uſe that they are of in the world; <note place="margin">5.</note> What uſe is a poor man or woman of, that lives in a poor ſmoak-hole, that no man regards? Yes, many ways; theſe are the onely uſeful people in the world, they are they from whom God hath all his glory in the world, God attains his end of making the world by them; were it not for a company of poor contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">The <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world.</note> people, what glory ſhould God have in the world? Now for men to be the onely people from whom God hath his glory in the world, is to be of great uſe: They are they that are the <hi>ſalt</hi> of the earth, and the <hi>light</hi> of the world; though by ſome that be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied onely to thoſe Diſciples and Miniſters, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is to be applied to any Diſciples of Chriſt: They are they that hold forth the light of the glory of God; the world would be as a dungeon of diſmal darkneſs, were it not for them: They are they that can <hi>prevail with God</hi> for mighty things, as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> he prevailed with God as a <hi>Prince:</hi> They are they that are employed about high and honorable things; none have ſuch glorious employments as Gods people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hiſtory tells us, that the very Camels that are uſed to go to <hi>Mahomets</hi> Tomb, are ever after of high eſteem amongſt them, ſo as they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57146:115"/>
after uſe them in any mean ſervile way as they did before: Though things be never ſo mean, yet by the <hi>uſe</hi> they become honorable; no uſe ſo honorable as that of the Saints, where this is ſeen with a diſcerning eye, they are exceeding honorable. They are the great bleſſing of the world: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19. 24. there is a promiſe that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be <hi>a bleſsing in the midſt of the Land.</hi> Gods people, whereſoever they are, are a bleſſing to that Country, a bleſſing to the world, howſoever deſpiſed of the world; put all theſe together, and ſurely they are precious.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, a ſpiritual eye looks upon Gods people as <note place="margin">6.</note> precious, notwithſtanding all outward meanneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it looks upon them as in their ends, though they are now incomparably above all that is in the world beſides, yet their glorious end raiſeth their worth exceeding high, and a ſpiritual eye looks much at the end and iſſue of things, and therefore looking <note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Gods people in regard of their <hi>ends.</hi>
                     </note> upon the Saints in regard of the iſſue of all, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but have a high eſteem of them. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man, to conceive the excellent things that God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. And now a <hi>ſpiritual eye</hi> can ſee theſe things, which a <hi>natural eye</hi> cannot, as if they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the glorious things that are to come, and the glorious condition that ſuch a one ſhall be in, a ſpiritual eye cannot but faſten upon ſuch a one, and bleſs him, as the bleſſed of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>We do uſe to look upon great heirs, that are appointed for great things, and ſhall have great poſſeſſions, with honorable reſpect, though now
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57146:115"/>
they be meanly clothed, in ruſſet cloth, or eating courſe bread, and playing with beggars children; ſo Gods ſervants, howſoever they are in the eſteem of the world, yet thoſe that know what they are to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, what they ſhall receive hereafter, cannot but look upon them as honorable: A ſpiritual eye ſees that that body that is now clothed ſo meanly, within a few years ſhall ſhine more bright then the Sun in the firmament, and that ſoul that is weak in parts and gifts, it ſees it as a veſſel that ſhall be filled to the brim with all the glory of God, and the Image of God to be made perfect, and to have perfect knowledge of God, and of the bleſſed Trinity, and the myſtery of the Goſpel, and all the great works of God: A ſpiritual eye can ſee within a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, when Chriſt ſhall come in his glory, he will own them before men and Angels, and tell men and Angels, <hi>Theſe are thoſe,</hi> for whom the eternal councels of my Father did work, and I was content to ſhed my blood for them; and all that was intended in the great work of Redemption, was for theſe: A ſpiritual eye can ſee, that within a while they ſhall be taken up with our Savior, to judge the whole world, to judge the Angels, with <hi>Crowns</hi> upon their heads, and <hi>palms</hi> in their hands, triumphing, aſcending up with Chriſt to ſee the Father, and to enjoy him ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly. And if theſe things be ſeen, as real and certain, they cannot but raiſe eſteem; there is ſo much in Gods people here, as not onely does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a gracious heart, but ſometimes will convince one that hath but natural principles of their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
                  <p>Some men and women, that do ſometime rail
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57146:116"/>
at Gods people, if we could ſee into their boſoms, do ſometimes bleſs them, and wiſh that their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were ſuch as theirs ſhall be: As <hi>Balaam</hi> wiſhed <hi>he might dye the death of the Righteous;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> though he was mean for outwards, yet <hi>Herod</hi> reverenced him, becauſe he ſaw ſome glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings of the excellency that was in him: And that is obſervable that we have of <hi>Joaſh</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 14. he was a wicked man, yet when he comes to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and ſees the Prophet <hi>was to dye,</hi> ſays he, <hi>O my Father, my Father, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of Iſrael, and the Horſemen thereof!</hi> this is the ſpeech of one that was ungodly, he had a reverend eſteem of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and it ſeems he walked ſo, as he gained mighty eſteem from wicked men; as in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 12. three <hi>Kings</hi> came down to the Prophet to ſpeak with him, they do not <hi>ſend</hi> for him; True it is, one of them was a good man, but the other two were wicked; it was indeed in the time of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, yet it was a mighty honor the Prophet had from them. It is reported of the Emperor <hi>Severus,</hi> when <hi>Origen</hi> came to him, he came very meanly cloathed, onely one garment; <hi>Severus</hi> ſent him a Chariot, and change of garments, to come in pomp to him, <hi>he refuſed to come in pomp;</hi> and yet when he ſaw the piety and gravity of the man, he was mightily convinced, and it gained much reſpect from him: The godly will gain reſpect from wicked men, much more from a gracious heart, that can judge as God judges, and ſee the ends of things.</p>

                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 1.</note> men of the world are ſuch, as in all their outward pomp and bravery, are baſe and wretched, and Gods people in all their baſeneſs and meanneſs, are precious and honorable: The wicked men are ſo vile, as all the glory that the world hath cannot make them bleſſed; and Gods people are ſo bleſſed, as that all the evil of the world cannot make them any way miſerable: If a man had his hearts deſire in all things that are here below, he may remain as a baſe curſed creature; but let him be gracious, and godly, and let him have all the miſery that can be put upon him in the world, he is one that God, and the Angels, and Saints look upon, as the glory of the earth.</p>
                  <p>That is very obſervable we have of <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 21. <hi>In his eſtate ſhall ſtand up a vile perſon,</hi> and yet he was the great <hi>King of Aſſyria.</hi> And <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports, the <hi>Samaritans</hi> wrote to him, becauſe he tormented the <hi>Jews,</hi> to excuſe themſelves that they were no <hi>Jews;</hi> and they writ, <hi>Antiochus the mighty God;</hi> and his name <hi>Epiphanes</hi> in Engliſh, does ſignifie <hi>one that is illuſtrious and famous above others:</hi> Though he was the great <hi>King of Aſſyria,</hi> and by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery was called the <hi>Mighty God,</hi> and by his name cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Illuſtrious &amp; famous above others,</hi> yet by the holy Ghoſt he is called <hi>a Vile perſon.</hi> But <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57146:117"/>
of Gods people, whom he ſhould do good unto, ſays, They are <hi>the excellent of the earth, in whom is my delight,</hi> Pſal. 16. the word ſignifies, <hi>the magnificent of the earth:</hi> The one is called <hi>The vile of the earth,</hi> in the Pſalm before, and the other called <hi>The magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent,</hi> in this Pſalm.</p>
                  <p>God hath made a ſeparation between the wicked and the godly, and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays in <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Thou haſt ſeparated between us and other people;</hi> the word that is tranſlated <hi>ſeparated,</hi> is, <hi>thou haſt wonderfully ſeparated between us and other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> ſo God hath wonderfully ſeparated between us and the world; that the one ſhould be ſo curſed, that all the good of the world cannot make them bleſſed; and the other ſo bleſſed, as all the evil of the world cannot make them miſerable. When <hi>Agrippa</hi> was ſo admired, that the people cryed, <hi>The voyce of God, and not of man,</hi> God gives an Angel au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to ſmite him, and <hi>he was eaten up with worms: John</hi> though he was mean in the world, the Holy Ghoſt calls him the greateſt that was born of a woman.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this rebukes thoſe that can ſee no excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency <note place="margin">2.</note> in thoſe that are godly, more then in others: and if they be afflicted, they look upon them, as the prey of the malice of wicked men, and a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible people, and paſs them by, and ſee nothing in them to be worthy of any reſpect. As it was ſaid of <hi>Herod,</hi> when Chriſt came to him, he thought to have ſeen miracles wrought by him; and becauſe he appeared as a mean man, <hi>Herod</hi> ſlighted him; and ſo men that judge according to the fleſh, if men be great in the world, or have ſuch a one to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57146:117"/>
be their friend, they like that well, but if he be rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and mean, they paſs him by, as not reſpecting of him. As <hi>Hoſpinian</hi> tells us of the dogs, that kept the Temple of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> If any came to the Temple with brave cloaths, they would let them alone, but if they came in ragged cloaths, they would tear them all in pieces: So men of the world, if they ſee men in good cloaths, and proſper outwardly, they are ſomebody; but for this godlineſs, and preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they have no skill in it, and therefore deſpiſe it, and look contemptibly upon it. So it was with the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> as long as the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> were proſperous outwardly, they would challenge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and affinity with them, but if they were in affliction, then they would fall off: but St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſo, for (ſays he) <hi>Henceforth know I no man after the fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a great ſign of a carnal heart, and oppoſite to the principle of grace, to look upon things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to outward excellency, and not to ſee a beauty in Gods people for want of outward excellency. Some things that are fooliſh, are onely weakneſs of reaſon: ſome things are oppoſite to the principles of reaſon, and where we ſee ſuch, we account thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals: ſo ſome things are infirmities, and argue weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of grace; but other things are quite contrary to the principles of grace, and amongſt thoſe I know none more evident then this, For people to judge of things according to outward excellency, and not to ſee the excellency of Gods people through outward meanes: this is an argument that the Goſpel is <hi>hid from thee,</hi> and ſo thou art a <hi>loſt creature:</hi> if the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Goſpel be <hi>hid,</hi> it is hid to thoſe that <hi>are loſt:</hi>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:57146:118"/>
It is true likewiſe of ſuch as profeſs the Goſpel, if the beauty of them be hid, it is hid to thoſe that are loſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if ſo that there is ſuch an excellency in Gods people, though under great afflictions it ſhould <note place="margin">3.</note> teach us all to manifeſt our reſpect to Gods people that are <hi>mean:</hi> It is a moſt vile thing, to <hi>have the faith of Chriſt in reſpect of perſons:</hi> ſays <hi>Tertullian, We do not judge of faith by perſons, but of perſons by</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Non ex perſonis fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, ſed ex fide perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.</note> 
                     <hi>faith:</hi> So do not look at men, to judge of them according to outwards, but look to the inwards of the ſoul, how they are cloathed within. What a ſhameful thing is it for thoſe that are Chriſtians, that know ſpiritual excellencies, to look upon thoſe that are gay, and brave outwardly? What do thoſe that are gay and brave attire themſelves for, but to have the eyes of men drawn after them? Let childrens eyes be drawn after them; but if they have rotten ſpirits, let them be ſo looked upon, notwithſtanding they be in gay cloaths: but for thoſe that are graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Jeſus Chriſt looks upon them as his glory; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23. The meſſengers of the Church, the glory of Chriſt; and therefore we ſhould glory in them much more.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle S. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks very bitterly to thoſe that he wrote unto, for having reſpect unto perſons, ſays he, <hi>Are ye not then partial in your ſelves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 4.</note> Do not your conſciences condemn you? Can this ſtand with grace? to have the faith of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in reſpect of perſons; <hi>Are you become judges of evil thoughts?</hi> thoſe evil thoughts of yours, in reſpecting thoſe that are in brave apparel; Are you
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57146:118"/>
judges of thoſe evil thoughts? that is, to judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them: Some render it thus; and are <hi>not judges</hi> of evil thoughts? And ſo the negative, that is joyned to <hi>partial,</hi> is to be applyed alſo, to become judges of evil thoughts: Have you ſuch evil thoughts as theſe, and do you not judge them to be evil? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there is ſo much evil in them, as it is to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that any ſhould have ſuch evil thoughts, and yet not judge them to be naught.</p>
                  <p>But how ſhould we manifeſt our reſpect to thoſe <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> that are outwardly mean, that are gracious?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, own them, and be not aſhamed of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> your braveſt kindred, for they are precious to <note place="margin">1.</note> God and Chriſt, and if you be aſhamed of them, you are aſhamed of Chriſt himſelf, and it is juſt Chriſt ſhould be aſhamed of you another day: Are they the glory of God, the treaſure of God, and the portion of God, and the peculiar ones of God, and ſhall you be aſhamed of them? O no, but thoſe whom God honors, let us honor; What rule can we have better for our honoring of men, then that honor that our God puts upon them? It is given as a ſpecial reaſon, why the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and a preſent to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> after he had been ſick, to teſtifie his reſpect to him, and to honor him, becauſe he had heard, how that miracle of the Suns going back was for him, as a ſign of his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; The Sun was the God whom the Babylonians worſhipped; now becauſe their God had honored <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſo much, the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> would ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him likewiſe. <hi>Abulenſis</hi> in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. God hath wrought great things for his Saints, whereby he hath put much honor upon them, he hath owned them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57146:119"/>
all the world, let us own them with honorable reſpect of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, bleſs God that you may have any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <note place="margin">2.</note> with them, to have the breathing of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <note place="margin">How to manifeſt our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to gracious perſons, that are outwardly mean.</note> in them; reioyce in their communion, and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and delight more in mourning with them in their afflictions, then in all the jollities of the world, then to be feaſting, then to enjoy all their delightful bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again, the more they are contemned in the world, and they ſuffer in the world, the more do you <note place="margin">3.</note> reſpect them, and own them; So long as Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſuffer nothing, but have outward proſperity as well as others, ſome will make of them; but if they ſee them in contempt, then they leave them, and look at them afar off: as it is with a mans Miniſtery, when a mans Miniſtery is approved of by ſome that are rich, and the aſſembly be filled with ſuch, they count ſuch a Miniſtery a credit to their Church; but if it be ſpiritual, ſo as it may be but few of them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, and ſo diſcountenanced by ſuch as thoſe are, then his Miniſtery is not regarded: and as in the eſteem of the Miniſtery, ſo in the eſteem of the ſaints; when they are eſteemed in the world, they will eſteem of them, but when the eſteem of the world is taken away, their eſteem is taken away.</p>
                  <p>As it is with the Deer that is hunted, when the Huntſman goes into the Park, he ſtirs up all, and all run together, but if one be ſhot, and they ſee the blood run down, they will all puſh him out of their company: ſo while Gods people go on, and are in credit, and eſteem with the world, others that are ſlight profeſſors of Religion will eſteem them, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57146:119"/>
they ſhall be welcom into their company, till they be ſhot, and they ſee diſgrace put upon them, <hi>then</hi> they look upon them with a lowry countenance. If a man be travelling, and there be a <hi>Sun-dial</hi> by the high-way, if the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhine, he will go out of his way to take notice of it, but if the Sun do not ſhine, he may go a hundred times by and never regard it; and ſo when the Sun ſhines upon Gods people, they are much made of, but if a cloudy day do come, and take away the Sunſhine, they are not eſteemed, and many people inſtead of helping them in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will adde to their affliction, and ſay, <hi>You needed not to have been ſo forward, and to have appeared ſo much; It was your want of wiſdom brought you into this trouble, and the like.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you had a gracious heart, if you ſaw one of Gods Servants go on in the way of God, and ſuffer in that way, though he had failed in ſome particulars, you would paſs them by, and not be ready to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to ſpeak againſt him for them: If a man do plead for the <hi>King,</hi> every circumſtance is not taken up, and aggravated againſt him; and ſo for thoſe that are for God, every circumſtance ſhould not be aggravated againſt them: It is better for one to be forward in Gods cauſe, though he ſhould fail in ſome circumſtances, then to be lukewarm. If a man be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earneſtly, and do fall forward, there is not ſo much danger in that, as to fall backward: ſo a man that is forward in that which is good, though he may carry ſome things indiſcreerly, and ſuffer ſomewhat that way, yet his fall is but forward, and there is not ſo much danger in that, as in a time-ſerver, and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate that falls backward, he may break his neck. And
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57146:120"/>
therefore we ſhould not aggravate the afflictions of the Saints, if they be right in the main, we ſhould countenance them, and appear for them, though we venture ſomething, as <hi>Moſes</hi> here, he might have ſaved himſelf, and yet he had ſuch a high eſteem of Gods people, as he would venture all for them: but of this in the next Point.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If God does move the hearts of any, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to eſteem of his people, though afflicted out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, <note place="margin">3.</note> hearken to a word of encouragement, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thou art bleſſed of God: It is a note of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſtrong eye-ſight that thou haſt, that thou canſt ſee Spiritual excellency, through outward meanneſs: there is more skill in being able to ſee the preciouſneſs of a thing, then to ſee the glory and luſtre of it; that which is not true pearl, may have as much luſtre as the true, but the skill of the Lapidary is to know, that is not precious, but the other, although it be fullied with dirt. It is a note of ſincerity of grace, that thou loveſt grace for grace: It is a note of the power of grace, that thou canſt paſs by that which is a ſtumbling to ſo many. Certainly God will know thy ſoul in adverſity, and will look through all thy infirmities upon thee, that canſt look with an honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able eſteem upon his people through all afflictions: And in that time when thou ſuſpecteſt the work of grace in thee, this may be one argument to uphold thee, though thou canſt not diſcern the work of grace in thine own heart, yet thou canſt prize it in another; it is an argument it is in thy ſoul, though now thou canſt not ſee it; though people want other notes, yet this many have.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, You that are the Servants of God, and <note place="margin">4.</note>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:57146:120"/>
God hath ſo ordered it, as you are mean in the world, mean in your parts and eſtates, and mean in regard of your friends, be not diſcouraged, do not think, <hi>I am a poor contemptible man or woman, no body looks at me, or regards me;</hi> God hath a high eſteem of you, the Angels have a high eſteem of you, the Saints have a high eſteem of you, and therefore be not diſcouraged. As you have it in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 56. 3, 4. <hi>Let not the Eunuch ſay, I am a dry tree,</hi> for if he will take hold of my name, and keep my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>I will give him an everlaſting name, better then of ſons and daughters:</hi> Many, becauſe they are outwardly mean, do go on diſcouraged, and ſay of themſelves, <hi>We are dry trees:</hi> If thou didſt but ſee the thoughts of Gods people, and ſee the thoughts of wicked men, as if thou couldſt but unfold the conſciences of wicked men, they do reverence thee, and wiſh they were in thy condition, if they were to dye; though you have not that reſpect from the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which they ſeem to ſhew to others, that they have more uſe of, and are more ſerviceable to them to do their buſineſs, and ſo there is a ſhew of more outward familiarity, yet do not think but that you are more highly eſteemed then they are.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe no man ſhould regard you, it is enough that God does regard you; It is a notable ſpeech of <hi>Salvian, Such as are truly bleſſed in their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, cannot be miſerable by the falſe judgements of other men:</hi> But I ſay, though that were enough, yet you have more, you have God, and his Angels, and Saints, and the conſciences of wicked men, though we ſhould not regard the eſteem of the men of the world, but go on in our way, onely be careful that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57146:121"/>
they may not ſpeak ill of our Religion; but the eſteem of the Saints is not ſlightly to be eſteemed, for it is a bleſſing of God, and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> was earneſt with the <hi>Romans</hi> to pray to God for him, <hi>that his ſervice might be accepted of by the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, for one to be in ſuch a condition, as thoſe that are godly, wiſe, and humble, ſhall call their eſtates into queſtion, and be ſuſpitious of them, ſuch need look to themſelves: many that are truly godly, may be very guilty of cenſuring, and ſo do much wrong, both to thoſe that are godly, and to Religion; but take thoſe that are wiſe, and humble, and I ſay, if ſuch ſhould be jealous of me, I ſhould have great cauſe to be ſuſpitious of my ſelf; for ſuch have the Spirit of God, and do know the things of God, <hi>A ſpiritual man judgeth all things,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould make good uſe of their opinions of us; If they be afraid of us, we ſhould fear our ſelves, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſays, <hi>There is no peace to the wicked, ſays my God;</hi> that God that my ſoul hath intereſt in, ſays, <hi>there is no peace to the wicked;</hi> So when thoſe that have intereſt in God, ſhall ſay to a man, there is no peace to thee, it ſhould make his heart quake. Gods people ought ſo to walk, as to gain reſpect from the conſciences of men; Do you ſo walk as to gain any ſuch honorable reſpect? Is there not cauſe of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? In the name of Jeſus Chriſt I beſeech you, let it be your care ſo to walk, with ſuch heavenly humble ſpirits, as to hold forth the beauty of godlineſs unto others, and to force reſpect from them. As it is ſaid of God, <hi>Holy and reverend is his name;</hi> How does Gods name come to be <hi>reverend,</hi> but by being <hi>holy?</hi> ſo it may be ſaid of Gods people, <hi>Holy and reverend</hi>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:57146:121"/>
                     <hi>are</hi> their <hi>names;</hi> if they be <hi>holy,</hi> their names are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend,</hi> they will gain reverence from thoſe that are godly, and will force it from the baſeſt wretches: and therefore you that would have honor, and a name, here is a way; you would be the fineſt in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and you think to get a name that way, you ſeek to get riches, and ſo to get a name; this is not the way, this does not cover the filth of ſin, this cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is narrower then that you can wrap your ſelf in, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 26. but if you would get a name indeed, be godly, and gracious, and holy, and then you ſhall have the teſtimony of the conſciences of men, and that is more then all their words, for there may be flattery in their words.</p>
                  <p>Many Miniſters think if they ſhould be poor and mean, every one would contemn their Miniſtery, and therefore they think the way to have their Miniſtery reſpected, is to get great livings; this certainly is a falſe way: A poor godly man that walks in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery faithfully, and conſcionably, will gain more reſpect, then others by all their great preferments. As it was the ſpeech of <hi>Boniface,</hi> that was a <hi>Martyr;</hi> one askt him, whether it was lawful to give the Wine in the Sacrament in a wooden cup; <hi>Time was,</hi> ſays he, <hi>when there were wooden Chalices, and golden Prieſts; but now there are golden Chalices, and wooden Prieſts:</hi> This was the way of <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> for to have outward bravery, and thought to gain mens devotion that way; but when there were <hi>wooden Chalices,</hi> when things were carryed meanly, that did not take away the dignity of the Miniſtery, but by the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their lives, they were eſteemed of the more, and the <hi>Ordinances</hi> were not accounted the worſe
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57146:122"/>
by the outward ſimplicity of them, but the better. Let us that are acquainted with any thing of the minde of God, know that there are better things to gain reſpect to Religion, and to our ſelves by, then all the outward things; be not afraid therefore of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, be godly, and let ſufferings be never ſo much, and your name will be precious. <hi>Thoſe who wandred up and down in ſheep-skins, and goat-skins,</hi> Heb. 11. yet <hi>obtained a good report by faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if a gracious eye can ſee ſo much excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Saints, in outward meanneſs, how much more ſhall they ſee when they come to their glory, when all the treaſures of Heaven ſhall come to be opened, and all the good of Heaven let out to them, when they ſhall be wholly free from ſin, when the robes ſhall be brought out, and the glorious garments, and they ſhal walk with Chriſt in white? If they be ſo glorious when they are on the dunghil, what ſhall they be when they are in their Kingdom, when the Bride ſhall come trimmed, when there ſhall be a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs to that Bridegroom Jeſus Chriſt; and God, and all the Angels ſhall come to ſolemnize the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage? There ſhall be a time here, when wicked men <hi>ſhall take hold upon the skirt of a Iew,</hi> and ſay, <hi>I will go with you, for I have heard God is with you:</hi> How much more afterwards will the great ones and mighty ones of the earth be ready to catch hold upon the Saints, and ſay, <hi>O that we might go with you, though it were but to attend upon you?</hi> This is the day of viſitation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. in which they ſhall glorifie God.</p>
                  <p>There are three days of viſitation, and in all thoſe days of viſitation men ſhall glorifie God in the behalf of Gods people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:57146:122"/>
Firſt, When the time ſhall come that God ſhall viſit their ſouls, and work any good upon their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the time of affliction, when they are upon their ſick-beds: though in proſperity they contemn you, and ſpeak evil of you, yet in the day that God ſhall viſit them, and lay his hand upon them, then they ſhall ſay, This is the onely people that live upon the earth, and ſend for ſuch a one.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they ſhall glorifie God in the Day of Judgement, when they ſhall ſee the glory of theſe, and they ſhall ſay, Theſe are thoſe we deſpiſed, and called Hypocrites, now we ſee they are no Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites: as thoſe fooliſh Virgins that wanted oyl, when the Bridegroom came, then they asked oyl of the wiſe Virgins; it may be before they would not acknowledge it was oyl, it was water with them before, but now it is oyl: ſo now they ſhall ſee they were godly, and not hypocrites, and they were not notions that they heard of, but realities. And thus much of the excellency that a gracious heart does ſee in thoſe that are godly, though never ſo mean and afflicted outwardly. The fifth Point is,</p>

The Point is of great uſe in theſe times, wherein God calls for ſo much appearing in his cauſe, for his people; but generally men ſeek a ſafe way to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as they think, to keep their Religion within, and not to venture themſelves, by appearing what they are; and if any ſhall be ſo forward, to appear outwardly what they are inwardly, theſe are deſerted. St. <hi>Pauls</hi> complaint, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. and <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 16. may juſtly be the complaint of many of Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in our times; <hi>Thou knoweſt that all they which are in Aſia be turned away from me, of whom are Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellus, and Hermogenes: At my firſt anſwer no man ſtood with me, but all men for ſook me.</hi> This is no new thing in the world, every age affords many examples in this kinde, and ours excels; but certainly, it is the duty of all who would approve themſelves to God, to be willing to appear with, and for the Saints in their troubles.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Saints are dear to God, therefore God <note place="margin">Why we ſhould <hi>own</hi> the Saints in their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</note> will certainly take it well at the hands of ſuch as ſhall joyn with them in their affliction, and appear for them: if any ſhould ſee your childe in affliction, and danger, and hazard himſelf in joyning with your
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57146:123"/>
childe, in his affliction, and danger, you would take it well at his hands.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they hold out the honor of God in the <note place="margin">2.</note> world, in their ſufferings, they are Gods witneſſes; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 44. 8. <hi>They ſtand for God;</hi> in appearing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for them, and their cauſe, ye appear for God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: the cauſe is yours as well as theirs, if God be yours.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they need encouragement, eſpecially in <note place="margin">3.</note> the time of their affliction; the beſt have fleſh and blood, and if they be deſerted in their cauſe, much advantage is given to temptation; <hi>Wo to him that is alone:</hi> If any ſhould fail, if any ſhould miſcarry through your deſerting, or not coming in and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, it will prove a ſore and a fearful evil againſt you. If any of Gods ſervants in affliction ſhall go to God, and make their means to him, and in the grief of their ſouls tell him, how you have left them, how they are alone in ſo great a cauſe, whereas ſuch and ſuch might have afforded much help and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; ſurely this will witneſs fearfully againſt you, and it will go ill with you; Certainly you bring much guilt upon your ſouls, in deſerting the Saints in the time of their affliction: Hence <hi>Paul</hi> prayed, that <hi>God would not lay to the charge of thoſe in Aſia that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>left him in his firſt anſwer.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ad aras Jovis, aut Veneris a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorare, ac ſub Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſto fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem occul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Zuingl. ep. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, not appearing, is a betraying the truth: It is a ſpeech of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> in his third <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle;</hi> We may as well with <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> worſhip at the Altar of <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Venus,</hi> as hide our faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Antichriſt: He that is not with me, is againſt me,</hi> ſays <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Chriſt appears moſt for his people in their <note place="margin">5.</note>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:57146:124"/>
afflictions, when they are at the loweſt; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 63. 9. <hi>In</hi> their <hi>affliction</hi> he <hi>was afflicted, the Angel of his preſence was then with them, his love and his pity was towards them, he bare them, and carried them:</hi> Pſal. 69. 9. <hi>The Zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me up, the reproaches of them that reproached thee, are faln up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me.</hi> You know the place is ſpoken of Chriſt, and theſe words were ſpoken when the Church was in a very ill caſe, as appears in the <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, times of affliction are the eſpecial times <note place="margin">6.</note> to manifeſt our true love to the Saints, which are near to us in many bonds. It is an ill part of a wife or friend, to forſake husband or friend when in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports of <hi>Herodias,</hi> wife to <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Tetrarch,</hi> who when the <hi>Emperor</hi> had deprived her husband of his <hi>Tetrarchy,</hi> and baniſhed him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing his <hi>Tetrarchy</hi> to <hi>Agrippa</hi> his kingdom, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that <hi>Herodias</hi> was <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s ſiſter, the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> gave her her husbands ſubſtance, ſuppoſing that ſhe would not accompany her husband; but ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the <hi>Emperor,</hi> There is a cauſe that hinders me from partaking the benefit of your bounty, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I bear to my husband, whom if I ſhould forſake in this his miſery, it would very ill beſeem me, in that I have been a partner with him in his felicity: the <hi>Emperor</hi> diſpleaſed with her anſwer, baniſhed her likewiſe with her husband: a <hi>brother,</hi> a <hi>friend,</hi> a <hi>wife,</hi> is for the time of adverſity.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially hence it is recorded of <hi>Davids</hi> brethren, and fathers houſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 1. When <hi>David</hi> was perſecuted, and came to the Cave of <hi>Adullam,</hi> when they heard it, they went down thither to him; they ventured the diſpleaſure, the rage of <hi>Saul,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57146:124"/>
all their eſtates, to go down to <hi>David</hi> their brother, both his <hi>father</hi> and <hi>mother</hi> was there, though very old now, as appears <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Baſils</hi> forwardneſs <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chryſ. l.</hi> 2. <hi>de Sacerd.</hi>
                     </note> in appearing for his friend in danger, mightily affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Chryſoſtom:</hi> he tells of him, that he hazarded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much, to deliver his friend in danger, and being blamed by ſome for venturing ſo much, he gave this anſwer, <hi>I have not learned to love otherwiſe, I know</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ego aliter amare non didici.</note> 
                     <hi>not how to manifeſt my love but thus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, when Gods people ſuffer moſt in Gods cauſe, it is then moſt honorable to be called forth to <note place="margin">7.</note> appear for it, to aſſiſt in it. Amongſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the left hand is accounted the moſt honorable. <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> reports of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that thoſe whom he honored moſt, he placed at his <hi>left hand,</hi> upon this ground, becauſe that hand was weakeſt, and moſt ſubject to danger; the moſt honorable of the kingdom were ſet to defend, where there was moſt weakneſs and moſt danger: If the people of God be brought low, if they be brought under by affliction, if the cauſe of God in them ſeem to be in danger, then to come in and appear, to ſtand by them, and for them, this is honorable.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, this appearing for the Saints, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them in their affliction, ſhall be highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded <note place="margin">8.</note> of God. When <hi>David</hi> was in his affliction, perſecuted by <hi>Saul, Abiathar fled to him with the Ephod, and abode with him;</hi> Although ſelf-reſpects might move him, <hi>Saul</hi> having ſlain his father, and fourſcore and four prieſts of the Lord, and if he had not eſcaped, he had gone to it too; yet becauſe he was with <hi>David</hi> in his affliction, mark how <hi>Solomon</hi> reſpects him for it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 26. <hi>Thou art worthy</hi>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:57146:125"/>
                     <hi>of death, but I will not put thee to death, but go to Anathoth, to thine own fields, becauſe thou bareſt the Ark of the Lord God before my father David, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that being bound with chains, and ſent to priſon by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> for wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Caius</hi> in the Empire; one <hi>Thaumaſtus</hi> one of <hi>Caius</hi> his Servants carrying a pitcher of water, met him, and <hi>Agrippa</hi> being very thirſty, deſired him to give him drink, which he willingly did; upon which <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſaid, <hi>This ſervice thou haſt done in giving me drink, ſhall do thee good another day:</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when <hi>Caius</hi> was Emperor, and <hi>Agrippa</hi> was made King; he firſt begged <hi>Thaumaſtus</hi> his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joſeph. Antiq. l.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> of the Emperor, and made him a free man, then he made him his chief Officer over all his affairs, and after his deceaſe, he took order he ſhould continue in the ſame office with his ſon. This <hi>Agrippa</hi> was a wicked man, who thus rewarded him that relieved him in his affliction: it was the ſame <hi>Agrippa</hi> whom the Angel ſmote, and was eaten up of worms, becauſe he gave not glory unto God: How much more then will Chriſt reward thoſe, who ſhall give him in his members, cups of water in their affliction, yea, who ſhall ſo joyn with them, as to hazard themſelves for them? ſurely they ſhall not go without their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when Chriſt comes in his glory, he will own them. <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>

                  <p>Secondly, appear for them, by viſiting them in their <note place="margin">2.</note> troubles; that is a ſpecial duty that Chriſt looks for <note place="margin">

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57146:126"/>
with many threatnings, terrors, and it was great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we muſt be ready and willing to entertain ſuch as ſuffer. <note place="margin">3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we muſt uſe all the intereſt we have in any friends, improve all opportunities for the relief of <note place="margin">4.</note> ſuch as ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theodoret</hi> tells a famous ſtory of one <hi>Terentius,</hi> a Captain in the Emperor <hi>Valens</hi> his Army, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Theod. l.</hi> 4. <hi>biſt. eccl. c.</hi> 32.</note> from <hi>Armenia</hi> with a great Victory, the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> bade him ask what reward he would; he onely asked as a recompence of all his Service, that there might be granted a Church to the Orthodox in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> that they might freely meet in publique: this he knew could not but be exceeding diſpleaſing to <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperor, becauſe he was an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and ſo it proved, for the Emperor tore his Petition, and bade him ask ſomething elſe; but <hi>Terentius</hi> gathered up the torn pieces of the Paper, and ſaid, <hi>This I ask as a reward of my Service, and I will ask nothing elſe.</hi> How few wil now improve ſuch intereſt in great ones, ſuch opportunities for the relieving the perſecuted Servants of God?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, we muſt improve all our <hi>gifts, parts, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> for them, in pleading for them: Thus in the <note place="margin">5.</note> Primitive times, God ſtirred up many of great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of excellent parts, to plead for the perſecuted Chriſtians, who did much ſervice this way: as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Martyr,</hi> in his Apologies; and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and one <hi>Ariſtides</hi> an <hi>Athenian Phyloſopher,</hi> a man admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably learned and eloquent, becauſe the Emperor then was much delighted in learning, he made uſe of his eloquence and learning, for Chriſt and his Saints,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57146:126"/>
making eloquent Orations before the Emperor for them: and another <hi>Quadratus Athenienſis,</hi> when <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Euſeb. l.</hi> 4 <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>Cent. Magd. Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Adrian</hi> came to <hi>Athens,</hi> he preſented a Book to him, pleading for Chriſtian Religion; God bleſſed the endeavors of theſe much, for the mollifying the Emperors heart towards the Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, we muſt be willing to ſuffer with them; <note place="margin">6.</note> we muſt be willing to lay down our lives for the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, much more ſuffer with the brethren: we muſt be willing to have fellowſhip with them, not onely in their priviledges, but in their ſufferings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>I John who alſo am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the Kingdom and patience of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> many are willing to be brethren, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the kingdom, but not in tribulation, and in the patience of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 33. it was the commendations of thoſe Chriſtians mentioned there, that they were companions of thoſe that were ill uſed for the cauſe of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore for application, let us know our duty, <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> and ſhew our ſelves more ready and forward to joyn with, and ſhew our ſelves to the ſervants of God in their perſecuted eſtate; in the times of their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity there is not ſo much need we ſhould manifeſt our ſelves to be for them; this is the time wherein we are called, eſpecially to manifeſt our love to them, our ſiding with them; The greater their affliction is, the more we muſt appear for them: When the people of God were in a comfortable eſtate in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as they were in <hi>Joſephs</hi> time, <hi>Joſeph</hi> did not leave the Court to joyn with them, but when they were in an afflicted eſtate, as in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, <hi>Moſes</hi> left all to joyn with them; here you have a tryal upon what ſide you
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57146:127"/>
will be, now you have an opportunity to witneſs for God.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe words, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11. 12. <hi>Judah ruleth with God,</hi> the old Latine hath it, <hi>Teſtis deſcendit cum Deo, He deſcends a witneſs with God,</hi> and ſo the words will bear, if the pricks be altered, which may be, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of many put in, in latter times; <hi>Ribera</hi> maintains this reading, and hath two good notes upon it:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Others leave the true worſhip of God, but <hi>Iudah continues,</hi> and ſo witneſſes to his truth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He deſcends,</hi> he is content to be in a lower condition; though he be fewer, and not ſo flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet if he may be Gods witneſs, he is content. Thus ſhould we be willing to deſcend to witneſs for the truth, to leave the flouriſhing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the world, and to joyn with the loweſt and meaneſt.</p>
                  <p>Ordinarily men deal with the ſuffering ſervants of God, as <hi>Demas</hi> dealt with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they forſake him, <hi>embracing this preſent world;</hi> but if you finde any inclination of heart that way, conceive as if Chriſt were now ſpeaking to you, <hi>Will</hi> you <hi>alſo forſake me?</hi> Take heed of flattering your ſelves, of putting off this duty with any vain pleas, or pretences, or excuſes; God ſees what lies at the bottom. We read <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. divers of the <hi>Tribes</hi> are blamed, for not coming in to help to joyn with <hi>Barak</hi> and <hi>Deborah;</hi> and in their rebuke, their excuſes are mentioned, as ſome were to <hi>follow their buſineſs at ſea,</hi> they could not come: and eſpecially <hi>Aſher,</hi> he was to ſtand in his own breaches <hi>to defend himſelf, ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Reuben</hi> muſt follow his buſineſs, <hi>and look to his ſheep,</hi> he could not come,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57146:127"/>
                     <hi>ver.</hi> 16. yet theſe are rebuked, but <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Nepthali</hi> are commended for a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death, they are honored for this. The people of God were now in a low condition, in great affliction, and no excuſe could ſerve turn, for their not joyning with their brethren; whatſoever neceſſities, inabilities we may pretend, that keep us from appearing in the behalf of, and joyning with Gods people in their afflicted eſtate, it will not bear us out before the Lord; In times of ſtorm, all ſhould come in and help. The two <hi>Tribes</hi> and the half <hi>on the other ſide Iordan,</hi> muſt not think to abide peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in their poſſeſſions, while their brethren were warring for theirs, but they muſt joyn with them in their battels, until they were in their poſſeſſions like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>It is a ſore and great evil, not to joyn with Gods ſervants in their troubles; but how great an evil then is it, to adde affliction to their affliction, to joyn with their enemies againſt them, eſpecially when they are weak in their ſuffering condition? Gods wrath againſt <hi>Amalek</hi> was, becauſe he came out againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs, and not onely ſo, but ſmote the hindmoſt of them, even all that were feeble behinde them, when they were faint and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 18. Now you ſhall finde that the wrath of God was never ſo dreadful againſt any, as againſt the <hi>Amalekites:</hi> for,</p>

                  <p>Firſt, This wickedneſs of <hi>Amalek,</hi> and his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, muſt be <hi>wrote for a memorial in a book,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed in the ears of <hi>Ioſhua.</hi>

Secondly, God will utterly put out <hi>the remembrance of Amalek from under Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Lord ſwears that he will <hi>have war with Amalek, from generation to generation;</hi> all theſe <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 14, 16.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Gods anger for <hi>many years after continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt Amalek.</hi> Numb. 24. 20. <hi>His latter end ſhall be, that he periſh for ever:</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 19. <hi>Moſes</hi> gives a charge, that after <hi>Iſrael</hi> was poſſeſſed of his inheritance, that he muſt blot out the remembrance of <hi>Amalek</hi> from under Heaven, <hi>Thou ſhalt not forget it.</hi> And further, although at the <hi>firſt,</hi> when <hi>Amalek</hi> came againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there was a great ſlaughter of them, yet more then four hundred years after, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 2. God ſays, <hi>He remembred what Amalek did to Iſrael,</hi> and gave a charge to <hi>Saul</hi> to go and ſmite them, <hi>and utterly to deſtroy all they had,</hi> not to ſpare, but to ſlay <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman, Infant, Suckling, Ox, Sheep, Camel,</hi> and <hi>Aſs;</hi> and it is obſervable, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in all other places that were not of <hi>Canaan,</hi> though they did ſmite the <hi>male,</hi> yet they were to ſpare the <hi>women,</hi> the little <hi>ones,</hi> and the <hi>cattel,</hi> and all that was in the City, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 14. but not ſo in <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek,</hi> yet <hi>Amalek</hi> was not of <hi>Canaan;</hi> God had a more ſpecial quarrel againſt <hi>Amalek,</hi> then againſt any of the other Countries: Yea, whereas in <hi>Canaan,</hi> although men and women were deſtroyed, as in <hi>Ai, Ioſh.</hi> 8. <hi>Yet the cattel, and the ſpoyl of the City they took to themſelves,</hi> ver. 27. but they might not do ſo in <hi>Amalek,</hi> the deſtroying the Cattel, and all there was in it, was for the greater horror, to ſhew what an abominable, and an accurſed thing <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:57146:128"/>
Yet further, although in <hi>Jericho</hi> they deſtroyed <hi>men, women,</hi> and <hi>cattel,</hi> and ſo it was more accurſed then <hi>Ai,</hi> for there the cattel were ſaved; yet in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo</hi> the <hi>gold, ſilver, braſs, iron,</hi> were conſecrated unto God, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 7. 19. but ſo it muſt not be in <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek,</hi> for that muſt be more accurſed then <hi>Iericho.</hi> And God was ſo ſtrongly ſet upon revenge of this people, that becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> ſpared <hi>Agag,</hi> and <hi>the fat of the cattel,</hi> though in pity, though under pretence of Sacrifice, <hi>the Lord therefore rejected him,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his ſin <hi>as rebellion and witchcraft,</hi> ſo as he would not have <hi>Samuel</hi> ſo much as mourn for him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 1. And when <hi>Agag</hi> was brought before <hi>Samuel,</hi> becauſe he was the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Amalekites, Samuel,</hi> though he were a loving ſweet natured man, yet he took a ſword, and himſelf <hi>hewed him in pieces before the Lord,</hi> being filled with Gods indignation againſt <hi>Amalek,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 33. And <hi>Pſalm</hi> 83. 7. <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Amalek</hi> is joyned together; God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces of the <hi>Ammonite,</hi> that to the tenth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>none of them ſhould enter into the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lord for ever;</hi> Why? <hi>Becauſe they met not Gods people in the way, with bread and water, when they came up out of Egypt,</hi> Deut. 23. 4. <hi>but hired Balaam to curſe them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God expects that his people in their afflicted eſtate ſhould be relieved, and not curſed; the curſe of the Lord will purſue thoſe, who deny help to them in this condition, eſpecially ſuch as ſeek to adde to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. What was the reaſon that <hi>Shimei</hi> muſt not go to his grave in peace? It was becauſe of his <hi>rayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> againſt <hi>David,</hi> when he was in his affliction; The Jews gave Chriſt <hi>gall and vinegar</hi> when he was upon
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57146:129"/>
the Croſs, this was a great aggravation of their ſin: take heed that you give not the ſervants of God <hi>gall</hi> and <hi>vinegar</hi> when they are upon, or under the croſs; God expects you ſhould bring oyl to their wounds, not pour brine in; many think they may ſafely tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon ſuch as are down; when the hedge is broken, when a gap begins to be made, every one treads it down lower and lower: but know, when the day of the recompences of <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall come, all the wrong done to Gods Servants, who were not able to reſiſt the malice of men, ſhall be recompenced to the full, eſpecially ſuch wrong as was done them in their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; God takes it ill that any ſhould once look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his people in the day of their affliction, except it <note place="margin">Obadiah 12. 13.</note> be to pity them, and to relieve them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I am very ſore diſpleaſed with the Heathen,</hi> ſays the Lord, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 15. Wherefore? <hi>They helped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the affliction;</hi> and mark it, it was that affliction that was upon Gods people, out of Gods diſpleaſure for their ſin: and does God take that ſo ill, that <hi>that</hi> affliction ſhould be helped forward? how ill then will he take it, how ſorely will he be diſpleaſed, when the affliction that his people ſuffer for his name, is helped forward? Let us take heed of any hand in ſuch an evil as this; but let us know that it is our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and will be great advantage to us, to appear for to be helpful, and comfortable unto the Servants of God in their ſufferings; to be <hi>Obadiahs, Ebedmelechs,</hi> to the Prophets of the Lord. <hi>Obadiah</hi> pleads this with the Prophet, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 13. <hi>Was it not told my Lord what I did?</hi> when he was afraid of danger, that thereby he might be delivered: And God bade <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> chap. 39. 16, 17. Go to <hi>Ebedmelech,</hi> and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57146:129"/>
tell him, <hi>Behold, I will bring evil upon this City, but I will deliver thee in that day, thou ſhalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We read likewiſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 6. of a merciful work of Gods providence towards the poſterity of ſuch, who had been kinde to his ſervants in the times of their trouble, namely the <hi>Kenites;</hi> when <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek</hi> was to be deſtroyed, <hi>Saul</hi> ſent to the <hi>Kenites</hi> to depart from among the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> leſt they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed with them: Why? <hi>For ye ſhewed kindeneſs to all the children of Iſrael, when they came up out of Egypt:</hi> Who were theſe <hi>Kenites?</hi> How long ſince was his kindeneſs ſhewed? What was this kindeneſs? For the <hi>firſt,</hi> The <hi>Kenites</hi> were the poſterity of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro, Moſes</hi> his <hi>Father in Law;</hi> this you may ſee, <hi>Judges</hi> 1. 16. For the ſecond, This kindeneſs was <hi>four hundred and twenty years</hi> before this time at the leaſt, for ſo long it was from the Children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> being then in the wilderneſs, and this time of <hi>Sauls</hi> reign. For the third, It is thought of ſome to be the kinde viſit of <hi>Iethro,</hi> viſiting his ſon in law, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs; and beſides, directing him in a way of government of the people, that he might not wear away himſelf, which was a great bleſſing to <hi>Iſrael</hi> at that time. And further, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired him to go with him to direct him in the way of the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> where they ſhould go; it is like he did it in part, but though he did not ſtay with him, but returned to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, yet it is probable that ſome of his children ſtaid, and went along with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and were helpful to them in their way: for <hi>Iudges</hi> 1. 16. <hi>The children of the</hi>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:57146:130"/>
                     <hi>Kenite,</hi> are ſaid to go up out <hi>of the city of palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees</hi> with the children of <hi>Iudah,</hi> now this is by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo,</hi> the firſt City the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> took in <hi>Cannan,</hi> as appears <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 3. therefore its like that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied <hi>Iſrael</hi> along in the wilderneſs, and ſo ſhewed kindeneſs unto them, which the Lord here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members. Ye who are willing to ſhew kindeneſs to Gods people in their affliction, know there is mercy laid up in ſtore for you, and your poſterity: that childe not yet born may many years hence have the bleſſing of this your love.</p>
                  <p>Let no vain objections therefore, no carnal reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings hinder you in this great and honorable ſervice of Chriſt, for appearing for, for defending of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the perſecuted, deſpiſed, afflicted Saints of God, be not aſhamed of them, look not ſhy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, deal not ruggedly with them, let your hearts and houſes be open to them, let their ſpirits be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, their bowels be refreſhed, their names vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, their cauſe maintained, their perſons honored, their ſorrows eaſed, their burthens lightened, by what you have, or can do, by your ſelves or others: If there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, if any hope, any deſire that Jeſus Chirſt ſhould know your ſouls in the day of your adverſity, fulfil this truth now opened before you, applyed unto you, this duty urged upon you.

                  <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>Enjoyment of communion with Gods people, is worth the enduring much affliction.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE are now come to the ſixth doctrinal <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 6.</note> Point that we have here in this part of <hi>Moſes choice,</hi> That the enioyment of communion with Gods people, is worth the enduring of a great deal of affliction. <hi>Moſes chooſes to ſuffer affliction with the people of God;</hi> he ſaw they were Gods people, and that it was a good thing to be with them, and therefore rather then he would not be with them, he was content to loſe all the honors of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs Court,</hi> and put himſelf under the ſoreſt affliction that he could meet withal, nothing ſhould hinder him from joyning with them.</p>
                  <p>In the worſt times of the Church, wherein the hardeſt things were to be ſuffered in joyning with Gods people, yet even then would thoſe who had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hearts chooſe to be with them upon the hardeſt terms, rather then to be from them with all outward eaſe, and carnal delight. It was a very ill time when there was a ſeparation between the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> and the reſt, when the ten <hi>Tribes</hi> left the Temple, left the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, and followed after <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> this was a very hard time, and the rather becauſe <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> ſet watchers, to obſerve who would go from him unto <hi>Judah</hi> to joyn with Gods people there, for
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57146:131"/>
there remained the true Church. And this is the meaning of that place, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Hear ye this O Prieſts, and hearken ye houſe of Iſrael, and give ye ear O houſe of the king, for judgement is towards you, becauſe you have been a ſnare on Mizpah, and a net ſpread upon Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor:</hi> Now theſe two places, were places that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Samaria,</hi> the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould go from them to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to joyn with Gods people there in the true worſhip of God, thoſe that were ſet at <hi>Mizpah</hi> and <hi>Tabor,</hi> would ſpy them, and ſo they were ready to be taken: This was the hard condition of Gods people then, and they did mightily ſcorn at thoſe that would go to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to joyn with them in that way of worſhip.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>Amaziah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Amos, (Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 12.) <hi>O thou Seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and propheſie there:</hi> as if <hi>Amaziah</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>Judah</hi> is a fitter place for you then this, you are ſo <hi>preciſe,</hi> and <hi>ſtrict,</hi> you had need be gone to <hi>Judah,</hi> we are Idolaters here, and no true Church but in <hi>Judah,</hi> ſuch as you are, had better be gone to <hi>Judah:</hi> And ſo it is uſual for thoſe that are carnal and prophane, to ſcorn at thoſe that are godly. Yet though things were ſo hard in theſe times, that there were watches and ſpies ſet to watch over them, and they did contemn thoſe that did look towards <hi>Judah,</hi> yet thoſe that were godly would not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but would go, and joyn with Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple notwithſtanding all this: and therefore you have it in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 16. what was the way of Gods ſervants in that time, when it was ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing to joyn with Gods people: <hi>All ſuch as ſet their hearts to ſeek the Lord God of Iſrael:</hi> there
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57146:131"/>
were a company of them that would ſtay in <hi>Samaria,</hi> that might have good wiſhes, that times were better, and things were better, but would not ſuffer any thing, to go and joyn with Gods people, where they might have the <hi>Ordinances</hi> in a pure maner; but all ſuch as ſet their hearts to ſeek the Lord, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved whatſoever came of it, they would have God in the purity of his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> they went up to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> And</p>
                  <p>So it was in the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> they were very hard times for Gods people, and the people of God, and Chriſtians were diſcovered by their meetings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if ſo be all of them would have ſeparated one from another, and kept their Religion to themſelves, they might not have been diſcovered, but though it were with hazard of their lives, they would joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and meet together; and therefore when any was converted, it is ſaid, they were added to the Church. And S. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 10. 25. lays a charge upon them, though it were at ſuch a time as they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded their lives, <hi>Not to forſake the aſſembly of the Saints, as the maner of ſome is.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in a Sermon upon that Text, <hi>Seek ye my face,</hi> interpreting it thus, <hi>The face of God is Gods Ordinances;</hi> as a man is known by his <hi>face,</hi> ſo God maketh himſelf known in his <hi>Ordinances;</hi> and ſo he urges that place, <hi>Seek my face,</hi> that all Chriſtians in conſcience are bound to go where Gods Ordinances may be enjoyed, if poſſibly they can: And he ſays further, It is better they ſhould ſcrape the ground with their nails, then to be any where elſe, where they ſhould not ioyn with Gods people in the ways of his Ordinances. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is a great bleſſing to be with them, though up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57146:132"/>
never ſuch hard terms in regard of afflictions.</p>
                  <p>That is obſervable that we read of <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſing his ſons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 28. it is ſaid, <hi>He bleſſed every one of them;</hi> How was that? for you ſhall finde he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeemed <hi>to curſe three of them, Reuben, Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi;</hi> he ſpeaks onely of evil to them; but becauſe they were not rejected, from being amongſt Gods people, although they were to be under great and ſore afflictions, yet they are ſaid to be <hi>bleſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, but why ſhould we ſuffer much affliction for <note place="margin">Quest.</note> the joyning with Gods people? What is there in them, or amongſt them, that makes joyning with them to be ſo deſireable?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that point we handled before, might be <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.</note> enough to ſhew the reaſon of this: they are <hi>the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of the earth, Iſaiah</hi> 43. 4. I do not now ſpeak of them particularly, though every Saint is honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but eſpecially they are honorable in a way of Church <hi>communion:</hi> Now we know it is a credit, and priviledge to have ſociety with thoſe that are honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Gods people are ſo, they are the glory of the world: as for others, God ſpeaks of them as dirt and droſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 118, 119. but now Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are called the glory of God himſelf, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 4. 5. now it is good being with ſuch as thoſe are. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ſaw but two of Gods ſervants together with Chriſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> ſays, <hi>It is good being here, let us make three Tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moſes, and one for Elias;</hi> he never thought of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it is good being here, though he ſhould lye in the field, and in the rain: and ſo ſays a gracious heart, It is good being here with Gods people, for they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57146:132"/>
are precious, whatſoever hardſhip we ſuffer amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is no ſuch comfortable commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <note place="margin">2.</note> in the world, as with Gods people. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, <note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Saints.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the very beholding of the ſhining of the graces of Gods Spirit in them; ſays Heathen <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, The very look of a good man delights me:</hi> What <note place="margin">1.</note> is the glory of God himſelf, but to ſee his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Ipſe aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus boni viri dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat.</note> ſhining in the world, in the works of creation, and providence? If God delights ſo much to ſee the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendency of that glory that ſhines in his works, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it muſt be a great delight to thoſe that have any work of grace, to ſee grace ſhining in others.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there is a bleſſed fragrancy of graces in <note place="margin">2.</note> Gods people: as the eye is ſatisfied in beholding the beauty of them, ſo the heart is ſatisfied in the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them; <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of ſpices;</hi> the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church is as the <hi>garden,</hi> and every particular Church, if it be as it ſhould be, is as a bed of ſpices, that gives forth a very fragrant ſmell. It is reported of <hi>Alexander,</hi> his body was of ſuch an exact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, that it gave a ſweet ſcent where it went: and ſo a Church is of ſo good a conſtitution, that it gives forth a wonderful ſweet fragrant ſmell to thoſe that have their right ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>Again, no ſuch comfort as in <hi>communion</hi> with Gods people, in regard of the nearneſs of their union one <note place="margin">3.</note> with another, their hearts joyn, and are one if they be truly ſpiritual: other ſocieties are but as the iron and the clay in the toes of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image, they may cleave together, but they will not incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57146:133"/>
one into another: The more ſpiritual any thing is, the more it does unite with that which is ſpiritual; ſpiritual things are more unitive then ſuch things as are bodily; as if you have a heap of ſtones, they do not joyn ſo cloſe together, but now a thouſand beams of the Sun will unite together in one point, becauſe they are ſpiritual things in compariſon: and this is the reaſon why there is ſuch a full union between God, and a ſpiritual heart, becauſe God is ſo ſpiritual, and the more ſpiritual the heart is, the more union; and ſo Chriſtians having grace, and grace being ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, the more grace, the more ſpiritual, and the more ſpiritual, the more union: and the reaſon why in Church-fellowſhip there is ſo little union, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo carnal, and therefore the Apoſtle ſays, the contentions that were in the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> were becauſe <hi>they were carnal.</hi> If you were more ſpiritual, there would not be ſuch diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you.</p>
                  <p>As it is in wicked communion, thoſe who are more ſpiritually wicked, (for there is a kinde of ſpiritual wickedneſs) they do more unite toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thoſe that are more fleſhly wicked, do not ſo cloſely unite, as your drunkards, and prophane fellows, though they call good fellows, yet upon every croſs word, they are ready to fall out: but others that are wicked in a malicious way againſt the godly, and wicked in a way of policy, to work to undermine the way of godlineſs, ſuch as thoſe joyn together a great deal more ſtrongly, then thoſe that joyn together in an outward fleſhly way; Now becauſe Gods people are ſpiritual in a gracious way, therefore they have ſuch near
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57146:133"/>
union, and union cauſes abundance of comfort. We read <hi>Exodus</hi> 26. of two ſorts of Curtains for the Tabernacle, the one, <hi>verſe</hi> 1. of fine twined linen, blew, purple and ſcarlet, and the tatches were of gold to couple them; the other were of goats hair, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. and the tatches to couple them were of braſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. Which may ſet forth the ſeveral ſorts of people in the Church; ſome are of a finer make then others, more ſpiritual, and the bonds of their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are golden, others are more courſe, and the bonds of their union are not ſo glorious; but this is a truth for ever, the more ſpiritual, the more union, the more pure the ſouls of men are, and of the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temper, the more cloſe, ſweet, excellent in their union.</p>
                  <p>Again, no ſuch comfort as with Gods people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſuitableneſs of that diſpoſition that is in <note place="margin">4.</note> their ſpirits, one with another, having but one ſpirit, and but one divine nature, led by the ſame principles, and rules, and have the ſame ends, and affections, hopes, and deſires, and joys: and where there is ſuch a ſuitableneſs, ſurely there muſt needs be a great deal of comfort, for all comforts come from a ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between the heart and the object; if the thing be never ſo good, if there be not a ſuitableneſs between the heart and it, there is no comfort; but no ſuch ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs as between Gods people, and therefore no ſuch comfort.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, no ſuch joy as is to be had in communion with them, becauſe of their entireneſs of love, entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <note place="margin">5.</note> of love is a lovely ſight. <hi>Dioniſius</hi> ſeeing two entire friends together, wiſhed himſelf the third. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>My Dove is but one,</hi> and it follows, <hi>the</hi>

                     <hi>daughters ſaw her, and bleſſed her;</hi> an oneneſs of heart is a bleſſed thing, no ſuch entireneſs, ſuch oneneſs any where as amongſt the Saints: their love is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and not upon baſe grounds, as the love of others is, there is not that baſe aiming at ſelf as in others: a carnal heart cannot love another, but in ſome baſe reſpect to himſelf; but now it is not ſelf that is the the ground of the love between thoſe that are truly gracious and godly, but God that is between them, and with them, the ground of their love is more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and therefore it is a kinde of divine love, and not ſo droſſie as others.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, no communion ſo comfortable in regard <note place="margin">6.</note> of their faithfulneſs, they dare truſt one another. <note place="margin">

Ser. in Luc. 10. 23.</note> They call themſelves brethren, and they will dye for another, ſays <hi>Tertullian:</hi> the men of the world cry out, <hi>Of all men I would not truſt thoſe that are ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe:</hi> Indeed, if you do take all refuſe that make profeſſion, you may ſay ſo, but a gracious heart can ſavor who is godly, and will not truſt every one that <hi>talks</hi> of Religion, but ſuch as are <hi>truly</hi> godly, they dare truſt them, and venture their lives with them: no communion in which we can eaſe our ſelves of our burthens, as where there are a company of true gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious humble Saints in communion one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that put theſe together, and you ſee the ſecond reaſon why it is worth the enduring ſo much affliction to have communion with the people of <note place="margin">3.</note> God. <note place="margin">Why it is worth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during of <hi>affliction</hi> to enjoy the <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of Saints.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is worth the enduring a great deal of affliction, to have communion with them; becauſe it is in their communion, in which the ſolemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God is ſet up; now it is worth the enduring
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:57146:134"/>
of a great deal, to be where that is. <hi>In Judah is God known, and his name is great in Iſrael:</hi> he hath honor by others, but his name is great in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in his <hi>Church;</hi> What a comfortable thing is it, and bleſſed, and worth the enduring of much, to have multitudes of Gods people joyn with one heart, in ſetting out the praiſes of God, ſitting at his Table, ſitting before him, lifting up the name of the great God, making his praiſe glorious: When the Saints are gathered together for this end, in this work, Chriſt is there preſent with them, praiſing God, he joyns with them in this work, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>In the midſt of the Church will I praiſe thee;</hi> this is ſpoken of Chriſt, it is quoted out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 22. which is prophetical of Chriſt: who would not be in ſuch acts of worſhip, to joyn with ſuch as Chriſt joyns with? If God be our God, and dear to our ſouls, his worſhip is dear to us; and if there be any people in the world, among whom God is truly worſhipped, it is a great affliction not to be with them.</p>
                  <p>It is the obſervation of one Interpreter upon that place in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. where the <hi>Cherubims</hi> cryed, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hoſts, the earth is full of thy glory:</hi> the Prophet cryes out, <hi>Wo unto me, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips, unfit to joyn with thoſe that are praiſing of God:</hi> howſoever the meaning of that place be, yet thus we may make uſe of it, to be a great affliction, and cauſe there is to cry out, <hi>Wo to our ſelves,</hi> when we hear of Gods people crying out, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hoſts;</hi> if we be not amongſt them, though it be in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet if Gods worſhip be ſet up, the people of God have a feaſt: When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to go
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57146:135"/>
from <hi>Egypt,</hi> into the <hi>wilderneſs, Moſes</hi> ſays, they muſt go thither to keep a <hi>feaſt</hi> unto the Lord; What was that feaſt in the wilderneſs, but the ſetting up the worſhip of God?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, no communion, no ſociety in which there is ſo much profit and benefit, as to be amongſt theſe. <note place="margin">4.</note> As <hi>Abigail</hi> ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> The Lord <hi>ſhall binde up the ſoul of my Lord in the bundle of life:</hi> to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Gods people, is to be bound up in the bundle of life; much good we enjoy in them, and the more communion we have, the more intereſt we have in all their gifts, and graces, and prayers: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we read of <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he had a great work to do, how he makes uſe of that intereſt he had in the prayers of the godly, <hi>Daniel</hi> 2. 17, 18. It is a great bleſſing to have an intereſt in the prayers of the Saints, and ſo in all their gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. <hi>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all are yours, and you are Chriſts:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, there need no ſuch envying one at another, to ſay, <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> and another <hi>of Apollos,</hi> and another <hi>of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> for all <hi>are yours;</hi> all the gifts, and graces of all the worthies of the Lord, are <hi>all yours,</hi> they are all for your good, and you have intereſt in them all: in communion with the Saints, there is watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over one another, and quickning one another, and admoniſhings, and wholeſome counſels, and ſtirring up the graces of God that are in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Have you not felt your ſelves, when you have come away from a ſpiritual communion, to come away with hearts raiſed, and ſpirits inflamed for God, and ſo ſtrengthened, that your reſolutions have been up, to do or ſuffer any thing for the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57146:135"/>
Lord; as in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Thoſe that feared the Lord, ſpake often to one another, quickned the hearts of one another;</hi> and ſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 5. <hi>And when Silus, and Timotheus, was come from Macedonia, Paul was preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſpirit, and teſtified to the Iews, that Ieſus was Chriſt:</hi> Certainly in their converſe together, S. <hi>Paul</hi> found his ſpirit wrought upon, and refreſhed, ſo that the Text ſays, when <hi>Timotheus</hi> was come, <hi>Paul was preſſed in ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is good being with Gods ſervants, though <note place="margin">5.</note> it be in ſuffering affliction, becauſe God takes ſo much delight in them; if God takes delight in being with them, certainly there is great cauſe we ſhould take delight in them: there are admirable expreſſions of Gods taking delight in them, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>The Lord thy God in the midſt of thee is mighty; he will ſave thee, he will rejoyce over thee with joy, he will reſt in his love, he will joy over thee with ſinging:</hi> One word is heaped upon another, to ſet out the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>delight</hi> that God takes in his people: Hence the Church hath that name given her, <hi>Hephzibah,</hi> becauſe God delighteth in her, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 62. 4. And in <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 3. it is ſaid, <hi>He loved his people,</hi> there is a general love: <hi>All his Saints are in his hand, and they ſate down at his feet,</hi> that is more particular: and in <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my ſiſter, my Spouſe,</hi> &amp;c. One would think by the reading of the words, they were rather the ſpeech of the Spouſe to Chriſt; but it is the ſpeech of Chriſt to his Spouſe: And ſo again in <hi>Cantic.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Open to me, my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled:</hi> theſe are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the delight that God hath in his people; <hi>The Lord loves the gates of Zion, more then all the</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:57146:136"/>
                     <hi>ling places of Jacob,</hi> that is, <hi>God delights in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like communion of his people, more then in all their private dwellings:</hi> If we be of Gods minde, and have Gods Spirit, our hearts muſt be where God is, Gods bowels yern towards them, <hi>I am afflicted with thee in all thy afflictions, and how ſhall I give thee up?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a notable expreſſion in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9. 10. where God ſets out much of his delight in his Church, <hi>I found Iſrael like grapes in the wilderneſs;</hi> as a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, wearied, parched in the wilderneſs, if he findes bunches of grapes, O how ſweet and refreſhing are they to him! ſo, ſays God, was <hi>Iſrael</hi> to me: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>I ſaw your fathers, as the firſt ripe in the fig-tree at her firſt time:</hi> Fruit when it comes at the firſt, and is dainty, how is it prized? ſome will give an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible price for ſome kinde of timely fruit, when it is rare at the firſt; Thus God ſets out his delight, never <hi>Longer</hi> did delight more in ſome timely rare fruit, then <hi>God</hi> does in his Saints. God takes delight (you ſee) in his people, above all others, and therefore it is good to be with them.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Conſider the glorious titles that in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <note place="margin">6.</note> are put upon the Saints in a way of Church communion: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are Gods <hi>portion, Deut.</hi> 32. 9. <hi>The Lords</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>titles</hi> of the Saints.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:57146:137"/>
Seventhly, There is a ſpecial preſence of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; and to be there, where God is in his eſpecial preſence, it is worth the enduring of a great deal of affliction: God is there in a ſpecial maner, as in the laſt words of the propheſie of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the Church is called by that name, <hi>Iehova Shammah,</hi> the Lord is there. And the Lord filled his Tabernacle with his preſence: the Tabernacle was a type of the Church, and did typifie his eſpecial preſence with his people in Church-communion.</p>
                  <p>And as God is there preſent, ſo obſerve the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his eſpecial preſence; he is ſaid to dwell there, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 2. <hi>In Salem is his Tabernacle, and his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place in Zion:</hi> Now it is good keeping houſe with God. <hi>You are his houſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; the Church of God is his houſe, and it is good to be in Gods houſe. But though it be his dwelling, Is it a dwelling that is lovely to him? Yes, for it is that his ſoul deſires to be in; as if ſo be God counted it a kinde of honor (as we may ſpeak with holy reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) to have ſuch a habitation; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 14. <hi>Here will I dwell, for I have deſired it:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>If I might have but a dwelling among my people, I deſire no better habitation in the world.</hi> Now you that are fain to be put into mean holes for your dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, if you may be with Gods people, do not think it much, for God dwells there, and deſires no better habitation: It is ſtrange that God that hath Heaven to be his habitation, ſhould deſire to dwell with his people, yet ſays he, <hi>I deſire to dwell there,</hi> and I will dwell there.</p>
                  <p>If a man make a houſe to do ſome mean buſineſs in, he does not take much delight there, but in that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57146:137"/>
houſe where the Kings Majeſty is manifeſted, that is the greateſt place in the Kingdom: now in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 8. it is, <hi>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy houſe, where thy honor dwelleth:</hi> as if this were the chief houſe that God had, that God delighteth in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other dwellings; his honor dwells here. But will God ſtay here? Yea, it is the place that he will dwell in for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 13, 14. Surely our hearts may reſt where God reſts, and we ſhould not be weary where God is not weary. And he does not onely dwell here, but he hath his delightful walks here: the walks of God are amongſt his people, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. If a man have a houſe that he rejoyces in, he will have his garden as near his houſe as he can, that he may have ſome walks to delight in: and ſo the Church of God is ſuch a houſe, as hath not onely room for God to reſt in, and ſet his honor in, but he walks there, and walks <hi>in them,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Thus the Lord is pleaſed to condeſcend to our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to expreſs his eſpecial preſence with his Church, and therefore it is good to be with them; theſe are the expreſſions of it.</p>
                  <p>But wherein does the preſence of God with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> appear more then with other people?</p>
                  <p>In theſe two things eſpecially. <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe there God makes himſelf known, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals <note place="margin">1.</note> himſelf there, and makes his beauty to appear. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 4. <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Wherein the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of God with <hi>his people,</hi> appears more then with <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>that I will ſeek after, that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple:</hi> It is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Heaven to ſee God in his beauty, and this is one of the greateſt promiſes of God to his Church,. that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57146:138"/>
they ſhall <hi>ſee the King in his majeſty:</hi> We may ſee ſome glimmering light of God in the <hi>Heavens; Sun, Moon, and Stars;</hi> but in the Church, there God ſhews his <hi>beauty,</hi> there we may ſee the face of God; and this is that which <hi>Moſes</hi> did deſire; <hi>Lord-ſhew me thy glory:</hi> It is much granted to us in the Church, in enjoying his Ordinances; and there is no way to ſee Gods face ſo clearly, as this way: Every childe of God that is in the Temple, ſhall ſpeak of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for they ſee God in his glory in a ſpecial maner.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the eſpecial preſence of God with his people, is eſpecially manifeſted, in that he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates <note place="margin">2.</note> to his people; as namely,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the choice mercies of God are communicated to his people: If you would have any ſhare in Gods <note place="margin">1.</note> choice mercies, his peculiar mercies, come amongſt Gods people, joyn with them: as that place is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 134. 3. <hi>The Lord that made Heaven and earth, bleſs thee out of Sion:</hi> He does not ſay, the Lord that made Heaven and Earth, bleſs thee out of Heaven and Earth; but the Lord that made Heaven and Earth, bleſs thee out of <hi>Sion:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, The bleſſings that come out of <hi>Sion,</hi> are the choice bleſſings, and the peculiar mercies of God, even above any that come out of Heaven and Earth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God communicates his mercies more <note place="margin">2.</note> fully then any where elſe: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 6. <hi>And in this mountain,</hi> that is, in the Church, <hi>I will make a feaſt of fat things, a feaſt of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 8. <hi>They ſhall be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drink of the river of thy pleaſures:</hi> In a private way there may be ſome <hi>drops</hi> of pleaſure
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57146:138"/>
from God, but there is not that <hi>full</hi> communication from God, as with his people in his <hi>Ordinances:</hi> there is in the world, in the creature drops, in private com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion there are ponds, but in a pulique Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communion, there are rivers of pleaſure, and that is the height of all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God communicates his mercies more powerfully in the Church then any where elſe: <hi>Pſal.</hi>

There <hi>in the Church,</hi> amongſt his people, <hi>there</hi> God commanded the bleſſing, even life for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, God bleſſeth more <hi>univerſally</hi> with all <note place="margin">4.</note> kinde of bleſſing, and therefore he is more preſent there: and in that reſpect the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 87. 7. <hi>All my ſprings are in thee.</hi> This whole <hi>Pſalm</hi> is to ſet out the excellent condition of the Church, and he concludes the <hi>Pſalm</hi> with this, <hi>All my ſprings are in thee:</hi> Now this expreſſion is very emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; <hi>Spring</hi> is taken two or three ways in Scripture: The Law of God, the Doctrine of Gods Law is compared to a <hi>ſpring,</hi> and heavenly knowledge is compared to a <hi>ſpring;</hi> and then it is thus, <hi>All my ſprings:</hi> All the truths I have, all the knowledge I come to be made partaker of, <hi>are all in the Church.</hi> Again, <hi>All my ſprings;</hi> all the comforts of my heart, and that good and joy my ſpirit receives, and all the graces of the Spirit that I have, and all the quickning and ſtrengthning I have, is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to me this way. And upon this ground, the Church is called the very perfection of all beauty,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57146:139"/>
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 2. <hi>Out of Zion the perfection of all beauty, God hath ſhined:</hi> Out of <hi>Zion,</hi> there is his glory wonderfully apparent; The word that is tranſlated, the perfection of beauty, is tranſlated by ſome, the univerſality of beauty; all kinde of beauty, all kinde <note place="margin">Univerſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te decoris.</note> of excellency: as if the Pſalmiſt ſhould ſay, Put all excellencies together that poſſibly you can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, to make a thing comely and lovely, <hi>they are all in the Church.</hi> Thus you ſee it is good being with Gods people, when as God is thus preſent with them, in a ſpecial maner.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, it is good being with Gods people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">8.</note> there is Gods ſpecial protection; others are but as the wilderneſs, the Church is as a <hi>garden encloſed, Cant.</hi> 4. 12. A man regards his garden that he hath encloſed, and beſtowed coſt about, more then a wilde field; the fields have hedges to keep out the beaſts, but gardens have brick wals, or wood walls. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 3. <hi>I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every moment, leſt any hurt it; I will keep it night and day:</hi> How full is this? his care over it is ſuch, as he threatens thoſe which ſhall but touch it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 14. to pluck them out of their land. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 5. God promiſeth <hi>he will be a wall of fire round about his people;</hi> alluding to the cuſtom of travellers in the wilderneſs, who uſed to make fires round about them in the night for their ſafety, becauſe then none of the wilde beaſts durſt come near them; ſuch a defence is God to his people.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing in the Book of God, wherein God is ſo full in his expreſſion, as when he comes to this argument, to manifeſt his affection to his Church. Chriſt is the <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and when ſheep are together,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57146:139"/>
they are under the protection of the Shepherd, when the ſheep are ſcattered, the Shepherds eye is not ſo over them; And therefore in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4. 16. God threatens his people, he would feed them <hi>as a Lamb in a large place;</hi> as a Lamb getting from the fold, goes up and down bleating; ſo when Gods people are ſcattered, they are as <hi>a Lamb</hi> in a large place: and when God would threaten the ſoreſt judgement againſt his people, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 34. he ſays, <hi>He will ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them,</hi> and they ſhall become <hi>to be meat to the beaſts of the field.</hi> And hence it is, that the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church is ſo ſtable a condition: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 60. 15. the Church is called <hi>an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal excellency,</hi> becauſe it is under the Lords protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is it not good being there, to be under the wing of God?</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, to be amongſt Gods people is a bleſſed <note place="margin">9.</note> thing, becauſe they have ſo many <hi>priviledges</hi> from God: every one deſires to joyn with ſuch ſocieties as have great priviledges; now Gods people have ſuch as are very great, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. 3. <hi>Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O City of God!</hi> What glorious things?

To them are committed the Oracles of God, as the Apoſtle reaſons for the Church of the Jews; So to every Church of God, is committed the Oracles and the Ordinances of God, and thoſe Offices for the diſpenſation of the myſteries of God; which were the great gift, that Chriſt triumphingly aſcending to Heaven gave, and ſurely that gift muſt needs be great.

                  </p>
                  <p>Every Church-fellowſhip is as the pillar, to hold <note place="margin">T. 5. ep. 3.</note> forth the truth to the world, as a light ſet upon a hill, to hold forth the glory of God. And they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them the broad ſeal of Heaven; To Gods people that are together in a Church-fellowſhip, <hi>the ſeals</hi> are committed; now this is a mighty priviledge. And beſides, they have the <hi>power of Chriſt</hi> with them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. the power of Chriſt is committed to them. And amongſt other priviledges, this is one of great worth, that all the promiſes of God made to his Church in former ages, is the heritage of every preſent Church, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 54. 17. Theſe are great and high priviledges, and worth the enduring of a great deal of hardſhip, to be made partakers of the good of them.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, it is a bleſſed thing to be with them, though with ſome hardſhip, becauſe God is working <note place="margin">10.</note> more and more good for his people every day: Now he is about fulfilling the glorious promiſes that we have in the Prophets, to make an end of all the glory that he does intend in the world: Now if God be

working great things for his people, as we hope he is, <hi>To ſet up Jeruſalem, as the praiſe of the whole earth;</hi> Is it not good to be with them, that we may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the glory that God intends to them? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 14. There is a promiſe that the Church ſhall ride upon the high places of the earth: There is a time a coming, that the ſociety of Gods people in this world, ſhall be ſet above all ſocieties in the world; and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. that <hi>The mountain of the Lord ſhall be</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed above <hi>all mountains:</hi> we cannot ſee how this hath been fulfilled. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 60. 19. <hi>The Sun ſhall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightneſs ſhall the Moon give light unto thee, but the Lord ſhall be unto thee an everlaſting light, and thy God thy glory.</hi> This propheſie is ſpoken of the eſtate of the Church of God; when was this fulfilled, that there ſhould be ſo much glory in the Church, that there need not be any <hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>Moon,</hi> but God ſhould be in ſtead of <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and all the glory of his people? and to be with Gods people, when God does ſuch great things for them, is worth the enduring much hardſhip</p>
                  <p>In the former part of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 60. <hi>v.</hi> 7. God ſays, <hi>He will glorifie the houſe of his glory;</hi> and mark what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Who are thoſe that fly as a cloud, and as the Doves to their windows?</hi> Seeing God will glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the houſe of his glory, his people ſhould fly to it as a cloud; Thoſe who are of heavenly, not of droſſie ſenſual ſpirits, will do ſo, and <hi>as Doves</hi> to their windows; thoſe who are of Dove-like ſpirits, loving ſociety, and purity, they will do ſo. And it was the reaſon why ſome deſired to live, becauſe in a few years, they hoped to ſee ſome great things for his people. And ſo the 102 <hi>Pſalm</hi> is a prophetical <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:57146:141"/>
into what a happy condition the Lord will bring his people; and in the latter part of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt brings in a gracious heart living in thoſe times, bemoaning the condition of it, that it hath a ſickly body, and weak, and like to dye, before God would make good thoſe promiſes made to the Church: as if he ſhould ſay, Lord, thou art bringing glorious things to paſs for thy Church, and thou art gathering the Kingdoms to ſerve thee, Lord, then take not me away in the midſt of my days; O God let me live to ſee all fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, It is good to be with Gods people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">11.</note> they are thoſe people we ſhal live withal in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: If there were a company travelling together in a ſtrange countrey, and knew when they came to their own countrey they ſhould live together, in ſome great preferment in the Court, how would they delight in one another? So the godly ſhould look upon one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; here we have communion one with another, and theſe are they we muſt joyn in communion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al hereafter, to praiſe God eternally in the higheſt Heavens.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is Heaven already to joyn with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">12.</note> of God in communion: The Scripture calls the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and Church <hi>communion,</hi> Heaven. And therefore where there is a promiſe of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore his Church, and recover it from thraldom and miſery, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65. 17. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſays God, <hi>I create new heavens, and new earth;</hi> and ſo in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. where the viſion of the reſtoring of the Church was ſhewn to <hi>John,</hi> it was ſhewn that way; there was <hi>a new heaven,</hi> and <hi>a new earth:</hi> ſo that the Church of God is <hi>heaven,</hi> it is not onely a company we ſhall live

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:57146:142"/>
to have it, for great things are ſpoken concerning it. If there be any realities in the truths that have been opened to you, it cannot but make the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and joyning with Gods people very lovely; but certainly that which I have ſaid, comes abundantly ſhort of what is in it: for the moſt things that are uſed, for the ſhewing the excellency of this communion, were from ſome expreſſions of God to his people under the Law, and we come ſhort in the underſtanding of them; but if we could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them fully, they come ſhort of the abundance of priviledges that Gods people have under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and the reaſon is, not onely becauſe <hi>ceremonies</hi> were typical, but Gods dealing with his Church, their way in Church order, and government, was but a <hi>typical thing,</hi> to typifie the eſtate of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Now we know there is a great deal more in the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype,</hi> then in the <hi>type,</hi> the type is but a ſhadow of that which is typified; now if the excellency of the eſtate of the Church under the <hi>Law,</hi> was but a type of the eſtate of the Church under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> then all that is ſaid of the excellency of that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is but as a ſhadow of that which is now, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>The law was a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very image;</hi> The eſtate of the Church now under the Goſpel, is the <hi>image</hi> of that glory that is to be revealed, but the <hi>Law</hi> was but a ſhadow of <hi>that</hi> image: as a Limner, firſt draws a dark ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a picture in coal, and after makes the Image; look what differenne there is in the excellency of that rude draught by a coal, and the beauty of the Image; ſuch there is between all the excellency of the eſtate
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57146:142"/>
of the Church under the <hi>Law,</hi> and that there is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> and therefore, that which is to be expected now, is a great deal more, and ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the deſires of all, to ſeek after ſuch a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, that this good which is to be had in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Gods people, is a ſpecial fruit of the loving kindeneſs of God; and would you not all be made partakers of the loving kindeneſs of the Lord? Thriving in your Trades, and outward bleſſings, are a fruit of the common kindeneſs of the Lord, but communion with Gods people, is a fruit of his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialloving kindeneſs: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 7, 8. <hi>How excellent is thy loving kindeneſs, O God! therefore the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men put their truſt under the ſhadow of thy wings. They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drink of the river of thy pleaſures.</hi> The ſatisfaction of the ſoul with <hi>the fatneſs of Gods houſe,</hi> is the fruit of <hi>Gods loving kindeneſs,</hi> yea, the fruit of Gods <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> loving kindeneſs, and his <hi>admirable</hi> excellent loving kindeneſs: It is worth the ſeeking after, to be ſatisfied with the fatneſs of Gods houſe: <hi>And thou ſhalt make them drink of the river of thy pleaſures:</hi> While you ſeek after the comforts of the creature, you ſeek to drink in puddles, but here are rivers of pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>It is the inheritance of Gods elect ones; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65. 9. <hi>I will bring forth a ſeed out of Jacob, and out of Iudah an inheritor of my mountains, mine elect ſhall inherit it.</hi> I do not ſay, whoſoever does enjoy communion with Gods people, is <hi>elected;</hi> but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever does enjoy it, enjoys that which is the <hi>inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57146:143"/>
of Gods elect,</hi> ſuch a fruit of Gods loving kindeneſs, as comes to the elect by <hi>inheritance,</hi> though ſome others do get into it, yet none ſhould but onely the elect ones; and therefore if you have any hope to be the elect of God, deſire after this as part of your inheritance; A man would be loath to loſe part of his inheritance. It is an inheritance promiſed to thoſe who truſt in God, and oppoſed to all the vanity of the world; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 13. <hi>Vanity ſhall take them, but he that putteth his truſt in me, ſhall inherit my holy mountain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it hath been the onely deſire of gracious <note place="margin">3.</note> hearts heretofore; and if God hath wrought any grace in you, ſure your grace is ſuitable to the grace of others, as <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 24. <hi>This one thing have I deſired of the Lord, that will I ſeek after, that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord:</hi> as if there were nothing were the object of <hi>Davids</hi> deſires, but this <hi>one thing.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. what abundance of expreſſions have we to ſet out his deſires this way? <hi>David</hi> was here in his baniſhment; we do not finde him complaining, <hi>O my Kingdom that I am like to loſe!</hi> my brave <hi>Palaces,</hi> and my brave <hi>Chambers, Gardens</hi> and <hi>attendance that I am like to loſe;</hi> but <hi>the houſe of God.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>As the Hart pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God!</hi> It was not after the enjoyment of God that he might have in his own ſoul privately, that his heart ſo panted after, but the appearing before the Lord in <hi>his houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this is the eſpecial work of wiſdom: if <note place="margin">4.</note> God hath let out any beam of wiſdom into your
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57146:143"/>
ſouls, to ſhew unto you any thing of the excellency of Chriſt, this will be immediately deſired; as in that Parable of the wiſe Merchant, as ſoon as he had found the Pearl, he went and ſold all to buy the field: the meaning is, when a ſoul comes to have any knowledge of Chriſt, that Chriſt is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pearl, then it deſires to ſeek to enjoy him, where he is to be enjoyed; it is in the field, in the Church of God, in communion with it; and the wiſe Merchant would part with any thing, that he might have the <hi>field,</hi> that is, <hi>have communion with Gods people</hi> in his Ordinances, and ſo come to enjoy the Pearl.</p>
                  <p>Yea fifthly, the reaſon why God puts any light or truth into the ſoul, is to put forth the ſoul to this, to <note place="margin">5.</note> joyn with his people in this way of communion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43. 3. What was the reaſon why the Prophet would have the light and the truth of God? but to lead him to the holy hill, and to the Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, by joyning your ſelf with the Saints, and <note place="margin">6.</note> furthering this work of <hi>communion,</hi> you ſet up the honor of God much, God is much glorified by this, and will be more and more; <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>I will build him a Tabernacle,</hi> the Septuagint renders it, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>I will glorifie him:</hi> and it is very obſervable, that as ſoon as <hi>Moſes</hi> was delivered from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he thinks of, and reſolves, and promiſes, <hi>the building of Gods Tabernacle,</hi> which was a type of the Church. If God hath delivered you out of any trouble, out of any ſickneſs, in teſtimony of thankfulneſs to God for his mercy, ſet upon this work, to further the building of Gods Tabernacle; Seeing God hath ſpared my life, this ſhall be one of the firſt things
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:57146:144"/>
I will do, I will put in what I can, to the furthering of the building of Gods Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, we finde in Scripture, that there is a <note place="margin">7.</note> fearful threatning againſt all thoſe that ſhall neglect this, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 17. <hi>And it ſhall be, that whoſo will not come up of all the families of the earth, unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, to worſhip the King the Lord of hoſts, even upon them ſhall be no rain;</hi> that is, no bleſſing of God. You will ſay, how does this appear to be meant of Gods people now? It appears the holy Ghoſt did intend the eſtate of the Church in the time of the Goſpel, and therefore it follows in the 20. ver. <hi>In that day ſhall there be upon the bells of the horſes, Holineſs unto the Lord, and the pots in the Lords houſe ſhall be like the bowls before the Altar.</hi> Now theſe expreſſions are ſpiritually to be underſtood of the glorious condition of the Church of God in the time of the Goſpel, and therefore God takes it ill at the hands of any that ſhall not come to joyn with his people.</p>
                  <p>And further, we have a fearful threat, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65. 11, 12. againſt ſuch as forſake, or forget Gods holy mountain, <hi>I will number you to the ſword, and ye ſhall bow down to the ſlaughter:</hi> You may think to provide for your ſelves, to live ſecurely, and ſafely, at your eaſe, enjoying <hi>houſe, lands, friends, trades;</hi> you are loath to hazard your ſelves ſo as others do, to bring your ſelves into ſo much trouble, but as <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, My ſervants ſhall eat, and ye ſhall be hungry, my ſervants ſhall drink, and ye ſhall be thirſty, my ſervants ſhall rejoyce, and ye ſhall be aſhamed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, if any ſoul have any deſire to come and <note place="margin">8.</note>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:57146:144"/>

What difficulty will ſuperſtition put a man upon?</p>
                  <p>It is a note of Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> upon that place, <hi>Seek ye my face;</hi> that ſuperſtitious people will go on pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to the image of ſuch a <hi>Lady,</hi> or ſuch a <hi>Saint,</hi> and they will go over Mountains, and through ſtrange Countries, and though they be uſed hardly, and loſe much of their Eſtate, they ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this, <hi>I have that I came for:</hi> What have they? The ſight of <hi>a dumb Idol;</hi> if they will endure ſuch hardſhip for the ſight of a dumb Idol, how much hardſhip ſhould we endure to ſee God in his Ordinances?</p>
                  <p>But it may be ſaid thirdly, Whither ſhall we go to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> 3.</note> any people, but we ſhall finde ſin <hi>there</hi> as well as in another place?</p>
                  <p>For that there is likewiſe an anſwer in the ſame Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> of Mr. <hi>Calvins;</hi> It is true, ſin and wickedneſs will be whereſoever we go, but the caſe is thus: Suppoſe there ſhould be a general diſeaſe, and there ſhould be one place where there were Phyſitians, and means of cure; ſhall any ſay, Why ſhould I go thither, there is the diſeaſe? Go thither though, for there is the cure; ſo though there be ſin every where, yet in the Church, and in communion with Gods people, there is the cure.</p>
                  <p>But may not a man go to heaven without it? <note place="margin">

                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:57146:147"/>
It is true, it is poſſible for a man to go to Heaven without it, yet if God does convince a man of an <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Ordinance, and he neglect it for outward accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, it is dangerous: A man may be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> but where there is the wilful neglect of it, it is dangerous.</p>
                  <p>How did all that never heard of this way? <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> 5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is one thing where there is not that light, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> thing where God hath revealed it. You deſire Heaven at laſt, and do you not deſire communion with Gods people? When you fail in any thing, you plead infirmity, but when you do neglect any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of gaining ſtrength, how can you plead infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity?</p>
                  <p>But how ſhall we joyn with any? there is no place <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> 6.</note> but there is brabling, falling out, heart-burning, ſo as there is no ſweet communion.</p>
                  <p>This is a great ſtumbling, and I would we <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> could deny it: but if you will take offence at this, you muſt be offended; It cannot be expected to the end of the world, but there will be diſſention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people of God: where there hath not been care in laying a good foundation at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and where there is much liberty, and ſome are carnal, what elſe can be expected? A company of ſheep, when they are worried by the dog, though they were ſcattered before, they will now run cloſe together; but in a fair Sun-ſhine day, when there is no dog to ſcare them, they will one feed here, and another there, diſtant from one another: and ſo it is with Gods people, though it be a foul ſhame, and a great ſin.</p>
                  <p>Again, there is no more diſſention then in other
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:57146:147"/>
places, for though in other places there ſeem to be more union, what is the reaſon?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe they are in the dark, and all colours <note place="margin">1.</note> will agree in the dark; but amongſt Gods people there is light, and ſo things that differ are ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe they are chained together; as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will ſay, there is no ſuch union between <note place="margin">2.</note> others, as between us; What is the ground? They are held together by an <hi>Antichriſtian chain:</hi> Popery does ſubject the conſciences of men to them: they muſt believe the infalibility of the Pope, and they have no liberty to ſearch things by the Word; and they will not ſuffer them to be reaſoning about the points of Religion; they are in darkneſs, and when they be chained up in darkneſs, no wonder though they be cloſe together. This is juſt as if there ſhould be a couple of men chained to a block, and as they are chained together, they ſee other men go at a diſtance from one another; and they that are chained ſhould cry out, See what a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is between you, we keep cloſe together all the day long; Were this a plea for them? What is that that keeps them together? It is but their chain, and if their chain were off, they would be at as great a diſtance as others; and therefore though there be great evil in the diſſentions of Gods people, yet it is not for ſuch as theſe are to complain of the evil.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, falſe Religions have more peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will admit of mixture; but our God <hi>is a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>jealous God,</hi> he will admit us of no mixture, ſo of no partner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:57146:148"/>
But that this might not be an offence, ſo as to keep us from joyning in Communion with the people of God, let us know if this might have been offence enough to keep men from joyning with them, it would have kept men in all times from joyning with the Churches ſince Chriſts time: You know what difference was between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. And ſo the Apoſtles do complain of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions, and diviſions in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in the Primitive times, and if that had been enough to keep out men from joyning with them, then there had been no joyning with the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and other Churches. <hi>Baſil</hi> complains, I have lived now to the age of a man, and I ſee more union in Arts and Sciences, then in Divinity; for in the Church, I ſee ſuch diſſentions, as do diſſipate it, and rend it aſunder. And ſo between <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> the one wiſhed the other might never dye a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and the other wiſhed that he might never go home alive. And between <hi>Jerome</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus;</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a moſt ſad ſtory we have of thoſe that fled to <hi>Frankford</hi> from <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> time, and when they came there, though they fled for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and for their lives, yet there were ſuch grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous breaches, as they ſought the lives of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, picking out ſome words againſt the <hi>Emperor,</hi> in a Sermon that <hi>Maſter Knox</hi> had preached in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> long before, and now accuſing him for them to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Frankford,</hi> upon which divers of them were fain to flee. This is through the malice of the Devil, in ſowing tares, and therefore if you will be offended in this way of ſcandal, you muſt be offended</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:57146:148"/>
Yet we muſt all take heed of giving offence, for though offences <hi>will come,</hi> yet <hi>wo to them</hi> by whom they come: Howſoever there fall out offences, through the ſinful diſtempers of mens hearts, let not the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God be challenged as the cauſe of theſe offences. Joyning in Church-fellowſhip is a ſpecial Ordinance of God, to maintain love and peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his people, yet by the abuſe of it many times, diviſions and diſſentions are ſtronger, and more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Church, then elſewhere; let not Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance be accuſed as the cauſe of it, nor declined for this, but let the wickedneſs of mens hearts be accuſed, let us ſeek to have it purged.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt came into the world <hi>to diſſolve the works of the Devil,</hi> and yet the Devil never more raged, then in Chriſts time, and a while after; We never read of men ſo poſſeſſed of the Devil before Chriſt came, as they were <hi>then;</hi> Shall we therefore accuſe Chriſt for bringing the Devil into the world, for being the cauſe of mens being poſſeſſed of the Devil? Thoſe who thus reaſon againſt the Ordinance of Chriſt, becauſe of this evil that falls out by accident upon it, may as well, yea, and certainly would as readily reaſon againſt Chriſt, if they lived in his time, becauſe of ſuch poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Devils, which never was ſo before he came, as it was then; but as the true reaſon why the Devil thus prevailed upon Chriſts coming, was the juſt judgement of God againſt men for contemning and rejecting Chriſt, who came amongſt them: ſo it is here the judgement of God for the evil of mens hearts in abuſing ſuch a bleſſed Ordinance of love and peace.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe, the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Lords Supper,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57146:149"/>
is a Sacrament appointed by God to maintain love and peace in the Church, it is an Ordinance for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, it hath the denomination from thence, it is called <hi>communion;</hi> Yet what hath occaſioned ſuch diſſentions in the Chriſtian world, as the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies about the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> Shall therefore this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance be accuſed as the cauſe of diſſention? O let us for ever learn this truth, that whatſoever evil falls <note place="margin">Qui con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionum gratia Chriſtinam vituperabit doctriuam, iſte etiam Socraticam &amp; Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicam co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne rejicit.

                  <p>There is diſſention amongſt Merchants, and other Trades, you do not ſay therefore, I will not binde my childe to that Trade, they diſſent amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: If there be profit and accommodations in the Trade, men will not be hindred by this plea, but joyn with them notwithſtanding; And ſo come you and joyn with the Saints, though there be ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions, though there may be ſome rigid, diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd, hot ſpirited men, that may cauſe ſome trouble, yet there is not ſo much union and love in all the world as with them; ſet but aſide ſome, and there are a company, if you be gracious, your ſoul may take pleaſure in, and bleſs God for; and therefore away with all ſuch ſtumbling blocks, and reaſonings againſt the Ordinances of God, come you thirſting after the Ordinances of God, and my ſoul for yours, if you
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:57146:149"/>
do not finde that ſweetneſs in communion with them, as never was found before.</p>
                  <p>There are many objections againſt this way, and many are a long time enſnared in them, but <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 13. where God promiſes the inheritance of his holy Mountain, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. he promiſes to make the way plain to it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such a one as can approve to his own heart, an inward effectual call of God, calling him out of the world, as well as an outward call, by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, ſuch a one as hath teſtimony to his own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he is ſeparated, ſet apart for God, that he hath an <hi>inward ſanctification</hi> of the holy Ghoſt, ſuch a one as in whoſe ſpirit <hi>there is no guile;</hi> this is a true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if it be ſuch a great bleſſing to be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in union, and communion with the people of God, hence labor to bleſs God for this great bleſſing, that is ſuch an amiable, deſireable condition; it is your heaven upon earth, that mercy that ſhould ſweeten all other mercies, yea, that ſhould ſweeten your afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to you. Gods holy mountain, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57. 13. is promiſed as <hi>an inheritance</hi> oppoſed to <hi>vanity,</hi> and promiſed as the bleſſing upon truſting in the Lord, <hi>Vanity ſhall take them, but he that putteth his truſt in me, ſhall inherit my holy mountain.</hi> Let us not enjoy <note place="margin">

                  <p>We have cauſe to bleſs God that we might be with Gods people, though in <hi>caves,</hi> and <hi>woods,</hi> and <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed</hi> from all; we have much more cauſe to bleſs God when we can be with them thus publiquely, and peaceably, and can go from Gods houſe, to our own houſes, and have communion there; this is the reſt that the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> did typifie, for which the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57146:151"/>
name of God is to be mganified; God might ſo have left us, that we ſhould have had communion onely with the prophane ones, and drunkards; yea, we might have been caſt out from God, to have had communion onely with reprobates, and that now we may have communion with the godly, it is a wonderful mercy. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. we read of Chriſt ſtanding upon the <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> and having ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people ſtanding up, <hi>to joyn with him in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowſhip;</hi> for that is the meaning of that place, there they were rejoycing at the mercy of the Lord, that they were upon <hi>the Mount with the Lamb;</hi> though there might be time, when our Harps hanged upon the Willows, yet if we be called to <hi>the Lamb</hi> upon Mount <hi>Zion, Let us have our Harps in our hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is there nothing in the delight that God hath in his people, and the preſence of God with his people, and the great priviledges they have, to raiſe our hearts to praiſe the Lord, and let it not be verbally, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. As namely thus; Is it that we are Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, let him be <hi>our</hi> delight; if we be his <hi>treaſure,</hi> let him be <hi>our</hi> treaſure; if we be his <hi>portion,</hi> let him be <hi>our</hi> portion, if he communicates choice mercies to us, let us give choice endeavors to him; if he gives us protection, let us protect his truths and name; if he honor us, let us give him his honor. And ſo I ſlip into a third particular, which is a third branch of this exhortation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If there be ſo much excellency in communion <note place="margin">3.</note> with the people of God, you that are ſuch, take heed you do not darken that excellency that God hath put in communion with his people; there are three ways eſpecially that darkens this excellency.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:57146:151"/>
Firſt, if we reſt in any <hi>Church-priviledge</hi> we have, and make that to be our Religion, and the <note place="margin">How the excellency of the <hi>Saints communion</hi> is darkned</note> ſtrength of our ſpirits be let out about theſe things we enjoy, more then others, ſo as we begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline in the ſavour and power of godlineſs; if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that knew us before, when we had not thoſe priviledges and mercies, that we have now, ſhall ſay, What good is to be had there? <hi>I knew ſuch, and me thinks they had more ſavour and reliſh in the ways of God then now, more ſweetneſs and warmth to be had in their company then now there is;</hi> Take heed of this, of giving occaſion to any to ſay ſo. It is a very evil and a dangerous thing to <hi>reſt</hi> in Church-priviledges, to make all our Religion to conſiſt in being in a Church-way, we may have this revealed to us, and yet little of Heaven revealed. There were <hi>two vails</hi> of the Tabernacle, one covered <hi>the Holy of Holies,</hi> the other the place where the <hi>Prieſts entred;</hi> it may be we have had the <hi>firſt</hi> opened to us, but yet the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> which leads to the Holy of Holies, may ſtill be vailed.</p>
                  <p>Many whoſe hearts are very carnal, may be much for Church-Ordinances. We have in the 24. of <hi>Ezekiel, ver.</hi> 21, 22. ſeven ſeveral expreſſions of carnal hearts, priſing Church-priviledges. Firſt, they accounted them their ſtrength. Secondly, the <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> of their ſtrength. Thirdly, <hi>the deſire of their eyes.</hi> Fourthly, that which <hi>their ſouls pitied.</hi> Fifthly, their <hi>glory.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>the joy of their glory.</hi> Seventhly, that whereupon they <hi>ſet their mindes.</hi> What a noiſe did they make about the Temple of the Lord? <hi>The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord, Ier.</hi> 7. 4. and yet they were carnal: Take heed therefore you
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:57146:152"/>
reſt not in the Church-priviledges, by this you will deceive your ſelves, and darken the excellency of this bleſſed communion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, take heed of darkning this by any ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous way, as thoſe do who profeſs themſelves to be the people of God, and yet by their wretched ways of ſenſualities, or any other ways, are a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal unto Gods people, this is an evil, and a bitter thing. Chriſt walks amongſt the <hi>golden candleſticks:</hi> Every Church ſhould be a golden <hi>candleſtick,</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth <hi>light</hi> in the Doctrine of it, and <hi>golden</hi> in the holy converſation of it. We muſt take heed that there be not ſo much as a duſting of this golden candleſtick of the Lord, by the leaſt looſeneſs, or earthlineſs of our lives. By ſcandals in the wicked lives of thoſe that are of Gods people, there is a ſtain and blot caſt upon Church communion; here the name of God is polluted; others that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, pollute the creatures, and their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, but Gods name is not ſo much polluted by them; but Gods people do not onely pollute their conſciences, by their ſcandalous lives, but pollute Gods name, and it is worſe to pollute Gods name, then to pollute your conſciences: And therefore know, that joyning to the Saints is an aggravation to every ſin you commit afterward; and though it be true, that union with the people of God is a mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every croſs and affliction, yet it is an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to every ſin.</p>
                  <p>Yea, if men were born for no other end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to do miſchief, they could not do more then this, to joyn with the people of God, and then live ſcandalouſly. O brethren, let us pray to God,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:57146:152"/>
that we may never live to that day, to darken the great excellency of the fellowſhip of the Saints: It were better that God ſhould take a thouſand of us out of the world, then that we ſhould live to darken the profeſſion of Gods name, in union with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; this does more miſchief, then all the perſecuters under Heaven can do.</p>
                  <p>The Church of God hath never been in a better condition, then when their perſecuters have raged moſt; the raging of perſecuters have not darkned the excellency of the Church, but the ſcandalous lives of members of a Church have darkned the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Church: though by perſecution others may be afraid to make profeſſion of the truth, yet all the perſecution in the world cannot take off mens conſciences, and cauſe them in their conſciences to think ſuch are not in the truth, becauſe they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted; but the ſcandalous lives of thoſe that are Profeſſors, do make men think in their conſciences that this way is not right, and therefore make them think they do God good ſervice in hating ſuch men, perſecuting ſuch men, and there is more evil in this, to be an occaſion to make men think this way is not good, then to make men afraid to venture upon this way. And therefore conſider what a great deal of miſchief ſcandalous lives do, and if you finde your hearts inclining to any ſenſual way, that you are like to give ſcandal, take heed of it, for it is the greateſt miſchief that can be deviſed. Thoſe who joyn with the Church of God, ſhould walk ſo, as to be an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to it, not a ſtain, a blot, to caſt filth upon it; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 18. <hi>Behold theſe that gather themſelves to thee, thou ſhalt ſurely clothe thee with them all, as</hi>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:57146:153"/>
                     <hi>with an Ornament:</hi> Conſider how far many of you are from being an ornament to the Church; are <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Malo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum quam eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be ſecudum</hi> Tert. de fuga. perſ.</note> not your lives rather blemiſhes? This is a ſore evil. Better it is to endure any miſery, then to do that which ſhall make Gods people aſhamed of us.</p>
                  <p>The third thing that darkens the excellency of <note place="margin">3.</note> communion with Gods people, is <hi>diſſentions in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>affection,</hi> this makes it appear to be black in the eyes of the world. <hi>Sozomen</hi> reports of a Deviliſh <note place="margin">Epiſcopos regnante Conſtantio exilio addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctos domu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> revocavit, eo tantum fine ut ipſe ob mutuam inter ſe contentione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bello inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtino op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnarent eccleſiam.</note> policy of <hi>Julian,</hi> to raiſe a ſcandal againſt the Church: He ſent for thoſe Biſhops that were baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Constantius</hi> his time, on purpoſe that he might cauſe diſſention in the Church by them. Take heed you have not a hand in darking this excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, no not in this way. In the body, <hi>ſolutio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinui,</hi> is more dangerous then the corruption of a humor: Let us labor ſo far as poſſibly we can, to make it excellent by peaceableneſs; this is that which is propheſied of for the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 20. <hi>Thine eyes ſhall ſee Jeruſalem a quiet habitation:</hi> And mark the bleſſing that follows upon this quietneſs; <hi>A Tabernacle that ſhall not be taken down; not one of the ſtakes thereof ſhall ever be removed, neither ſhall any of the cords thereof be broken; but there the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers, ſtreams, &amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. there is a Propheſie, that <hi>the Lord ſhall be King over all the earth; in that day there ſhall be one Lord, and his name one:</hi> We now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs <hi>one</hi> God, but we do as it were call him by <hi>ſeveral names;</hi> but that will be a bleſſed time, when as there ſhall be but one Lord, ſo his name ſhall be <hi>one;</hi> there ſhall be a bleſſed agreement in the profeſſion of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:57146:153"/>
his name, oneneſs of heart is a bleſſing of the new Covenant.</p>
                  <p>I remember <hi>Euſebius</hi> reports in the life of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> that he was ſo much troubled for diſſentions in the houſe of God, as he could not ſleep in the night, and they did more diſquiet him, then all his wars; yea he ſays, they cauſed him to ſob and ſigh: and ſo they ſhould be diſquietings to our ſpirits, and we ſhould ſtudy to make up breaches. S. <hi>Auguſtine, ep.</hi> 15. hath this expreſſion, ſpeaking of the diviſions of ſome of the Church, ſays he, I would fall down <note place="margin">Ad pedes prociderem &amp; flerem quantum poſſum.</note> at their feet, and deſire them with all the might I have they would not do thus and thus, that they would not caſt reproaches upon one another. And obſerve the ſpirit of St. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>If there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the ſame love, &amp;c.</hi> Doves cannot endure to be amongſt Ravens, but where they ſee meekneſs and love, there thoſe of Dove-like diſpoſitions love to be; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 60. 8. Who are they like Doves, that flie to their Windows? Brethren, if we would expect to grow up in the ways of godlineſs, it muſt be by love and union together, <hi>Coloſſians</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Being knit together in love, unto all riches of full aſſurance.</hi> When hearts are knit together in <hi>love,</hi> then a Church thrives, and grows up to all riches of grace.</p>
                  <p>As it is in the body of a man, when the members of the body are out of joynt, they can neither receive ſtrength from the body, nor be uſeful to the body. And therefore the Apoſtle would have us be careful,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:57146:154"/>
if any were out of joynt, to ſet him in joynt again, that is the propriety of the word. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>If a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are ſpiritual, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore</hi>

                     <hi>ſuch a one;</hi> ſet ſuch a one in joynt, that he may thrive, as members in joynt thrive. Chriſt is called the corner ſtone; now a corner ſtone is that which joyns both ſides together; now Chriſt loves to be in the place of joyning, where there is a joyning in mutual fellowſhip: Although there be variety in gifts, <note place="margin">In veſte varietas ſit, ſciſſura non ſit.</note> although the garment of the <hi>Kings daughter,</hi> the Church, be of divers colours, yet why may it not be like Chriſts garment without ſeam?</p>
                  <p>For the Lords ſake let us take heed of diviſions and quarrels, eſpecially let us take heed that under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion, we do not maintain quarrels, for this is to bring down the holy Ghoſt, from appearing like a Dove, to appear in the form of a Vulture, or Raven; You know what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of ſpeaking with <hi>ſeveral tongues,</hi> will not he that comes in ſay you are <hi>mad?</hi> When wicked men hear of ſo many diſſonant opinions, of ſo many diſſentions among you, will they not think you mad? And becauſe you all pretend Religion, will they not think that that kinde of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which you pretend is a mad thing? So far ſhall you be from making the way of Chriſt honorable in their eyes, which yet ſhould be the thing you ſhould more deſire, ſeek after, rejoyce in, then your lives. Religion hath the name from binding, and certainly <note place="margin">Religio à religando.</note> it is the beſt band of humane ſocieties; there is great reaſon then that we ſeek to keep it in the band of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And that is the third thing I would ſay to thoſe that are in Church-fellowſhip, not to darken the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that is in communion with the Saints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:57146:154"/>
The fourth exhortation is, that you would walk and live ſo, as by your walking you may draw others to be in love with this fellowſhip: as God hath made it to be glorious, ſo that you would ſet out the glory of it to others, that all that go by you ſhould ſay, Surely they are the bleſſed of the Lord, certainly God is with them, and therefore we will likewiſe joyn with them; O what a bleſſed thing were it, if we could by our lives convince others, that we are the plants of the Lords own planting! The lives of men <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jubeat vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deat liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua</hi> Atha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. exhort. ad Monachos</note> convince more ſtrongly then their words: The tongue perſwades, but the life commands, is the ſpeech of an Ancient.

Thoſe that ſtood with the Lamb upon Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communion there, they had his Fathers name written upon their foreheads, the glory of God ſhined in their foreheads; a convincing converſation is that which God calls for at your hands. Let the name of God be precious to you: Is it not a precious thing to live ſo, as to bring honor to God? to hold forth the honor of God, is all the glory we can bring to God; let us be known to be thoſe we profeſs our ſelves to be, ſeparated from the world, by the holineſs of our lives; as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays of the Chriſtians in his time, they were known to be Chriſtians from the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">

You are joyned near to Chriſt, as a girdle about a mans loyns; take heed you be not as that girdle, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. A rotten girdle, fit for nothing, ſo were the Church of the Jews at that time; but you ſhould be as that girdle of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. A golden girdle about his paps; By which the beauty and glorious condition of the Church in the Primitive times is deſcribed.</p>

Let us walk ſo, as to manifeſt and hold forth the beauty and amiableneſs of godlineſs in the eyes of all, that they may ſee it whether they will or no, and to force eſteem from the conſciences of men. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 4. it is ſaid of the Church, <hi>She is terrible as an army with banners;</hi> A Church of God that walks cloſe to the rule, is terrible to guilty conſciences.

St. <hi>John Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 3. expreſſeth his deſire for thoſe whom he wrote to, that they might have fellowſhip with him, and the reſt of the Saints; and he brings this as an argument, Truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt; this would be a mighty prevailing argument indeed, if we walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo before others, as to manifeſt that we in truth have fellowſhip with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt; then our fellowſhip would be deſireable indeed.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, in the general, take heed of thoſe ſins <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> eſpecially, that thoſe which you converſe with are guilty of, that they be not able to ſpy the ſame ſins in you, which their conſciences accuſe themſelves of: take heed of the pollutions of the world. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Who is ſhe that looketh forth as the Morning, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun, and terrible as an army with banners?</hi> The Church of God ought to be <hi>fair as the Moon,</hi> but the Moon hath ſpots, and therefore it follows, <hi>Clear as the Sun,</hi> and then, <hi>ſhe is terrible as an army with banners:</hi> Either ſhe will <hi>draw</hi> the hearts of others to love her, or ſhe will <hi>daunt</hi> their hearts. Yea, let them not ſee any defilement anſwerwable to their defilement: for wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, though they cannot ſpy evils in the godly, yet ſurely they think they are guilty of the ſins which they live in, as well as themſelves: as <hi>Nero,</hi> becauſe he was unchaſt, thought all the world was unchaſt: and therefore the godly ſhould labor to keep themſelves from ſuch ſins as the world is guilty of, that they may not ſpy ſuch in them. A godly man ſhould not onely labor to be kept from outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement; that may be done by the ſtrength of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſcience, without any ſanctifying grace: and it ſhould be a ſhame to one that hath grace, if he ſhould not do that; if he cannot do that, how can he purge
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:57146:156"/>
himſelf from ſecret, and ſpiritual evils that are in the heart?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if you would walk ſo as to draw others in love to communion with you, walk in <hi>ſingleneſs</hi> and uprightneſs of heart. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 46, 47. They did eat their bread with gladneſs, and ſingleneſs of heart, praiſing God: mark what follows; having favor with all the people, and God added to the Church: Singleneſs of heart makes Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion lovely.</p>
                  <p>But what is that uprightneſs, and ſingleneſs of heart <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> that we are to walk withal?</p>
                  <p>By that I mean this; namely, to be ſure that there <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> be an anſwerableneſs in our converſation unto all thoſe principles of godlineſs that we profeſs: for take the moſt ſtrict principles of Religion, and the men of the world cannot ſpeak againſt them, and when it comes to, this is all they have to ſay, <hi>Ah! if it were in truth, and in ſincerity, it were ſomething, but they are hypocrites:</hi> they acknowledge the principles are right, but they think the principles are ſo ſtrict, that it is impoſſible to walk up to them: <hi>Ah! ſay they, give me one that does walk up to his principles, and we will ſay ſomething to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, you that are godly, conſider of the many principles of godlineſs that you profeſs: as namely, that <hi>the leaſt ſin</hi> is a greater evil, then all the evils in the world; and labor that all your whole life <note place="margin">What ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs of heart is.</note> may hold out this principle, fearing the leaſt ſin, and the leaſt occaſion of ſin. It is our principle, that we muſt make <hi>the Word the Rule of all our actions:</hi> Now let your converſations hold out this principle before others; And that the <hi>peace of conſcience</hi> is of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57146:156"/>
infinite more value, then all the delights of the world: Hold out this principle; That the <hi>glory of God</hi> is the thing to be aimed at in all things. Now the care of Gods people, if they would ſo walk, as to draw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in love of communion with them, is not to talk of theſe things, but to hold them forth in their lives, that men that converſe with them, may read them in their lives; Gods people ſhould ſo walk, that if there were no talking of ſuch principles, yet they may be found in their converſations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if you would ſo walk, as to draw others in love of communion with you, then walk ſo, that <note place="margin">3.</note> thoſe that are without may ſee a conſtant evenneſs, and proportion in your ways, that one action may be proportionable to another; let them take us when they will, and where they will, we are always the ſame: though there be never ſo much forwardneſs in ſome of Gods ways, if there be not forwardneſs in others, there can be no conviction, and there is no beauty: As in nature, ſo in grace; The beauty of nature is proportion; the beauty of nature is not in the greatneſs of one member, or in colour, but in the proportion: So the beauty of a Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, lies in the proportion of a Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; that there may be ſuitableneſs between one thing and another, that the men of the world may not ſee us halt: Many are hot in ſome one thing, and remiſs in others: I condemn not forwardneſs in any way of God, but where a man is forward in one thing, and remiſs in another, there is a diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his ways, he goes long and ſhort; as where one leg is ſhorter then another, there muſt needs be halting; this is a diſhonor to Religion, this takes away
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57146:157"/>
the beauty of Religion, and ſuch as theſe are, will never convince any of the excellency that is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if you would walk ſo, as to draw others <note place="margin">4.</note> in love to communion with you, then labor for to be eminent in thoſe things that the men of the world have skill in.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, the works of <hi>juſtice:</hi> The men of the <note place="margin">1.</note> world think men muſt be juſt in all their ways, and all their dealings; and though it be true there may be juſtice where there is onely morality, yet there can be no Religion where there is not Juſtice, for Religion teaches Juſtice more then <hi>morality</hi> does; it is a ſhameful thing for men that make profeſſion of Religion, not to be raiſed above moralities: now when the men of the world that have skill in this, ſhall ſee that godlineſs teaches men to be juſt, and that their's is a more accurate juſtice then that which is in the world, this convinces men; but when they ſhall ſee men talking ſo much of <hi>godlineſs,</hi> and Church<hi>-diſcipline,</hi> and yet when they come to deal with them, they are then ſo cunning, and will fetch over men as well as any, as griping as any, and men know not where to finde them, theſe are burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Members to a Church, that wrong Religion: your injuſtice in dealing with men, is a greater evil then the injuſtice of any moral man, in this regard, the injuſtice of a moral man does not make men ſhy of dealing with all moral men, but injuſtice in you makes men ſhy of dealing with any that make profeſſion of Religion, and to ſay, none are ſo deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as they; and though that objection does come uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from malice, yet it cannot be denyed, but thoſe
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:57146:157"/>
that make profeſſion, give too too much advantage for it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, labor for an eminency in performing the duties of your relations, and your callings. As <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>wives</hi> ſhould fulfil their duties, and every one be faithful in the duty that God requires of their places, and if this be not in you, you may talk your hearts out of the excellency of communion with Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they will not believe you: And therefore the Apoſtle, when he urges the Church of God ſo to walk as to convince others; mark how he inſtances in the duties of relation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Having your converſation honeſt amongst the Gentiles, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ſpeak againſt you as evil doers, they may by your good works which they ſhall behold, glorifie God in the day of viſitation:</hi> But what good works muſt we do, which they beholding ſhall glorifie God in the day of viſitation? You ſhall finde he inſtances in the duties of <hi>relation,</hi> as between <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Subjects, Maſters</hi> and <hi>Servants, Husbands</hi> and <hi>Wives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, you <hi>ſervants</hi> that are under ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, eſpecially under carnal <hi>Governors,</hi> let them ſee, ſince you have joyned with Gods people, that you are more faithful and obedient then ever before, and that they never had any ſervant in their lives, ſo ſubject, and obedient, and faithful as you are, that did not make that profeſſion that you do. And ſo <hi>wives,</hi> carry ſuch reſpect, and ſhew ſuch humility towards your <hi>husbands,</hi> though they be naught, that they may ſay, Since my wife made this profeſſion of Religion, I finde it in her carriage; and ſo <hi>children.</hi> It is a wonderful ſhameful thing that any <hi>ſervant</hi> or
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:57146:158"/>
                     <hi>childe,</hi> that is but civil, ſhould go beyond a godly ſervant or childe in diligence, and obedience, and faithfulneſs; ſays <hi>Jerome,</hi> What a ſhameful thing is <note place="margin">Ut non prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtet ſides, quod prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitit infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitas.</note> it, <hi>That faith ſhould not enable to do that, which Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels are able to do?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The men of the world have skill in <note place="margin">3.</note> peaceable diſpoſitions, labor to be of a peaceable diſpoſition: <hi>Bleſſed are the peacemakers;</hi> let them not ſee rigidneſs in your ways. The Jews obſerve upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 3. that there was no iron amongſt the ſtuff of the Tabernacle: What do rigid iron diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Gods Tabernacle, in Gods Church?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they have skill in affability, and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; Religion does not teach men to be ſowre, <note place="margin">4.</note> but as courteouſneſs and affability is a moral vertue, ſo it is to be carried in a higher way in Chriſtians then in others. Many men who have no grace, ſeem to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themſelves like Chriſtians; what a ſhame then is it for Chriſtians, who have grace, not to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like men?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the men of the world have skill in love, and therefore be eminent in that, that they may ſee your <note place="margin">5.</note> love towards one another, bearing one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. As the curtains of the Tabernacle were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together by loops, ſo ſhould the members of the Church be joyned one to another by love. In the Primitive times we finde the Heathens, and enemies of the Church, did acknowledge there were no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world did love one another ſo as Chriſtians did. The Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is blamed for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; <hi>Philadelphia</hi> ſignifies <hi>brotherly love;</hi> when brotherly love rules in Churches, they grow to a blameleſs converſation before God and man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:57146:158"/>
Sixthly, be bountiful, and liberal: The men of the world having skill in theſe things, and they ſeeing no <note place="margin">6.</note> eminency of theſe in you, they ſay, Let them make what profeſſion they will in thoſe things we have no skill in, we believe them not, they are a company of falſe hearted people.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if you would walk ſo, as to draw others in love to communion with you, labor to manifeſt the power of godlineſs, by doing ſuch things as the men of the world cannot do; if the men of the world can ſee, that men that make profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are able to do that they cannot do, they ſee now there is ſome reality in Religion. You know how it was with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Magicians;</hi> all the while <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought ſuch things that <hi>Pharaohs Magicians</hi> could do, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was not convinced; but when <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſuch things, that the <hi>Magicians</hi> could not do, this convinced them: and ſo for you to do that the men of the world do, or can do, this does not convince them; ſays Chriſt, <hi>If I had not done ſuch things as no man did, you had had no ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is it to do thoſe things which the men of the <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> world cannot do?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the reſiſting of <hi>ſtrong temptations;</hi> every <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſlight temptation overcomes them, but when they <note place="margin">1.</note> ſhall ſee you ſtand out againſt powerful temptations, they ſee you have a power beyond theirs. When <note place="margin">Wherein a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> outſtrips the men of the <hi>world.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaw the three Children <hi>in the fiery furnace,</hi> and they were not touched by the fire, he was convinced; ſo when the men of the world ſhall ſee you in the midſt of prevailing temptations, and you keep your ſelves untouched, they will be convinced,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57146:159"/>
and ſay, <hi>Surely there is a power</hi> with theſe <hi>that we have not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the overcoming of <hi>ſtrong paſsions,</hi> this convinces them: When as thoſe you live withal, ſhall <note place="margin">2.</note> know there was a time you were outragious, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at every thing that did diſpleaſe you, and ſince God hath wrought on your hearts, you can be <hi>meek,</hi> and <hi>patient,</hi> and thoſe paſſions and temptations cannot overcome you <hi>now,</hi> that did before. When Chriſt commanded the <hi>winds</hi> and <hi>ſeas,</hi> and they were ſtill <hi>at his word,</hi> they wondred and ſaid, <hi>Who is this, that the winds and ſeas obey him?</hi> And ſo, when you have ſtorms and paſſions ariſe in you, and you by the word of God can make all quiet, men will wonder, and ſay, <hi>Who is this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if you be able to deny your ſelves <hi>in your wills</hi> and <hi>ends,</hi> this is a thing they cannot do; but <note place="margin">3.</note> now the godly, if there come any word of God to ſhew their <hi>wills</hi> are not right, they do not only change the thing their will is upon, but their will is bowed to Gods word. And as it was with <hi>David,</hi> when he had <hi>Saul</hi> at an advantage, and might have had his own will upon <hi>Saul,</hi> and yet ſpared him, how did this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>Saul?</hi> Who having his Enemy, would have ſpared him? As if he had ſaid, <hi>If I had had thee at an advantage,</hi> at my own will, <hi>I muſt have had my ends;</hi> And ſo is there any thing that the men of the world can ſee you may have your ends in, you ſhould rather deny your ſelves in them.</p>
                  <p>Brethren, Gods people are to ſtrive, and contend with the world above all people, and that for God; now then, that we may manifeſt unto the world, that when we do contend with them, that it is meerly-for
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:57146:159"/>
God, when it comes to our ſelves, and our own cauſes, we ſhould be the moſt yieldable people in the world. There is a time when we muſt contend with the world, our conſciences put us upon it, and the cauſe of God puts us upon it, and then they ſay we are ſtubborn proud ſpirits; now to take off this reproach, and to convince them, it is not ſelf-will; therefore when it is onely your own cauſe, yield to the utmoſt you can, and this will convince them, when you do not yield, that it is not for ſelf, but for God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, do good for evil, this is that which the men of the world cannot do. We muſt labor to do <note place="margin">4.</note> ſome ſingular thing for God; if you onely do good for good, the Publicans can do ſo, but we muſt do good for evil. As it is reported of Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> they uſed to ſay of him, <hi>If they would have Biſhop</hi> Cranmer <hi>their friend, let them do him ſome ill turn:</hi> Do you not think how you may be even with them that have done you an ill turn, but rather go home, and all the way you are going, be muſing, and ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how you may return ſome good to that man that hath done you wrong, and ſo you ſhall not be <hi>even</hi> with him, but above him; by this you ſhall <hi>heap coals of fire upon his head:</hi> This beſeems the people of God, that are the peculiar of God. It was a notable ſpeech that <hi>Balaam</hi> had in <hi>Numbers</hi> 23. 9. <hi>Lo, the people ſhall dwell alone, and ſhall not be reckoned among the Nations:</hi> They are a people pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar amongſt themſelves; if they be ſuch a people as are ſo peculiar, as they muſt not be reckoned amongſt the Nations, then they muſt do ſuch things, as cannot be reckoned amongſt the ways and works of the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:57146:160"/>
Nations. If we ſhould read all Authors of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, yet we may finde ſuch things in Gods people, as we cannot finde in all the Authors.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, be <hi>joyful in affliction,</hi> rejoycing in God <note place="margin">5.</note> and Chriſt, then when all outward delight fails in very convincing: If people ſpeak ſo much of faith, <hi>and living by faith</hi> on the promiſes, and yet if they be croſt in any thing in the world, their hearts are as low and ſinking as the hearts of any; when men of the world ſee this, they ſay, Where is all their <hi>faith?</hi> But if they ſee when affliction comes, even ſuch as would make their hearts ſink, and the people of God carry them out chearfully, they will ſay, <hi>Surely there is ſome real principle in them that we cannot ſee.</hi> As <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> when he ſaw the Chriſtians ſuffer ſuch great things ſo chearfully, ſays he, <hi>Surely theſe men have more then the men of the world, they have other principles,</hi> and ſo he enquired what maner of people they were, and ſo came to embrace the truth.</p>
                  <p>It is not ſo much to be merry and joyful over their cups; the people of God cannot be merry and joyful in ſenſual delights, but put them into afflictions and hardſhips, and they can be chearful more then you, they are not ſo dumpiſh and ſad as the men of the world think they are. Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I have meat to eat of which you know not of:</hi> The light of the <hi>candle</hi> is fed with ſtinking tallow, but the light of the Sun hath influence from Heaven to feed it, and ſo is not ſoon blown out: And ſo the joys of Gods people have other matter to feed them, and are not ſo ſoon puffed out as the joys of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:57146:160"/>
Sixthly, in the people of God there ſhould be <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs</hi> mixed with chearfulneſs, and the mixture <note place="margin">6.</note> of both theſe makes Religion beautiful; for if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Religion will be merry, they preſently run into a lightneſs, and vanity of Spirit; and if they think to be ſerious, they preſently grow dumpiſh and ſullen; but if we could do ſo, be ſo chearful in our way, as to manifeſt ſeriouſneſs, and ſo ſerious, as to manifeſt chearfulneſs, this will be a mighty convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the world.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, the men of the world cannot be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the encreaſe of <hi>gifts;</hi> but the more encreaſe <note place="margin">7.</note> of gifts Gods people have, the more humble they ſhould be. They ſhall ſee ſince the people of God did cloſe one with another, they are encreaſed in gifts; a poor boy, or girl, or ſervant, that underſtood nothing before, <hi>now</hi> they can underſtand more, and with their underſtanding their hearts are more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then before; this is a great convincement, That in the exerciſe of your gifts, there may not appear much of <hi>your ſelves,</hi> but much <hi>of God,</hi> is that you ſhould much labor after in the exerciſe of your gifts; let them ſee that God hath acquainted you with ſuch divine myſteries, as ſhould make them admire; Gods people ſhould not onely labor to have words that are flat, but to have ſuch gifts, as that they ſhould know the ſecrets of God, and of their own hearts, and of the hearts of others. You know when he in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. that was ignorant came into the Church, and ſaw gifts ſo exerciſed, as the ſecrets of his heart were opened, he ſaid, <hi>Surely God is there.</hi> We ſhould not exerciſe gifts ſo, as to ſhew our parts in them, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe them in ſuch an humble maner, as to convince
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57146:161"/>
the world of the excellency in communion with the Saints.</p>
                  <p>O brethren, labor to practice theſe things: O what a bleſſed thing were it that all of us might come to convert ſouls! Though <hi>women</hi> may not preach in the Church, they may preach abroad in their <hi>lives,</hi> and in their <hi>families,</hi> by their humble and godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 16. <hi>What knoweſt thou, O wife, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy husband?</hi> Labor ſo to walk, as ſome ſoul may bleſs God for you, and bleſs God for your joyning with his people: Heretofore I was a poor ignorant wretch, and minded nothing but to ſatisfie the fleſh, and heard many Sermons, and they never wrought upon me, but now I ſee the holy converſation of ſuch, this works upon me; No mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Church ſhould ſatisfie himſelf, until he have ſeen himſelf to work upon ſome by his converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The people that God intends to bring to joyn with his Church, are ſaid <hi>to flye like Doves to their windows, Iſaiah</hi> 60. 8. Now <hi>Doves</hi> love white, clean, and lightſome places; wherefore ſuch ſhould be our converſations, ſo <hi>white, clean,</hi> and <hi>lightſome,</hi> as thoſe in whom God begins any work of grace, to be of Dove-like diſpoſitions, may come flying to us; and this is the fourth branch of the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if there be ſo much good to be had in this <hi>communion,</hi> labor to walk ſo one with another, that <note place="margin">5.</note> when any come to joyn with you, they may finde that made good which they heard of: though they do ſuffer affliction to come and joyn with you, yet when they are come in, they may finde all made up, that they may ſay, <hi>Before</hi> I heard by the ſpeech
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:57146:161"/>
of others, there was ſuch a comfortable life in communion with ſuch, which made me venture much, and <hi>now</hi> I have found it made up to the full; yea, half of it was not told to me: O let us not give occaſion to any to go and complain to God, and ſay, I heard there was much good to be had in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with thy people, and thereupon I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to venture much to enjoy it, and now I finde no ſuch thing, I finde nothing but jealouſies, and wranglings, and pride, and as much earthlineſs as before: If you give any occaſion to go to God, and to make his moan thus, it will go ill with you; but give occaſion to others to bleſs God for you: therefore let there be a ſweet union among you. It is a promiſe in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. <hi>They ſhall ſerve the Lord with one conſent,</hi> with one <hi>ſhoulder,</hi> ſo the words are: So every one of you ſhould ſet your ſelves to ſerve the Lord, quickning one anothers ſpirits, careful for one anothers good.</p>
                  <p>And when you come together, bring your <hi>living ends</hi> together: When you lay brands together, you do not lay the dead ends together, they will never kindle, but you lay the living burning ends toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo they kindle: And ſo when you come together, lay your living ends together, that when you go away, you may ſay, I feel my heart warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; you ſhould never meet together, but that you might bleſs God for your meeting, and by this you ſhall ſhew there is a power in this Ordinance of God.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable, the great ſtrength that there is in a civil Ordinance, one would think there ſhould be more in a ſpiritual Ordinance: How comes it
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57146:162"/>
to paſs, that two, that it may be a moneth or two before were meer ſtrangers, and yet they coming to joyn in marriage, if it be a true joyning, their hearts cloſe more together, then to <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mother,</hi> to their children, that came out of their own bodies, or <hi>brother,</hi> or <hi>ſiſters</hi> that lay in the ſame womb, they cannot have their hearts ſo knit together, as theſe two have: From whence comes this? From the vertue of Gods Ordinance; if it were not an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, it could not produce ſuch an effect: If <hi>marriage,</hi> which is an Ordinance of God in civil things, and ſo a civil Ordinance, have ſuch power to unite the heart, how much more ſpiritual <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>communion,</hi> which is the higheſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance for uniting the heart? and therefore we ſhould look for more then a natural power in it: For people to love one another, and to do good to one another, hath a natural power to unite the heart; But do you look upon this communion as having the greateſt power to unite the heart, by vertue of an Ordinance, that ſo all who have ſuffered never ſo much to joyn with you, may ſee all recompenced up to the full, and never have a repenting thought for that they have ſuffered and ventured.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXIV. <hi>We ſhould ſatisfie our ſelves in communion with the Saints, and improve it to the utmoſt advantage we can.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AGain, another branch of the exhortation is this; if there be ſo much good to be had in <note place="margin">6.</note> this <hi>communion,</hi> labor to ſatisfie your ſelves in it, ſo as to take heed of breaking from it; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the aſſemblies of the Saints, is made by the Apoſtle an argument of Apoſtacy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. <hi>Not forſaking the aſſembling our ſelves together, as the maner of ſome is.</hi> Do not think to go and make up your comfort with going, and joyning with the world. Certainly, when men that are members of a Church ſhall for form come and joyn with Gods people, but their conſciences tell them, when they are in the world, their hearts are more content and ſatisfied; this is an argument of a carnal heart, that hath dallied with God. It is a diſhonor to godly men; as men that are raiſed to high priviledges, count it a diſhonor to company with thoſe that are mean. Thoſe who were free of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> were not to be free of any other place. It is enough that we are Citizens of the <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> let us ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our ſelves in this.</p>
                  <p>Godly men, though never ſo poor, are to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who are carnal, as baſe and vile, eſpecially to think to take ſatisfaction in <hi>eating,</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> and <hi>playing</hi> with them, when as there are ſuch holy Ordinances, and high priviledges with Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to ſatisfie your ſelves in, and in thoſe your hearts

withdraw from them; Certainly, your hearts muſt needs be very carnal and ſenſual: Can God take it well at thy hands, to go and ſhake hands with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? <hi>Job</hi> 8. 20. God will not take the wicked by the hand; ſo it is in ſome of your books; Why then will you? Canſt thou be in any place where thou ſeeſt God diſhonored, and be merry? Certainly, the ſight of ſin, whereſoever it is committed, ſhould cauſe horror in the heart; thus it was with <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 119. 53. <hi>Horror hath taken hold upon me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the wicked that forſake thy Law:</hi> It ſhould make men forbear to come into ſuch company where they ſee ſin committed.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of <hi>Mezentius</hi> the <hi>Hetrurian</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that he deviſed this torment, to chain <hi>a live man,</hi> and <hi>a dead man</hi> together, and ſo whereſoever he went, he ſhould have the <hi>dead man</hi> to rot before him, and ſtink in his noſtrils, till he was poyſoned with it: Surely this was a great miſery, a moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous death: And Gods people ſhould count it as great an evil to have filthy <hi>dead wretches,</hi> that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury in any thing that is good, <hi>to be joyned</hi> with them: <hi>David</hi> prays in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 9. <hi>Gather not my ſoul with ſinners:</hi> Would you not have your ſouls ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered with ſinners hereafter? for the preſent take heed of joyning with them. It was the prayer once that I have heard of a good Gentlewoman, when ſhe was to dye, being in much trouble of conſcience, <hi>O Lord, let me not go to hell where the wicked are,</hi> for <hi>Lord thou knoweſt, I never loved their company here:</hi> She prayed with <hi>David, Lord gather not my ſoul with ſinners:</hi> If you would have evidence that God will not gather your ſouls to ſinners, but that he
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57146:163"/>
will gather them to the godly, labor to ſatisfie your ſouls with Gods people.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, if there be ſo much good in this way, labor to improve it to the utmoſt: <hi>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool?</hi> This is a great price; if many had ſeen the days that we have ſeen, how would they have bleſſed God? what uſe would they have made of them? Seeing God therefore hath given you this opportunity, improve it: if you have any advantage in your trading, you will improve it. Take heed of ſuch things as may hinder that good you may have in communion with the Saints: What are they?</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing that I would forewarn Chriſtians <note place="margin">What hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders our profiting by the Saints commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> of, it is <hi>ſullenneſs of ſpirit,</hi> that makes them love <hi>ſolitarineſs</hi> rather then communion; and this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many that have true grace: and certainly it comes ſometimes from abundance of pride, for if they come among others, they think they ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their weakneſs, and rather then they will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their weakneſs, they will deprive themſelves of all that good which they might have. Conſider how unfaithfully you deal with God, God hath given you a talent, and you are not to wrap it up in a napkin, but to uſe it for God. Again, it is a wrong to the Church, for your <hi>gifts</hi> are not your own, but the Church hath an intereſt in them, and therefore you are to uſe them for their good. Again, you do much wrong to the Ordinance of God, when you do prefer the contenting of a pettiſh humor, before the Ordinance of God. God threatens it as a judgement, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4. 16. <hi>To feed his people as a Lamb in a large place;</hi> that is, to ſcatter them from the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57146:164"/>
fold, that they ſhould go one and one, as a <hi>Lamb</hi> bleating alone in the wilde wilderneſs: take heed you do not bring it upon your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Again, there is a great deal of danger in this ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs <note place="margin">Danger of <hi>ſolitarineſs.</hi>
                     </note> of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there will ſoon grow a wonderful drineſs, and barrenneſs of ſpirit: It is juſt with God to deprive <note place="margin">1.</note> men of <hi>gifts,</hi> that have not hearts to improve the gifts that God hath given them.</p>
                  <p>Again, you will be ready to run into error, and <note place="margin">2.</note> ſtrange conceits; for if you obſerve the workings of your hearts, you have ſtrange opinions of things, and think you are ſure of them, and when you come amongſt others, though you could not ſee the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your opinions, others can quickly ſee them, whereas if you will not come amongſt them, but be ſtiff in your opinions, you may run into errors.</p>
                  <p>Again, you will be lyable to the temptations of Satan; immoderate ſolitarineſs, is joyned with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate <note place="margin">3.</note> melancholy, which is the common ſhop of the Devil for to forge his temptations in, and it is a great evil to keep the Devils temptations cloſe; and therefore come into communion with the Saints.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, when you do come into communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, take heed of <hi>pride;</hi> pride ſometimes keeps away <note place="margin">2.</note> from communion, and <hi>pride</hi> is a great hinderance to the benefit of communion: As round things do not joyn but onely in one point, but take flat things, and they joyn in every point; and ſo hearts ſwoln with <hi>pride</hi> cannot joyn with others, but onely in ſuch particulars as will ſerve their turns, but if we
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57146:164"/>
have plain hearts, we will cloſe in all things. If a bladder be blown with wind, when you touch it or handle it, it goes away, but when it is pricked, it falls, and you may handle it: ſo hearts that are ſwoln with pride, will not cloſe as low humble hearts will. A ſwoln member is fit for nothing, but all members muſt ſerve that; As a gouty leg, all the members muſt tend that, but it is unfit to be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any: and ſo <hi>a proud heart,</hi> it expects every one ſhould attend it, but when it comes to be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any, it is unfit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, take heed of <hi>envying</hi> at the gifts and graces of one another; the wicked men of the world <note place="margin">3.</note> do envy one another, becauſe the good they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as their laſt end, is ſo ſtrait, that if one have much room, the other is ſtraitned; but the godly need not be ſtraitned, their good is in God, and they have place enough to expatiate themſelves, and ſatisfie themſelves. If men were riding or ſailing in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſſage, they would envy him that were ſailing before them, that hinders; but in the Sea they do not envy them, becauſe they have room enough to ſail: So in Chriſtians that place their happineſs in God, where there is room enough, there ſhould not be envy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, take heed of <hi>pettiſhneſs,</hi> and <hi>frowardneſs,</hi> or <hi>paſſions,</hi> theſe do darken communion: the meek <note place="margin">4.</note> ſpirit is fit for communion. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuffered much for communion with Gods people, and indeed he was fit to get good, and to do good by <hi>communion,</hi> he was <hi>the meekeſt man upon earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, take heed of <hi>ſelf-ends</hi> in communion: when men are ſo politick, as to wheel about their <note place="margin">5.</note>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:57146:165"/>
                     <hi>own ends,</hi> and not ſeem to aym at ſuch things, this hinders the ſweetneſs of <hi>communion,</hi> and though ſuch may carry things a while, as not to be diſcerned, yet at laſt they will be diſcerned to have ſelf-ends, and all will be ſhy of them. If you would have ſweet communion indeed, labor for open hearts to one another, that you may truſt one another.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, labor ſo to <hi>improve your communion now,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> as every time you do enjoy it, it may make your hearts to ſpring, putting you in minde of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed communion you ſhall have with God, and his people; and think thus, If we finde ſo much joy, in enjoying communion with Gods people here, what will there be in that communion our ſouls ſhall have in Heaven, when we ſhall not onely have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with ſome few of Gods ſervants, but with all, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs?</hi> As <hi>Cicero</hi> hath a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <note place="margin">
                        <hi>O praecla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum diem, cúm ad il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Concili um coetum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcar; &amp; cum ex hac turba &amp; colluvione diſcedam: proficiſcar enim non ad cos ſolum viros de quibus ante dixi, ſed etiam ad Catonem meum, &amp;c.</hi> Cicero de ſenectute.</note> ſpeech concerning the happineſs of his death; O famous day, that I ſhall go to the counſels of thoſe famous men, that I ſhall go from this rout of people, and go and converſe with thoſe famous men! But brethren, for us to think that we through Gods mercy, here have communion with Gods people, and ſhall hereafter enjoy communion with the Saints of God for ever, what is it worth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during? if it were but the enjoying of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with <hi>Moſes</hi> alone, it were worth all you have endured; and therefore comfort your ſelves for the preſent in that you have, and let your hearts be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in hope of better things hereafter, when you ſhall have them perfect. Now we rejoyce that we are with Gods people, if they be conferring about
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:57146:165"/>
any thing of God and Chriſt; but hereafter we ſhall ſee nothing but God in his Saints, we ſhall ſee the full glory of God ſhining in them; then the very bodies of the Saints ſhall ſhine more glorious then the <hi>Sun;</hi> How glorious ſhall their ſouls be then? There ſhall <hi>then</hi> be no more danger of fallings out, and frampold carriages, no more jealouſies and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitions, but we ſhall ſee the image of God perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them; and we ſhall have perfect love to rejoyce in the ſalvation of any as in your own ſalvation, and then we ſhall be with them in all holy exerciſes: It is good to be with Gods people, to trade with them, but better to be with them to <hi>pray</hi> with them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Sacraments</hi> with them; the better the exerciſe is, the better it is to be with them: Then what is it to enjoy communion with them, and to be always in holy exerciſes, always ſinging praiſes <hi>to the Lamb,</hi> and giving glory to him <hi>that ſitteth on the Throne for evermore,</hi> bleſſing God for the great Myſtery of the Goſpel? And therefore improve your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſo here, as not onely to put you in minde of your communion hereafter, but to prepare and fit your ſouls for it: And thus is this point finiſhed; and now we are come to the ſeventh and laſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal point, out of <hi>Moſes his Choice,</hi> which is from the laſt words of the Verſe, <hi>Then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrinal Concluſion is this:</p>

                     <hi>THat whatſoever is but for a ſeaſon, cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie a gracious heart:</hi> Or, <hi>Nothing but that</hi>

                     <hi>which is eternal, can ſatisfie a gracious heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes,</hi> if he would have been ſatisfied with any thing that abided but for a ſeaſon, he might have had ſatisfaction enough; but his heart was ſet upon eternity, and therefore could have no ſatisfaction in things that were but for a ſeaſon. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>We look not at things that are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen; for the things which are ſeen are temporal, but the things which are not ſeen are eternal.</hi> We do not ſo much as look at things ſeen, for they are temporal, but there are other things that our hearts are upon, which are eternal; we look not at things that are ſeen, but at things not ſeen: The word notes theſe two things eſpecially, not onely that we believe things that are not ſeen, eternal things, but we look at them, we minde them; we do not much minde things that are temporal, but eternal things are minded of us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we do not make things that are <hi>ſeen,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> that are <hi>temporal,</hi> to be our ſcope and aim; that which ſatisfies the heart, is that which is looked at as the end, and aim, and ſcope of the ſpirit: ſo that if a man could look at things ſeen as his aim and ſcope, they would ſatisfie him, but nothing that is ſeen can be the ſcope and aim of a gracious heart, but eternal things are his ſcope and aim, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſatisfie him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:57146:166"/>
That nothing which is but for a ſeaſon, can ſatisfie a heart rightly principled, appears: <note place="margin">No tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral thing can ſatisfie a <hi>ſpiritual heart.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe there is no proportion between an immortal ſoul, and fading tranſitory things; indeed the ſenſitive ſoul that does depend upon the preſent temper of the body, that is ſatisfied onely with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things, and the reaſon is, becauſe it depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which is preſent; but the rational ſoul being immortal, and not depending upon any ſuch thing, whatſoever it be that continues not for ever, cannot ſatisfie it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a gracious heart knows the things of <note place="margin">2.</note> eternity after another maner then any other does, God hath revealed eternal things to it, and upon the ſight of thoſe eternal things, it comes to know it is taken off from all temporal things; for all temporal things, be they never ſo glorious, yet in compariſon of eternal, they are but as the point of a centre to an infinite circumference: Indeed while a man knows no better then temporal things, the heart is let out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as the greateſt good, but when it comes to know the things of eternity, the heart is greatned, and all temporal things are but ſmall to that ſoul; when it comes to know what an eternal God is, and what an eternal crown is, and an eternal inheritance, when it knows that God does intend to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf eternally to his creature, it cannot be ſatisfied, unleſs it knows it ſhall live to enjoy thoſe things that God ſhall communicate eternally.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a gracious ſpirit hath received an eternal principle within it, that does work the heart beyond things for a ſeaſon, that works the heart all to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for the work of Grace that is in the ſoul, it
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:57146:167"/>
is begotten of the immortal ſeed of the Word, and it is an eternal principle, that is infuſed by God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and therefore it works beyond things that are for a ſeaſon; every creature works according to the nature of its principles; as ſenſitive creatures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto ſenſitive principles, and rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures according unto rational principles, but grace is beyond reaſon, and is of an everlaſting nature, and therefore it works the heart beyond all that is but for a ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a gracious heart cannot be ſatisfied with things that are but for a ſeaſon, becauſe God <note place="margin">4.</note> hath loved ſuch a heart with an eternal love, and there is the impreſſion of the ſame love in the ſoul, that carries the ſoul to God in ſome meaſure with that love wherewith it is loved, that cauſes the ſoul to love God with an eternal love, and not to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with any work of love that it can work in time; and therefore grace muſt have eternity for to manifeſt the love again that it hath to God, or elſe it hath not a love proportionable in its meaſure to the love wherewith God hath loved it, but that is in every gracious heart.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, there is a kinde of image of Gods <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs</hi> in the ſouls of men, and according to this <note place="margin">5</note> print of Gods infiniteneſs, the enjoyment of God is deſired, where the heart is gracious: though it is true, our ſouls are not infinite creatures in themſelves, yet having a print of Gods infiniteneſs upon them, they manifeſt this in their infinite deſires; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot enjoy an actual infinite good in themſelves, therefore they deſire an infinite good in duration at leaſt; let there be never ſo much good,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:57146:167"/>
yea, as much as an infinite power can let out for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent good, yet this does not ſatisfie the ſoul, unleſs it can have it infinitely for duration; for an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſoul knows that it is not capable to hold that good that an infinite God can, and hath a purpoſe to communicate to his creature, if it ſhould come all together, therefore it deſires to enjoy communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what good it is capable of to all eternity. To receive good from God is not ſufficient, except it be received in an infinite way; now it cannot receive any thing infinite for the preſent, and therefore it muſt have it in an infinite way in regard of duration.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, there is nothing that is but for a ſeaſon, <note place="margin">6.</note> can ſatisfie a gracious heart, but it muſt be ſome <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thing,</hi> becauſe ſuch a one hath received light from God to underſtand the infinite conſequence of <hi>eternity,</hi> to make any good to be infinite, or any evil to be infinite: When as one enjoys any <hi>good,</hi> and knows it ſhall continue infinitely, it makes that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent good to have a kinde of <hi>infiniteneſs in it;</hi> and and ſo for evil, if there be any evil upon the heart, though the evil ſhould be never ſo little, yet if it be an evil, and the ſoul knows it muſt continue infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it puts a kinde of <hi>infiniteneſs</hi> to every moment; and that is the principal thing that makes the miſery of the damned to be ſo miſerable, and the happineſs of the godly ſo happy; they are not onely <hi>happy</hi> and miſerable, becauſe they ſhall be happy and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable</hi> for ever, but becauſe they know there is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinance</hi> in happineſs, and in miſery; their knowledge of this is that which puts infinite weight upon every moment.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe a beaſt ſhould have happineſs ſuitable to
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:57146:168"/>
its nature for eternity, that would come infinitely ſhort of the happineſs of a rational creature, that knows wherein happineſs conſiſts, and what eternity is; for the beaſt enjoys nothing but the preſent hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but a reaſonable creature it hath happineſs for the preſent, and it can by the thoughts of the minde fetch in the infiniteneſs of the duration, and put it upon the preſent content it receives, and ſo have infinite ſatisfaction every moment: And ſo for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; it were not ſo much if God by his power ſhould hold a brute beaſt in the fire eternally, as if a man were in miſery; becauſe though it hath pains, yet it hath no thought of future pains, but what it now feels: But if a rational creature be in miſery, by the thoughts of his minde, he can fetch all the pains that ſhall be in hundred thouſands of years, and put them upon that inſtant, and this makes it to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable indeed, in a kinde of infiniteneſs, beyond that which any other creature is capable of.</p>
                  <p>You think to be tortured with fire is miſerable, and to be ſo eternally is miſerable; but there is ſomething more, every inſtant you ſhall be in miſery, there ſhall be a kinde of infiniteneſs, becauſe you ſhall by your thoughts bring whatſoever is to come, and put it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the preſent moment, and nothing can ſwallow up a mans ſpirit ſo much as this, if he underſtands eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Now then a gracious heart that knows this, that knows what the conſequence of eternity is, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſatisfied, except it hath made good proviſion for eternity; whatſoever it enjoys for the preſent, cannot ſatisfie the ſoul, unleſs it hath made good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for that which it underſtands, to be of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite conſequence as it is. A ſoul that underſtands
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57146:168"/>
the conſequence of eternity, ſees it as an infinite O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, that it is lanching into, and muſt for ever ſwim in: Now if a man were to go a voyage in the vaſt Ocean, that he muſt go thouſands of miles, could he be content that he had made proviſion of ſuch a Veſſel, that he could make ſhift to get over ſome narrow water with? ſo it is here; yea, this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude comes ſhort of the expreſſion of the folly of any that knows any thing concerning eternity, to think to ſatisfie themſelves in any thing that is but for a ſeaſon; for any thing that is but for a ſeaſon, let it be for as long a ſeaſon as you will, if it were for <hi>Methuſelahs</hi> ſeaſon, that is but as ſome ſmall Brook, and what is this to the going of many thouſand miles in the infinite vaſt Ocean? and therefore a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart knowing the vaſtneſs of it, except it hath made ſome proviſion for it, can never be quieted with what it can enjoy for a ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, a gracious heart cannot be ſatisfied in <note place="margin">7.</note> any thing that is but for a ſeaſon, becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is but for a ſeaſon, but it can make the <hi>end</hi> of it as really preſent; If ſo be that the end of things that are but for a ſeaſon were preſent, they could not ſatisfie: Now a gracious heart makes the end of all things that are but for a ſeaſon to be really preſent: If <hi>grace</hi> enables a man to make the things of God, and eternal things to be <hi>preſent,</hi> much more will grace in the heart make the end of all worldly things to be <hi>really</hi> preſent: Now a gracious heart being wiſe, and conſidering, and looking upon theſe things that are but for a ſeaſon, as if the end now were; hence it is that it hath the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things that are but for a ſeaſon now, as it
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:57146:169"/>

                     </note> then every man will ſee the vanity of them, and cry out of them, and ſay they will not ſatisfie: Yea, we ſhall not onely ſee the vanity of them, but in ſome reſpect ſee it a greater miſery, then if we had never enjoyed them; now that thing which will not onely fail us, but when it ſhall fail us, it will be a greater vexation to us that we had them, then if we had never enjoyed it, certainly they which know this cannot be ſatisfied with it.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, a gracious heart makes uſe of all the experiences that it hath had of the vanity of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">8.</note>, of all things that are but for a ſeaſon; when God in the way of his providence gives to one that is gracious, experience of things, he will treaſure up his experience: vain light hearts, though God do give them experience of the vanity of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of things that are but for a ſeaſon, they do not treaſure up their experiences, but though they cry out of the vanity of the creature at ſome time, yet they run out again as greedily in their deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it as before: but a gracious heart findes when God takes away the creature, wherein it had placed a great deal of confidence, God hath ſhewed it how fading it was, and the ſetled condition of it is nothing but vanity: and ſo the experience of the vanity of former things, does take off his heart from any thing that it looks upon as abiding for a ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, that which is but for a ſeaſon, does want an eſpecial ingredient in it, which is required for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction <note place="margin">9.</note>: the ſpecial ingredient unto ſatisfaction, is ſecurity, that there may be ſoul-ſafe ſecurity. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>

ſays, The ſoul cannot enjoy any thing freely with ſatisfaction, unleſs it can enjoy it with ſecurity: Now when the ſoul enjoys a thing for a ſeaſon, it cannot be ſatisfied, becauſe it muſt be ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to provide ſomething when that is gone, which it hath for the preſent. So that theſe arguments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put together, you may ſee evidently, Nothing that is for a <hi>ſeaſon</hi> can give ſatisfaction to a gracious heart. Having laid theſe things in the explication of the point, all that we have to do is to apply it.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may ſee the excellency of a true graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">Uſe.</note>ſpirit: where there is grace in the ſoul, it puts a wonderful excellency upon the ſoul, as in many other reſpects, ſo this one does wonderfully declare the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of a gracious heart, that it is ſo <hi>raiſed,</hi> ſo <hi>enlarged,</hi> ſo <hi>greatned,</hi> that nothing that is for a <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> can ſatisfie it, but it looks for things <hi>beyond</hi> a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Let all the world, the things that are in Heaven and Earth, preſent themſelves to the ſoul to ſatisfie it, the ſoul will ſay, <hi>What are you, temporal</hi> or <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?</hi> If the anſwer be given <hi>temporal,</hi> the ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects them, and puts them off as too mean things to be ſatisfaction for it; If you had brought <hi>eternity</hi> with you, ſays the ſoul, I could have embraced you, and cloſed with you, and have been ſatisfied in the enjoyment of you, but if the inſcription of eternity be not in you, you are too mean for me, my happineſs <note place="margin">

                  <head>CHAP. XXVI. <hi>Perſwaſions to take off the heart from temporal things.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>SEcondly, hence let us all make uſe of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to take off our ſpirits from all earthly <note place="margin">2.</note> things that are here below; Let us look upon all things in the world as under this notion, that they are but for a ſeaſon, and let us improve this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to the utmoſt that poſſibly we can, for the working our hearts off from the things of this world. The beauty of all worldly things is but as a fair pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture drawn upon the Ice, that melts away with it; <hi>The faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</hi> When <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ſaw himſelf wounded, and in danger of death, he then ſaw the vanity of thoſe flatterers that would have perſwaded him he was <hi>a God:</hi> So when we ſee thoſe things upon which we ſet our hearts, as if our chief good, as if a Deity were in them, to be wounded, and ready to periſh, let us learn to alter our thoughts of them, to take off our hearts from them.</p>
                  <p>Much may be done in the improving of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the fading vaniſhing nature of creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts: the Scripture makes much uſe of it, to take off the hearts of People from them; <hi>Why wilt thou ſet thy heart upon that which is not? Riches have wings and will fly away.</hi> It charges them that have riches, that they <hi>truſt not in uncertain riches: Man that is made in honor abides not; They ſing to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret and Harp, and make merry, and in a moment they go down to hell.</hi> This <hi>Moſes</hi> argument, is the ſtrong
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57146:170"/>
Scripture argument: there is nothing but <hi>uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, mutability, vanity,</hi> upon every creature that is here below. The faſhion of the world paſſeth away, and the luſtre of it; there is no enduring ſubſtance here: Thoſe in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were content to part with any thing that endured but for <hi>a ſeaſon,</hi> ſo they might have an <hi>enduring ſubſtance:</hi> and ſo <hi>Abraham looked for a City that had foundations,</hi> Heb. 11. 10. theſe cities have no foundations.</p>
                  <p>All earthly things are like the earth it ſelf, it hangs upon nothing, <hi>Job</hi> 26. 7. and therefore there can be no certainty in them, no continuance in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them: neither will the things of this world <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nulla res longa mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talium eſt, omniſque foelicitas ſeculi dum tenctur amittitur.</hi> Hieron. in Eſay 38.</note> abide, they periſh in the uſing of them, and that which periſhes in the uſing, we muſt not ſet our hearts upon. Its the expreſſion of <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> The things of the world are as if a man were writing upon the water with his finger, as any thing is written, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion vaniſhes, and nothing appears; not as one were writing upon the ſand or duſt, which although any little wind blows ſmooth, yet it ſtays a while till the wind riſeth: So the creature is not <hi>vain</hi> onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it leaves us after a while, but the comfort of the creature leaves us in the uſing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, <hi>We live amongst things that are periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                        <hi>Inter peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. Cur cae quae ad uſum diuturna eſſe non poſſunt, ad ſupplicium diuturna depoſces?</hi> Ambroſe in Luc. 4. T. 5.</note>. We hear much of the vanity of the creature, and we can ſpeak much of it, but how is it improved? how if you periſh eternally for ſetting your hearts upon theſe things? and notwithſtanding all your talk, this dreadful noiſe ſhall be heard from you, <hi>We have loſt eternity, for ſetting our hearts upon things that were for a ſeaſon.</hi> It is a notable ſpeech that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> hath; <hi>Why will you make that which</hi>
                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:57146:171"/>
                     <hi>cannot be eternal</hi> for uſe, <hi>eternal for puniſhment?</hi> It is fading, in regard of the uſe, but it proves to be eternal in regard of the puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when any temptation comes, to draw your hearts to any thing that gives content to the fleſh for a ſeaſon, O that you might improve this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to reſiſt the temptation! What, ſhall I while away that time I have to improve for eternity to ſeek after you, and take content and pleaſure in you? you are not onely <hi>temporal</hi> your ſelves, but you do hazard the loſs of eternal things, and hazard the bringing of eternal evils. And therefore do not think it much that I preſs this argument, becauſe it is ordinary: all that periſh, <hi>periſh</hi> becauſe they ſet their hearts upon that which is for a ſeaſon: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the knowledge of this in ſome general notion be ordinary, yet the truth is, to know it powerfully indeed, and effectually, it is a riddle to the world.</p>
                  <p>It is a notable place we have in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 49. 3, 4. The whole ſcope of the Pſalm, is to ſhew the happy ſecure eſtate of the godly in all troubles, and the vaniſhing condition of all ungodly in proſperity; now mark how he calls to us in the beginning of this Pſalm, to hearken to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: We might ſay, this is an argument we have heard a hundred times, and know what it is, Why ſhould we hearken ſo? Though you think this is an ordinary Theam, yet this is the great wiſdom, and underſtanding of a gracious heart to know; this is the dark ſaying that I will open, ſo ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>My mouth ſhall ſpeak of wiſdom, and the meditation of my heart</hi>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:57146:171"/>
                     <hi>ſhall be of underſtanding, I will open my dark ſaying:</hi> So when you hear us ſpeaking of this argument, you ſay, This is an ordinary argument; but the true knowledge of it is a dark hidden thing to the men of the world, and it is the work of the Spirit of God, to make men know this truly: and when God works any ſaving work upon the ſoul, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in this way, to ſettle upon the ſoul this truth, That all the things that it hath ſatisfied it ſelf in, are fading; and what is a year or two, to enjoy all the contentments my heart can deſire, if then I muſt be gone, and bid farewel to all? have not I an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul? and when ſhall be the time that I ſhall provide for eternity? And therefore I beſeech you look into this argument, and ponder it a little more.</p>
                  <p>There are three <hi>worms</hi> that are in every thing of the world, to eat out the ſtrength of it, and make it fading.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the worm that is bred in the natural princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; the things that we ſet our hearts upon, are made of fading principles.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is the worm of the <hi>general curſe</hi> that is come upon them by mans ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is another worm, and that is the <hi>particular curſe</hi> that we bring upon the creatures, by our own proper ſins, as eſpecially when we ſet our hearts upon any fading tranſitory things below: all things in the world are ſubject to vanity by the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral curſe,</hi> but the <hi>particular curſe</hi> makes them more vain: and ſhall we think to ſatisfie our ſelves in the things of the world, that have theſe <hi>three worms,</hi> feeding upon them continually, to eat out the ſtrength of them?</p>

It is a good obſervation of <hi>Abulenſis,</hi> to ſhew to us the vanity of all worldly excellency, that thoſe who have been the moſt glorious, in what man accounts glorious and excellent, have had inglorious ends, by which their glory hath been ſtained; and thereby our hearts might be taken off from ſuch things, and ſet upon thoſe things which are ſo glorious as they will make us for ever glorious.

your hearts from things below, and ſay, What good will it be to me that I have been merry, and would have my will? I came to hear the word, and that was working to pull my luſt from me, but my heart was ſet upon my luſt, and I would have it: When my luſt ſhall be at an end, what good will it be to me, to remember I had my luſt and pleaſure, and delight?

have I made my ſelf a bond-ſlave to Hell for ever! One who was made according to the Image of God, who had means for eternal life, yet now am undone for ever! It is reported of <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi> the <hi>fifth,</hi> that he ſold his ſoul to the Devil, to enjoy the glory and pleaſure of the Popedom for ſeven years: What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite folly poſſeſſeth the hearts of the children of men, who were made for eternity, to venture eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſcarrying for a few years, yea, a few hearts contentment to the fleſh! The Lord keep us from this deſperate folly.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore when we finde our hearts beginning to be let out upon any temporal good, make uſe of this argument, and let us muſe with our ſelves, This content and pleaſure we have, but will it abide? I was made to abide <hi>for ever,</hi> I was made for that good that muſt abide for ever. What are a few years here? Thoſe who abide longeſt in the enjoyment of health and proſperity, their time is but as a <hi>bubble,</hi> they are gone, and the memory of them is periſhed. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays, there was a miraculous example of one <hi>Xenophilus,</hi> who lived a hundred and five years without ſickneſs: But what is this to eternity? <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</p>

<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57146:174"/>
withdrew himſelf into a room private, and fell down upon the earth, and with many tears cryed out thus unto God in prayer; <hi>O Lord,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>my heart is open unto thee, I indeed know not what to ask, but onely this, Lord let me not dye eternally; O Lord, thou knoweſt I love thee, O let me live eternally to praiſe thee!</hi> And when his mother came to him, and would have had him come to the reſt of the company that were bidden, he made an excuſe and would not, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon this meditation, becauſe he ſaw this would <hi>not hold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O that God would faſten theſe thoughts upon you, when you are in the midſt of your delights; But will this hold? Is not this one thing that is ſpoken of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, that is but for a <hi>ſeaſon?</hi> Think alſo upon this conſideration; Theſe things that are in the world, if they were a thouſand times more then they are, yet being <hi>but for a ſeaſon,</hi> this is enough to take off our hearts; but now when we conſider they are but for a ſeaſon, and but <hi>ſlight</hi> things, <hi>empty vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> beſides, this ſhould take off our hearts abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more; if they had a great deal in them, yet not being eternal, they are not very deſireable. How vain then is mans heart, in being ſet upon ſuch vain things? Well may <hi>man</hi> be ſaid to be <hi>lighter then vanity;</hi> no vanity is ſo vain, as the <hi>truſting in vanity;</hi> all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the creature amounts not to ſo much vanity as the <hi>truſting in vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet again conſider, that the <hi>emptineſs</hi> that is in theſe things, would make the eternity of them to be miſerable. You will ſay this is a riddle, how can it be made out? Certainly it is ſo, there is ſuch an <hi>emptineſs</hi> in the things of the world, that they are

Look at the things that will ſatisfie an immortal ſoul, let it be of the largeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that can be, theſe cannot upon this ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are but <hi>for a ſeaſon:</hi> Then let our hearts be after <hi>eternal things.</hi> I am this day to ſpeak to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers hundreds of you here, that muſt every one of you live <hi>in eternity</hi> one way or other, yong and old, you muſt live in a time <hi>beyond</hi> this ſeaſon: Now having to ſpeak to you that muſt live eternally, this is that which I have to do, To get your hearts up, to ſeek after <hi>eternal things;</hi> and O that this might be done, if I ſhould never preach more, and you ſhould never hear more, yet if this ſhould be obtained, that you ſhould live eternally, that you ſhould have your hearts got up to <hi>eternal</hi> things, you ſhould be bleſſed, and I ſhould think my ſelf happy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> would have a man come and cry to him every morning, <hi>You are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;</hi> this is that which I ſhould <hi>rather chooſe,</hi> that you might daily here a voyce, that <hi>You are immortal;</hi> The better part of you muſt live eternally: Were it that eternity were preſented to us in the reality of it, how mightily would it work to draw our hearts to eternal things? Certainly our thoughts are not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>eternity;</hi> the thoughts of <hi>eternity</hi> are mighty
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57146:176"/>
prevailing thoughts, they are over-awing thoughts, ſoul ballacing thoughts, that would ballaſt our hearts; they are infinite pertinent thoughts, that do infinitely concern us. You that have had a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſleight thoughts, and have ſet the ſtrength of your ſpirits in thinking of chaffy things; O this day here is an object preſented to you, to help you againſt ſleight thoughts: This one word <hi>Eternity,</hi> and the thoughts of <hi>this word,</hi> may be enough for you, to baniſh vain and chaffy thoughts away for ever; it concerns us to have the ſtrength of our ſpirits buſied about this.</p>
                  <p>There is a requeſt that I have to every one of you, and I will put it as fair, and eaſie, and low as may be, becauſe I would not have it denyed; that is, That every one that God by his providence hath brought this day here into this Aſſembly, would reſolve in their own thoughts, and covenant with God, to ſpend but one half quarter of an hour in meditating of eternity every day; there is no ſuch great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in it, to have ſuch thoughts as theſe renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every day: <hi>This body of mine,</hi> though frail and mortal, <hi>it muſt live for ever,</hi> and <hi>this ſoul of mine,</hi> it <hi>muſt live eternally;</hi> I have ſpent a great deal of time in ſeeking after contentment to my fleſh for the <hi>preſent,</hi> but, <hi>O Lord, what have I done to provide for eternity?</hi> The renewing of this daily, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this daily upon the heart, what might it do? It cannot be imagined what it might do: Precious are the thoughts of <hi>eternity,</hi> ſo precious, that there is many a ſoul, that would not for a thouſand worlds, but have had thoſe thoughts to be ſetled upon them; ſo precious, as many ſouls are now in Heaven, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:57146:177"/>
and bleſſing of God, that they had ſuch ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts of <hi>eternity,</hi> before they left this world.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, until you come to have your thoughts ſetled in ſome meaſure upon <hi>this,</hi> you do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>wherefore</hi> you were born, nor unto what you were born; you never have done any thing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe about the great buſineſs that God hath ſent you into the world for, until you come to have ſerious working thoughts about <hi>eternity:</hi> you have had all this while a ſeduced heart, that hath deceived you, and all your life hath been a dream. If God ſhould begin to dart thoughts into your hearts, and ſtick them upon your minde, about this argument, <hi>now</hi> you begin to live, and to awake, it were not poſſible that any luſts ſhould ſtand before theſe thoughts: you complain often of weakneſs, and that you meet with temptations that are very ſtrong, behold here a means to reſiſt ſtrong temptations, to ſtrengthen you againſt the ſtrongeſt temptations that you can poſſibly meet withal in the world, namely the ſerious thoughts of things that are <hi>beyond</hi> this ſeaſon. It is reported of the cuſtoms that have been obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> in making of Biſhops, they had this ſpeech to them, <hi>Have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in your mindes:</hi> O that this ſpeech were renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us, in all our conditions and buſineſſes, that ſo it may prevail with us, to ſeek after that which is <hi>eternal!</hi> And to that end, that what I ſpeak this way, may not vaniſh, and come to nothing, (for it is a ſerious argument that we are about, &amp; I am loth that it ſhould come to nothing) conſider theſe motives.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is <hi>onely</hi> the rational creature that knows <note place="margin">1. <hi>Motives</hi> to minde <hi>eternity.</hi>
                     </note> any thing that is <hi>beyond</hi> this ſeaſon: this is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:57146:177"/>
of <hi>a rational creature,</hi> that it hath any notion about any thing that is <hi>eternal:</hi> Now that God hath made <hi>us</hi> of ſuch a nature, and no creature elſe, but <hi>us,</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> ſurely there is ſomething in it: Mens hearts do naturally deſire <hi>eternity,</hi> and think this is good if it might <hi>laſt.</hi> That is very obſervable therefore that we have in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 5. concerning Gods expreſſion of himſelf to his people; where he would expreſs himſelf ſo as to ſatisfie his people, he ſays, <hi>I will be as the dew unto Iſrael, he ſhall grow as the Lilly, and caſt forth his roots as Lebanon.</hi> The <hi>dew</hi> and the <hi>Lilly</hi> are ſweet things, but the <hi>dew</hi> though it be ſweet is quickly gone, and the <hi>Lilly</hi> is ſweet, but it is obſerved by the <hi>Naturaliſts,</hi> that the <hi>Lilly</hi> does not take much <hi>root</hi> in the earth, therefore mark what follows, and he ſhall <hi>caſt forth his roots</hi> as <hi>Lebanon;</hi> you ſhall have the ſweetneſs of the <hi>Lilly,</hi> but you ſhall have <hi>the roots of Lebanon; Lebanon</hi> was the place of <hi>Cedars,</hi> and the roots of Cedars are deep. <hi>They that dwell under his ſhadow ſhall return, they ſhall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine.</hi> It might <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.</note> be ſaid the corn laſts but <hi>a year,</hi> therefore God adds, <hi>and grow as the vine;</hi> the <hi>Vine</hi> does not onely bud, and ſend forth his branches and grapes one year, but the next year, and the next year <hi>it continues:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God might preſent his mercies fully to the hearts of his people, he does preſent them in this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying way, that his mercies ſhall be abiding mercies. Why ſhould we be as Children, to run after bubbles? Men ſeek after inheritances, and to have things made ſure for perpetuity, ſo it ſhould be with us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let us look upon things that are <hi>beyond</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>
                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:57146:178"/>
this ſeaſon, that are <hi>eternal,</hi> becauſe that in theſe times of the Goſpel, God hath revealed <hi>eternity,</hi> and eternal things abundantly more clearly then ever they were revealed in the <hi>Law:</hi> in the time of the Law there was little made known concerning <hi>eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but the times of the Goſpel being renewed, now the <hi>treaſures</hi> of eternity are opened; Immortality is brought to light by the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. Now the glorious things of eternity are ſet before our eyes, and we the Miniſters of God are commanded to preſent them to you, and you living under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, where you hear ſo much of eternity revealed, it would be dreadful if you ſhould be deceived with things that are but for a ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, every one of you as you are born, are born with your backs upon <hi>Gods eternity,</hi> and your <note place="margin">3.</note> faces towards <hi>hells eternity,</hi> and therefore you had need look beyond things that are but for <hi>a ſeaſon,</hi> and minde the things of your <hi>eternal</hi> good with all your might.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, all your <hi>eternal</hi> good does depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">4.</note> the ſhort uncertain <hi>moment</hi> of your lives; if the thrid be but cut, and you have not provided for your eternal good, you are loſt and undone for ever, you do not know but upon every <hi>moment</hi> depends <hi>eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, know you may be far nearer to the Ocean <note place="margin">5.</note> of eternity, then you are aware, and therefore you had need have your thoughts faſtened upon <hi>eternity;</hi> Who knows but that before the morning ſome that are here may underſtand what eternity means, and be lanching into the infinite Ocean of it: there is many a man that is in his <hi>jollity, ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>health,</hi>
                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:57146:178"/>
that is called forth by God, ſuddenly to lanch into this Ocean; If God call you ſuddenly before you be ready, what will become of you? now you may be near it. You that are old are certainly near it, within a few years you muſt know what <hi>eternity</hi> means, you ſhall know a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things that are <hi>for a ſeaſon,</hi> and <hi>beyond</hi> a ſeaſon: and <hi>yong ones</hi> may, as we have daily examples; now you that are yong, conſider thoſe examples, and put the caſe, Suppoſe I had been called to la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>h into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, when ſuch a one was called, had I been ready? what had become of me? O conſider how near you may be unto it, and therefore look not upon things that are <hi>temporal,</hi> but let your hearts be after things that are <hi>eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, conſider how happy thoſe ſouls would <note place="margin">6.</note> think themſelves that are in their eternal eſtates, and are miſcarried, if they had time to provide for <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> again. Many are gone, and ſnatched away from all things that are for a ſeaſon, and are ſwimming in the infinite Ocean of eternal miſery, and they look about them, and ſee vaſtneſs, no limits, no end, no land: If they could but come back again, and have their time again, how do you think would they carry themſelves about things that are but <hi>for a ſeaſon?</hi> do you think temptations would draw their hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? If company ſhould come to draw them to drinking, and uncleanneſs, would they yield then? they would with indignation caſt away thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and ſay, <hi>God forbid I ſhould be drawn with theſe things, that are but for a ſeaſon,</hi> I know what <hi>eternity means.</hi> O now you have time, improve this argument, and labor to provide for <hi>eternity:</hi> now
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57146:179"/>
prayers and tears may do you good for <hi>eternity;</hi> within a while, if you could let ſtreams of blood iſſue from you, it can do you no good, and if this argument prevail to get off your hearts <hi>beyond</hi> things that are for a ſeaſon, there will ariſe theſe two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions: <hi>O that I did but know how it ſhould go with me eternally! O how ſhall I get eternal things to be my portion!</hi>

                  <p>IF you ſay, How ſhall I know how it ſhall be with <note place="margin">1.</note> me for eternity? ſhall it be well, or not well with my ſoul when I am beyond things that are for a ſeaſon?

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:57146:179"/>
to me by the Word, the Lord hath preſented to me by his Spirit, the ſtrength and chief of my thoughts have been buſied about this argument. It is a good ſign, that God does intend good for that ſoul to <hi>eternity,</hi> whom he is pleaſed to poſſeſs with the thoughts of it ſo deeply for the preſent.</p>
                  <p>Again conſider, could you not wiſh in your hearts, <note place="margin">2.</note> that you might live always? and that the content and delight in this world, in meat, and drink, and ſports do ſatisfie you, and you think your ſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the enjoyment of them; certainly God hath not yet ſavingly made known the things of <hi>eternity</hi> to you. Thoſe that God does prepare for his eternal mercies in Heaven, God does take off their hearts from all things in the world; that if it were put to your choice, though you might have a thouſand worlds, you would not have them for <hi>your portion;</hi> no, there are more glorious, more excellent things for my ſoul to have, and therefore God forbid I ſhould have my portion in <hi>theſe things,</hi> though they were to endure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> brings in <hi>Plotinus,</hi> acknowledging it the mercy of God to man, that his ſoul is in a <hi>mortal</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. A third Argument that it ſhall be well with <note place="margin">3. <hi>Ut ipſae ibi forent ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ubi eſt anima mundi.</hi> Aug. de Civ.

This is a certain truth, There is no ſoul that God intends eternal life unto, but God begins eternal life in this world. You know what St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>He that hates</hi>
                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:57146:180"/>
                     <hi>his brother, hath not eternal life abiding in him.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life is begun in this world in all that ſhall be ſaved; therefore think with your ſelves, What ſeeds <hi>of eternity</hi> have I put into my ſoul? All common graces, and moral vertues are not a ſeed that will grow up to eternal life, but ſaving grace will; though it be under the clods for the preſent, it will grow up <hi>eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Examine the Scriptures, look into the book of God, and ſee whether the Scripture ſpeaks <note place="margin">4.</note> well on your ſide, becauſe that in this Book, in this Scripture, there God hath revealed the <hi>eternal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of his will,</hi> and the great things about mans eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eſtate: there is little in all the Book of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Book of <hi>Creation,</hi> revealed of the counſels of Gods will, about bringing man to his eternal eſtate; but in this Book of the <hi>Scripture</hi> he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his will concerning this; and therefore confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, does this ſpeak well of your ſide? Thus by theſe <note place="margin">How to get <hi>eternal things</hi> to be our portion.</note> arguments you may know how it ſhall be with you for eternity.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall we do to get a portion in thoſe things <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2.</note> that ſhall be eternal?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, labor to bring all things in ſubordination to <hi>eternity,</hi> do not make other things your ſcope, make <note place="margin">1.</note> them an underling, and take no further content in them, then that they may further your ſouls to <hi>eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Suppoſe you have an eſtate encreaſing more then another, what will you do with it? how will you uſe it? wherein do you count the good of it to conſiſt? that by theſe things I have coming from God, I hope to make uſe of them, to fit me for eternal mercies, and to treaſure up eternal mercies by a ſanctified holy uſe
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:57146:180"/>
of theſe things; but when temporal things come in, and your hearts reſt upon them, without ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to eternal things, this is infinitely dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, make conſcience of the little time you <note place="margin">2.</note> have; O it is but a little time you have, let that be conſecrated and devoted to God: it is eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that you look for hereafter, why ſhould you not be willing to ſpend as much of this little time for it as can be?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, labor to be exact in all that you do, for <note place="margin">3.</note> you are working for <hi>eternity.</hi> As <hi>Zeuxis</hi> the Painter, when he was askt, why he was ſo accurate in his Painting, ſays he, <hi>I Paint for eternity:</hi> Let us in <note place="margin">Aeterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati pingo.</note> our Chriſtian profeſſion be exact in our way, becauſe we live for <hi>eternity;</hi> There is nothing that does make men ſo accurate in their way as this; and let the men of the world know, that this is the reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs of the ways of Gods people, becauſe they know they live to <hi>eternity.</hi> Hypocrites, who in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties aim onely at ſome <hi>preſent,</hi> ſome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good, they are not exact, they reſt in <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides;</hi> but the Saints who make <hi>eternity</hi> their aym, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in all things, eſpecially thoſe things that have a more immediate influence into <hi>eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, be ſure all you do, you do upon divine and <hi>eternal</hi> grounds, take heed of being carnal, and <note place="margin">4.</note> earthly in your ſpiritual ſervices; but in all duties in Gods worſhip, look to an eternal God, and let your <hi>principles, aims, grounds,</hi> and <hi>intentions</hi> be eternal. The Temple was called <hi>Bethgnolam,</hi> the houſe of <hi>Eternity;</hi> do all you do in the houſe of God, in his Ordinances, in order to <hi>eternity,</hi> that it may indeed be an houſe of <hi>eternity</hi> unto you.</p>

                     <hi>highly,</hi> as accounting that reproach of Chriſt that he was to ſuffer, great riches; and the argument that here he hath, is the greatneſs of the recompence of the reward, <hi>He had an eye unto the recompence of the reward.</hi>

                     <hi>[Eſteeming</hi> the reproach <hi>of Chriſt:] Reproach</hi> is taken either materially, or formally; <hi>materially,</hi> ſo it may be taken for the <hi>affliction</hi> that he did endure with Gods people, that outward mean wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he was like to ſuffer with the people of God, this was the matter of the reproach. Or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>formally,</hi> the ſcorn, contempt, reviling, railing, and all the evil that ſhould be ſpoken of him when he had left the <hi>Court,</hi> and joyned himſelf with Gods people; and this formal kinde of reproach is that which is eſpecially meant.</p>

                     <hi>[The reproach of Chriſt:]</hi> How could that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuffered, be the reproach <hi>of Chriſt?</hi> for Chriſt was not then born, it was a long time after before Chriſt came into the world.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt was preſent unto <hi>Moſes</hi> by the eye of <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> faith, though he were not yet come into the world, <hi>Chriſt is the ſame to day, yeſterday, and for ever;</hi> he was the ſame to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> that he is to <hi>us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[Eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt</hi> greater riches <hi>then the treaſures of Egypt] Moſes</hi> was not onely content to ſuffer patiently the reproach of Chriſt, but he counted it <hi>his glory,</hi> his <hi>riches,</hi> greater <hi>riches</hi> then the <hi>Treaſures of Egypt. Egypt</hi> was a rich coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and full of treaſures; and therefore in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. <hi>Egypt</hi> is called by the name of <hi>Rahab,</hi> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe of the pride, and power, and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57146:182"/>
of <hi>Egypt;</hi> becauſe <hi>Egypt</hi> was a fruitful rich place, therefore they had a great deal of ſtrength, and power, and were lift up with pride; So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. 9. <hi>vide Hieronym.</hi> upon the place. The King of <hi>Egypt</hi> is called a Dragon in <hi>the waters:</hi> and the chief horſes that <hi>Solomon</hi> had, in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9. they came out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and the <hi>Whore</hi> in the <hi>Proverbs, had her fine linen out of Egypt. Egypt</hi> was a very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <note place="margin">Prov. 7. 16</note> Country, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 9. The fruitfulneſs of that place to which <hi>Lot</hi> turned aſide, is deſcribed to be the garden of the Lord, like the Land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> it is called by many <hi>Horreum caeterarum regionum,</hi> the Granary of other Countreys: hence <hi>Abraham,</hi> when famine was in <hi>Canaan,</hi> went into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and after, <hi>Jacob</hi> in time of famine ſent his ſons into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> it is ſaid of it, that they ſow almoſt every moneth. And being ſuch a flouriſhing place, all <note place="margin">Gen. 13.</note> kinde of learning was there; and therefore in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 30. where the greatneſs of <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſdom is ſet out, it is ſaid, it excelled the wiſdom of <hi>Egypt.</hi> In <hi>Egypt</hi> was treaſures of riches, and treaſures of ſtrength, treaſures of the riches of the earth, and treaſures of merchandize, and treaſures of learning, and yet <hi>Moſes</hi> eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt, <hi>greater riches then all the treaſures of Egypt.</hi> Now the points that ariſe from theſe words, are theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the people of God have been, and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <note place="margin">1.</note> are a people under <hi>reproach.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the reproach of Gods people is the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a gracious heart is not only willing to bear reproach when God calls unto it, but in the cauſe of <note place="margin">3.</note> Chriſt, triumphs and rejoyces in that reproach it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="348" facs="tcp:57146:183"/>
Fourthly, the ſtrong argument that moves Gods people thus to do, is the <hi>eye</hi> that they have unto the <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>recompence of the reward.</hi> To begin with the firſt, and that is this:</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>HAving now to handle this Doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Point</hi> 1.</note> the <hi>reproaches</hi> that are caſt upon Gods people, before I ſpeak a word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the point, I deſire to put this caveat, That none upon hearing the eſtate of Gods people being reproached, ſhall think to waſh away all juſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and accuſation, and think to anſwer whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are accuſed of with this, That all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been reproached, and therefore think their condition to be but the ſame that uſually Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if that were enough to anſwer any accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">1.</note> upon this, then there ſhould never be any repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and accuſation, the Church of God ſhould never proceed againſt any for any evil.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſuch as think to put off juſt reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <note place="margin">2.</note> and accuſations thus, have their conſciences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them more then others do or can reproach them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is not for all to make uſe of this that I am ſpeaking of, but onely ſuch, whoſe conſtant <note place="margin">3.</note> and general way is gracious, and inoffenſive; now
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57146:183"/>
if they meet with unjuſt accuſations, and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſlanders, they may have the benefit of this, to think it is the uſual condition of Gods people to be reproached; but if any have been offenſive, and evils break out, they cannot have the benefit of this point, for more evil may be in them then appears; and thus I lay this caveat to pull up evil weeds, before I ſow good ſeed. And now to the Point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The condition of Gods people is</hi> a reproached <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> They have been a people ſubject to all maner of evil ſpeaking of them. This the Church of God complains of in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. 4. they were not onely a reproach, but God himſelf gave them over to be a <note place="margin">Pſ. 44. 13.</note> ſcorn and reproach. <hi>Iſaac</hi> that was the <hi>ſon of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> we know how he was reproached and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned by <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> and it is obſervable, when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the reproach of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29. it is ſaid, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> perſecuted <hi>Iſaac;</hi> now that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was nothing but his <hi>mocking</hi> and <hi>reproaching</hi> of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> We read of <hi>Job,</hi> a holy man, how lyable he was to reproach and contempt, <hi>Job</hi> 16. 9, 10. there you may read of the bitter reproaches he had from the abjects, ſuch as he would not ſet with his dogs, that had not bread to eat, and were driven from men to live among buſhes and nettles. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 15. <hi>David</hi> complains, <hi>the abjects of the people made a ſcorn of him;</hi> the baſeſt wretches that are, can finde a taunt, and mock at Religion; <hi>reproachers</hi> are the moſt baſe ſpirits. In <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time, thoſe that ſought to build the <hi>Temple</hi> were ſcorned; in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2. 19. it is ſaid, <hi>Tobiah</hi> the ſervant, one that had been but a ſlave, a baſe wretch, he comes and laughs them to ſcorn. And ſo in great mens houſes, if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57146:184"/>
do ſcorn at the godly, the baſeſt ſervants will do ſo too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> hath many bitter complaints of the reproach he ſuffered, <hi>I was a reproach among all my enemies,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 31. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>but eſpecially among my neighbors.</hi> Now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of <hi>profeſſors</hi> one againſt another, are the bittereſt, and moſt vile reproaches: and the reaſon of it is this, becauſe uſually reproach ariſes from ſome conteſtation about excellency: for a Prince that is <note place="margin">The <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches</hi> of <hi>Profeſſors</hi> the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</note> a great deal above another, hath not conteſtation with beggers, he does not reproach them, nor they him, for this diſtance is too great; but reproach is between equals, when one ſtands in the light of the other; or from inferiors, who have others by them who are above them, and their excellency ſtands in their light, and they caſt dirt upon their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, that theirs may appear the brighter. Now thoſe that have a conteſtation about Religion, have a conteſtation about the greateſt excellency, and where their hearts are unſavory, their reproaches will be the bittereſt reproaches. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 25. <hi>I became alſo a reproach unto them, when they looked upon me, they ſhaked their heads;</hi> and in other places the drunkards made ſongs of him. <hi>David</hi> was a man of ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſpirit, <hi>the ſweet ſinger of Iſrael,</hi> and God had bleſt him with all things that might make him honorable, and had he not been religious, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that ſuch a man as he ſhould have endured ſuch reproaches.</p>
                  <p>And we have the Church complaining in <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 30. <hi>He giveth his cheek to him that ſmiteth him, he is filled full of reproach.</hi> So all the Prophets that were the moſt eminent were reproached, as <hi>Iſaiah;</hi>
                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:57146:184"/>
in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. <hi>Precept upon precept, line upon line,</hi> that was a ſcoff they put upon <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> we have nothing but <hi>line upon line, and precept upon precept;</hi> the very ſound of the words as they are in the Original, carries with them a taunting, reproachful expreſſion, <hi>Zan la Zan, Kan la Kan, manda remanda, manda remanda;</hi> as ſcornful people by the tone of their voice, and ryming words, ſcorn at ſuch as they deſpiſe. And ſo <hi>Jeremy</hi> complains in the bitterneſs of his ſpirit, that <note place="margin">Ier. 20. 28.</note> the word of the Lord was made a reproach to him. And <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſee how he was ſcorned, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 30, 31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as they did the <hi>Prophets,</hi> ſo <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> when they were filled with the Spirit of God, they mocked them, and ſaid, <hi>they were filled with new Wine;</hi> And Chriſt tells them, <hi>they ſhall revile them, and ſpeak all maner of evil unto them.</hi> And ſo St. <hi>Paul,</hi> a man of moſt admirable parts, yet he ſays of himſelf, and of the other Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Being defamed, we intreat;</hi> the word tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>defamed,</hi> ſignifies <hi>blaſphemed. We are made as the filth of the world, and are the off-ſcouring of all things to this day.</hi> We are made <hi>the filth of the world,</hi> as if we were ſcraped out of the filth <hi>of the filth</hi> of the world; There is an emphaſis in that word, <hi>the filth of the world;</hi> why the world <hi>lies in filth,</hi> is even nothing elſe but filth, as in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 19. <hi>the whole world lieth in wickedneſs,</hi> as a carrion in the ſlime of it; to be accounted the filth <hi>of ſuch a filth,</hi> is a moſt vile eſteem of one indeed, that filthineſs muſt needs be great. <hi>Mundus</hi> hath the name <hi>à munditie</hi> of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but as <hi>lucus à lucendo,</hi> as <hi>mons à monendo, quia minimè lucet, minimè monet,</hi> ſo <hi>quia minimè mundus</hi>
                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:57146:185"/>
                     <hi>eſt.</hi> And further, <hi>the off-ſcouring of all things;</hi> to be the off-ſcouring <hi>of ſome things,</hi> is not ſo vile, but <hi>of all things,</hi> the moſt <hi>baſe,</hi> and <hi>contemptible</hi> things, how vile is that? The word ſignifies the <hi>dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart</hi> that goes through the city, into which every one brings his filth, and caſts in: every one had ſome filth to caſt upon <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> the people of God were then a people under great reproach: What ſtrange things does <hi>Tertullian</hi> tell us they reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them withal; as that in their meetings they made <hi>Thyeſtes ſuppers,</hi> who invited his brother to a ſupper, and preſented him with a diſh of his own fleſh; they charged them with uncleanneſs, becauſe they met in the night, (for they durſt not meet in the day) and ſaid, they blew out the candles when they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and committed filthineſs: they reproached them for <hi>ignorance,</hi> ſaying, they were all unlearned; and therefore the Heathens in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time uſed to paint the God of the Chriſtians with an <hi>Aſſes head,</hi> and a <hi>book</hi> in his hand, to ſignifie, that though they pretended learning, yet they were an unlearned ſilly people, rude and ignorant. Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon upon <hi>Luke</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. cites this out of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> and applyes it to his time: <hi>Does not our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries do the like,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>at this day, againſt all thoſe that profeſs the Goſpel of Chriſt? O ſay they, who are they that favor this way? they are none but</hi> Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, Taylors, Weavers, <hi>and ſuch as never were at the Univerſity.</hi> They are the Biſhops own words.

                  <p>And if we look into the ways of Gods permiſſive providence in theſe latter times; what reproachful, and ſcornful blood hath run in the veins of wicked men, and what horrid things hath been invented upon the moſt famous perſons of our latter times? As <hi>Luther,</hi> this report came to him, he being yet alive, That <hi>Luther</hi> upon his death-bed had recanted, and he deſired the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and after he was dead, there was a fearful Earthquake that ſhook the place where he lay, and they ſaw the <hi>Hoſt</hi> he had taken, hanging in the Ayr, and when he was put into the Grave, they heard a great noiſe, but they
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:57146:186"/>
ſaw nothing, but a filthy ſtink aroſe, and his body was taken away. And ſo of <hi>Calvin;</hi> though he had a ſweet death, yet was it ſaid by the Popiſh Party, that he was eaten up with worms, (as thoſe ſaid of <hi>David, An evil diſeaſe cleaves faſt to him:)</hi> and then when he was to dye, he called upon the Devil, and blaſphemed the name of God. And ſo <hi>Oecolompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> that he ſlew himſelf; and others reported, that the Devil ſlew him. It were endleſs to name the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches that we finde of the ſervants of God that were moſt eminent. Yea, I remember <hi>Seneca</hi> hath <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nondu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foelix es ſi nondu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> te turba deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerit.

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temni.</hi> Sen. lib. de moribus.</note> ſuch an expreſſion concerning Philoſophy; ſays he, You are not yet happy, if the rout of people do not deride you; if you will be happy, prepare your ſelves <hi>to contemn</hi> being contemned. And an other <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher</hi> ſays, <hi>If one does but begin to ſet himſelf to the ſtudy of Philoſophy, he muſt expect to be ſcorned and derided.</hi> Now if this be the wickedneſs of mens hearts, as they cannot ſo much as endure moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, much more if a man begins to walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule of God. This is that which many fear, and they bring it to keep others from Gods ways, and ſay, If you embrace Religion, you will be derided at, and ſcorned: and by this many are kept from the good ways of the Lord; and therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faln upon this argument, I ſhall labor to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this ſtumbling block, that it may not hinder any. Thus you have ſeen the thing it ſelf, that it is ſo, that <note place="margin">Why Gods people are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n the world.</note> Gods people are a people under reproach. Now the reaſons for it:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the men of the world look upon the ſervants of God, as having very poor low ſpirits; now thoſe are men that are liable to contempt and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:57146:186"/>
reproach. Gods people are not for the braveries of the world, and the glory of the world; and when they ſee their hearts are taken off from that which they count the bravery of the world, they contemn them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they look upon their ways as <hi>irrational:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> There is no reaſon why men ſhould be ſo afraid of the leaſt ſin, they are ſtricter then they need, and do more then they need: ſo that the more earneſt Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are upon their way, the more wicked men will ſcorn them, becauſe they ſee them earneſt upon that which they ſee no reaſon for.</p>
                  <p>Again, they think the ways of Religion are but <hi>imaginary</hi> things, and notions, and there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty <note place="margin">3.</note> in them, and think it ſtrange men ſhould ſuffer for things that are to come they know not when, and are they know not what: and therefore one gives that reaſon, why <hi>Cyprian</hi> was called <hi>Coprian, becauſe he gathered ſuch fables and tales,</hi> (meaning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel) as they termed them, <hi>which they ſaw no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But eſpecially it does proceed from the <hi>pride</hi> and <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>malice</hi> of wicked men; from pride, and ſwelling, and <note place="margin">

What was the reaſon that ſhould cauſe <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah</hi> to make ſuch a ſtir to reproach <hi>Nehemiah?</hi> Certainly the ground was this, <hi>Sanballat</hi>
                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:57146:187"/>
and <hi>Tobiah</hi> were in <hi>Samaria</hi> with a mixt people, and they had got a Temple, and endeavored to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that; Now they thought that the <hi>Temple of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemiah</hi> would darken the glory of their Temple, and therefore they ſought to caſt diſgrace upon them, to bring them into contempt. And the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of mens hearts, when it cannot vent its ſelf by open perſecution, then it will vent its ſelf by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the tongue; malice makes men very watchful, to obſerve any thing whereby it may gain matter of reproach, and malice will make men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding inventive to finde out ſtrange ways of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and exceeding bold in venturing upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> that place is remarkable in <hi>Proverbs</hi> 16. 27. <hi>An ungodly man diggeth up evil, and in his lips there is a burning fire;</hi> if things be not plain and fair enough, becauſe he hath an evil ſpirit, <hi>he will dig up evil,</hi> if he can dig up any old buſineſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them for.</p>
                  <p>Now the ways of invention, that malice hath to <note place="margin">1. <hi>Malice is</hi> fruitful in inventing <hi>reproaches.</hi>
                     </note> reproach upon the ways of God, are many: As the ſtraining of any word to the utmoſt, and putting gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and falſe interpretations upon words; and thus it is eaſie to make any man a tranſgreſſor for a word, yea, for any word, as it was with thoſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 21. <hi>They make a man an offender for a word, and lay a ſnare for him that reproveth in the gate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond way is, by caſting out doubtful <note place="margin">2.</note> ſpeeches; they will not accuſe one directly, becauſe it will be a ſhame to them, if it be falſe, but they caſt out doubtful ſpeeches, they know ſome will turn them the worſt way, and if they be examined,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:57146:187"/>
they can turn them another way, to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Another invention, is ſome ſecret intimations that others may gather, and it cannot be ſaid they ſpake <note place="margin">3.</note> any thing, but by ſome geſture or the like, others may gather ſomething.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to ſpeak things as from others, and not <note place="margin">4.</note> from themſelves, and in the ſpeaking of them to ſay, <hi>I believe ſuch things are not true,</hi> and yet they ſpread the report.</p>
                  <p>Another way is to ſpeak evil, and yet ſo, as to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt <note place="margin">5.</note> a great deal of grief and ſorrow for ſuch reports, and <hi>ſecretly deſire</hi> that they may ſpread, and take where they come.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, when they want apparent matter for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, <note place="margin">6.</note> they will pretend ſome love to get matter for reproach: ſo you may read in <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 1, 2. when the adverſaries of <hi>Judah</hi> could not reproach them appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, they pretended love, and this and that, they ſought the ſame God they did, and would ſacrifice to him, and therefore would build with them. So <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah</hi> deſired to meet lovingly with <note place="margin">Neh. 6. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to take counſel together, but in this they intended his reproach.</p>
                  <p>Yea ſometimes, to ſpeak ſome truths with reproach, to make it to be believed the more. It is ſaid, 1 <hi>John</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7.</note> 2. 21. that <hi>there is no lye of the truth,</hi> theſe men make the truth to be ſerviceable to a lye, they raiſe the ſtrength of <hi>a lye,</hi> even out of <hi>the truth.</hi> We might be abundant in ſhewing the ways of invention that malice hath, to caſt dirt and ſhame upon thoſe that it hath an evil eye upon.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, if there be any ſhew of <hi>ſuſpition</hi> of evil, to <note place="margin">8.</note>
                     <pb n="358" facs="tcp:57146:188"/>
make it a certainty, and ſo to carry it in the report, as if it were <hi>ſurely</hi> ſo, this is a great wrong; for every man is in poſſeſſion of his good name, until the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">Iudubiis melior eſt conditio poſſeſſoris.</note> be made out, and in doubtful things the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor hath the advantage, but in this way of malice, this his priviledge is taken away?</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, if there be any thing conceived evil, that <note place="margin">9.</note> hath any nearneſs or likeneſs to that which is done, malice will faſten that evil upon what is done, as if it were <hi>that;</hi> as appears notably in the example we have <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. of <hi>Rehum</hi> the Chancellor, and <hi>Shimſhai</hi> the Scribe, and the reſt of their companions, as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt calls them, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. in their reproachful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of the people of God; whereas the Text ſpeaks onely of their building the Temple, yet they accuſe them for building the <hi>rebellious City,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might free themſelves from ſubjection to the King. Thus while Gods people ſeek to build the Temple, to ſet up the Ordinances of Chriſt, they are accuſed for diſturbing the Commonwealth; becauſe they cannot do as others do, becauſe they cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject their conſciences to men, therefore they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached and accuſed, as diſturbers of the State, enemies to Government, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, <hi>Malice</hi> will teach men to draw conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences <note place="margin">10.</note> a great way off from the premiſes, that it may faſten <hi>reproach</hi> upon thoſe they have an evil eye upon, although in truth there be no dependance of that which they affirm upon that which they draw it from: As in the former example, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Certifie the King, that if this City be built again, and the walls thereof ſet up, by this means thou ſhalt have no portion on this ſide the River;</hi> It was a conſequence
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:57146:188"/>
that they could not conclude from what they affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them. Thus it is with many in their reproaches and accuſations of Religious men, if they be ſuffered to have their way in that which they pretend is for conſcience, they will grow <hi>Rebels,</hi> they will not live under government: ſurely there is no dependance of rejecting government upon Religion, upon ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the truth in a conſcientious way. And as it is inventive, ſo it is bold to venture ſtrangely upon ſuch things that men know they may be eaſily found in. It was the ſpeech of the <hi>Jeſuit Campian,</hi> Reproach <note place="margin">Fortiter calumniare aliquid haerebit.</note> valiantly, ſomewhat will ſtick, though it may be eaſily anſwered by thoſe who know the matter, yet the noiſe will go further then the examination, and much will ſtick by it.</p>
                  <p>A fifth reaſon of the reproach of Gods people, is from the malice of the <hi>Devil,</hi> becauſe the Devil <note place="margin">5.</note> knows there is no ſuch way to darken Religion, and to damp the hearts of people from embracing it. And therefore it is obſerved of <hi>Julian,</hi> he would not go the way that other <hi>Emperors</hi> did, to oppoſe Religion by open perſecution, but ſought all means to caſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> upon Religion, and by that means many were drawn from Religion: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, where we ſee that <hi>reproaches</hi> are caſt upon ſuch as are religious, this is the end, to ſuppreſs Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, there the Devil hath a great hand, and hopes to prevail much.</p>
                  <p>Again, God (ſometimes) hath a ſpecial hand in <note place="margin">6.</note> this. Why does God ſuffer this? ſometime for the <note place="margin">The ſins of Gods people, <hi>oft</hi> puniſhed by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</hi>
                     </note> correction of his people; ſometime for the good of his people.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the correction of his people: there are
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:57146:189"/>
ſeven or eight ſins puniſhed in Gods people by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches that are caſt upon them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that they have not been ſo tender of the name of God as they ſhould have been, you have not been <note place="margin">1.</note> affected with the wrongs that have been done to the name of God, and therefore God ſuffers you to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in your names.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the inordinate deſire of a <hi>name,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">2.</note> we are ſo ready to deſire a name abroad, and to have eſteem in the world, and are more <hi>ſolicitous</hi> about <hi>credit</hi> with men, then credit <hi>in heaven,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſometimes croſſeth his people, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers filth and dirt to be caſt upon them, to correct this ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it may be you have not done that good to others which you might have done, therefore God <note place="margin">3.</note> uſes them as a ſcourge to you this way.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it may be it is becauſe you have not <note place="margin">4.</note> been tender of the name <hi>of others,</hi> and therefore God ſuffers you to ſuffer in the ſame kinde. Says <note place="margin">Si quid ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile aliis tu unquam feciſti. Si libenter alios talia Aicentes audiſti, quod abſ<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> culpa eſſe non poteſt.</note> 
                     <hi>Chryſoſtom, When you hear any reproach you,</hi> you ſhould think, <hi>have not I reproached others?</hi> Or, <hi>have not I heard the reproaches of others, and been delighted with them?</hi> or, <hi>not affected with them, to grieve as I ought?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, God ſuffers this, becauſe many times you have taken ill the reprehenſion of your ſins by Gods Miniſters, and have thought your ſelves diſgraced, and therefore God may juſtly puniſh this, by caſting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace <note place="margin">5.</note> upon you, you ſhall be diſgraced indeed by the tougues of wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, becauſe many times Gods people will put <note place="margin">6.</note> fair colours upon evil actions, hence God ſuffers
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:57146:189"/>
their enemies to put foul colours upon good actions: we are ready to ſay, Good Lord, that ever we ſhould ſuffer ſuch things, when we labor to walk ſo ſtrictly, and our conſciences witneſs ſo well for us, that yet there ſhould be ſuch aſperſions! God puniſhes this; you have done evil with fair pretences, and therefore now though your actions be never ſo good, you ſhall have foul colours put upon them; your evil actions you made ſeem to be glorious, now your good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall appear as if they were foul.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, becauſe the people of God have not <note place="margin">7.</note> been careful to finde out the ſecret evil and filth of their hearts, therefore God will caſt outward filth upon them, this is uſual.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, though we be conſcious of a great deal of <note place="margin">8.</note> evil between God and our hearts, we many times are not aſhamed of that, and therefore becauſe God will have us aſhamed of our filth, he ſuffers filth to be caſt upon us outwardly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God intends good to his people, that they <note place="margin">2.</note> might know themſelves; and though the world have <note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit Gods people reap by <hi>reproaches.</hi>
                     </note> not ſufficient reaſon to accuſe them as guilty, it may be a ſlander from another, and yet I know my ſelf guilty; and though not guilty of <hi>that,</hi> yet by this I may be put to ſearch ſome other evil that I am guilty of that is as great.</p>
                  <p>Again, they may make them watchful for time to come; though they be not guilty <hi>now,</hi> they may be guilty of that evil <hi>afterward.</hi> Now what a mercy of God is this to ſtop our way, though it be by filth? If a man be ſtopped from falling into a dangerous pit, though it be by a heap of dirt, he accounts it a mercy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="362" facs="tcp:57146:190"/>
Thirdly, they recover them out of much evil: So that I may compare the <hi>reproaches</hi> of Gods people <note place="margin">3.</note> to the rags of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> when <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſtuck in the mire in the dungeon, he was pulled out <hi>by rags,</hi> and ſo theſe reproaches of wicked men <hi>are rags</hi> that may pull us out of evil.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God ſanctifies theſe to his people, to make them more fruitful; they may be compared <note place="margin">4.</note> to the dung that husbandmen caſt upon their ground, they ſcrape up filth and dung together to lay upon their ground, whereby it is more fruitful; ſo God ſuffers wicked men to gather up all the filth that can be, and caſt upon his people, which is but as dung to make fat the ſoil, the hearts of Gods people, to make them to be more fruitful in their way; as indeed never do Gods people more thrive in the way of godlineſs, then when many enemies are ſet to watch them. And thus we have done with the Explication of the point.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="31" type="chapter">

                        <hi>Ut ſi non horreret ſervitutem horreret ſaltem ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiam publicam. Ut multos habeat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectores &amp; teſtes.

                     <hi>Joſhua</hi> circumciſed the people, it is ſaid, <hi>He took away their reproach,</hi> therefore the place was called <hi>Gilgal,</hi> becauſe their reproach was rouled away; bodily uncircumciſion was a reproach, much more is ſpiritual uncircumciſion: Let us take heed we do not manifeſt any filth to them, being you live among <note place="margin">The evii of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling tongue.</note> thoſe that will revile you, whoſe tongues in Scripture are compared to three things, a <hi>Raſor,</hi> a <hi>Sword,</hi> and an <hi>Arrow:</hi> A <hi>Raſor</hi> that will take off every little hair, ſo a reviling tongue will not onely take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of every groſs ſin, but the leaſt thing that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can hardly ſee. Secondly, it is compared to a <hi>Sword,</hi> a ſword that wounds, ſo the tongues of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers do a great deal of miſchief: but a ſword can do miſchief onely near hand, it cannot do miſchief afar off; and therefore, Thirdly, it is compared to an <hi>Arrow,</hi> that can do miſchief a great way off, as far as one can ſee a man, and ſo revilers do not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſchief to a man in the Town where they live, but a great way off in other Towns: Now if mens tongues be <hi>Raſors,</hi> and <hi>Swords,</hi> and <hi>Arrows,</hi> the people of God had need take heed how they walk, and walk accurately, to give no juſt cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, that ſo the reproach may fall upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>The third Uſe of the point is this, Gods people are a people lyable to <hi>reproach:</hi> Let thoſe who are ſuch, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 3.</note> from hence be exhorted, that they do not further this, I mean by reproaching <hi>one another;</hi> it is enough that the ſervants of God are lyable to reproach from the world, and from thoſe that are <hi>without,</hi> let not this be furthered by thoſe that are <hi>within,</hi> upon every pettiſh humor, or every diſcontent, preſently to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57146:191"/>
be caſting filth one upon the face of another, this is a thing unbeſeeming Religion. Hereby you come to deprive your ſelves of that evidence of the truth of grace, from whence many of Gods ſervants receive ſo much comfort, <hi>love to Gods people:</hi> While they are in your way your hearts are towards them, but if they do croſs you, your hearts are as perverſe and froward, and appear as malicious as the hearts of any: So that the <hi>love</hi> you had to them, was becauſe they were in your way, and not becauſe they were the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God: Now if you have a heart, though you becroſſed by them, to put it up without caſting dirt upon their faces, your evidence will be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that you love them though they be oppoſite to you. Do not you tear the fleſh of one another by reproaches? it is enough that the bryers and thorns of the wilderneſs do tear our fleſh and our names; let there not be bryers and thorns amongſt our ſelves to tear our fleſh. If children be caſting mire and dirt upon the faces of one another, how unbeſeeming is it? and if the father ſees them, how provoked is he to correct them both? And ſo if we upon ſome pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh mood, caſt dirt upon one another, expect ſome ſevere judgement from God: If children be caſting dirt upon one another, this is enough to make them leave, <hi>Your Father ſees you:</hi> And ſo you that are brethren of a Church, and are caſting filth upon one another, know your <hi>Father</hi> ſees you: We ſhould not caſt reproaches upon an Enemy. It is a notable ſpeech reported of one <hi>Memon,</hi> that was General of <hi>Darius</hi> Army, when he was fighting againſt <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> one of his Soldiers reproached <hi>Alexander;</hi> the General came to him and ſmote him, ſays he,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:57146:192"/>
                     <hi>I did not hire you to reproach</hi> Alexander, <hi>but to fight againſt him:</hi> If a Heathen cannot endure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of his enemy, how much leſs ſhould God endure his children reproaching one another? It was a brave ſpeech of <hi>Calvin, Though</hi> Luther <hi>call me a Devil, yet I will honor him as a ſervant of God:</hi> and ſo though thoſe that are our brethren, do caſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon us, we ſhould honor the grace of God in them, and not caſt reproach upon them again, for theſe reproaches are bitterneſs.</p>
                  <p>But the main Uſe of the point is an Uſe of Direction, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 4.</note> how to carry our ſelves under reproach; this is the eſtate of Gods people, it hath been ſo, and does continue ſo, and is like to continue ſo; it ſhould teach us, as to make account of them, ſo when they befal us, to behave our ſelves Chriſtianly under them. This is a leſſon of Uſe, wherefore in this leſſon of bearing reproaches, take theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, labor to bear your reproaches <hi>Chriſtianly,</hi> not <hi>Stoically,</hi> inſenſibly; for certainly they are afflictions: <note place="margin">How to carry our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>A good name is a precious oyntment,</hi> and therefore reproaches, though never ſo wrongfully, are afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not to be born inſenſibly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, not to bear them <hi>deſperately,</hi> not to <note place="margin">2.</note> care what become of your Names, as many deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wretches will do. Let men ſpeak the worſt of me, I care not, I muſt appeal to God: Though it is true, <hi>Innocency is a good bulwark,</hi> yet we are not onely to care to approve our ſelves to God, but we are to care to approve our ſelves to men; and not onely to have a good eſteem in Heaven, but to have a good eſteem in the world, <hi>To provide things honeſt before all men,</hi> eſpecially amongſt the people of God,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57146:192"/>
and the Churches of God; for to have an evil name, is a great judgement of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 15. <hi>Ye ſhall leave your name for a curſe.</hi> For people to ſay, they care not what men ſay of them, it is a great evil, for by this it appears they are not affected with ſhame; and thoſe that are not affected with ſhame before others, they are deprived of a ſpecial bridle that ſhould keep them from evil, and a ſpecial means to further repentance. And beſides, it is an argument there is no worth, no good in thee who art ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; thoſe who have any true worth, will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preſerve it, but others are deſperate: As a man that hath a good garden, full of good flowers and herbs, will be careful to pull up every weed, but if the place be a dunghil, or over-grown, he neglects it: Wherefore let us labor to behave our ſelves Chriſtianly, not careleſly, deſperately under reproach.</p>
                  <p>Again, we muſt not carry our ſelves <hi>paſsionately</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> under reproach; though it is true, it is good to be <note place="margin">The evil of being <hi>Paſsionate</hi> under <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</hi>
                     </note> ſenſible of the wrong done to our <hi>names,</hi> more then the wrong done to our <hi>eſtates,</hi> yet neither are the wrongs to our <hi>names</hi> nor to our <hi>eſtates</hi> to be born paſſionately. There are five evils follow upon this diſtemper of heart.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is a great diſturbance to the ſpirit, and <note place="margin">1.</note> that is a greater evil to have the heart diſturbed, then to have a great deal of dirt caſt upon us: To have a diſturbance within the body, is worſe then a violent motion without.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are made lyable to diſcover a great deal of evil in us, that though we are unjuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, <note place="margin">2.</note> yet we may diſcover ſo much evil, as to be a juſt cauſe of reproach.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="368" facs="tcp:57146:193"/>
Thirdly, we do feed the humor of thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, they have part of their end to ſee us ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed. <note place="margin">3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we ſhew the baſeneſs of our ſpirits, to be  <note place="margin">4.</note> ſo ſoon put out of frame. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaking of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Qui vocem niſi quere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las animi nauſeantis.</hi> Sen.</note> of thoſe that are under reproach, <hi>They are,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the complaint of ſqueamiſh ſpirits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is a means to make others to think we are guilty: There is no means whereby I would think <note place="margin">5.</note> one were guilty of what he is reproached, as that, namely, a mighty inordinate paſſion at hearing of thoſe things. If you hear a couple diſputing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he that wants arguments for his caſe, will fall into giving ill language, and paſſion, and therefore thoſe men that have power over their paſſion in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, do what they can to bring thoſe they reaſon withal into <hi>paſsion,</hi> for then they have them at their will: And ſo thoſe that are brought into <hi>paſsion,</hi> when they are reproached, gives a great ſuſpition of the weakneſs of their cauſe, and are thought to be guilty.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, let us not carry our ſelves <hi>revengefully</hi> under our reproaches, not to deſire the reproachers <note place="margin">4.</note> might have an evil name in the ſame kinde: It is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for people that are reproached to do thus, but many though they dare not ſay ſo, yet ſecretly they would be willing that thoſe that do reproach them, might have an evil name. But where have we thoſe <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Innocency</hi> ſeeks not <hi>revenge.</hi>
                     </note> that do labor to clear the innocency of thoſe that do reproach them? it would be the glory of Chriſtians, to be ſo far from revenge to thoſe that reproach them, as to clear their innocency, and to ſpeak well of them as occaſions ſerve, as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>We</hi>
                     <pb n="369" facs="tcp:57146:193"/>
                     <hi>being defamed, we intreat,</hi> and <hi>are not glad if they fall into any evil:</hi> Many people if any have ſpoken evil of them, and they fall into evil, how does it pleaſe them? Let us ſuffer never ſo much, God forbid we ſhould think the evil of our reproach ſo great, as to be glad to have it wiped away with any ſin againſt God: Such and ſuch have ſinned ſuch and ſuch ſins, and by thoſe ſins my reproach is wiped away, and therefore I am glad: God forbid we ſhould have the wiping away of our reproaches at ſo dear a rate. We read in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4. of the great charge that was laid upon the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> they eat up the ſin of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had ſome advantage by the ſins that the people committed, for they brought Sacrifices for their ſin, and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had part, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this they ſet their hearts, upon the ſin of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; this is an abominable thing, to be glad of the ſin of another, becauſe of any advantage that comes to us by it. True it is, God ſhall have a great deal of glory by clearing the innocency of his ſervants, but we muſt not deſire that God may have his glory this way by the commiſſion of any ſin, nor rejoyce in ſuch a way of Gods glory.</p>
                  <p>But the ſpecial and moſt ordinary revenge in the bearing of reproaches, is reviling again, ſpeaking evil <note place="margin">The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling again.</hi>
                     </note> for evil, if they call you one ill name, you will call them another, this is unbeſeeming Chriſtians: And conſider what evil is in it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this is that which is moſt oppoſite to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <note place="margin">I.</note> of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Spirit of Gods people; that place you know, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Who when he was reviled, reviled not again;</hi> if you profeſs your ſelves to be Chriſts, you muſt <hi>not revile again</hi> when you are
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:57146:194"/>
reviled: And ſo the ſpirits of Gods ſervants, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> when they were reviled, they would not give ill language again.</p>
                  <p>Again, by reviling you come to harden thoſe that reproach you in their ſin; when they ſin and ſee the <note place="margin">2.</note> ſame ſin in you, they think they do not worſe then you, ſo they come to be hardned in their ſin, and you come to be guilty of their ſin, you turn their ſin to be yours, becauſe you harden them in theirs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, you by this means ſtir up more corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and more ſin; whereas thoſe that know what ſin <note place="margin">3.</note> means, and are tender of it, they ſhould by all means labor to ſuppreſs it, and beat it down, as when a neighbors houſe is on fire, we will labor what we can to quench it, and not to put more fire to it; ſhall we have more care of our neighbors houſe, then of our neighbors ſoul? his heart is on fire, and his tongue is on fire, and will you bring more fire? this is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, you come by this means to adde your ſin to his ſin: What, is not God diſhonored enough <note place="margin">4.</note> by his reviling, but muſt you adde to Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor?</p>
                  <p>Again fithly, here you ſhew your exceeding folly, <note place="margin">5.</note> that you do not apprehend a greater evil in the <hi>evil of ſin,</hi> then in the evil of <hi>ſuffering:</hi> for if we did apprehend the evil of <hi>ſuffering</hi> to be leſs then the evil of <hi>ſin,</hi> we would never labor to deliver our ſelves from the evil of ſuffering by the evil of ſin; let a man come and caſt dirt in your face, the worſt that can be in this is an evil of ſuffering at firſt, till you make your ſelves guilty, but how will you deliver your ſelves by the evil of ſin? what ignorance is this?
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:57146:194"/>
Are you acquainted with the ways of God? Is this the way to clear your ſelves, by defiling your ſelves more? That filth that comes out of you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files you more then that which is caſt upon you from without.</p>
                  <p>Again further, another evil that comes from this <note place="margin">6.</note> reviling, is this, you ſhew a vile, baſe ſpirit, as if you had no other means to deliver you from an ill name, but an ill tongue; thoſe that know any excellency that they have in themſelves, will know that there are a great many other ways to deliver themſelves from an ill name, rather then an evil tongue. But you are put to your ſhifts, you have evil caſt upon <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Neque prudentiae quicquam in ſe eſſe, nec fiduciae obſtendit, qui con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumclia afficitur.</hi> Sen. in Sap. non cad. injur.</note> you, and you have no way to deliver your ſelves from this evil but by your reviling tongue. It is a ſign there is no excellency in you, nothing but baſeneſs in you. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays of thoſe that are diſorderly affected with reproaches that are caſt upon them, <hi>They ſhew that there is no wiſdom, nor no confidence of any excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in themſelves to oppoſe that evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, hereby you come to be injurious to your ſelves, you deprive your ſelves from any help of <note place="margin">7.</note> God to clear your <hi>names:</hi> If you had hearts to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves to God, he would provide for you; but when you ſeek to clear your ſelves this way, you put your ſelves from any care that God ſhould have to provide for you. That we read of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 38. 12, 13, 14, 15. is very obſervable, <hi>They which ſeek my hurt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſpeak miſchievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long, but I as a deaf man heard not;</hi> and again, <hi>verſe</hi> 14. <hi>I was as a man that heareth not;</hi> but mark <hi>verſe</hi> 15. <hi>In thee O Lord do I hope, thou wilt hear:</hi> The leſs <hi>he</hi> heard, the more confidence
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:57146:195"/>
he had in God that <hi>he would hear,</hi> and could the more comfortably commit his cauſe to <hi>him;</hi> but if he had been too quick to hear himſelf, God would not readily have heard for him, and what had he got by that? Now by all this you cannot but be convinced in your thoughts, that it is a great evil to revile again, and you that have been guilty of this, let your hearts ſmite you, and know what cauſe you have to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>But is it poſſible not to revile again? Who can but <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> do ſo when they come and give ſuch ill language, ſo injurious, ſo falſe?</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that have the Spirit of Chriſt can do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Thoſe that know the evil of ſin to be a greater evil then the evil of ſuffering, can do this. And thoſe that are wiſe, and will not miſchief themſelves, can do this. Can any by reproaches force you to take a knife and cut your ſelves! If they force you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin, they force you to worſe. Certainly you think every man is in bondage; conſider what miſerable bondage men ſhould be in, for to be in the power of their enemies, when they liſt to make them to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief themſelves, can there be any worſe bondage? for an enemy to draw any body where he will, is not ſo much, but to make me to hurt my ſelf, this is a <note place="margin">Nolim te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Wherefore there is no contending with reproaches this way by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching again, here the overcomer is the loſer.

                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, take heed you be not hindred in your way, or <note place="margin">5.</note> break off your courſe when you are reproached: what
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:57146:195"/>
though there be filth caſt in the way, ſhall we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline our way? though the clouds do ariſe, and darken the light of the <hi>Sun,</hi> does the <hi>Sun</hi> ceaſe in its courſe, and ceaſe ſhining becauſe it is darkned? no, it goes on its courſe and ſhines till it breaks forth: ſo you are going on, ſhining in a good converſation, ſome <note place="margin">

No, go on, and in time you will break through the clouds. Was there ever ſuch a fool as to be jeered out of his inheritance? A man hath an inheritance worth a thouſand pounds a year, and a company ſhall go and ſcorn him, and contemn him, and reproach him, and he ſhall be rather willing to part with his inheritance then to be thus jeered; Was there ever any ſuch a fool? Is not our way of Religion a greater inheritance to us, then an inheritance of a thouſand pounds a year? If you ſhould be moved to go out of your way upon reproaches, know that this will be infinite more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to you, then if all the men of the world did caſt reproach upon you; this will reproach you to your conſcience, and that before God and all the Angels and Saints, before all Gods people. And then beſides, this will further reproach you before wicked men too, you will be the more ſcorned and vilified.</p>
                  <p>I remember a ſpeech of a Heathen <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> If any man begin to embrace Philoſophy, he muſt be reproached; They will ſay, What, we ſhall have a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> of you by and by, what pride and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſs is this? But do you ſtill go on in your way, and thoſe who reproached you before, will after admire you: But if you fall off, after you have
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57146:196"/>
begun (not being able to bear reproach) This, ſays he, deſerves a double reproach: Your reproachers will reproach you much more, they will ſay, <hi>Here is a time-ſerver, who will do any thing as the times ſerve for his turn.</hi> None ſo much contemned as <hi>Apoſtates.</hi> Thoſe that oppoſed <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and ſought to hinder his work, did it <hi>to reproach him,</hi> if he had left his work for reproaching, they would have reproached him much more: How would this cut you to the heart, that thoſe that did reproach you, if you go out of the way, ſhould reproach you much more? Conſider, does this beſeem the ſpirit of a Chriſtian? Had you ever any experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal knowledge of the evil of ſin, or any good in the ways of God? Will this be an anſwer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, when you come to give an account why you went out of your way? <hi>Lord, I ſuffered ſo much reproach, I could not bear it.</hi> And again, will it not be juſt with God, for to ſuffer you to fall into ſome vile ſcandalous ſin to be reproached for, after another maner? becauſe that you would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer reproach for his name, you ſhould ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach for your ſin. Theſe are the things we are to be warned of.</p>

                        <hi>Sapiens à nullo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemnitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſuam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novit.</hi> Sen. in Sap. non cad. injur.</note> that is caſt upon them, and therefore when upon every idle reproach, there come a company tatling, and ſay, Such a one ſays <hi>thus</hi> and <hi>thus;</hi> ſuch ſhould be ſent away with an angry countenance, it is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor to you to receive them, as if you would take notice of every word, and as if you had no other things to take up your thoughts. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> having not very well uſed <hi>Plato</hi> at the <hi>Court,</hi> when he was gone, he feared leſt he ſhould write againſt him, therefore he ſent after him, to bid him not to write againſt him, ſays he, Tell <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> I have not ſo much leiſure as to think of him: ſo we ſhould let thoſe that reproach us to know, that <hi>we have not leiſure to think of them;</hi> as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when the <hi>Viper</hi> came upon
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:57146:197"/>
his hand, <hi>he ſhaked it off,</hi> ſome would have ſwelled, and almoſt dyed at the very ſight of ſuch a thing but he did but <hi>ſhake it off:</hi> And ſo ſhould we do by our reproaches; when reproaches are oppoſed they <note place="margin">The evil of much ſtirring when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches are upon us.</note> do grow, as hair the more it is cut the more it grows, when they are deſpiſed they will vaniſh away; there is a great deal of evil comes by making much ado about reproaches.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by this means they are kept up in the mouthes <note place="margin">1.</note> of people, and ſo the evil is worſe, as a dunghil ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſtinks the worſe.</p>
                  <p>Again, it may occaſion thoſe that reproach us, to <note place="margin">2.</note> raiſe up things that were dead a great while ago, and adde that to our reproach.</p>
                  <p>Again, it may occaſion abundance of new matter, <note place="margin">3.</note> though falſe, to make our reproaches greater. If a <note place="margin">

                  <p>Again, our making much ſtir, does but ſtir them the more that do reproach us, and by making ado <note place="margin">4.</note> and ſtir, it comes to be more divulged.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, when we do ſtir, if we do not clear every <note place="margin">5.</note> little minute to the utmoſt, it will be a means to make us ſuſpected of all, and therefore do not take much notice of reproaches. It is a notable example that we finde of one <hi>Pericles</hi> as he was ſitting before others in a meeting, a foul-mouthed fellow railed upon him <note place="margin">Plutarch <hi>in vita</hi> Peric.</note> all the day long; at night when it was dark, and the meeting broke up, the fellow followed him and rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at him even to his door, and he took no notice of him what he ſaid, but when he came at home, this is all he ſaid, <hi>It is dark, I pray let my man light you home.</hi>
                  </p>

But men will take me for guilty if I let it paſs quietly. <note place="margin">Object.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not ſo, we know many times Chriſt himſelf <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> took no notice of a great deal of evil that was <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, it will rather be a means to hearten them by keeping a ſtir, for then they have ſomething to feed upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> How ſhall we ſtop their mouthes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, walk innocently, innocency wil clear all, and overcome in time; hence <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>that thou mayeſt be clear when thou judgeſt.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> quoting this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4. he hath it, <hi>That thou mayeſt overcome when thou judgeſt;</hi> he puts <hi>overcome</hi> for <hi>clear,</hi> becauſe thoſe who are clear will overcome. But more then this in the <hi>ſecond place,</hi> you muſt labor to be eminent in that which is quite contrary to that which you are reproached for: Perhaps he reproaches you for one that is a diſſembler, labor for the greateſt eminency of plainneſs of heart and ſincerity: If it be for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, labor to be eminent in liberality, &amp; doing good wiſely, not where they would have you, but in a gracious way, ordering your affairs by diſcretion: If it be for <hi>pride,</hi> clear your ſelves not by yielding
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:57146:198"/>
to their humor, but labor for an eminency of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity another way, that thoſe that can judge right may ſee there is humility in you: thus labor to entertain reproaches with wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, labor to bear reproaches <hi>patiently.</hi> And therein firſt I ſhall labor to take away thoſe pleas whereby men are hindred in their patience. Secondly, I will ſhew what powerful arguments there are for bearing reproaches. Thirdly, give ſome means how to bear them patiently.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to take away the pleas and objections that <note place="margin">1.</note> people have againſt patience. Some will ſay, if it <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> 1.</note> were not wrongfully, I could bear it, it would never grieve me.</p>
                  <p>One would wonder that ever there ſhould come <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſuch a fooliſh ſpeech out of the mouth of a reaſonable creature; if there be any thing that ſhould uphold your hearts, it ſhould be your innocency, therefore let not ſuch a ſpeech be heard out of a man or womans mouth, much leſs out of a Chriſtians mouth; if your guilt would encreaſe the burthen of the reproach, as moſt certainly it would, then it would be harder to bear it being guilty, then now it is being inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                  <p>But this is that which ſinks my heart, it is a reproach <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> 2.</note> that takes away my <hi>Name,</hi> even from thoſe that are godly, and they come by theſe reproaches to have hard thoughts of me; and this is the greateſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for an outward affliction, under Heaven.</p>
                  <p>It is true, <hi>Zedekiah</hi> feared more to be mocked of <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the <hi>Jews</hi> then of the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> it is certainly a ſorer <note place="margin">Ier. 38. 15</note> affliction to be reproached by the profeſſors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then by any others; but yet God is pleaſed to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:57146:198"/>
exerciſe his people many times with this affliction al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and it may be God ſees this to be the moſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and ſuitable to exerciſe you withal, becauſe he would wholly take off your hearts from other things, and ſatisfie your ſouls with himſelf alone; and bleſſed is that man that can make this uſe of it, to get his heart the more cloſe and fully to God. It is the bleſſing of God upon you, that your heart is above the reproaches of other men; if God will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe you with an affliction that you are ſenſible of, it is fit you ſhould yield your ſelf unto him in it: Would you have God exerciſe you in ſuch afflictions as are onely eaſie to be born, of which you ſhould not be ſenſible? it is the bitterneſs of them that cauſeth them to work, if they were not bitter, as to make you ſenſible, it is not like they would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſome cannot tell how to bear their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, becauſe it is not onely a diſgrace to their <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> 3.</note> name, but it hinders their ſervice in Gods Church, by this means they come to have ill eſteem, and are not like to do ſo much good in the Church of God, which I confeſs is a great matter.</p>
                  <p>Let no man lay ſo much upon his ſervice he ſhall do, but let God have his work his own way, and God <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> expects this humility from us, that he may have his work done his own way, and if God pleaſeth he may make uſe of us to do ſo much work for him, as if our names were never ſo clear: The <hi>Prophets</hi> were ſcorned and reproached, and did they never do ſervice? and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> never any man in the world that ever did God more ſervice, and yet no man that ever was ſo much reproached as he; he
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57146:199"/>
was whipped up and down as if he had been a rogue, and he was fain to go about in tatters, not having wherewithal to cover his nakedneſs, and had not bread to put in his body, and was called a ſeditious fellow, and counted the filth of all things; and yet this St. <hi>Paul</hi> was uſed as the moſt worthy inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods ſervice that ever was ſince the world began, next Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the arguments that may move us to bear <note place="margin">Why <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches</hi> ſhould be born <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ently.</hi>
                     </note> reproaches patiently.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a Chriſtian is called to do and ſuffer great things for God, and ſtrong and glorious is the grace of God that is in a man where it is true; now if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity <note place="margin">1.</note> ſhall not enable to bear reproaches, what will it enable you to do? Does not the Scripture ſpeak of the excellency, and the glory, and the power of the grace of God? What excellency, and power, and glory is in it, if it cannot do this? Now Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that are called to do and ſuffer ſuch great things, ſhould be above the reproaches of the world. <hi>Seneca</hi> would not have them called miſeries, but <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sapiens à nullo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemnitur, magnitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſuam novit, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes bas quas non miſcrias ſed mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtias dixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim non vincet, ſed ne ſentit quidem.</hi> Sen in ſap. non cad. injur. c. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>trouble ſome things,</hi> concerning which we cannot ſay a wiſe man overcomes them, but he is ſo far above them, as he is ſcarce ſenſible of them; if it be not out of ſtupidity or diſcontentedneſs, but out of true magnanimity of ſpirit, that one is not ſenſible of ſuch things, this beſeems a Chriſtian well. Now if a Chriſtian having received the grace of God, ſhould not think much of any miſery that he is capable of in this world, then ſurely he ſhould not have his heart ſink when there is but a troubleſome thing befaln him. It was the ſpeech of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> when one came and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him, ſays he, <hi>You have learned how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,</hi>
                     <pb n="381" facs="tcp:57146:199"/>
and <hi>I have learned how to bear reproach.</hi> And <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> the Philoſopher ſaid, <hi>You are fit</hi> to caſt <note place="margin">Tu profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendis ego audiendis co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumellis idoneus</note> 
                     <hi>reproaches,</hi> and <hi>I am fit</hi> to hear <hi>reproaches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, what are <hi>you?</hi> or what is your <hi>names</hi> that you ſhould think much to bear reproach? when as others that are your betters, that are not <note place="margin">2.</note> ſo vile, not ſo guilty as you, not ſo lyable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach as you; when as others of Gods ſervants, that have been moſt eminent in grace and parts, have been under exceeding reproach; yea, others whoſe names have been far more worth then yours, there have been more uſe of their names, and credits, and honors, then of yours, and yet God hath ſo ordered it in his providence, that reproaches and aſperſions have been caſt upon them, and do you think ſo much to be reproached? What do we think of our fleſh better then others, that we ſhould not endure trouble in it? and what do we think of our names, that we cannot endure reproaches in them.</p>
                  <p>Yea, not onely others that are better then you, but God and Chriſt is reproached: How is the <note place="margin">3.</note> name of God ſlighted? the baſeſt wretch that will tremble before his Maſter, thinks himſelf good enough to blaſpheme the name of God: How is the <hi>majeſty, ſoveraignty,</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> of God contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world? How are the dreadful threatnings of God, and the revelation of Gods wrath ſcorned in the world? When as we hear out of the word ſuch dreadful manifeſtations of Gods wrath againſt ſin, which calls for trembling hearts, yet how are they ſlighted in the world? thus God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and Chriſt: <hi>No man is able to bear ſo much</hi>
                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:57146:200"/>
                     <hi>contempt as Chriſt beares daily,</hi> ſays <hi>Luther:</hi> Not to ſpeak of the reproaches that Chriſt endures in his <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, conſider the great mercy of God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing the ſecret ſins of your thoughts: there are none, let them be never ſo innocent in the world, yet there is ſo much filth and baſeneſs within the heart, that if God ſhould but turn the inſide outward, and diſcover all to the world, certainly it would make them aſhamed of the ſociety of men, make them aſhamed to come into the Congregation; what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and what matter of reproach would there be then? Now, ſeeing God in his goodneſs favors his people ſo far, as he keeps in much ſecret evil that he could diſcover before the world: if he ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf a little from you, he could let you fall into ſuch ſins, as your ſecret ſins ſhould be diſcovered; but God favors your names, ſo as that he hath kept
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57146:200"/>
in that ſecret evil that you have had ſecret inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto; now the conſideration of Gods goodneſs in tendring you ſo far, may very well quiet your hearts when you begin to be troubled for every reproach that is caſt upon you: Now I ſee my adverſaries are fain to watch and ſearch, and pry for occaſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, God might have given them matter enough, and therefore its mercy they have ſuch little matter as they have. It is a great work of nature to keep the filth of the body when it is in a man from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſavory unto others; ſo the filth of the ſoul, though it be unſavory to God, yet it is Gods mercy that keeps it from that unſavorineſs that it might be to men.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, conſider how much reproach the name of <note place="margin">5.</note> God hath endured for your ſakes; and is it ſo great a <note place="margin">

                  <p>And what is it you are reproached for? it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or evil; if it be good, you have no cauſe to be troubled, if it be <hi>evil,</hi> it is threefold, the evil of <hi>ſin,</hi> or natural <hi>infirmities,</hi> or outward <hi>meanneſs.</hi> If it be the evil of <hi>ſin,</hi> then either you are guilty or not guilty; if you be guilty, it is not reproach, but right judgement of thy condition, and if there be ſuch a great evil for others to ſpeak of it, what a great evil is it for thee to be guilty of it? and therefore you ſhould turn all the trouble that you have for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice which is taken of it, upon your guiltineſs in it: and many times although the thing be true they ſay of you, yet it is ſo poor and mean a thing, that you may comfort your ſelf in this, that ſurely they cannot perceive worſe in you, for if they could, they would make uſe of that. <hi>Latimer</hi> in his laſt Sermon before <hi>K.</hi>

                  <p>Seventhly, conſider what honor God hath put upon you, and what he intends to put upon you: if you be godly, he hath put honor enough upon you, and that may be enough to uphold the heart under all the <note place="margin">7.</note> reproaches and ſtains that men and Devils can caſt upon you.

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:57146:203"/>
he hath honored you by the glorious priviledges of the Goſpel, he hath honored you by giving himſelf and Chriſt to you; he hath honored you in the hearts of his Saints, men of precious ſpirits, who know much of Gods minde, who are able to judge wherein true excellency conſiſts, their hearts are with you, they bleſs God for you, the eſteem of one godly man is more to be regarded then thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of others, your name is precious amongſt the Saints, and that is enough.

if they come into wicked company, and have but an evil tongue ſpeak againſt them, they are ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and caſt down, as if all the honor that God had put upon them were nothing: What an evil thing is this?

                  <p>If you had never ſo much filth upon you for the preſent, being there is ſo much honor to come, what need you to care?

Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there be hot water, and I put ſo much cold to it, it loſes its warmth, but if I put more warm then cold to it, then the water hath loſt nothing of its warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: So ſuppoſe you be reproached, and God brings more honor then the reproach did ſcandal, then you have loſt nothing; <hi>Every fool can caſt reproach,</hi> but <hi>it is the part of a wiſe man to bear it well.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, if we can bear reproaches patiently, what <note place="margin">2.</note> a quiet will it be to our hearts? otherwiſe we ſhould never be quiet, for we live amongſt thoſe that will caſt reproaches, and unleſs we can get power this way, we ſhall never have comfortable lives, and we ſhould think it much, that the comfort and quiet of our lives ſhould lie at the mercy of others.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the bearing of reproaches patiently is a mighty help to the progreſs of godlineſs in us: As <note place="margin">3.</note> thoſe that have overcome the evil of ſhame in a way
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57146:206"/>
of ſin, grow mightily hardned in their ſins; ſo thoſe that have got that ſtrength, to go on in the ways of God, ſo as not much to regard any reproach that is <note place="margin">

                  <p>Laſtly, conſider there is much danger in being honored by men, and in many regards, the <hi>honors</hi> of men are as much, if not more to be feared then their <hi>contempts</hi> and diſhonors. <hi>Luther</hi> writing to a friend of his, ſays, He would not have the glory and fame of <hi>Eraſmus;</hi> my greateſt fear is the praiſes of men, but my joy is in their reproaches and evil ſpeeches.</p>

                     <hi>Gulielmus Pariſienſis</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>De virtutibus,</hi> hath notable Expreſſions to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Little things,</hi> ſaith he, yea <hi>meer nothings caſt down poor weak ſpirited men.</hi> The words of vain men are ſmall things, whoſoever fears ſuch words ſo as to do evil, or to leave off good, are the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of men; theſe are like unto Soldiers who are caſt down and overcome, not with ſome violent ſtrong tempeſt, but with ſome ſmall weak puff of winde, theſe are the more ridiculous and not to be reckoned amongſt Warriers; nay, they are not to be reckoned amongſt men, who fall off for fear of words, which yet have not been ſpoken, as if a man ſhould fall for fear of the wind which yet blows not, ſuch are thoſe who dare not do good, or leave evil, for fear of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, another means is to make your moan to God, and lay your caſe before him, as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> came and <hi>reviled God,</hi> and the people
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:57146:208"/>
of God, he went and <hi>ſpread the letter before God,</hi> and made his moan before God; If we can do ſo, there will be that ſatisfaction to our ſouls that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, and that will be a great argument of our innocency; Many will ſay, <hi>Oh they are innocent,</hi> and <hi>God knows their hearts,</hi> but can you go and make your moan before God when you are reproached, and acquaint God with the cauſe, and receive refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that way, as <hi>Job</hi> 16. 20. <hi>My friends ſcorn me,</hi> but <hi>mine eyes pour out tears to God:</hi> And <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 109. 1, 2. <hi>Hold not thy peace, O God of my praiſe, for the mouth of the wicked, and the mouth of the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal are opened againſt me, they have ſpoken againſt me with a lying tongue; they have compaſſed me about with words of hatred, they are mine adverſaries,</hi> but <hi>I prayer;</hi> for ſo the words are in the <hi>Original,</hi> not <hi>I give my ſelf,</hi> but onely thus, <hi>but I prayer;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, as for my part, all that I do to help my ſelf withal, is to pray to God, and make my moan: Others have their evil tongues to help them, and run to this witneſs and that witneſs, to ſeek to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>but I prayer, Pſal.</hi> 57. 2, 3. I cry unto God moſt high, he ſhall ſend from heaven and ſave me from reproach of him that would ſwallow me up, <hi>Selah;</hi> God ſhall ſend forth his mercy and truth: A carnal heart hath no way to deliver it ſelf, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches again, by running up and down from one witneſs to another, but a gracious heart hath other ways to help it ſelf, it cryes to God moſt high, and looks for help from Heaven; God ſends forth his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and truth to help, and there is help indeed.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, another help is this, if you can but get your <note place="margin">5.</note> hearts quietly and kindely to lament the condition
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:57146:208"/>
of your reproachers, this will be a marvellous means toſweeten the heart, and to help to bear reproaches. It was the anſwer of <hi>Socrates</hi> to one who wondred at his patience towards one who reviled him, <hi>If we ſhould meet one,</hi> ſays he, <hi>whoſe</hi> body <hi>were more unſound then</hi> ours, <hi>ſhould we be angry with him, and not rather pity him? why then ſhould we not do the like to him whoſe</hi> ſoul <hi>is more diſeaſed then ours?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The folly of our <hi>reproachers</hi> ſhould cauſe us to pity them, to be patient towards them, and paſs by the wrong they do unto us; this was one of the arguments that <hi>Abigail</hi> brought to <hi>David,</hi> to quiet his ſpirit that was ſo ſtirred againſt <hi>Nabal,</hi> becauſe of that reproach he caſt upon him; <hi>Nabal,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>is his name, and folly is with him,</hi> it is his folly, rather pity him, it is too low a thing for ſuch a ſpirit as <hi>Davids</hi> is to be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with it. Inſtead of being troubled with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches that are upon you, your ſpirits ſhould be moſt troubled for their ſin: Now there is infinite cauſe we have to be troubled for their ſin more then for any evil that befals us. An evil tongue devours, and is an abomination, and in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 13. God ſays, <hi>The froward mouth he hates:</hi> Now if you have any love you ſhould think thus, This poor man what hath he done? he hath brought himſelf under <hi>the hatred of God;</hi> now this ſhould mightily affect the hearts of the godly. As he is an abomination to God, ſo he is an abomination to men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 9. <hi>The ſcorner is an abomination to men;</hi> ſcornful ſpirits love to caſt ſhame and ignominy upon others. And in <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 7. <hi>A fools mouth is his deſtruction, and his lips are the ſnare of his ſoul;</hi> we ſhould think, he hath but enſnared
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:57146:209"/>
his own ſoul, and ſo fall a lamenting of his wretched condition. And ſo in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 10. <hi>Your breath as fire ſhall devour you:</hi> If the breath of any man devours him, the breath of revilers, and reproachers, and ſlanderers does. The Heathens called a reproacher <hi>A three tongued man,</hi> becauſe he hurts three at once, he hurts <hi>him</hi> that he <hi>reproaches,</hi> and him that <hi>heard</hi> the reproach, and <hi>himſelf</hi> worſt of all; do but get power over your hearts to bewail this ſin, and your reproach will not be ſo troubleſom. <hi>Trilinguis Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> a writer upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. obſerves the exceeding patience of thoſe three <hi>Emperors, Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Honorius, Arcadius,</hi> towards thoſe who ſpake <note place="margin">Si ex levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendum, ſi ex inſania miſeratione dignum, ſi ab inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendum.</note> evil of them, they would have them ſubject to no puniſhment, for they ſaid, If it comes from <hi>lightneſs</hi> of ſpirit, it is to be contemned, if from madneſs, it is worthy of pity, if from injury, it is to be pardoned, wrongs are to be forgiven.</p>
                  <p>Again, labor to poſſeſs your ſouls with the reality of the ſweet of, and the honor there is in the ways <note place="margin">6.</note> of God, ſo no reproach will be grievous to you: As it is ſaid of the covetous man, when ſome told him, Such and ſuch hiſs at thee, but ſays he, I care not, <hi>I rejoyce in what I have at home, that I have ſo much</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mihi ipſi domi plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, nummos in area.</note> 
                     <hi>money in my cheſt:</hi> So it ſhould be with a gracious heart, he ſhould ſay, <hi>I have ſweet enough in my own heart, what need I trouble my ſelf with what others think or ſay?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, labor to ſatisfie your ſouls in the glory of God and Chriſt: Though my name be caſt out as <note place="margin">7.</note> filth, yet the name of God and Chriſt is bleſſed and glorious, and ſo ſhall be for ever, let Devils and wicked men do what they can againſt it; It was a
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:57146:209"/>
good ſpeech of <hi>Luther,</hi> writing to his friend <hi>Spalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> bemoaning his condition to him, becauſe of the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prorſus Satan eſt Lutherus, ſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus vivit &amp; regnat Amen.</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ad Spalat.</note> ſcorn and contempt he ſuffered, yet comforting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this, that Chriſt lived and reigned, <hi>Luther</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted even a Devil, but Chriſt lives and reigns, he addes his Amen to it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is not enough to bear reproaches pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, but we muſt bear them fruitfully: a chriſtian ſhould think he hath not done that which belongs to <note place="margin">3.</note> a chriſtian, unleſs he hath got ſome good by them; <note place="margin">How to bear <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches</hi> fruitfully</note> a chriſtian ſhould not think it enough to free himſelf from the ſcorn of the tongue, but he muſt improve it for good by it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, conſider what ends God aims at by it, and labor to work them upon your ſelves, that you may <note place="margin">1.</note> attain to thoſe ends.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, labor to draw what good inſtructions you can from the reproaches of others: As namely <note place="margin">2.</note> thus, when I hear men reproach and revile, O what a deal of evil is there ſecretly in the heart of man, that is not diſcovered till it have occaſion? I did not think that ſuch and ſuch could ever have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachers, if they had not been provoked. Again, do I ſee another ſo vigilant over me to finde me out to reproach me; how vigilant ſhould I be over my ſelf to finde out what is in me to humble me? Again, is there ſo much evil to be under the ſtroke of mans tongue, what a great evil is it to be under the ſtroke of Gods juſtice?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, to be fruitful, that is, ſet upon what duty God calls for at the preſent; ſurely this is one great ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <note place="margin">3.</note> duty, that the leſs credit I ſee I have in the world, let me labor to have the more credit in Heaven; I
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:57146:210"/>
ſee there is a breach of my name here, let me ſeek to make up my name in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And then they muſt be born joyfully, but we ſhall ſpeak of that afterwards in the third point, that a gracious heart is not onely willing to bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach when God calls unto it, but in the cauſe of CHRIST to triumph and rejoyce in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, we ſhould return good for evil; then you come to the top of Chriſtianity. This is a ſign of <note place="margin">

your ſelves under reproaches after this maner: Now what a great evilis this to cut a man off from that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which hath been ſpoken of in this argument? and if you do behave your ſelves chriſtianly under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, God is more and more engaged to ſtand for your names, and you are more prepared for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

                  <p>There is onely one place of Scripture that I ſhall adde, and ſo I have done with this point: <hi>Job</hi> 17. compare the 6. verſe with the 8. and 9. verſes; ver. 6. <hi>He hath made me alſo a by-word of the people: Job</hi> was a godly man, and yet he was made a <hi>by-word:</hi> What then? at the 8. verſe, <hi>Upright men ſhall be aſtonied at this:</hi> How?

And ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted:</hi> The ſufferings and troubles of Gods people are the ſufferings and troubles of Chriſt, he is ſenſible of them; and therefore in <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4.

                  <p>But is it ſaid here the reproach of Chriſt? It may be asked, Why not the reproach of God the Father, or the reproach of the Holy Ghoſt?</p>
                  <p>The reproaches of Gods people are the reproaches of Chriſt in a ſpecial maner; becauſe Chriſt is the head of the Church, and it is from the fulneſs of Chriſt, that they have that grace conveyed which is reproached; and the union they have with God, and with the Spirit, is by Chriſt; and therefore it is the reproach of Chriſt here named, according to the ſeveral workings of the <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> ſo the three perſons are reproached by
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:57146:212"/>
mans ſin: There is a reproach unto <hi>God</hi> as God, and unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> as Chriſt, and unto the <hi>Spirit</hi> as the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>There is a reproach unto God as he is <hi>Creator,</hi> the preſerver of the world, and governor of all things: When the work of God, the firſt Perſon of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is reproached, then he is reproached, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 31. <hi>He that oppreſſeth the poor, reproacheth his maker:</hi> It is a work of the <hi>Father</hi> to order things ſo, as to make one poor, and one rich: And you take an advantage to mock at the poor upon this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which God hath made in the world, when as you ſhould honor the work of God in making any difference between you and others: but in ſtead of honoring of it, you caſt an aſperſion upon his work, and deſpiſe others, becauſe God hath put them in a low condition; you reproach your Creator in this. And when the work of Redemption is deſpiſed, when that is oppoſed, and when the profeſſion of the Goſpel hath diſhonor put upon it, then Chriſt is reproached: <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Thoſe that fall off after they have taſted of the heavenly gift, and the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, they put the Son of God to an open ſhame.</hi> And when en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning, and drawing, and the quickening and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting work of the Spirit is reproached and vilified, then the Spirit is reproached, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. <hi>They do deſpite to the Spirit of grace:</hi> So that you ſee both <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> all three are reproached by mans ſin; not that the ſin of man is able to caſt the leaſt ſtain upon the glory of the bleſſed God, or make God to be leſs glorious, no more then a little duſt caſt up into the air can darken the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:57146:212"/>
of the Sun ſhining in its ſtrength; but it keeps the glory of God from ſhining upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and upon himſelf, ſo as he and others ſhall not ſee it, and admire it, and adore it as they ought.</p>
                  <p>If you ask why the reproaches of Gods people are <note place="margin">Object.</note> called the reproaches of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, as <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> becauſe they do <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſuffer the ſame things that Chriſt ſuffers; you ſhall finde the reproaches of Gods people, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Chriſt are juſt alike one another. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 6, 7, 8. there are three things upon which Chriſt ſeems to be reproached, and they are the three ſpecial things upon which Chriſtians are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached: As firſt the outward means of Chriſt in the world, <hi>I am a worm and no man,</hi> ſo the outward, mean and low condition of Gods people ſubjects them to reproach. Secondly, Chriſt bore the world <note place="margin">Why the <hi>Reproaches</hi> of Gods people are called the <hi>Reproaches</hi> of Chriſt.</note> in hand that he truſted in God, and depended upon God, and no outward help; and therefore they ſaid, <hi>Let us ſee whether he will deliver him, being he truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him;</hi> ſo the men of the world ſcorn at Gods people, becauſe they ſpeak ſo much of God, and truſting in God. Thirdly, they reproached him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaid, <hi>God delighted in him;</hi> ſo becauſe the Saints of God do profeſs their relations to God, and do expect an eſpecial love of God, therefore the world reproaches them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is the reproach of Chriſt, in regard of the near relation, and cloſe union that is between <note place="margin">2.</note> Chriſt and his people: As the reproach of the <hi>Wife</hi> is the reproach of the <hi>Husband,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the <hi>Husband</hi> is the reproach of the <hi>Wife,</hi>
                     <pb n="408" facs="tcp:57146:213"/>
becauſe of their <hi>union,</hi> and therefore in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. the Apoſtle calls <hi>the woman, the glory of the man:</hi> Either in regard that the man may glory in her if ſhe be godly and good, or elſe becauſe the woman does honor the man, <hi>the Wife is to honor her Husband,</hi> and to give glory to him; as the people of God are called <hi>The glory of God,</hi> partly becauſe God does glory <hi>in them,</hi> and partly becauſe they do give glory to God: ſo the woman ſhould be ſuch a one as the man may glory in her, and ſuch a one as may give glory to her husband: Now the Church is the glory of Chriſt, as the wife is the glory of the man; and therefore it is ſaid in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 23. ſpeaking of <hi>Titus</hi> and others which were meſſengers of the Church, he ſays, <hi>they are the glory of Chriſt,</hi> then certainly their reproaches muſt be the reproaches of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Nay, there is a nearer union then this, for this is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by convenant, but there is a union between the head and the members, that is a nearer union; the Church is not onely <hi>fleſh of Chriſts fleſh,</hi> and <hi>bone of Chriſts bone,</hi> but it is the fleſh of Chriſt, and the bone of Chriſt, it is <hi>the very fulneſs of the body of Christ, Eph.</hi> 1. 23. it is a high expreſſion: Yea, and beſides this, the Church is called Chriſt, <hi>myſtical Christ:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>For as the body is one, and hath many members, &amp; all the members of that one body being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are one body, ſo alſo is Chriſt;</hi> that is, <hi>The Church having many members, ought to be joyned in union as the body;</hi> yea, there is yet anearer union between Chriſt and his people, <hi>the in-being is mutual,</hi> Chriſt is in them, and they are in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14. 20. <hi>You in me, and in you:</hi> The arm is in the body, but the body is not in the arm; the branch is in the vine,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:57146:213"/>
but the vine is not in the branch; but here as the Saints are in Chriſt, ſo Chriſt is in them: and in regard of this near union between them, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches may well be eſteemed the reproaches of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe they are reproached <hi>for the ſake of Chriſt:</hi> if a dog be abuſed for the ſake of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <note place="margin">3.</note> it is the abuſe of his maſter: much more when Gods own people are abuſed for the ſake of Chriſt; and therefore we finde that this hath been the plea of Gods people, <hi>for thy ſake have we been killed all the day long;</hi> it was for Chriſts ſake rather then any evil in themſelves. And therefore though they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for their ſins, it may come to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt, namely thus, When as men ſhall take advantage the rather againſt them, becauſe they are profeſſors of Religion; and were it not for this reaſon, they might juſtly reproach them; yet when as they put in this reaſon, They could bear well enough with the ſin, were it not they were profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Religion, then the reproaches that they juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might ſuffer for their ſins, do come to be the reproaches of Chriſt. And further, when in theſe they will take advantage to reproach the ſhews of Religion, which in others they cannot bear well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; as when one that is a Profeſſor expreſſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in lifting up his eyes, or his hands to Heaven, they will reproach him for making ſhews of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and preſently they are Hypocrites: and yet there are others can make mighty ſhews, and they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
                  <p>Again, they are the reproaches of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are reproached in the work of Chriſt: <note place="margin">4.</note>
                     <pb n="410" facs="tcp:57146:214"/>
As when <hi>David</hi> ſent meſſengers to the children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> to congratulate their King, and they cut off <hi>their garments half way,</hi> and <hi>cut off half of their beards, David</hi> preſently counted it his reproach; and ſo when Gods people are in Gods work, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, ſurely it Chriſts reproach. So <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was in Gods work, and he ſuffered a great deal of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; and mark how God is more provoked then <hi>Nehemiah, Nehem.</hi> 4. compare the third verſe with the fifth.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is the Spirit of Chriſt that is in them that is reproached: As if ſo be that the skill or influence <note place="margin">5.</note> that comes from a skilful Attificer, that is put into one that hath learned, that does as it were but act his ſpirit, if he ſhall ſee him reproached for that work which is done by vertue of that influence which he had of his ſpirit in him, then he counts himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached: ſo all the gracious works of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are by the influence of the ſpirit of Chriſt; and therefore when they are reproached, Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached: <hi>we have not received the ſpirit of the world, but the Spirit of God,</hi> ſays the Apo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtle: this is the reaſon of all oppoſition, becauſe of the difference of ſpirits; now the ſpirit of God and the Spirit of the world are oppoſite. But to come to the application of the point.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>if the reproaches of Gods people</hi> be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 1.</note> of Chriſt, then certainly Chriſt is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reproached in the world; none ſo reproached as Chriſt is, becauſe he is not onely reproached him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but all the reproaches that fall upon all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world, not onely ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> time, but from the beginning of the world, they are all the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:57146:214"/>
reproaches of Chriſt, none ſuffers ſo much as he: conſider we then with our ſelves, how we can love this Chriſt, a reproached Chriſt? Is Chriſt notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his reproaches dear and precious to us? howſoever he be to the world, yet can your ſouls ſay with the Church, <hi>He is altogether lovely,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7, 8. <hi>He is a rock, and a ſtone of offence to thoſe that do not believe, but to you precious;</hi> and ſo Chriſt, though he be a reproached Chriſt, yet to you he is precious; to a godly and gracious heart how precious is Jeſus Chriſt? There is a notable place concerning the reproaches of Chriſt, and yet of the high eſteem that Gods people have of him, notwithſtanding he is reproached, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 14, 15. <hi>His viſage was ſo marred more then any mans, and his form more then the ſons of men:</hi> what then, is there none therefore that ſhall prize him? yes; at the fifteenth verſe, <hi>So ſhall he ſprinkle many Nations: the Kings ſhall ſhut their mouthes at him, for that which had not been told them ſhall they ſee, and that which they had not heard ſhall they conſider;</hi> that is, there ſhall yet come a time when as the Lord <hi>ſhall ſprinkle many nations</hi> by the work of his Spirit, <hi>and draw many Kings, ſo as they ſhall ſhut their mouthes;</hi> whereas they contemned him, and deſpiſed him, now they <hi>ſhall ſhut their mouthes</hi> in a way of admiration, that <hi>that</hi> had not been told them <hi>which they ſee:</hi> as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he knew Chriſt onely after the fleſh, but when he came to know him after another maner, he thought otherwiſe of him: So when God does ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle any with his Spirit, that they know Chriſt, though <hi>his viſage he marred more then any mans,</hi> and he is reproached more then any man, yet they ſhall prize
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:57146:215"/>
him, and delight in him, and the more he is reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more they ſhall delight in him: It is a notable <note place="margin">

                  <head>CHAP. XXXV. <hi>Sixteen ſeveral Conſolatións ariſing to the Saints from this conſideration, That their ſufferings are Chriſts ſufferings.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>SEcondly, the conſideration of this point is of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 2.</note> admirable uſe for the conſolation of all the people of God, in all their ſufferings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. If reproaches and ſufferings be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Chriſt, Chriſt is engaged in them more then you; there may be many branches of comfort to Gods people from hence, That Chriſt is ſo engaged in all their ſufferings, as they are accounted Chriſts own: it is a great matter, when any one ſuffers any thing, if they know this, that any great man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in their ſufferings: if a ſubject ſhould have a <hi>King</hi> ſo engaged in any thing he undertakes, that he can ſay, Whatſoever I ſuffer in this, is the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>King,</hi> this is a great comfort to him; ſo here there are ſeveral branches of comfort that may be drawn from this, Our ſufferings are the ſufferings of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is a great deal of comfort, that God does <note place="margin">1. Comfort againſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</hi>
                     </note> take notice of our reproaches: This was the comfort of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 19. <hi>Thou haſt known my reproach, and my ſhame, and my diſhonor, my adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:57146:215"/>
are all before thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> If a man ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and diſgrace, and trouble for his friends, while he is abroad from them; O ſays he, Did but my friends know what I ſuffer, and ſuffer for them, it would comfort me: If it be comfort to be known, much more when they ſhall be accounted their own; Chriſt is acquainted with all the ſufferings of every member: and therefore do not ſay, I am a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who takes notice of my ſufferings? Heaven takes notice of your ſufferings, Chriſt takes notice of them better then your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if they be the ſufferings of Chriſt, they are no other but ſuch as are predetermined for <note place="margin">2.</note> you from the beginning of the world; for certainly the ſufferings of Chriſt are determined: It may be ſaid of theſe ſufferings, as truly as of thoſe he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his own perſon, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>They are by the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate counſel &amp; foreknowledge of God:</hi> &amp; therefore it is not in the liberty of man to reproach you as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but all is by the fore-determinate counſel of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, certainly you do not want compaſſion in <note place="margin">3.</note> your ſufferings neither; for one to ſuffer much, and to be reproached, and no body to have compaſſion, is grievous; but ſurely you have compaſſion enough, Chriſt muſt needs take compaſſion on you: and it is not a forced compaſſion, but a natural compaſſion: was there ever any that was not ſenſible of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his own fleſh, unleſs it be dead? Indeed if you be a dead member of a Church, it may be Chriſt does not compaſſionate your ſufferings, but if you be a living member, Chriſt does compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate your ſufferings, and pity you in every <hi>lye</hi> and <hi>ſlander</hi> that is told of you: many times when
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:57146:216"/>
we hear of the ſervants of God (and eſpecially thoſe we know to be godly) to have ſuch ſtrange reports of them, our hearts begin to break, and to yern to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. If one member have compaſſion of another, much more the <hi>head;</hi> the head is more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the evils done to the body, then the other members are.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, all theſe reproaches and ſufferings do not <note place="margin">4.</note> argue your rejection, they may ſtand with the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love of God: many of Gods people are ready to draw ſad concluſions from their reproaches, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God would not ſuffer this if he loved them: they may ſtand with the ſame love wherewith the <hi>Father</hi> loved the Son, for they are the reproaches of the <hi>Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, they muſt needs be ſanctified to you: thoſe that are the ſufferings of Chriſt, are fanctified ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; <note place="margin">5.</note> certainly Chriſt will not ſuffer them to go away unſanctified; Chriſt is ſo holy, that if they come near to him, he will make them holy: and therefore your bodies and ſouls having union with Chriſt, they come to be ſanctified: ſo all your conditions and ſufferings come to be ſanctified by union with Chriſt: he is the bleſſed one of God, and therefore all your ſufferings muſt be bleſſed from him.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, if they be <hi>the reproaches of Christ,</hi> then <note place="margin">6.</note> you are not left to bear the burthen of them alone, you have but the lighter end of the ſtaff: if a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then be never ſo heavy at one end, and a ſtrong man is under that, and the other be light, though a weak man be under that, he does not care: ſo the weight and burthen of reproaches lie upon the ſhoulders of Chriſt: and therefore when you think it is hard for
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:57146:216"/>
one reproach thus to follow upon another, and for one evil to follow another, it will break my heart; ah, if you did bear it alone, but Chriſt bears the weight of our reproaches.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, if they be the reproaches of Chriſt, then for that part you do bear, although it be but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <note place="margin">7.</note> you may expect his ſtrength in, you are not left to bear that little by your own ſtrength; Chriſt gives out his own ſtrength, to bear his own reproaches; if the burthen be his you bear, you ſhall have ſtrength from him to bear it.</p>
                  <p>Again, this is an eighth ſtream of comfort, if they <note place="margin">8.</note> be the reproaches of Chriſt, they are the reproaches of all the members of Chriſt, who ſympathize with you, and help to bear the burthen with you.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, it may be comfort that your names ſhall <note place="margin">9.</note> be vindicated, your names are as dear to Chriſt as his own, and it does as much concern Chriſt to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate <hi>your names</hi> as to vindicate his own.</p>
                  <p>Again, if our reproaches be Chriſts reproaches, <note place="margin">10.</note> and Chriſt is content to own our reproaches; ſurely, he will not leave us to take our ſins upon our ſelves: if his love be ſuch as he will take the burthen of our ſufferings upon himſelf; ſurely his love is ſuch as not to ſee us ſink under the burthen of our ſins: No, our ſins are upon him as well as our ſufferings; not that he takes them upon him to be guilty, but only by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: the Text ſays, <hi>He was made ſin;</hi> what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of conſolation is this, that Chriſt is willing both to take off our ſins and ſufferings? there are nothing but theſe two that ſhould trouble us in the world, our ſins and ſufferings, and Chriſt takes them off both.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And yet further, if Chriſt will own our <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">11.</note>
                     <pb n="416" facs="tcp:57146:217"/>
                     <hi>proaches,</hi> then he will own our ſervices: there is no great difficulty of believing the one, if we believe the other: we may comfortably go to Chriſt and ſay, <hi>Bleſſed Savior, wilt thou own upon thy ſelf, the dirt caſt upon our faces,</hi> and <hi>wilt not own the work of thine own Spirit?</hi> though we may ſtain the work of Gods grace by our ſin, yet Chriſt that is ſo indulgent to take reproaches, will ſurely own our ſervices; he will own our active obedience, as well as our paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>Again, then we may be aſſured there will come good of them, and that we ſhall be carried through <note place="margin">12.</note> them; conſider three or four things here for our help in this, to aſſure us of a bleſſing in theſe our ſufferings. Firſt, were it that we onely did know that God had a love to us, and were merciful to us, that were enough to aſſure us. But, ſecondly, God may have love and not binde himſelf by promiſe; but as he hath <hi>love,</hi> ſo he hath engaged himſelf by <hi>promiſe</hi> to help his people in ſufferings, and that is more. But, thirdly, we have the experience of Gods dealings with his people, that he never left them in ſuffering. And fourthly, we may riſe higher, <hi>it is Gods own caſe,</hi> we have further aſſurance by this: If a man <hi>love me,</hi> I hope it will be well with me; if he <hi>promiſe me,</hi> that is more; if others have had <hi>experience,</hi> I am more aſſured: but if it be his <hi>own cauſe,</hi> I am ſure enough. If a man go to ſea, and he knows the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner hath skill, and he loves me, and the Mariner promiſes he will have care, and others have had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his care, this is much: but when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, my life is the Mariners life, if <hi>I</hi> periſh, <hi>he</hi> periſhes; this aſſures me, that as far as the Mariner can do it,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:57146:217"/>
it ſhall be well with me. <hi>Luther</hi> writing to <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton</hi> troubled with fears; <hi>If we fall,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Chriſt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Si nos ruit mus ruet e Chriſtus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luth.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>falls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, here we have a notable ground to go to God in prayer in all ſufferings, becauſe we can go with <note place="margin">13.</note> this argument, <hi>Lord it is thy own Name:</hi> that was the plea of <hi>Moſes, Lord, if thou deſtroyest thy people, what will become of thy Name?</hi> our names are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, what though ten thouſand ſuch <hi>as we are</hi> come to nought, and rot? but if God put <hi>his name</hi> to ours, and twiſt them together, there is abundance of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then <hi>our names</hi> are a ſtrong argument.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ſuppoſe we be in ſuch a condition as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">14.</note> pray, yet here is comfort in this, our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are the ſufferings of Chriſt; and the ſufferings of Chriſt do preſent themſelves as a mighty pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God: The ſufferings of Chriſt, have a mighty cry in the ears of the <hi>Father,</hi> and they will be heard.</p>
                  <p>And yet further, if ſo be our ſufferings be the <note place="margin">15.</note> ſufferings of Chriſt, then ſurely Chriſts ſufferings are our ſufferings; if Chriſt have an intereſt in our ſufferings, then we have an intereſt in his ſufferings: for how come our ſufferings to be Chriſts, but by vertue of our relation to him; and therefore his ſufferings muſt be ours, by the relation of Chriſt to us.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there will be an end of ſufferings, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not laſt always, for they are the ſufferings of Chriſt <note place="margin">16.</note>; and it cannot ſtand with infinite juſtice, that Chriſt which hath undertaken for us, ſhould be eternally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuffering; &amp; if he ſhal not ſuffer always, we ſhal not always ſuffer; for ſo long as we ſuffer, he muſt ſuffer:
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:57146:218"/>
the time therefore is a coming, wherein Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be too high for to be reproached, they ſhall be in ſuch a condition, as it ſhall be impoſſible for any to reproach them: for <hi>reproach</hi> comes from ſome kinde of apprehenſion of the reproacher, to be in ſome meaſure above the reproached: no man can reproach another for a thing that he fully knows, and certainly believes that he is above him in that thing: and therefore the people of the world do reproach the people of God, becauſe they apprehend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be above Gods people in wiſdom, or the like; but time will come, that the dignity of Gods people ſhall be raiſed to ſuch a heighth, that though wicked men do hate them, they ſhall not be able to reproach them, they cannot poſſibly have a conceit to be above Gods people in any thing.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are the conſolations that ariſe from this point, that our ſufferings and reproaches are Chriſts: and theſe conſiderations being put together, why ſhould we diſtract our ſelves, and take immoderate care what ſhall become of us; if we be unbelieving, Chriſt will count it a diſhonor to him, and ſay, <hi>Is it not my caſe?</hi> we need not take any ſhifting courſes to help our ſelves; a man that hath an enemy ſurprize him, if he have no weapon in his hand, it may be he will take up ſtones and dirt, but if he have his weapon, he uſeth that, and ſcorns to take up ſtones and dirt: when people are reproached, that have no intereſt in Chriſt, reproaches come upon them and take them unarmed, and they take up any thing near hand, and reproach and revile again: but thoſe that have intereſt in Chriſt, have this weapon; they know
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:57146:218"/>
all their reproaches are the reproaches of Chriſt, and we ſhall not need to depend upon any outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for to comfort us; much leſs have we need to help our ſelves by reviling again. The comfort of a Chriſtian, is this, That his reproaches are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Chriſt; this is enough to quiet his heart: you need not comfort your ſelves in your parts, or eſtates; this is enough alone: do but anſwer all your diſtractions and troubleſome workings of your hearts with this, and this will quiet them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhall I know that my reproaches <note place="margin">How to know that <hi>our reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> are the <hi>reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </note> are the reproaches of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, if you be reproached for the ſake of Chriſt; though you be not a member of Chriſt, yet if your adverſaries reproach you, becauſe they take you for a member of Chriſt, there is ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <note place="margin">1.</note> in this. Secondly, if you can under all reproaches <note place="margin">2.</note> bring your hearts in ſubjection unto Chriſt, and quiet your hearts under reproaches in obedience unto him. Thirdly, if you finde the rule by which you are guided <note place="margin">3.</note> and acted in that condition to be the rule of Chriſt. Fourthly, if you finde the chiefeſt comfort that you gather in to help you, to be the comfort of <note place="margin">4.</note> Chriſt. Fifthly, if you finde the end you do aim <note place="margin">5.</note> at in your bearing them, is the honor of Chriſt; and that you do deſire rather that Chriſt may be in the concluſion honored, then your ſelves clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Sixthly, take this as a ſpecial note, if you make <note place="margin">6.</note> thoſe reproaches that Chriſt ſuffers in his <hi>cauſe,</hi> his <hi>truth,</hi> his <hi>people,</hi> yours; then he makes yours <hi>his:</hi> how does your hearts ſtand affected to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches Chriſt ſuffers in others? <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 17, 18. <hi>God promiſes much mercy, to ſuch to whom the reproach</hi>
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:57146:219"/>
                     <hi>of the ſolemn aſſemblies were a burthen.</hi> That heart that is burthened with the reproaches of Gods ways, ſhall finde eaſe in the comforts of Gods Spirit. If theſe things be in you, certainly theſe come from the Spirit of Chriſt; and if from the Spirit of Chriſt, then you are Chriſts; and if you be Chriſts, then your reproaches are Chriſts.</p>
                  <p>A third Uſe is this: Seeing Chriſt ſuffers for us, and <note place="margin">2.</note> all our reproaches are the reproaches of Chriſt, Let us take heed that he do not ſuffer by us. Now Chriſt may come to ſuffer by us two ways: Firſt, if ſo be that we cauſe the name of Chriſt to be ſpoken evil of. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when we come to be actors our ſelves in ſpeaking evil of Chriſt, or of his people.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if we cauſe Chriſt or his people to be ſpoken evil of by any ſinful, way of ours, this is the reproach of Chriſt (but not in that ſenſe I ſpoke of before.) Chriſt does not onely ſuffer in you, but he ſuffers <hi>by you.</hi> This is the charge that the Apoſtles lays upon the <hi>Romans, For your ſake is the name of God blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:</hi> we had need look to our ſelves in this. Mark <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 24.</note> what charge the Apoſtle lays upon <hi>women,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 13, 14. that they ſhould <hi>take heed of tatling, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying themſelves unchriſtianly;</hi> and that they <hi>give none occaſion to the adverſary to ſpeak reproachfully.</hi> That was the reaſon why <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was ſo careful in his buſineſs, in <hi>Neh.</hi> 5. 9. Becauſe of the reproach of the <hi>Heathen.</hi> And ſo I ſay to you that are Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Is it not enough that Chriſt hath ſuffered <hi>for you</hi> and <hi>in you,</hi> but muſt he ſuffer <hi>by you?</hi> O that the fear of God might be upon you, becauſe of the reproach of your adverſaries: Is Chriſt dear to you? did Chriſt ever do any thing for you? Is it
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:57146:219"/>
not better a thouſand times that you were croſt, and your lives were taken away, and you laid rotting in the grave, if your names could waſh away any ſtain that is upon the name of Chriſt? know there are many that Chriſt have fuffered reproach by, and you cannot clear your ſelves of it, and know what an evil and bitter thing it is, that after all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy of Chriſt to you, and the near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he hath taken you into; will you abuſe all this mercy, and this near relation? if Chriſt had never taken you for his own, had you been never ſo vile, Chriſt had not ſuffered reproach by you; but now in regard of your near relation to him, he ſuffers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by you; and is this the uſe you make of your near relation?</p>
                  <p>When therefore you finde your hearts begin to ſtir, <note place="margin">How Chriſt is <hi>reproached</hi> by us.</note> and corruption boil; conſider the name of Chriſt lies proſtrate before you, and will you trample upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt: if one were ſet upon going to a place to do miſchief, and his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould throw themſelves in the path, that if he goes on he muſt tread upon them, and they ſhould ſay, <hi>You ſhall tread upon the bowels out of which you came, upon the loyns that begat you;</hi> this would be a great ſtop: and ſo you that are Profeſſors of the Goſpel, if you have a temptation to a luſt, the name of Chriſt calls Stay, and ſays, <hi>If you go you ſhall trample upon me, and my blood, and bring reproach upon me;</hi> will not this ſtop you? Never think that gain that you get by the reproach of Chriſt. It is true indeed, if we be going on in our duty, and do that we ſhould, though men ſay the name of Chriſt ſhall be reproached, we are to go on,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:57146:220"/>
and do our duty, and let Chriſt vindicate his name if he will: but if it be any thing that concern out ſelves, and the ſatisfaction of our own wills and deſires, whereby Chriſt may be reproached, this is a mighty argument to keep us from it: the word hath ſcarce a ſtronger argument to keep us from an evil way, then this, <hi>The name of Chriſt ſhal ſuffer by it:</hi> for the people of God to ſuffer reproach by you, is an evil thing: for a man to have but his kindred aſhamed of him, what an evil thing is it; but that it may be ſaid of one that is a Profeſſor of Religion, that he is not onely a reproach to the Church of God, but a reproach to Jeſus Chriſt, if you have any ingenuity in you, this might ſtrike to your hearts.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of <hi>Alexander,</hi> having a Soldier of his name, and his Soldier being a coward, he came to him, and ſaid, <hi>Either leave off the name of</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, <hi>or be a Soldier:</hi> and ſo we have the name of Chriſtians, but when we are vile in our lives, Chriſt ſays, <hi>Either leave off your profeſsion,</hi> your name, <hi>or be a Chriſtian indeed:</hi> do not come in amongſt the number of Profeſſors, to let profeſſion ſuffer by you. And ſo <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> the <hi>Emperor,</hi> ſeeing a company of Chriſtians fighting together, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to leave off the name of Chriſtians; for ſays he, <hi>You profeſs your ſelves to be Chriſtians, and yet you are thus contending: this is not the ſpirit of him whom you do profeſs.</hi> It is a lamentable thing that we ſhould profeſs ſuch a glorious name as we do, and that we ſhould handle the matter ſo as that it ſhould ſuffer ſo much by us. It is ſaid of the high Prieſt, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>He ſhall not make himſelf unclean for his father, or for his mother, or for his brother, or</hi>
                     <pb n="423" facs="tcp:57146:220"/>
                     <hi>for his ſiſter, becauſe he had the holy oyl upon him, the conſecration of his God was upon him:</hi> So I may ſay unto you, You have the <hi>holy oyl</hi> of the profeſſion of the name of Chriſt upon you; and therefore take heed what you do, ſays St. <hi>Paul, It were better for me to dye, then to loſe my glorying:</hi> were it then not better for us to dye, then to have the glory of Chriſt ſuffer by us. Know, though the name of Chriſt be not dear to you, he will defend his name when you ſhall rot and periſh for ever; and though it be defiled by you for the preſent, he can clear it otherwiſe: but wo to them that be the cauſes of reproaches that come thus upon Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But as we muſt take heed that Chriſt be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by us in this regard, much more that he be not reproached by our ſelves, ſo as to ſpeak evil of the ways of God: as we may hear it of thoſe that have been forward in profeſſion of Religion, if profeſſion of Religion do not come to ſerve their turns, they are ready to ſpeak evil of that way, and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it. Take heed what you do in reproaching of a member of Chriſt, the name of Chriſt is upon him; take heed you do not reproach him that the name Chriſt is upon; the people of God do bear the name of Chriſt upon their foreheads; take heed you do not ſpit upon their faces, for it may be you may ſpit upon the name of Chriſt: as many unskilful hunters will ſhoot at wilde beaſts, and ſhooting at random may kill a man; and ſo many ſhoot at Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but they hit Chriſt, they reproach Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>FOurthly, the conſideration of this calls for a trembling heart unto all thoſe that have been <note place="margin">

In this Uſe we have three branches: Firſt, thoſe that have done it themſelves: Secondly, thoſe that rejoyce in the reproaches that others caſt upon Gods people: Thirdly, thoſe that are the divulgers and ſpreaders of the reproaches of Gods people. In <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. The Holy Ghoſt there rebuking <hi>Moab</hi> for reproaching his people in the eighth and tenth verſes, at the eleventh verſe it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord will be terrible to them:</hi> there are ſome of you, that howſoever God have ſhewn you better things now, yet heretofore you have been guilty, and it may be ſome of you are guilty of this ſtill; and if you be guilty, the Lord will be terrible to you.

your reproaches reach no further then the Saints themſelves, yet in regard of that excellency there is in them, it is an abominable wickedneſs. Mark with what indignation the Spirit of God ſpeaks againſt ſuch as are guilty herein, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 3, 4. <hi>Draw near hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye ſons of the ſorcereſs, the ſeed of the adulterer, and the whore, againſt whom do ye ſport your ſelves? againſt whom do ye make a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of tranſgreſsion, a ſeed of falſhood?</hi> What, you who are ſo vile and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy your ſelves, will you preſume to reproach the Saints of God, ſuch as are ſo precious in the eyes of God, and ſo near to Chriſt? Know, you have not to deal with them onely, but with Chriſt in them. You think you have to do onely with a company of poor weak creatures that are not able to right them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but know, you have to do with Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Mark that expreſſion we have in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 23. it is ſpoken concerning <hi>Rabſhekah, Whom haſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached?</hi> it is not againſt <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> it is againſt <hi>the holy One of Iſrael:</hi> Thoſe that have done thus, have lifted up their mouthes againſt heaven it ſelf: <hi>They ſet their mouthes againſt the heavens:</hi> Thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached <note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 9</note> him that is <hi>the brightneſs of the glory of the Father;</hi> The character, <hi>The engraven image of the Father;</hi> he that is the glory of heaven, that hath all the treaſures of all good in him; Thou haſt caſt reproach upon him that muſt be thy Judge; At whoſe mercy thou lyeſt for thy preſent and eternal eſtate; <hi>Him</hi> that is God bleſſed for ever, that is the infinite delight of the Father. You miſtake, you have ſhot at Chriſt all this while: As we read of <hi>Oedepus,</hi> he killed his father <hi>Laius</hi> King of <hi>Thebes,</hi> taking
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:57146:222"/>
him for his enemy; your miſtake is worſe you ſtrike at, you reproach Chriſt, while you think it is but a poor man, yea your enemy.</p>
                  <p>O that ever you ſhould be born to do ſo much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief as to caſt dirt upon the face of Chriſt; ſurely you kick againſt the pricks: It is an argument that you are not <hi>a ſon of the promiſe,</hi> that you are a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> Thou haſt cauſe to fear that God will laugh at thy deſtruction, and mock when thy fear cometh: Thou haſt cauſe to fear that thou art reſerved for everlaſting ſhame and contempt, unleſs God does humble thee for this dreadful guilt that is upon thee. When you take advantage upon the meanneſs of Gods people for to reproach them, you are the men and women that are found guilty in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for to reproach Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, There are none ſo vile as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach <note place="margin">Object.</note> Chriſt, nor the people of Chriſt for their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, it is for their hypocriſie.</p>
                  <p>Let no man deceive himſelf thus; for there never <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> was any Devil or man that did reproach godlineſs under the name of godlineſs, but they would put ſome other name upon it, under which it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear vile and contemptible; and in this the men of the world do as the perſecutors did in the Primitive times with the Chriſtians, they put the bodies of Chriſtians into the skins of wilde beaſts, and then they would ſet dogs upon them, and other wilde beaſts, to tear them: So men do to this day; they put the profeſſion of godlineſs into the ſhapes of their own conceits, and their own ſlanders, and their own apprehenſions, to make it ugly, and they fall a reproaching and tearing, and run upon

them like a company of wilde beaſts: And that which thou ſayeſt is hypocriſie, is but the skin of the wilde beaſt, thy own unſhapen conceits, to make thy ſelf and their adverſaries run upon them, that you may the more freely venture; becauſe the wilde beaſts would not venture upon the body of a man ſo freely, but when they ſaw the body of a man in the ſhape of ſuch a beaſt as they hated, they ran upon it freely: And ſo thou dealeſt with Gods Saints in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an unſhapen form upon them, to let out thine heart more freely upon them. But what if that which thou calleſt <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> God account <hi>godlineſs?</hi> yea know, that this thy aſperſion upon godlineſs, to ſay it is hypocriſie, and upon the people of God, to ſay they are hypocrites, is the reproach of Gods people, and there is a great deal of evil in it more then thou art aware of. In <hi>Mark</hi> 3. from verſe 22. and ſo on, when Chriſt caſt out devils, they ſaid, <hi>He caſts them out by Beelzebub the Prince of devils:</hi> well ſays Chriſt, <hi>All ſins ſhall be forgiven unto the ſons of men, and blaſphemies wherewith ſoever they ſhall blaſpheme, but he that ſhall blaſpheme againſt the Holy Ghoſt, hath never forgiveneſs, but is in danger of eternal damnation:</hi> So that it ſeems theſe Phariſees had ſinned <hi>the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in that they ſaid, <hi>He had an unclean ſpirit,</hi> becauſe they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted that to an unclean ſpirit, which was done by the Spirit of Chriſt; onely they did this againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and in malice: I do not ſay that all reproachers do ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; but if it be <hi>againſt knowledge,</hi> and <hi>in malice,</hi> conſider how near it comes: as their attributing that to an <hi>unclean ſpirit</hi> which came from the ſpirit of God <hi>was it;</hi> ſo does not
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:57146:223"/>
thy attributing that to hypocriſie which comes from the Spirit of God in ſincerity come near it. But laſtly, if it be for hypocriſie that thou reproach, and not for godlineſs, then it is for an evil; if it be for an evil that thou doeſt reproach them, then the better thou art, and the better mood thou art in, the more thou wilt reproach them. But we ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary evident: Wicked men they reproach the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for hypocriſie, as they ſay, but they do it when they are in the height of their luſts; but if they be in a good mood, when they are on their ſick beds or death beds, and in their beſt condition, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them leaſt; therefore ſure it was the good they reproached, and not the evil. But thus much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt branch.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is this, it calls for a trembling heart from thoſe that ſhall rejoyce at the reproaches of <note place="margin">2.</note> Gods people: Perhaps thou art one that wilt not reproach thy ſelf, yet thou mayeſt rejoyce at the reproaches of Gods people: There is a great deal of evil in this: Surely thou haſt no love to them, for love does not rejoyce in iniquity, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13. 6. When the Devil does ſow the ſeed, thou doſt come with the harrows to cover the ſeed, when thou doſt rejoyce in their reproaches. <hi>Proverbs</hi> 18. 8. <hi>The words of a tale-bearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermoſt parts of the belly:</hi> It may be tranſlated, <hi>The words of a tale-bearer are as the words of them tbat are wounded:</hi> That is, The tale-bearers that come and tell you things, they come with expreſſions of a great deal of broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, as if their ſpirits were grieved at that they hear, and they ſpeak as if they ſpoke in
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:57146:223"/>
the defence of them, and then they are <hi>as wounds;</hi> not <hi>the wounds</hi> of them they ſpeak of, but the wounds of the <hi>wounded:</hi> And if any come in this way to caſt reproaches upon Gods people, they are taken down into the belly, and they go glib down: This is a ſlight of the Devil to make them paſs without the leaſt queſtioning; for thoſe that reproach, ſeem to ſpeak out of wounded troubled hearts.</p>
                  <p>But we do not rejoyce in this, that we hear any evil <note place="margin">Object.</note> of Gods people, but we rejoyce that they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and this is the work of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If ſo be thy conſcience be convinced, that through <note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> the concealing of ſuch and ſuch things, there was a great deal of miſchief done before, and there is a great deal of good like to come to the publike cauſe, and the name of God in the diſcovery, then you may rejoyce.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I appeal to conſcience: Suppoſe the diſcovery do a great deal of hurt, Gods name does <note place="margin">2.</note> ſuffer by it, is there a proportionable meaſure of grief in thy heart, for the ſuffering of Gods name, unto the joy that is in you for the diſcovery?</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, ſuppoſe it were one that were near to you; ſuppoſe it were your <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Brother,</hi> the <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>Wife</hi> of your boſom, the deareſt friend you had that were diſcovered, would your hearts rejoyce then? if you rejoyce becauſe God hath glory by the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then would you rejoyce, if the deareſt friend you had were diſcovered?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, yea, ſuppoſe you did ſuffer much by this <note place="margin">4.</note> diſcovery, that it were much to your prejudice, you ſhould loſe ſomething that your hearts are much ſet upon, would you rejoyce then?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if ſo be that it were for the diſcovery that <note place="margin">5.</note>
                     <pb n="430" facs="tcp:57146:224"/>
you rejoyce; then you would not rejoyce, that they are diſcovered to ſuch as will not honor Gods name: You are glad that <hi>any</hi> know of it, that Gods <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> know of it, that will not make a good uſe of it, but will be hardened in their ſin, and diſhonor Gods name: Take heed you do not deceive your ſelves, to rejoyce ſo in the diſcovery of the people of God; there is a great deal of evil in it, more then you think of. <hi>Joſeph</hi> he feared <hi>Mary,</hi> but he feared the name of God might ſuffer, and therefore he would not make her a publike example.</p>
                  <p>The third branch is to thoſe that are divulgers of the reproaches of Gods people. Conſider what <note place="margin">3.</note> you do, they are the reproaches of Chriſt; take heed you do not divulge the reproaches of Gods people. Suppoſe they prove falſe, do you think that after Gods people have ſuffered ſo much, this will be enough to anſwer God and Chriſt, for all the dirt that hath been caſt upon his face, I heard ſo; that the names of Gods people may ſuffer much, when they are under falſe reproaches. As it is with a ſtick; a ſtick when it is in the water, it looks as if it were broken, pull it out of the water, and it is ſtraight: So it is with the names of Gods people; when their names are under reports that go abroad in the world, they look as broken; but when their names are pulled out from the reports of the world, they appear whole: And therefore take heed of divulging the reproaches of thoſe that are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; You may in this do the Devils work, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Devils pack. The Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 3. 11. ſpeaking of women, ſays, <hi>That they muſt be grave, not ſlanderers;</hi> The word in the Original is, that
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:57146:224"/>
they muſt <hi>not be Devils:</hi> So that to carry ſlanders and evil reports up and down, is the work <hi>of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> Again, wilt thou ſpread the reproaches of Gods people, when as it is the great work of God to cover the ſins of his people? And further, conſider, doeſt thou ſtand in need of ſo much covering of thy own ſins, and wilt thou have a hand in ſpreading abroad the ſins of others? How juſt will it be with God to let thee fall into ſome groſs ſin, and ſpread abroad thy ſhame, ſeeing his name and the names of his people are not dear in thine eyes?</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>FIfthly, if Chriſt will take our ſufferings and our reproaches, and make them his; then we are <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 5.</note> to take Chriſts ſufferings, and Chriſt reproaches, and make them ours. It was the burning love of Chriſt, and his zeal to his people, that made him take the reproaches of his people to himſelf; and ſo our burning love to him, and zeal for him, ſhould make us take his reproaches upon our ſelves. Chriſt is many ways reproached in the world, not onely in his perſon, when he lived upon the earth, and in his people; and ſo we are not onely to take the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Chriſt upon us in theſe regards, but in any particular, whatſoever reproach falls upon Chriſt any way, let us account of it as our own: When
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:57146:225"/>
the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Goſpel is reproached, then he is reproached; when the ways and light that God hath diſcovered to his people is reproached, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached; when the Ordinances are ſlighted, when as the blood of Chriſt is counted a common thing, and every baſe luſt is preferred before it; when as the bleſſed authority of Chriſt is villified and ſlighted, either when it is ſlighted openly or ſecretly, if the authority of Chriſt be caſt off, then he is reproached, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 6, 30. <hi>When you put a reed into the hand of Christ, and bow to him, and ſay, Hail King of the Jews:</hi> when you ſhall profeſs obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto Chriſt, and in ſtead of a Scepter, put a reed into his hand, then he is reproached. Again, when Gods people <hi>walk unworthy of Chriſt,</hi> then Chriſt is reproached. And when Chriſt is reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any of theſe, let us take them to heart, as throughly, as if we were reproached; yea, take them more to heart, becauſe the reproaches of Chriſt are far worſe then our reproaches: Thoſe that are firſt upon Chriſt, and then upon us, are worſer then thoſe that are firſt upon us, and then upon Chriſt: To ſpit upon the face of a man, is more reproach to the body, then to ſpit upon ſome other member of the body is a reproach to the face; and ſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt that is the face of the Church, is more then the reproach of any other member: And therefore confider, whether your hearts be more broken when Chriſt is reproached, then when you your ſelves are reproached, this is a good ſign of grace. And if you demand what ſhould be the behavior of a gracious heart, when he is in any company that he hears Chriſt reproached in;</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="433" facs="tcp:57146:225"/>
I anſwer, Firſt, thy ſpirit ſhould riſe in indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt ſuch deſperate evils and wickedneſs as <note place="margin">1.</note> this, that any ſhould dare to be ſo bold as to reproach <note place="margin">How a gracious heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves its ſelf, when he hears Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached.</note> the holy One of God, ſuch a bleſſed one as Chriſt is, that is ſo infinitely dear to thy ſoul, and hath done ſo much for thy ſoul; though in our own cauſes we may be quiet and give way, yet when it comes to the cauſe of Chriſt, it is good for the heart to riſe. It is the ſpeech of <hi>Oeclampadius</hi> to his fellow Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>Let our Zeal be hot and burning, not when ſcorns and reproaches are cast upon us, but when the truth is endangered, and the name of God is blaſphemed.</hi> Ye have heard that of King <hi>Croeſus</hi> his ſon, who though he were dumb all his life, yet when one would have ſtruck at his Father, the affection to his Father broke the bars of his ſpeech, and he ſaid, Take heed of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King: And ſo though we be dumb in things that concern our ſelves, yet when Chriſt comes to be reproached, let our hearts ſwell in us and break out.</p>
                  <p>Again, look upon them with trembling hearts, that ever the patience of God ſhould ſuffer ſuch <note place="margin">2.</note> wickedneſs as this: As they did admire at <hi>Mordecai,</hi> when he would not bow to <hi>Haman,</hi> they held their peace, <hi>and wondered what would become of that matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, we ſhould, if it were poſſible, labor to wipe off all the reproach of Chriſt, and take it upon our ſelves <note place="margin">3.</note> that we might rather be ſpit upon and contemned then Chriſt. It was a brave ſpeech of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> he wiſhed it would pleaſe God to <hi>turn all the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from the Church upon himſelf, and let them ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their thirſt with his blood:</hi> This is a true chriſtian
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:57146:226"/>
heart. And therefore if it be for our ſakes, and we have any thing in the buſineſs by which Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, we ſhould be willing rather to ſacrifice our ſelves, then that Chriſt ſhould be reproached: And as <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he knew that the tempeſt roſe for his ſake, ſays he, <hi>Caſt me into the ſea:</hi> And ſo <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi> when contention roſe about him, ſays he, <hi>Caſt me into the ſea, let me loſe my place, rather then the name of Chriſt ſhould ſuffer for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, the behaving of a Chriſtian ſhould be this, it ſhould take his heart from his own name, ſo long <note place="margin">4.</note> as Chriſt is reproached: What though I have eſteem? Chriſt is not eſteemed, he is contemned. I have theſe comforts, and I through Gods mercy want nothing, and my friends cleave to me, and prize me; but Chriſt is not cleaved to, he is not prized: and what are all my comforts to me? they are <hi>Ichabods,</hi> the glory of all is departed from me.</p>
                  <p>And further, we ſhould be willing to intereſt our <note place="margin">5.</note> ſelves in the cauſe of Chriſt: when we hear any of Gods people reproached, we ſhould not ſay, <hi>What have we to do with them, let them clear themſelves?</hi> but be willing to intereſt our ſelves in it, and take it upon our ſelves, as if our own name were to be cleared.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, we ſhould labor to wipe away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt, in laboring to expreſs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing <note place="margin">6.</note> power of that grace which is contrary to their carriage for which Chriſt is reproached: Such a one is ſcandalous, and Chriſts name ſuffers in that, let me labor to make up the breach in being ſo much the more faithful, and walking in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:57146:226"/>
grace: Such a one is proud, let me be more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſuch a one is covetous, let me be more liberal, that there may be ſomewhat to anſwer: As it is ſaid of the wiſe ſon, when his father is reproached, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries himſelf ſo as his father hath wherewithal to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer from his good carriage, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 11. So let Chriſt have wherewithal to anſwer his reproaches from your godly convincing converſation. Suppoſe others have caſt an aſperſion upon the ways of godlineſs, becauſe ſuch are falſe and covetous, yet walk thou in the contrary, that Gods people may anſwer, Though ſuch and ſuch be ſo, <hi>what ſay you to ſuch an one?</hi> is not the breach made up in thoſe? And ſo much for that Uſe.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, we muſt not onely labor to wipe away <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe.</hi> 6.</note> the reproach of Chriſt: But if Chriſt have ſuffered ſo much <hi>in us</hi> and <hi>for us,</hi> let us labor to honor Chriſt as much as we can in the world, and ſet up the name of Chriſt, as much as others pull it down. How are we to ſet up the name of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in holding forth the beauty and glory of <note place="margin">1.</note> the Spirit of Chriſt in our lives, that though Chriſt <note place="margin">How we may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Chriſt in the world.</note> be reproached in others, he may be glorified in us: Others may be forced to ſay in their conſciences, <hi>Bleſſed be God that ever I ſaw ſuch men:</hi> I never ſaw the graces of Chriſt ſhine more brightly in any, then in them. And then ſet up Chriſt, in ſpeaking <note place="margin">2.</note> all the good we can of Chriſt, in bringing others in love with him: As they in the <hi>Canticles</hi> ſaid, <hi>What is thy beloved more then another beloved?</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>My beloved is the chiefest among ten thouſands.</hi> Again, let us ſet up the <hi>Ordinances of Chriſt,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> therein appears the honor of Chriſt, and let the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:57146:227"/>
beauty of his holineſs appear in his Ordinances, that men may ſay, <hi>Bleſſed are the people that are in ſuch a caſe.</hi> Fourthly, let Chriſt have the honor of our <note place="margin">4.</note> names, and of all our comforts: Surely if he have the ſhame of our reproaches, he ſhould have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of our honors: If he have the pain of our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, ſurely he muſt have the praiſe of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: Chriſt hath a ſhare in our ſorrows, ſhall he not have a ſhare in our comforts? when we are reproached he is reproached; when we are honored, let him be honored too. What a ſad thing will it be, that when you go out of the world, it ſhould be ſaid, Chriſt hath had more diſhonor by you, then he hath had honor?</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, If Chriſt ſuffers in all our ſufferings, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 7.</note> hence we learn not to ruſh into ſufferings, before we be called to them, nor to withdraw from ſufferings, when we are called to them. Chriſt ſuffers in all our ſufferings, then it is not in our liberty to ruſh into ſufferings when we pleaſe, though it ſhould be in the cauſe of Chriſt. Indeed if we ſuffered alone, we might venture, but becauſe Chriſt is intereſſed in it, we muſt ſtay till we know whether Chriſt be willing to ſuffer; though our time be come, yet it may be Chriſt will ſay, <hi>My time is not yet come;</hi> becauſe it is in a good cauſe you think you may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in it, but conſider, is Chriſts time come? In <hi>Proverbs</hi> 10. 10. it is ſaid, <hi>He that winketh with the eye cauſeth ſorrow, but a prating fool ſhall fall.</hi> when a man is loth to ſtand for thoſe truths of God that ſhall bring him into ſuffering, he winks: <hi>He that winketh with the eye, cauſeth ſorrow, he will bring ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to his heart.</hi> But others will ſay, We will not
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:57146:227"/>
wink with the eye, it is the cauſe of God, and we will ſtand for it, but <hi>a prating fool ſhall fall.</hi> A true man may ride in the rode, and fear no danger, yet he will not willingly ride into dangerous places, and ſo a man is not to ride into danger. As now if you be partners with another, you cannot give what you will, becauſe it is not your own, but it is your partners too. If a man have a cottage of his own alone in a field, he may ſet it on fire, but if he ſet his own houſe on fire in the town, it may coſt him his life, becauſe others are intereſſed in the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage as well as himſelf. Again, if Chriſt do call, we muſt go freely, becauſe they are the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt, It is reported of <hi>Peter</hi> in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Story, that he was coming out of <hi>Rome</hi> for fear of ſuffering; and as he was coming out of the gates, he met Chriſt, and he asked Chriſt wherefore he came; ſays he, <hi>I come to be crucified,</hi> then he thought Chriſt came to be crucified in him, and therefore he went back and reſolved to ſuffer, and ſo he was crucified. And ſo though we be ſhy of ſuffering, yet if we know Chriſt calls to it, we muſt yield, as being willing to ſuffer in us.</p>
                  <p>But when are we called? <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is an ordinary call, and an extraordinary call. The <hi>extraordinary call</hi> is by the Spirit: And that is <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> firſt, when there are none that will ſtand for the cauſe of God in an ordinary way. Secondly, thoſe that God calls extraordinarily, are ſuch as have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary graces: They act not their own natural boldneſs, but are carried beyond it by a mighty work of Gods Spirit: And therefore thou mayeſt ſuſpect thy ſelf, that thou art not called extraordinarily,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:57146:228"/>
but after much humiliation, and much abilities to deny thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But for <hi>an ordinary call<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Firſt, then we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led when if we do not ſuffer, Gods cauſe will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. Secondly, when God does take away the means and helps of delivering us from ſuffering. Thirdly, the more helps are taken from us, the more we finde the conſolation of Gods Spirit come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</p>
                  <p>But when helps are taken away, and the Spirit of God does abſent it ſelf, ſhall we fear then that we are <note place="margin">When we are called to ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> not called?</p>
                  <p>Some think, ſurely they muſt not ſuffer, then they ſhall betray Gods cauſe: If they do, becauſe they do not finde God preſent with them: If God do give you a fair way to eſcape when his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is gone, you may take it; but if he ſhut you up that you cannot eſcape, you may comfortably go on; though now he be gone, he will return again; as it was with Mr. <hi>Glover,</hi> who wanted the preſence of God even till he came to the Stake, and then he clapt his hands and cryed, <hi>He is come, he is come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt Uſe of the point is this, If Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 8.</note> in his people, and if all the evil you caſt upon Gods people is Chriſts, then all the good you do to them is Chriſts: If when you ſpeak evil of Gods people and reproach them, you reproach Chriſt; then when you ſpeak well of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you ſpeak well of Chriſt: If when you perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Gods people, you perſecute Chriſt; then when you relieve Gods people, you relief Chriſt; Chriſt will own the good that is done to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:57146:228"/>
as well as the evil: And therefore as the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument once was, <hi>Relieve all ſtrangers,</hi> for ſome unawares have done good to Angels; So now, do all the good you can to Gods people, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares you may do much good to Chriſt. And thus I have finiſhed the ſecond point from this Verſe, <hi>That the reproaches of Gods people are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Chriſt.</hi> Now we are to proceed to the third.</p>

<pb n="440" facs="tcp:57146:229"/>

                  <p>Secondly, they are an evidence to him of that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that God hath made between others and him: <note place="margin">2.</note> there was a time, when as other men could cloſe with me, and agree with me; now ſee what a difference there is, they nothing but contemn me and deſpiſeme: I might have gone on and have been a ſcorner and a mocker as they are; O the difference that God hath made between me and them! that God ſhould call

                  <p>Thirdly, it is an evidence of the ſincerity, and the power of his grace, and his love that he bears to Chriſt: and this is great riches; for a gracious heart ſays, <hi>Lord try me, Lord prove me:</hi> he would fain have an opportunity to manifeſt the truth of his love to Chriſt: all the while I go on in a way of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <note place="margin">3.</note> and have the deſire of my heart, wherein appears my love to Chriſt? but now when I am called to <hi>ſuffering,</hi> and to part with much for Chriſt, here is an opportunity to ſhew I love Chriſt for <hi>himſelf,</hi> that my love to him does not depend upon any thing that I gain by him in the world. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>The tryal of your grace,</hi> he ſpeaks of faith, <hi>is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then ſilver and gold:</hi> and not onely <hi>your grace</hi> is more precious, but the <hi>tryal</hi> of grace is more precious then gold and ſilver. A gracious heart does rejoyce much in evidencing love to Chriſt; as any dear friend rejoyces much in any opportunity of manifeſting his love to another friend, and the greater the opportunity is, the more does he rejoyce. And likewiſe the <hi>power of grace</hi> is manifeſted: as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to the King <hi>Achiſh,</hi> Thou ſhalt know <hi>what thy ſervant can do;</hi> and ſo a gracious heart thinks here is an opportunity to manifeſt the ſtrength and power that is in grace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they are an evidence that much good is done, <note place="margin">4.</note> that Satans kingdom is ſhaken; in <hi>ſufferings</hi> we ſee the rage of the Devil, and he rages then moſt

                     <hi>That Satan does ſo rage and blaſpheme, as often as I do but touch him:</hi> he took it as an argument that much good was done, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Devil would not have been ſo vexed, he would not have raged ſo much.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, a gracious heart hath an evidence to it ſelf, that God will ſpare him when others ſhall ſuffer from <note place="margin">5.</note> his wrath. Certainly, the more any one is called to ſuffer in the cauſe of God, and when he findes his heart ready and willing to yield to God in ſuffering, the more evidence may he have to his ſoul, that when others ſhall be called to ſuffer from Gods wrath, he ſhall be ſpared: and this is the bottom of the prayer of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 50. <hi>Remember Lord, the reproach of thy ſervants; how I do bear in my boſom the reproach of the mighty people.</hi> I read of one <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celus,</hi> being condemned to be ſtoned to death, and all the people were ready to caſt ſtones at him; and his brother came, and run in, and ſhewed that he had but one hand, and the other hand he had loſt for the defence of his countrey, and then none would ſtone him: and ſo the marks of the Lord Jeſus, are notable marks to ſafeguard thee in the time of trouble: when the Lord goes out in his wrath, he will ſet his mark upon thoſe that he will ſave; and none more notable marks, then the reproaches and ſufferings they bear for Chriſt. This was <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> plea before the Lord, chap. 15. ver. 5. <hi>O Lord thou knoweſt, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me and viſit me; know that for thy ſake I have ſuffered rebuke.</hi>
                  </p>

Laſtly, it is an evidence of ſalvation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 28. not that all that ſuffer ſhall be ſaved: but a gracious <note place="margin">6.</note> heart that ſuffers in a gracious Chriſtian maner, hath God ſealing to him by his ſpirit in his ſufferings, his ſalvation. Put theſe together, and we ſee one cauſe why we ſhould count <hi>the reproaches of Chriſt</hi> great riches, yea, this is <hi>greater riches then the riches of</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, the reproaches and ſufferings which we endure for Chriſt, are riches of <hi>preferment.</hi> It was a ſpeech of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> when he was to ſuffer, <hi>It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for me to be a Martyr, then a Monarch.</hi> Epiſt. 12. ad Romanos, <hi>Euſeb.</hi> l. 8. c. 7. To be preferred to honor, is counted great riches: now there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment of Gods people here, theſe three or four ways: <hi>Baſil</hi> upon that famous Martyr <hi>Bar-aam,</hi> ſays, he rejoyced in ſtripes as in honors, he exulted in the ſevereſt puniſhments, as if <hi>praeclara bravia acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Saints look upon this as high preferment, becauſe it is a teſtimony that God hath a high eſteem of them: God does not uſe to call thoſe that are weak and mean to great ſufferings, but his ſervants that are moſt eminent; God will diſpoſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of his people, ſuitable to their diſpoſitions, therefore he will not call thoſe to the ſtrongeſt work that are weakeſt. A Captain does not call out his mean Soldiers to a notable enterprize, but he calls out his moſt able couragious Soldiers; and the more deſperate the enterprize is, the more honor the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier thinks it to be called out: ſo the greater work God calls one to, the more preferment is in it; and we have cauſe to admire that God ſhould deal ſo with
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:57146:232"/>
us his poor creatures, rather then others; as if we were fitter then' others: though we cannot ſay we are fitter, becauſe we are conſcious to our ſelves of ſo much weakneſs; but God honors us as if it were ſo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by this we come to be honorable in the eyes of the Churches, and the Saints of God: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing makes Gods people more honorable in the eyes of the Saints, then when they are called to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer  much for God. And ſo in the Primitive times, they eſteemed much of the Martyrs, even too much. <hi>Chryſostom</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, it is a greater dignity in ſome degree then God puts upon the Angels in Heaven; the Angels glorified God in a way of ſervice, but the Angels and Saints in Heaven have not this way to glorifie God, they are not called to ſuffer in the cauſe of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the reproaches we ſuffer for Chriſt, are riches of <hi>imployment:</hi> in this they are called to be imployed in the greateſt work that God hath to do
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:57146:233"/>
in the world: there are no people in the world imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo to ſet out Gods praiſe, as they are that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſuffer; this is the loweſt ſubjection that can be to God, but the higheſt honor.</p>
                  <p>And they are called to be maintainers of the truth of God. Says <hi>Calvin</hi> upon this argument, <hi>What are we poor worms, full of vanities and lyes, that we ſhould be called to be maintainers of the truth?</hi> The great cauſe of Gods truth, is maintained eſpecially in <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Glorioſa voce Deum confeſſi qui in carcere,</hi> Cypr. Ep. 5.</note>, <hi>Confeſs God with a glorious voyce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, they are imployed in bringing credit to the Church of God; Gods people that ſuffer, are a great honor to the Church of God: whereas Apoſtates do diſgrace the Church of God; thoſe that ſtand out in the defence of the truth in ſuffering, make up that honor that the Church hath loſt: theſe are great employments. A gracious heart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it as great riches to bring honor to the Church, as to have honor himſelf: of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. It is a notable expreſſion that <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath, to ſet out the honor the Church hath by ſuch who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the truth; <hi>O bleſſed Church, which in our times is made glorious, by the glorious blood of the Martyrs; it was white by the works of the brethren, now it is purple by the blood of Martyrs; there are neither Lillies nor Roſes wanting in her flowers; white garlands from their works, and purple from their ſufferings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they are riches of <hi>improvement:</hi> Firſt,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:57146:233"/>
                     <hi>grace</hi> is improved; grace is never ſo improved, as it is at that time when a ſoul ſuffers for Chriſt; <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mihi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximè pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt, qui mei poſſime mimineru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> Luth. Ep ad Spala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinum.</note> they moſt profit me, ſays <hi>Luther,</hi> who ſpeak worſt of me? as oppoſition of ſin in the wicked improves their ſin, ſo oppoſition of grace in the godly improves their grace: <hi>Lutherus paſcitur convitiis, Luther</hi> made reproaches his food, he was nouriſhed by them: <hi>virtutem intelligo animoſam &amp; excelſam quam inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat quicquid infeſtat,</hi> Sen. <hi>Ep.</hi> 72. Secondly, here is improved whatſoever Gods people do enjoy, that they are willing to loſe; no ſuch improvement of a mans credit or eſtate, as the loſs of it for Chriſt: if we would deviſe how we ſhould improve and lay out all our talents for God, we cannot lay them out better; we ſhall quickly gain from five to ten here: If men know how to improve their ſtocks to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, they count the knowledge of that way, more then if a man had given them many hundred pounds: we come to improve all that we have in a glorious maner, when God calls unto ſuffering. Thirdly, by <note place="margin">3.</note> ſuffering Gods people come to improve the <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>wickedneſs</hi> that is in the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>men;</hi> that is a great improvement, when I can turn the malice of the Devil and wicked men into my riches. It is a notable ſpeech that one <hi>Vincentius</hi> had of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, <hi>Never any man did ſerve me better then you ſerve me;</hi> and he told them what a great deal he did get by their <hi>malice</hi> in perſecuting of him: if a man were able to turn dirt into riches, how would that enrich a man? but to have that which can turn the dirt of wicked men and the Devil into our riches, that muſt be a rich thing. Again, a childe of God <note place="margin">4.</note> never improves his time ſo wel, as when he is ſuffering
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:57146:234"/>
for God, when he is a doing good, he is improving his time, but when he is <hi>ſuffering,</hi> he does as much in a little time, as he was doing a great while before; God does much reckon upon the time of his people in ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, ſufferings and reproaches are riches of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> As firſt, when they are called to ſuffer for <note place="margin">1.</note> Chriſt, to be reproached for Chriſt, they have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Gods power in upholding them. Secondly, <note place="margin">2.</note> experience of the ways and many paſſages of the providence of God towards them in all their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Thirdly, they come to have experience of the <note place="margin">3.</note> working of their own hearts. And laſtly, they come <note place="margin">4.</note> to have experience what it is to be in a ſuffering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: men have another apprehenſion of a ſuffering condition before they are called unto it, then when they are called to it; and therefore they are ready to ſay, <hi>I never knew what a priſon meant, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches meant till now, I do not finde that in them that I was afraid of;</hi> and theſe experiences are great riches.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, reproaches and ſufferings bring in rich <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> and they bring in a great deal: O that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <note place="margin">6.</note> did but know their riches in regard of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Every promiſe is a pearl to enrich Gods people withal, and where there is true grace, that ſoul does count it ſelf more enriched by the promiſes, then by any trading. Now the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> that are ſo <hi>rich</hi> unto a gracious heart, they are of divers ſorts; As firſt, the promiſe of <hi>Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> with them, and they count thoſe promiſes to be rich things: as the promiſe of Gods gracious <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> and the promiſe of his <hi>glorious preſence,</hi> and the promiſe of his <hi>abiding preſence.</hi> For his <hi>gracious</hi>
                     <pb n="451" facs="tcp:57146:234"/>
                     <hi>promiſe,</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 2. <hi>When thou paſſeſt thorow the waters, I will be with thee, and thorow the rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee; when thou walkeſt thorow the fire thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi> Again, his <hi>glorious preſence</hi> and his <hi>abiding preſence,</hi> for that you have one promiſe take in both together, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>If you be reproached for the name of Chriſt, happy are ye, for the Spirit of glory and of God reſteth upon you;</hi> there is the Spirit of God in all the Saints, but there is the Spirit of God, and the <hi>Spirit of glory</hi> on thoſe that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for Chriſt, that is, The glorious Spirit of God, the Spirit of God in a glorious maner. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Spirit of God and of glory <hi>reſts</hi> upon you, it does not <hi>paſs away,</hi> but <hi>reſts</hi> upon you: now what a rich promiſe is here; and what is in all the world that may be named with this promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, promiſes of <hi>direction:</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>Take</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>no thought when you are called before rulers for my names ſake, how or what you ſhall ſpeak, for it ſhall be given you in that ſame hour what you ſhall ſpeak.</hi> Thirdly, there are promiſes of <hi>aſſiſtance; I will be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>with you to the end of the world.</hi> Fourthly, there is <note place="margin">4.</note> a promiſe of <hi>acceptance; He that forſaketh houſes, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my names ſake, ſhall receive a hundred fold, and inherit eternal life.</hi> Fifthly, a <note place="margin">5.</note> promiſe of <hi>bleſſing; Bleſſed are you when men revile you and perſecute you, and ſay all maner of evil falſly on you for my ſake.</hi> Sixthly, a promiſe of <hi>a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; If we ſuffer with him, we ſhall likewiſe reign</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>with him,</hi> Luke 22. 28, 29. <hi>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations;</hi> and, <hi>I appoint</hi>
                     <pb n="452" facs="tcp:57146:235"/>
                     <hi>unto you a Kingdom, as my father hath appointed unto me:</hi> the appointing of <hi>a Kingdom</hi> follows upon their <hi>continuing with Chriſt in temptation.</hi> Brethren, God promiſes much to thoſe that ſhall be ſenſible of the reproaches of others, much more when thou thy ſelf ſuffereſt in the cauſe of Chriſt. In <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>I will gather them that are ſorrowful for the ſolemn Aſſembly;</hi> time was, when the ſolemn Aſſemblies of Gods people, their gathering together to hear a Sermon was their reproach, and they were contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many: were you ever in any place where the Aſſemblies of Gods people were reproachful, and was this a burthen to your ſouls, and grievous to you? mark the bleſſed promiſe, <hi>I will gather them together:</hi> but to be reproached our ſelves, and to bear our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches in a Chriſtian maner, <hi>great</hi> and <hi>rich promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> are made unto it.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, in reproaches and ſufferings for <note place="margin">7.</note> Chriſt, there are rich conſolations; never ſuch conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation let out to a gracious heart, as when it is under reproaches and ſoreſt perſecutions: if ever Chriſt does turn water into wine, it is the tears of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are turned into wine of conſolation. <hi>Baſil</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

Pariſ. de moribus. <hi>Ad epulas &amp; nuptias ire ſe dixit, cum ad car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceres &amp; tormenta iret,</hi> apud Lutherum T. 4. 315.</note> in his Oration for <hi>Barlaam</hi> that famous Martyr, ſays, <hi>He delighted in the cloſe Priſon, as in a pleaſant green meadow, and he took pleaſure in the ſeveral inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of tortures, as in ſeveral ſweet flowers.</hi> And <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> the Martyr ſpeaking of the great things he ſuffered for Chriſt, hath this expreſſion, <hi>I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deſired theſe dainties. Luther</hi> reports of that Martyr, St. <hi>Agatha,</hi> that as ſhe went to Priſons and Tortures, ſhe ſaid, ſhe went to Banquets and Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails. And <hi>Iames Bainham</hi> ſaid when they kindled the

fire at his feet, <hi>Me thinks you ſtrew roſes before me.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> hath a moſt full expreſſion of his conſolation, he felt a wonderful ſweet refreſhment flow from his heart unto all the members of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and from all the parts of his body to his heart again. And that Martyr <hi>Hawks,</hi> lifts up his hands above his head, and claps them together when he was in the fire, as if he had been in a triumph: this is a ſpecial fruit of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and <hi>of glory,</hi> of which St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>If ye ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, happy are ye, the Spirit of God and glory reſts upon you,</hi> and one conſolation, one beam of Gods face is worth all the riches of the world. The <hi>Sun</hi> enlightens the world, ſays <hi>Cyprian,</hi> but he that made the <hi>Sun</hi> is a greater light to you in priſon; that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is the horrible deadly darkneſs of the place of puniſhment to others, he irradiates to you with his bright and eternal light. <hi>Vobis idem qui Solem fecit majus in carcere lumen fuit horribiles caeteris atque funeſt as paenalis loci tenebr as aeterna illa &amp; candida lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce radiante, Cyp. Ep.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, in reproaches and ſufferings there are riches of glory both before the day of Judgement and after: riches of glory before; if ſo be that opinion of ſome be true (which I dare not altogether deny) of Chriſts coming to reign in the world here before the day of Judgement; though I will not affirm it as a truth, yet if there be not a truth in it, I confeſs I cannot make any thing of many places of Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 5. <hi>But the reſt of the dead lived not again till the thouſand years were finiſhed. This is the firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Bleſſed &amp; holy is he that hath part in the firſt reſurrection; on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power,</hi>
                     <pb n="455" facs="tcp:57146:236"/>
                     <hi>but they ſhall be Prieſts of God, and of Chriſt, and ſhall reign with him a thouſand years.</hi> I know this is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily interpreted of the reſurrection <hi>from ſin to grace,</hi> and reigning with Chriſt <hi>a thouſand years,</hi> that is, reigning with him <hi>in Heaven:</hi> but this cannot be the meaning of the Text; this <hi>thouſand years</hi> muſt be before the day of Judgement, becauſe Satan muſt be looſed after: now if this prove to be true, O the riches of glory, that thoſe that ſuffer for Chriſt ſhall have! all thoſe that have ſuffered for Chriſt, they eſpecially ſhall be raiſed up to reign with Chriſt on the earth; and therefore you have it in ver. 4. <hi>And I ſaw thrones, and they ſate upon them, and judgement was given unto them: and I ſaw the ſouls of them that were beheaded for the witneſs of Ieſus, and for the word of God, and which had not worſhipped the beaſt, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands, and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years.</hi> Suppoſe it to be ſo, then the more any do ſuffer for withdrawing himſelf from <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> the more glory they ſhall have when Chriſt comes to reign upon the earth.

in pleaſure to the fleſh: but take the Kingdom of Chriſt to be ſpiritual in the glory of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, as I am confident that Chriſt ſhall reign Perſonally, in his fleſh I will not ſay, but Spiritually, farre more gloriouſly then he hath done.</p>
                  <p>But then at the day of Judgement, O the glory of thoſe that ſuffer for Chriſt, they ſhall have Crowns upon their heads, and Palms in their hands, and all their perſecutors ſtand as baſe creatures before them!

Ep 55.</note> ſoul, and to be equalled with Angels, ſays <hi>Jerome,</hi> who is willing to ſuffer, if it were poſſible, as great things for Chriſt, as Chriſt hath ſuffered for it. <hi>Vera eſt illa anima faelix, &amp; Angelis aequanda quae pro nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne &amp; opere Chriſti tanta quanta pro nobis ille ſuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuit, voluit ſuſtinere, Hyeronym. Epiſt. ad Oceanum.</hi> Such as have been followers of eminent men, they highly eſteemed to be like their Maſters, though in things that were ſome diſhonor; As <hi>Plato</hi> was a man of a crooked back, and his Schollars counted it an ornament for to go crooked. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had a liſping ſpeech, and his Schollars thought it an honor to have a liſping ſpeech. And <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a wry neck, and a harſh ſpeech, and his ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thought it an honor to be like him: how much more ſhould the godly count their ſufferings an honor, becauſe they are comformable to Chriſt? For Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, hence we ſee the excellency of <hi>grace,</hi> what an excellent and glorious thing it is, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 1.</note> whereſoever it is, that it does conduce ſo far to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe riches out of any thing: great muſt needs be the gain of godlineſs, when it gains from their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and reproaches; grace is ſuch a thing, as can turn duſt into gold: The Philoſophers ſtone is counted a rich thing, becauſe it turns duſt into gold, <hi>grace</hi> will do it, the dirt that the world caſts upon Gods people, is turned into gold: well may it be called the <hi>Divine nature;</hi> for as God brings light out of darkneſs, and comfort out of ſorrow, and riches out of poverty, and glory out of ſhame, ſo
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:57146:237"/>
does grace. How does grace conduce to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life of Gods people? as for the ſervice that God employs them in, they count that honorable; and the ſufferings that God calls them to, they count them comfortable; we need not therefore be ſo afraid of ſufferings; indeed, if we have not a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to change the nature of them, we may be afraid, but if God do put a principle into us, to turn our ſhame into glory, and ſufferings into riches, we need not be afraid: If any did ſee <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>Serpent,</hi> he would be afraid; but if he had <hi>Moſes</hi> hand, he would not be afraid, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> hand had a divine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue with it to turn the Serpent into <hi>a rod;</hi> and ſo if we look upon ſufferings as a Serpent ready to devour us, we may be afraid, but when we conſider the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of grace, that it hath a divine power to turn the Serpent into a rod, you need not be afraid; labor to prize this jewel of grace, that can do ſuch great things: It was the curſe upon the wicked, that God would turn their glory into ſhame; It is the bleſſing of grace, that it will turn ſhame into glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we ſee a reaſon of the meekneſs and quiet behavior of Gods people in ſufferings: Though they are perſecuted, they carry themſelves meekly, and are ready to forgive, they are not diſcouraged, and ſink in their ſufferings, becauſe they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſufferings with another eye then the men of the world do, they look upon their ſufferings as their glory and riches: When a man hath riches coming in, he is quiet; and though he were angry, paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and vexing before, yet when riches come in, that quiets his heart, and he is ready to do any
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:57146:238"/>
office of love then; this is the reaſon why Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ready to do any office of love to them that do perſecute them, becauſe they look upon them as their glory. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a man that had a high eſteem of his ſufferings, and therefore when he ſuffered much, and from thoſe that were his friends, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 12. ſee his behavior, <hi>Brethren, I beſeech you, be as I am, for I am as you are, ye have not injured me at all;</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>How ſoever you have carried your ſelves, yet be as I am, I am as you are, let our hearts cloſe and joyn together;</hi> you have not injured me at all: Thus his ſpirit was carryed in this quiet and meek frame, becauſe he had a right underſtanding of the nature of ſufferings. And ſo we read of <hi>Stephen,</hi> when they were ſtoning him, ſays he, <hi>Lord forgive them:</hi> What was the ground of this? <hi>He ſaw the heavens opened, and Chriſt ſtand at the right hand of his Father,</hi> he ſaw a great deal of glory that was in his ſufferings when he ſuffered thus for Chriſt; he could pray for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors: What was the reaſon Chriſt endured all ſo quietly? he knew the good that was in his ſufferings. Indeed, as for thoſe that ſee no good in them, that finde nothing but trouble and vexation, no marvel though their hearts fret and revile again; but where a gracious heart findes ſweetneſs and good in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſurely there need not be that fretting and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirit in them as in others. And why ſhould we vex and fret, when we ſuffer any thing for God? it muſt be upon one of theſe two grounds; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the evil that we do endure, or the evil of thoſe from whom we do endure. The evil that we do endure cannot cauſe fretting, becauſe it is turned to ſuch great riches. But you will ſay, The ſuffering
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:57146:238"/>
it ſelf I do not care for, but <hi>the baſe malicious hearts of thoſe from whom I ſuffer,</hi> that troubles me. To that I anſwer, It is reported concerning <hi>Socrates,</hi> being once reproached, and yet behaving himſelf meekly and quietly, one came and asked him how he could be ſo meek and quiet, when he was reproached by ſuch a one as he was that did reproach him? <hi>Socrates</hi> anſwered, If as we go along we ſhould meet with a man that had a diſeaſed body, more diſeaſed then our bodies, more weak then ours, ſhould we fret at him becauſe we ſee the diſeaſe of his body more grievous then ours: No, this ſhould make us pity him; then ſays he, if as we go along, we ſee the ſpirit of one more diſeaſed, and more diſtempered then ours, ſhould this make us fret at him? it rather calls for pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration: ſo if that be the thing that makes thee fret; namely, the malice of them from whom you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, it ſhould rather turn your vexation into commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and look upon his ſpirit as diſeaſed, and ſickly, and weak, and bleſs God that hath given you a more ſtrong and hail ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if Gods people account ſufferings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 3.</note> greater riches then the treaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> then here we may ſee to what a heighth a gracious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is raiſed to, how high above the world; in that it looks upon the riches, and glory, and ſweet content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, as under the meaneſt and baſeſt thing that does attend godlineſs; namely, as things under reproaches, and under ſcorns and ſufferings; Gods people do not onely look at Chriſt, and grace, and heaven, as above the riches and glory of the world, that they are infinitely above them; but mark how a gracious heart is raiſed above the world, take
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:57146:239"/>
the very dirt that is caſt upon the ways of God, and he counts that very dirt to be higher then all the riches, and glory, and dignity of the world; ſurely then a gracious heart hath a very low eſteem of the world, and the riches and glory of it, howſoever other men that know no better things, eſteem high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them: A man that hath rich Revenues, plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful comings in, he bleſſes himſelf in this, and counts himſelf a great man here; but know, while you are bleſſing your ſelves in theſe things of the world, that do glitter in carnal eyes, a gracious heart is ſo far from looking at that which you do ſo highly eſteem of as great matters, as he accounts the very baſeneſs that attends the ways of godlineſs, as a higher pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment by far then all your glory, and rejoyces more in it, and bleſſes God more for it; yea, bleſſes himſelf more in the very baſeſt and meaneſt things that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend godlineſs, then in all your riches; ſo that a godly mans feet are where a wicked mans head is.</p>
                  <p>The head of a worldly man, that is, the chief of his <hi>deſires,</hi> and <hi>joys,</hi> and <hi>endeavors,</hi> it is in the riches of the world, and there a godly mans feet ſtand, and he counts them ſo low, as he counts the dirt of his feet better: Surely it is but a little room that riches have in the heart of a godly man, when as the very <hi>reproaches of Chriſt are more to him then all the riches of the world:</hi> The very filth that is caſt upon him while he is in his way, he does count better. When we would expreſs our moſt vile eſteem of any thing, we uſe to ſay, We prize it no more then the dirt under our feet; then ſurely a godly man muſt have a vile eſteem of the things of the world,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:57146:239"/>
for he does not ſo much prize it as the dirt that is caſt upon him. And ſo the Pſalmiſt in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119, 118. ſpeaking of the vile eſteem that God hath of the wicked, ſays he, <hi>He treads them down under his feet, and puts them away as droſs:</hi> Gods ſervants are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. to <hi>jewels</hi> that are ſcattered up and down in the dirt, for ſo the phraſe does intimate, but the dirt that is upon his jewels, is highlier eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Gods people, then all the jewels of the world: The ſcrapings and waſhings that come from the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of men, is the ſweeteſt food unto a Swine; ſo that which is the ſweeteſt and moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things of the men of the world, it is meaner then the baſeſt thing that does belong unto the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Gods people. O the advantage that the Saints have above the men of the world! Were there any great matter in the things of the world, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eſteemed by men, it could not be that the very reproaches of Gods people could be counted bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but whatſoever eſteem the men of the world have of them, it appears by this there is no great matter in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Riches</hi> in Scripture are compared to <hi>thorns,</hi> there <note place="margin">How <hi>riches</hi> do reſemble <hi>thorns.</hi>
                     </note> are five or ſix things wherein they are like thorns; Firſt, <hi>thorns</hi> are the vileſt plaints, ſo <hi>riches</hi> are to a gracious heart. Secondly, in regard of the <hi>ſuddenneſs</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>of their paſsing away,</hi> if the fire do but touch them, <note place="margin">2.</note> they are quickly gone, ſo <hi>riches</hi> ſoon paſs away, it is ſaid, <hi>They have wings and fly away.</hi> Thirdly, in regard <note place="margin">3.</note> of their unfruitfulnes, <hi>thorns</hi> bear nothing fit for man, ſo <hi>riches</hi> are very unfruitful, they make men unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Fourthly, in regard that <hi>thorns</hi> are ſuch hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances to better things; and therefore the Scripture <note place="margin">4.</note>
                     <pb n="462" facs="tcp:57146:240"/>
ſays, the ſeed of the word that was ſown <hi>among thorns it was choaked,</hi> they will not let better things grow by them; ſo the riches of the world and cares about them, choak up all, and hinder other things that are good. Fifthly, they are compared to <hi>thorns,</hi> in regard <note place="margin">5.</note> of the prickly nature of them: So there are many ſnares in <hi>riches;</hi> ſays the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>They pierce themſelves through with many ſorrows:</hi> It is hard for a man to go through thorns, and not to pierce him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he may be in the outſide of them, and not pierce himſelf; ſo though a man be buſie in the world, he may keep himſelf from pricking, but if he be over head and ears in the world, he will be pricked; as the ſheep that is got into the thorns will loſe part of her fleece, ſo Gods people will loſe part of their good amongſt the world. Laſtly, many venomous creatures, as <note place="margin">6.</note> Snakes and Toads, and the like, are creeping and crawling in the thorns, ſo many venomous luſts are hidden by riches, an outward glorious eſtate does hide many filthy luſts. Theſe arguments may for ever teach us to look upon theſe things as very mean and low.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if ſufferings and reproaches for Chriſt be <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 4.</note> greater riches then all the riches in the world, O how are they miſtaken, how are they deluded that look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe things as the greateſt evils! that are ſo ſhy of ſufferings and reproaches for Chriſt, as that they will loſe the greateſt riches, rather then they will be enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, rather then they will endure them, when as they are ſo great a good: As firſt, is not <hi>peace of conſcience</hi> a rich jewel, more then all the riches of the world; and yet how many are there that will loſe the rich jewel of <hi>peace of conſcience,</hi> rather then endure
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:57146:240"/>
reproaches, rather then be enriched by reproaches? though they be convinced in their conſcience, ſuch ways are according to Gods minde, that they are bound to do them, ſuch things ought to be done, and ſuch things ought to be left undone; yet rather then they will endure reproaches, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to part with the riches of the peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, is not the <hi>truth of God</hi> a rich jewel, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious jewel? O any one truth is rich, we ſhould prize <note place="margin">2.</note> it above our lives! O that faith <hi>that was once deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fit of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</note> 
                     <hi>to the Saints,</hi> how ſhould we prize it! <hi>Buy the truth, ſell it not:</hi> Buy it at any rate, ſell it not upon any terms. The truth is that, that the blood, the lives of ſo many dear and precious Saints of God that were the glory of the world, have been laid out for the maintenance of, and well laid out too: For though God does eſteem of the blood of his Saints, and <hi>precious in his eyes is the death of the Saints,</hi> yet God eſteems highlier of his <hi>truth,</hi> that is worth the blood of all that have been ſpilt for the defence of it. The <hi>truth</hi> of God is the eſpecial end for which the Son of God came into the world, and took mans nature upon him, to teſtifie to the truth. The <hi>truth</hi> is more worth then rubies and all precious ſtones, then gold and ſilver: <hi>Whatſoever thou canſt deſire, is not to be compared to it;</hi> and though there be ſo many riches in the truth of God, yet how many are there that will rather betray the truth of God, loſe the truth of God, rather then ſuffer reproaches.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, is it not a rich thing to enjoy <hi>communion with God?</hi> It was an expreſſion of that truly noble <note place="margin">3.</note> Marquis <hi>Galeacius,</hi> that parted with all for Chriſt,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:57146:241"/>
when his friends that were very rich, offered him bags of gold and ſilver to return to them again, he put them all away with this expreſſion of indignation, <hi>Curſed is that man that counts all the gold and ſilver in the world, worth the enjoyment of communion with Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> This is riches, yet ſome had rather loſe this then endure reproaches.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, is not <hi>the bleſsing of God</hi> upon us, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God over us, the love of God unto us, the <note place="margin">4.</note> care of God for us, and the brightneſs of the face of God ſhining upon us, and brightning all our ways, are not theſe riches? and yet behold how many are there that are ſo far from counting reproaches riches, as they will loſe theſe riches, rather then bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, is not <hi>the inheritance of the Saints,</hi> that <note place="margin">5.</note> kingdom of glory, that incorruptible undefiled crown that is reſerved for them, riches? and yet how many are ſo far from eſteeming reproaches riches, as they will venture the loſs of that too, rather then they will endure reproaches.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, are not <hi>the Ordinances of God</hi> riches, that <note place="margin">6.</note> are the eſpecial conduits and means of conveyance of the choice mercies of God unto his people; thoſe mercies that have ſuch an immediate dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eternity, are not theſe riches worth all the world? yet how many are ſo far from counting reproaches riches, as will rather loſe all the riches of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, then be <hi>reproached:</hi> Though their conſcience tell them, You might enjoy abundance of bleſſing in the Ordinances, were it that you might have them in the power of them, and they have a good minde to them: Ah, but my friends will ſcorn me; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:57146:241"/>
this ground, they forbear coming to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: And thus they are ſo far from counting the reproaches they ſhall endure, <hi>riches,</hi> as they deprive themſelves of all the riches in the <hi>Ordinances of God,</hi> rather then they will endure them: Like unto <hi>Aſa,</hi> in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 18. he took all the <hi>gold,</hi> and <hi>ſilver,</hi> and <hi>riches</hi> of the treaſure of God, to ſend them unto <hi>Benhadad,</hi> that he might free him from the <hi>King of Iſrael:</hi> So men are willing to part with the gold and ſilver, and all the riches of Gods houſe, and of Gods Ordinances, ſo they may be freed from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and ſufferings, and from enduring trouble; was there ever deluſion like this deluſion, to loſe ſuch <hi>riches,</hi> rather then endure that which in <hi>it ſelf</hi> is riches? were it that reproaches were as great evils as you can imagine, ſuppoſe you might go to live where you might enjoy the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> though it were in ſuch a place as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of, in <hi>Job</hi> 22. 10. <hi>A land of darkneſs,</hi> as darkneſs it ſelf, <hi>and of the ſhadows of death,</hi> without any order, and where the light is as darkneſs; yet that ſubjection that your ſouls do owe to God, does call for a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to yield to that, and to yield to reproaches and ſufferings, though there were no good in them: but now, when there is ſo much good, ſuch glorious things mingled together with <hi>reproaches,</hi> for you now to be ſo afraid of reproaches, as to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to loſe ſo much riches rather then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them, how is your heart beſotted? Suppoſe <hi>reproaches</hi> had ſuch ſhame in them as you think they have, cannot God put honor upon them? man can put honor upon mean things: As the <hi>Garter</hi> that is counted an ornament of the higheſt
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:57146:242"/>
                     <hi>Nobility,</hi> that <hi>Kings</hi> wear about their necks as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of their princely order: A Garter fell from a <hi>Lady,</hi> and ſhe bluſhed for ſhame, the <hi>King</hi> took it up, <hi>Well,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I will make this an honorable orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ere long;</hi> and upon that came the Order of the <hi>Garter.</hi> If man can put an honor upon that which is mean, ſurely God can do it: And therefore <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>ſufferings</hi> and <hi>reproaches,</hi> ſays, They are <hi>the enſigns of heavenly nobility;</hi> and if God hath put this honor upon them, ſhall you be ſo ſhy of them, as to loſe ſo much, rather then to endure them?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if they were evil, you are to endure them, in <note place="margin">1.</note> regard of your ſubjection to God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if there were nothing loſt by your draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">2.</note> from them, and your unwillingneſs to endure them, it ſhould be a great deal of evil; but <hi>firſt</hi> conſidering that there is <hi>good</hi> in them, and <hi>ſo much loſt</hi> by your unwillingneſs to endure them, what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is here? there is an art and skill in Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that would ſhew you other things then you ſee: You would never have ſuch low eſteem of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,</hi> if you had the skill of Chriſtianity: If a man did fling bags of pearls and gold at a dog, he would be afraid of them, and run away, but a man would not, but be ready to catch them; and ſo men of the world and baſe hearts, that are not acquainted with this skill of Chriſtianity, they will run way at reproaches and ſufferings, but a heart that knows what they are, does not run away.</p>
                  <p>But are you ſhy of ſufferings, and run away? what a difference is there between the diſpoſition of your hearts, and the diſpoſition of the moſt worthy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God in all ages? you are afraid of them, as
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:57146:242"/>
if they were evil like hell it ſelf; Gods people ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire them. I remember a ſpeech of <hi>Jerome</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Qu is poſt hujuſmodi vocem ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari ſe non ſinat? quis ab bomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus erſequi ſe juſtitiae cauſa non optet? quis ſe non ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledici deſi deret?

O would all the rout of unbelievers did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute and trouble me for the name of my Lord, and for righteouſneſs ſake; I would this fooliſh world would all riſe up againſt me to reproach me.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods people have been greedy of them. <hi>Origen</hi> was ſo earneſt to ſuffer with his father, when he was a youth of ſixteen years of age, that if his mother had not kept his clothes from him, he would have run to the place where his father ſuffered, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and to have ſuffered with him. And ſo the ſtory of the <hi>poor Woman</hi> in the book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> that made haſte to the place where many Chriſtians were to be burned, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>Perſecutor,</hi> ſays he, <hi>What need you make ſuch haſte to that place, there are many to be burned?</hi> Ah, ſays ſhe, that I know, and <hi>I am afraid all will</hi>

Again, what unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and diſhonor is this to Chriſt, that hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo much for you. Chriſt hath gloried in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings he ſuffered for you, and why ſhould you be afraid of ſufferings for him? it was a notable ſpeech of an Ancient, <hi>Acceptable is the reproach of the Croſs</hi> to

him <hi>that is not unthankful to him that was crucified upon the Croſs.</hi> And what confuſion will it be upon <note place="margin">

                  <p>Fifthly, let us labor to get this Chriſtian magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of ſpirit, namely, for to <hi>glory in all</hi> that we ſuffer for Chriſt: <hi>Heathens</hi> can be <hi>patient</hi> in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but <hi>Chriſtians</hi> muſt go beyond them, and <hi>glory</hi> in their ſufferings.

Firſt, if you had a full ſatisfaction of your own
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:57146:243"/>
ſpirits in the cauſe of God you maintain, and the ways of God, you walk from your own experience you have in them; if you take upon you the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Religion by the reports of others, and be carried by the example of others, that will not do it; but if in your own experiences you finde that ſweet and onely ſatisfying content in the truths and ways of God, this will do it. It was a notable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of <hi>Luther,</hi> My purpoſe is not, ſays he, to maintain my life or name in reſpect what men ſay, or can ſay of me for my maners, but my purpoſe is to maintain the cauſe of God; let whoſoever will tear my life and name in this regard: <hi>Propoſitum eſt mihi neque vitam neque mores tueri, ſed ſolam cauſam; lacerent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res meos quicun<expan>

                  <p>Secondly, if you get your hearts inflamed with love <note place="margin">2.</note> to Chriſt: <hi>Love</hi> delights in opportunities of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it ſelf, and it hath never ſuch a full opportunity of expreſſing the ſtrength and heat of it, as in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering much for the <hi>Beloved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if you have an eye of <hi>faith,</hi> and can behold <note place="margin">3.</note> God the Father, and Chriſt, and the bleſſed Angels looking upon you when you are in your ſufferings; By the eye of faith look up to heaven, and ſee God looking upon you, and ſaying, Here is a ſervant of mine is called to ſuffer for me, now you ſhall ſee his behavior; and Chriſt and the Angels looking upon you to ſee your behavior, and this will do it; not onely make you patient, but <hi>glory</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, if there be ſo much glory, and ſuch riches <note place="margin">

I remember a notable ſpeech of <hi>Gulielmus Pariſienſis, O happy pallat that can taſte ſuch delicates!</hi> O it is a bleſſed thing that God hath given you ſuch a taſte! Again, know, if you glory <note place="margin">2.</note> in your <hi>ſufferings</hi> for God, God will glory in doing for you: None ſhall glory in <hi>ſuffering</hi> for him, but he will count it his glory to be doing for them. Thirdly, <note place="margin">3.</note> if you glory in your ſufferings for Chriſt, God will count it his glory to uphold you in his ſufferings. Fourthly, do you glory in the low condition you are put into for Chriſt? certainly God will own your <note place="margin">4.</note> ſouls, and glory in you when you are in the loweſt condition, when your ſouls ſhall be in adverſity, God will know you then. Fifthly, can you glory in a ſuffering Chriſt, when Chriſt comes in glory, he <note place="margin">5.</note> will <hi>own you,</hi> when he ſhall be glorified, his glory ſhall be <hi>yours: Thoſe that are aſhamed of me, I will be aſhamed of them</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>before my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Angels:</hi> But thoſe that glory in Chriſt, Chriſt ſhall be <hi>their glory.</hi> Laſtly, now you glory in <note place="margin">6.</note> Chriſts <hi>ſufferings,</hi> you ſhall glory in his <hi>praiſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, if ſo be that Gods people account <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 7.</note> themſelves ſo enriched by ſufferings and reproaches, let us take heed we do not deſpiſe any that do ſuffer <note place="margin">Sufferers for Chriſt not to be deſpiſed.</note> for Chriſt, that we have not low eſteem of them, becauſe of their ſufferings: God hath high eſteem of them when they ſuffer, and they themſelves ſee cauſe to glory in their condition; and are you that are ſtanders by aſhamed of them? and do you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem of them for their ſufferings? while the Saints of God flouriſh in the world, they are eſteemed of
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:57146:244"/>
by many carnal hearts; but let them ſuffer any thing and be diſgraced, and they withdraw themſelves from them, they are deſpiſed as a lamp in the ſnuff, but who do deſpiſe thoſe that are ready to fall into trouble? thoſe that are in eaſe: When a lamp is bright and ſhining, every one eſteems it; but when it comes to be in the ſnuff, men deſpiſe it: and ſo in outward proſperity, many do eſteem of them, but when they come into trouble, then they ſlight them: O let not thoſe that are like to fall into trouble be deſpiſed by you: I pray what ſervice do you for God, that you ſhould deſpiſe them? ſuch a one as ſuffers in the cauſe of God, does more ſervice for God, then you have done in all your lives, and God hath more honor by him; and will you deſpiſe him, and look with an evil eye upon ſuch a one? behold him, look upon him, ſee whether the preſence of God be not more with him then ever; ſee whether the glory of God does not appear more upon him then ever? and will you deſpiſe him? It is ſaid, <hi>God will not withdraw himſelf from the righteous,</hi> however <hi>others</hi> do withdraw <hi>themſelves;</hi> (that is) let the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous be inany condition, though in the pooreſt mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt condition, God withdraws not himſelf from him, and ſhall you withdraw your hearts from him? you ſhould embrace them, and the more they ſuffer for God, the more you ſhould delight in them, and be in their company the more, and not be ſhy of their company, and aſhamed to own them.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 9. you ſee how St. <hi>John</hi> does boaſt in his tribulation; he does not ſay, <hi>I John</hi> that am an <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt,</hi> who am an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> who have revelations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto me, but, <hi>I John, who am alſo your brother</hi>

                     <hi>and companion in tribulation:</hi> This he rejoyces in, that there is a company of Gods people that I may joyn with in tribulation for Chriſt. And ſo it is ſpoken of the honor of thoſe Chriſtians in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 33. that they were <hi>companions of thoſe that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached and perſecuted:</hi> It is therefore well taken at Gods hand, when any of Gods people are in trouble, that others are willing to be their companions, and not to deſpiſe them, but to embrace them. And <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the <hi>Emperor,</hi> when he came to <hi>Pagnutius,</hi> that had loſt his <hi>eye</hi> for Chriſt, he embraced him, and kiſſed <hi>that</hi> eye.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, if Gods people do ſo glory in their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: <note place="margin">8.</note> Hence there is diſcouragement to all wicked men to meddle with them; certainly they will get nothing by it. You think if they will not do thus and thus, you will make them do it: Alas, you are infinitely deceived; what will you do to make them do it? you will reproach them, and caſt diſgrace upon them, and take away their eſtates, and hunt them up and down: This is that which they glory in, and they count their riches; you enrich them by this: And therefore if there be any policy in you, leave off this way; for when are the people of God more ſetled in the way of godlineſs, and againſt the way of Antichriſt, then when they are perſecuted? <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in his Oration upon <hi>Baſil,</hi> tells of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conteſtation that <hi>Baſil</hi> had with <hi>Modeſtus,</hi> the Emperors Lieutenant: What, (ſaith <hi>Modeſtus)</hi> what do we ſeem to be to you?

<pb n="473" facs="tcp:57146:245"/>
reckons up a company of ſcaring things, <hi>Loſſes of goods, Baniſhment, Tortures, Death:</hi> then, ſays <hi>Baſil,</hi> if you have any thing elſe, threaten it, for theſe things are nothing. How is that, ſays he? <hi>Baſil</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>for loſs of goods,</hi> I have nothing but a few torn cloathes, and a few books; <hi>for Baniſhment,</hi> I account the whole earth mine; <hi>for Death,</hi> that will be a benefit to me, you will ſend me ſooner to God, <hi>to whom I live, and to whom I hasten;</hi> and a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſaith, <hi>Fire, Sword, Priſon, Famine, are all a pleaſure, they are delightful to me.</hi>

                  <p>We read likewiſe of a notable ſpeech of this <hi>Lieutenant</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Julian: While they ſuffer, they deride us</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the torments are more fearful to them that ſtand by, then to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. Gulielmus Pariſienſis</hi>

                  <p>In <hi>Jeremy</hi> 23. 7. ſays God, <hi>They think to cauſe my people to forget my name by their dreams,</hi> which they tell every man to his neighbor, <hi>as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal:</hi> becauſe a company of baſe <hi>Hypocrites</hi> are taken from the ways of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and from the profeſſion of truth by ſcorns and reproaches, the men of the world think to get Gods people to forget his Name, but they are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely miſtaken: although you prevail with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, do not think to prevail in like maner with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hearts. The anſwer of <hi>Baſil</hi> to <hi>Modestus,</hi> that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in his former Oration mentions, is very remarkable; When <hi>Modeſtus</hi> heard his bold anſwers, ſays he to him, <hi>Never any man anſwered me thus, thus boldly as you do:</hi> It may be, ſays <hi>Baſil, you never had to deal with a Biſhop before.</hi> So although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps others who make ſhews of Religion, yet not well grounded, will yield to you; yet if you meet with a true gracious heart, you ſhall finde another maner of power there to reſiſt whatſoever you can do. Do what you can, thoſe who are truly godly, will be above you in whatſoever ſufferings they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure from you. It was a notable ſpeech I have read of one <hi>Cyrus Theodorus,</hi> to the former <hi>Modeſtus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Baſil: O Modestus, Baſil is above you, you are but a poor</hi> Piſmire <hi>to him, though you roar as a</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! <hi>Luther</hi> likewiſe reports of <hi>Vincentius,</hi> that he laughed <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>things,</hi> he glories more in them, then in raiſing thouſands from the dead, <hi>Chriſt glories in them;</hi> And that is obſervable in the ninth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where Chriſt appears to <hi>Saul,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> ſays <hi>Paul, Who art thou? I am Jeſus of Nazareth;</hi> why does he ſay, <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth?</hi> does any good come out of <hi>Nazareth?</hi> he does not ſay, <hi>I am the ſecond perſon of the Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of God, the <hi>King</hi> of the Church; no, but <hi>I am Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> that was a <hi>reproach</hi> that was caſt upon Chriſt, and Chriſt glories in that, ſurely we ſhould glory in it then.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if there be ſo many riches in ſuffering <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 10.</note> for Chriſt in reproaches, what riches are there in the Crown, in the reward of the reproaches, and ſufferings? men do dig riches out of dark holes and mines in the Earth; here is a hole, though it be dark, yet it is a mine, where-out you may dig great riches, if you have wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to dig, if you have a true Chriſtian Spirit; you ſee out of this deep dark pit you may dig riches.</p>

                     <hi>ſervants, to go on in a way of ſuffering and hardſhip for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was this that helped <hi>David</hi> in the midſt of his ſore temptation, that did ariſe from his affliction in the way of God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37. 24. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me mith thy counſel, and afterward receive me to glory:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Howſoever it be with the men of the world, who enjoy their proſperity according to their deſires; and howſoever it be with <hi>me,</hi> that I am afflicted, and muſt endure hard things here, yet this is that which upholds me through all, Thou ſhalt <hi>afterward</hi> receive me to glory. This is that which upheld the Spirit of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. where he brings in a moſt notable and high expreſſion of the glory that is to come, for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his ſpirit in his ſuffering; <hi>For our light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> This is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> propounded unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> to uphold his heart in all his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 2. 12. <hi>If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him.</hi> This is that which ſtrengthned the Spirits of the Chriſtians, that ſuffered in the times of
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:57146:248"/>
the <hi>Maccabees, Heb.</hi> 10. 34. As thoſe <hi>cluſters of Grapes</hi> that were brought from the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that ſhewed to the people, what the fruitfulneſs of that land was, was an encouragement to them, to paſs through all difficulties that they were like to meet withalin the poſſeſſion of the land, to fight againſt the children of <hi>Anak;</hi> ſo that which God hath revealed of Heaven, is like thoſe <hi>cluſters of grapes,</hi> thoſe little things that we have made known to us (in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the glory that is to come) are to that end re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to encourage us in our way here. In the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this point, there are theſe five things we ſhall endeavor to do: Firſt, to ſhew that there is a reward for the righteous. Secondly, how far a Chriſtian may have an eye unto this reward. Thirdly, ſhew ſomewhat what this reward is. Fourthly, wherein lies <hi>the power</hi> of the believing of this, to help us to endure any hardſhip. Laſtly, make Application of all.</p>
                  <p>That there is <hi>a reward.</hi> Certainly, there is a more bleſſed condition for Gods people hereafter, they have <note place="margin">1.</note> not received that which is prepared for them, there are other maner of things to be revealed, then thoſe that you ſee. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. 11. <hi>Verily there is a reward for the righteous;</hi> ſurely it is ſo: notwithſtanding a carnal ſenſual heart doth not ſee it, yet <hi>verily there is a reward;</hi> though the ways of Gods providence do ſeem outwardly to work otherwiſe, yet ſurely there is a reward: notwithſtanding our unbelieving hearts are ready to queſtion it, yet <hi>ſurely</hi> there is a reward, <hi>verily</hi> there is a reward for the righteous. There is a great deal of power in this one thing to raiſe up our hearts from the creature, from grovelling here below,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:57146:248"/>
to make us at leaſt to look upward to know our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is not here, to know that there are glorious things to be expected, and that appears:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God hath infinite riches of glory, infinite treaſures of happineſs, there are infinite great things in God, and God takes infinite delight to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelf, and let out himſelf unto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: now if there be ſuch infinite riches with God, ſuch glorious treaſures of happineſs, and he delights to <hi>communicate</hi> himſelf, certainly there are great things to be communicated then; for wherefore is it that God hath ſuch infinite riches in him, but that in due time he will make them known, and reveal them, and communicate them? it is but little that is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and communicated for the preſent; therefore there are other things to be revealed and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God hath made mankinde to be of ſuch a nature, as to have a kinde of infinite capacity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is made capable of happineſs, beyond that which any creature, beſides <hi>Angels,</hi> is capable of: Properly no creature but the rational creature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of happineſs at all, but beſides it hath a kinde of infinite capacity, whereby it is made capable of the higheſt happineſs that belongs to the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Creature: and certainly God hath not made this in vain, God does intend to fill this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, <hi>An infinite capacity of happineſs,</hi> how is that? Thus; for there are two things in the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of man, his <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and his <hi>will:</hi> now the capacity of this part, muſt be judged according to the objects that are ſuitable unto theſe two facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:57146:249"/>
in mans ſoul: For the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> it is not any particular thing that is the object of it, but truth <hi>in general:</hi> take <hi>truth</hi> in the utmoſt latitude of it, in the univerſality of it, that is the object of mans underſtanding; and therefore the underſtanding is infinite, becauſe it is not ſatisfied in this or that particular, but <hi>truth</hi> in the utmoſt extent. And for the object of the <hi>will,</hi> it is good in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it is not this or that particular good, but good in the univerſality of its nature; and therefore till it come to enjoy God, that does eminently contain all good in him, it can never come to have full ſatisfaction. And here obſerve the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the capacity of mans nature, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of other Creatures: as for other Creatures, their faculties can extend no further then ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular good, and they are limited within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bounds of their own nature; and therefore if ſo be the <hi>eye</hi> have colour, it goes no further; and if the <hi>ear</hi> have ſound, it goes no further; and ſo <hi>taste,</hi> it goes no further then ſome particular good; but the intelligent ſoul, the rational ſoul goes beyond all particulars. Now God having made mans nature of ſuch a capacity for good and happineſs, certainly God intends great things for the children of men, other maner of things, then there are in this world; and if for any, ſurely for the righteous.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſurely there is a reward, becauſe it is the <note place="margin">3.</note> great deſign that God had in the making of the world, in all his works to lift up, and advance the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the riches of his mercy and grace: now if this be Gods great deſign, to advance the glory of his
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:57146:249"/>
infinite mercy, then certainly there muſt needs be a glorious condition for ſome of the children of men, for that is not yet done; though there be ſomething of Gods mercy manifeſted, that we have cauſe to admire at; yet certainly, God does not reveal that in the world, whereby he ſhould attain to the great deſign, of lifting up of the glory of his great Name.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the chief of the deep infinite counſels of God, and the works of his wiſdom, that have been <note place="margin">4.</note> from all eternity, have been, and are yet exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this eſpecially; namely, to bring mankinde to his eternal eſtate, and to communicate unto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, that glory that he hath appointed for them, that it might be in the moſt glorious way that can be: now if God have ſet his infinite wiſdom on work from all eternity about this; namely, what might be the moſt glorious way of communication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the riches of his goodneſs unto mankinde, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, when this comes to paſs, that God ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelf as much as he does intend, it muſt be infinitely glorious: certainly, there are great things, and glorious things to be communicated hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the power of God hath been already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, in ſubſerviency to other attributes of his, to <note place="margin">5.</note> make known his wiſdom, and his bounty, and his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral goodneſs; the power of God have been won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully manifeſted in the works of creation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: now certainly, the power of God is as well to be put forth in a way of ſubſerviency unto his grace and mercy; now if there be ſuch a time, as Gods infinite <hi>power</hi> is to be let out, and work unto that end, that it might be ſubſervient unto the infiniteneſs
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:57146:250"/>
of his mercy, then certainly there are glorious and great things to be revealed and made known.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, certainly there are glorious and great things <note place="margin">6.</note> for mankinde, in that God hath raiſed the nature of man unto ſuch a heighth, as he hath done in Chriſt; namely, to unite mans nature unto himſelf, unto the ſecond perſon of the Trinity, and that with the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt union that poſſibly can be; namely, an hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal union: certainly then God intends great things for the children of men, for <hi>that nature,</hi> that is one perſon with the <hi>Divine nature.</hi> This is ſuch a great work of God, as all other of the works of God are darkned in the honor of this great work.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, the great purchaſe that Jeſus Chriſt hath made, in that he hath been content to leave ſo much <note place="margin">7.</note> glory, certainly this was to purchaſe great glory; and in that he was content to be made a curſe for mans-ſin, and to ſhed his blood, and to give his life for man, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this was not onely to purchaſe outward comforts in the world, it was to purchaſe higher things; and therefore great muſt needs be the fruit of the purchaſe of the blood of Chriſt; and therefore great are the things that are to be revealed hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, there are in Scripture many glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which yet are not fulfilled, <hi>abundant rich and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">8.</note> 
                     <hi>glorious promiſes,</hi> that have infinite treaſures of good in them, there muſt be a time of fulfilling of them all, to the utmoſt extent of them: and therefore certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there are great things to be revealed hereafter. <hi>Thy word O Lord is ſetled for ever in Heaven,</hi> Pſal. 119. 89.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, the great things that God hath done for his <hi>enemies,</hi> is a demonſtration that there is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <note place="margin">9.</note>
                     <pb n="483" facs="tcp:57146:250"/>
condition for <hi>Gods people</hi> afterward, in that God hath filled their bellies with his hid treaſure: what treaſures hath God to fill the ſouls of his own people with, when as he does fill the bellies of the wicked, whom he does intend to caſt out as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed?</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, it appears there are great things for the people of God hereafter, becauſe of the great <hi>hopes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">10.</note> that are wrought in the hearts of Gods ſervants, by the power of the Holy Ghoſt. Now ſurely ſuch hopes as are wrought by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, they muſt attain unto glorious things: <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. <hi>Now the God of hope, fill you with all joy and peace in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> the hope of Gods people is that which is not onely wrought by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but by the <hi>power</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt; and ſuch an <hi>hope,</hi> as God is pleaſed to ſtile himſelf <hi>the God of this</hi> hope; and therefore certainly glorious things are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
                  <p>Another demonſtration is this, the very natures and <note place="margin">11.</note> excellency of grace, is to take off our hearts from theſe preſent things in the world, and from all the good that is here in the creature, God does give grace for this end; now then I reaſon thus: if the chief excellency of <hi>grace</hi> be to take the hearts of the Saints from the things of the world, and to ſettle them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on higher and better things, then certainly there are glorious things to come.</p>
                  <p>The laſt demonſtration is this, becauſe there are <note place="margin">12.</note> ſuch glorious <hi>firſt fruits</hi> of that which is to come, that Gods people do finde for the preſent; thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed rays of heavenly conſolations, and thoſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:57146:251"/>
of Heaven that they finde here: if there were a thouſand worlds filled with that glory that this is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with, they would not take it for one ray, one beam, that is made known unto them, as the firſt fruits of that glory they ſhall have hereafter: now put all theſe together, and we may conclude, <hi>Verily there is a reward for the righteous;</hi> verily there is a glorious condition for Gods ſervants; happy are they that ſhall be made partakers of theſe things, certainly there are great things to come.</p>
                  <p>Before we go any further, me thinks the thoughts of theſe ſhould raiſe our hearts: what do we here minding ſuch poor empty things? are theſe the things that God hath made us for? are not the thoughrs of God concerning the children of men, higher and more glorious then theſe outward things? ſurely there is ſomething elſe, that God hath made mans immortal ſoul for, above any thing that it hath ſeen in the world: men do live for the preſent, as if there were no other condition for them, no greater good, but onely to cat and drink, and have money, and brave cloathes, and the like: O know there are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things for us to look after! but thus we paſs from the firſt thing, <hi>that there are bleſſed things for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men</hi> hereafter.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XL. <hi>How far we may aym at the</hi> recompence of reward <hi>in what we do.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT is true, will ſome ſay, there are glorious things prepared for ſome of the children of men; but whether may we look after them? may we have a reſpect to the reward? Is not this a merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thing, and hypocriſie? we are not to ſerve God for reward, but for himſelf: and therefore how is this that <hi>Moſes</hi> had a reſpect unto the <hi>recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and how is this a thing that ſhould help us on in our way?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this is granted, that we are bound to ſerve the <note place="margin">1.</note> Lord, and to walk with him, and obey him; if there were no reward to be expected hereafter, God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely worthy of himſelf, of all our ſervices, of all that we are able to do in this world; and whatſoever we have, the Lord hath more intereſt in it, then we have in it our ſelves; and therefore we owe all that we are, or have, unto him, and righteouſneſs it ſelf is ſufficient to cauſe us to perform the works of it: <hi>In the keeping of thy Commandments there is great reward,</hi> Pſalm 19. 11. Not onely <hi>for keeping</hi> them, but <hi>in keeping them</hi> there is great reward, and the excellency of our work would be ſufficient reward for our work; though there were no reward that were to come hereafter, we are bound to do all we do.</p>
                  <p>But yet ſecondly, notwithſtanding this, God is <note place="margin">2.</note> pleaſed to give leave unto us his poor creatures, to help and encourage our ſelves in the expectation of
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:57146:252"/>
that reward that is to come; yea, to make it our aim (though I will not ſay <hi>the higheſt aim)</hi> for ſo the word ſignifies in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>While we look not at things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen;</hi> the word ſignifies, <hi>While we make things that</hi>

                     <hi>are</hi> not ſeen <hi>our ſcope and aym,</hi> ſo that God gives us leave to have ſuch reſpect unto them, as to make them our <hi>aym:</hi> and ſo the people of God have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>the recompence of reward,</hi> as a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them in their way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 112. <hi>I have enclined my heart to perform thy ſtatutes alway, even to the end:</hi> the ſame word that ſignifies <hi>end,</hi> ſignifies <hi>reward</hi> alſo, becauſe <hi>reward</hi> is to come at the <hi>end</hi> of all our works, and therefore the ſame word is tranſlated reward in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 11. and ſo the word ſeems to carry more, then to the <hi>end:</hi> as if <hi>David</hi> ſhould ſay, I have enclined my heart to perform thy Statutes alway, <hi>looking unto the reward.</hi> In <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 3. it is ſaid of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>That for the joy that was ſet before him, he endured the Croſs, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſhame:</hi> Now if Chriſt made uſe of the <hi>joy</hi> that was ſet <hi>before him,</hi> and that was a help to him to endure the Croſs, and deſpiſe the ſhame, much more may we make uſe of it, and it may be a help <hi>to us;</hi> ſo that we have leave to look at it.</p>
                  <p>Yea thirdly, we have not onely leave to look at it, <note place="margin">3.</note> but it is our duty to ſeek to help our ſelves <hi>in eying</hi> the reward; we ſin againſt God if we do it not: and the reaſon is, becauſe we are bound to make uſe of the word, in that way that God hath revealed it to us: now God hath revealed the glorious things of the recompence of the reward in a way of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; and therefore we ſin againſt God if we
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:57146:252"/>
do not encourage our ſelves in it. Some think, why ſhould we look at the reward, we muſt look to the rule, and ſee that our obedience be accordingly: but know, if you do not look to the reward, you do not only hinder your ſelves of the good you might have, but do ſin againſt God in it. Here you deceive your ſelves, as <hi>Ahaz</hi> did deceive himſelf in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 7. 11. where God bid him <hi>ask a ſign;</hi> he was modeſt, and baſhful, and would not ask a ſign, <hi>he would not tempt</hi> God, he would believe the Lord without a ſign, ſee how the Lord is angry: <hi>Is it a ſmall thing to weary man, but will you weary God alſo?</hi> When as the Lord in favor towards you will vouchſafe you a ſign, and you refuſe it, as if you had no need, <hi>why will you weary God?</hi> ſo as when God for the help of our weakneſs, will grant us an argument to help us in our way, and we think it is <hi>modeſty,</hi> or what you will to leave it, in this we ſin againſt the Lord our God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I never finde that the Scripture does accuſe any of Hypocriſie, of unſoundneſs, and not <note place="margin">4.</note> to have truth of grace meerly for this, becauſe that they did aym at the reward which is in Heaven, for that they did; you ſhall finde in Scripture many are diſcovered for <hi>hypocrites,</hi> for looking at the glory of the world as their aym, for ſeeking of <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>credit;</hi> but give me an inſtance where any is accuſed for unſoundneſs, for ſeeking of immortallity, and eternity, and happineſs; this is that which troubles many Chriſtians, that which they do is out of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, and they aym at themſelves; God did never diſcover any to be unſound upon this ground, and therefore we ſhould be cautious in accuſing our ſelves
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:57146:253"/>
of this, as many do, becauſe, for the preſent they cannot ſee how they go further then ſeeking of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though we cannot ſee how we do go further, yet it is an argument we do go further, if we get up to this. <hi>Paul</hi> made it a mighty work of grace in him, that he could have his heart taken off from all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things that <hi>are ſeen,</hi> and to look at eternal things that were <hi>not ſeen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, yet we ought to look at God, and to lift up <note place="margin">5.</note> God beyond our ſelves, or any thing that concerns our ſelves, and not to aym at God more then any worldly thing onely; but to aym at God more then at the glory of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But yet further, though we are to aym at God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <note place="margin">6.</note> our own good any way, yet it is the will of God that he would not have us to part with any of our ſpiritual good, no not for any glory to his own name: if you look at your reward in Heaven <hi>as ſpiritual,</hi> you may ſo far look at it, as not to be willing to part with it, for any glory that you conceive may come to God: by ſpiritual good, I mean grace. Now if it could be ſuppoſed that God ſhould have never ſo much glory by my abating the leaſt degree in grace, yet I am ſo bound to the work of grace, as I muſt not abate the leaſt degree for the higheſt glory that can come to God; yea, though it is true I am to deſire the glory of God, and that others ſhould glorifie God: yet I ſhould more deſire the furtherance of grace in my own ſoul, ſo as I ſhould not be willing to part with the leaſt degree of grace, though thereby all the world ſhould glorifie God.</p>
                  <p>But here lies one objection: <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to go <note place="margin">Object.</note>
                     <pb n="489" facs="tcp:57146:253"/>
otherwiſe; for <hi>he wiſhed himſelf accurſed, or anatha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized from Chriſt for his brethren, his kinſmen after the fleſh,</hi> ſo that it ſeems St. <hi>Paul</hi> did wiſh the glory of God in <hi>others,</hi> more then any grace in <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>

                  <p>To this I anſwer, That ſeparation from Chriſt we muſt underſtand rightly; we are not to underſtand by <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
                     <hi>ſeparation,</hi> that he ſhould be ſeparated from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and grace of Chriſt, but that he might be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from <hi>the comforts of Chriſt,</hi> that he might not have that comfort and that happineſs that comes in by Chriſt: If he had deſired to be ſeparated from the grace of Chriſt, he ſhould have ſinned in it; Gods glory and our good are ſo annexed together, that though we may ſuffer much for the good of others, yet we are not to deſire to be in any ſinful condition, though it could ſave all the world: If it could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, unleſs I ſin the leaſt ſin in thought, all the men of the world ſhould be damned, I ſhould ſuffer them all to be damned, rather then to ſin the leaſt ſin. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath a tractate about an <hi>offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious lye,</hi> to tell a lye for no hurt, but for good; ſays he, <hi>We are not to tell ſuch a lye, though it were to ſave all the world:</hi> Chriſt had rather all the world ſhould have been damned, then that he ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the leaſt ſin.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, whoſoever does underſtand what <note place="margin">7.</note> the true reward is that is in heaven, it is impoſſible, if he deſire heaven aright, but he muſt deſire the glory of God above himſelf: What is the heighth and top of heaven? it is not any carnal good, any carnal content that is the heighth and top of the glory of heaven? It is that our ſouls being
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:57146:254"/>
in the perfection of them, might live to the praiſe of God for ever: Now if this be the end of all, we ſhall receive from God in heaven that we might live for ever, to reflect the glory upon God again in our praiſe; then it is impoſſible to deſire heaven, but in our deſires of heaven, we do deſire God above our ſelves: Surely we may freely aym at our reward in heaven, for if we aym at our <hi>reward,</hi> and know it aright, it is ſuch as we cannot but aym at God above our ſelves; yea further, ſo near is Gods glory and <note place="margin">8.</note> our reward joyned together, that we cannot aym at God above our ſelves, but we ſhall by that means in the beſt maner provide for our ſelves; and the more we ſtrive to aym at God above our ſelves, we come in the beſt maner, that poſſibly can be, to provide for our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>And yet laſtly, there is a great difference between <note place="margin">9.</note> 
                     <hi>a gracious heart</hi> looking to the reward, and <hi>a carnal heart</hi> looking to the reward: As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the difference lies here, a gracious heart does <note place="margin">1. Difference between a gracious mans aim at the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and one that is carnal.</note> love the reward for <hi>the works ſake;</hi> a carnal heart does onely love the work for <hi>the rewards ſake:</hi> As a gracious heart loves heaven, and loves the glory of heaven; but it loves heaven, and the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the better, becauſe there is ſuch <hi>a bleſſed way to it.</hi> If a man were to go home, and had an ill way, he would love his home; but if he have a fair ſmooth way home, he loves his home the better for the <hi>ways ſake;</hi> therefore many men are at great coſt to have a fair going to their houſes: And ſo a gracious heart loves the way, that God does reveal to come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by, and loves heaven the better becauſe of the way: A carnal heart may love heaven, but he does
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:57146:254"/>
not love heaven the better for the way, but wiſhes the way to heaven were otherwiſe; he looks upon the way to heaven as a neceſſary burthen to him: As a man that is going out a journey, and muſt go through a dirty lane, he goes through it, but complaining; and ſo, though they deſire heaven, yet all the while they are complaining of the way: Certainly there is a great deal of difference between the deſires of heaven in a carnal heart, and the deſires of it in a gracious heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>eye</hi> that a gracious heaat hath to <note place="margin">2.</note> the recompence of reward, is another maner of eye then any <hi>carnal heart</hi> can have. What kinde of eye is it? Firſt, the eye that a gracious heart hath to the <note place="margin">1.</note> reward, it is <hi>a clear diſcerning eye;</hi> he does not take the things of heaven as gueſſes, and imaginary things, but looks upon them as certain ſubſtantial realties: For my own part, I much doubt whether any man in the world be able to ſee the glorious things in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as certain ſubſtantial things, that hath not the truth of grace: The truth of grace it is partly in this thing, in having that principle in the ſoul, that makes the ſoul able to look at the things of heaven as the onely <hi>real, ſubſtantial, excellent</hi> things, ſo as to darken all the glory of the things of the world; ſo that when you come thus far, whereas before you heard ſomething of heaven, and they were but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary things; and now there is ſuch a light ſet up in your ſouls, as you ſee the things of heaven as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly real, ſubſtantial, glorious things; certainly there is the work of grace: The ground of it is that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> ſo that the work of faith <hi>is there ſeen:</hi> Whoſoever
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:57146:255"/>
ſpeaks of the reward that is in heaven, if the glory of the world be not darkned in their eyes, it argues there is no true ſaving faith.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond difference is, a gracious heart looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">2.</note> the reward by ſome <hi>experimental ſweet,</hi> and good that he findes in himſelf, as the beginning of that eternal good he expects; whereas others look upon the reward as a thing onely to come unto them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: He reads in the word, and hears Preachers ſay ſo, and ſo he can ſpeak of them, but it is not from any experimental ſweetneſs that he findes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of eternal life <hi>wrought in him:</hi> That place is very remarkable for this, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. <hi>Knowing in your ſelves that ye have in heaven a better and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during ſubſtance:</hi> Other men may know in <hi>others,</hi> in <hi>books,</hi> that there is a reward; but a gracious heart knows in <hi>himſelf,</hi> by that experimental ſweetneſs of the <hi>beginning</hi> of eternal life that he findes in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>A third difference is, The eye that a gracious heart <note place="margin">3.</note> hath unto the recompence of reward, is a <hi>fixed eye,</hi> a ſetled conſtant eye: Another man that is an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may have a <hi>flaſh</hi> of lightning, even from heaven it ſelf, that may diſcover ſomething unto him of the glorious condition of the people of God; as <hi>Balaam, Let me dye the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his:</hi> This was more then natural, I may call it a ſupernatural work that was upon <hi>Balaam,</hi> yet not ſaving and gracious: It appeared not to be ſaving, becauſe it had not a ſaving power went with it, and it was not conſtant; and ſo many hypocrites that are unfound, when they have enlargement in <hi>prayer,</hi> they may have ſome flaſhes of lightning let into their hearts, they may have ſome glimmerings of the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:57146:255"/>
glorious things of heaven; and as the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 5. they may have <hi>a taſte of the powers of the world to come;</hi> but a gracious heart hath it not as a flaſh of lightning, but as <hi>a conſtant light</hi> that is ſet up in his ſoul, and as that light which does tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his ſpirit into light, and makes him to be a childe of light.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there is a great deal of difference in this, <note place="margin">4.</note> the eye that a gracious heart hath is truly <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> the other is but <hi>carnal.</hi> A ſpiritual eye, what is that? that is, he looks at the reward as a <hi>ſpiritual thing,</hi> a carnal heart looks at it <hi>carnally:</hi> O the flaſhes of joy to have a crown and a kingdom! but a ſpiritual heart looks at the reward ſpiritually; time is coming when I ſhall be wholly free from the body of ſin and death; time is coming, when as the image of God ſhall be made perfect in my ſoul; time is coming, when I ſhall behold the bleſſed face of God, and live to the praiſe of that bleſſed God, without any intermiſſion, joyning with thoſe bleſſed creatures that are eternally bleſſing God: Now the heart that looks at it thus ſpiritually, and looks at the top of it to be a ſpiritual good; ſuch an one ſees the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward after another maner then any carnal heart doth.</p>
                  <p>The laſt difference is, the eye of the gracious heart is a <hi>believing eye,</hi> ſuch an eye, as he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">5.</note> the glorious and bleſſed things of heaven, as the things that his ſoul hath an intereſt in, as the things wherein his riches and happineſs does conſiſt; another may look upon them as glorious things that may be deſired; but for an eye to be fixed upon the promiſe, ſo as to be content to venture all upon
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:57146:256"/>
the bare word of God for ſuch great things, ſo as to count his riches to conſiſt in theſe things that he hath but a bare word for; ſuch a believing eye as this is not the eye of a carnal heart.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, take all the beauty, excellency, the ſweet and <note place="margin">1.</note> good that there is in all the world; if there could be a confluence and extract of the quinteſſence of all good, in all creature in this world, and all to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to one man, yet it were but as a dark ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the glory that is to be revealed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this reward, certainly it is that which is <note place="margin">2.</note>
                     <pb n="495" facs="tcp:57146:256"/>
beyond all the expreſſion that we have in Scripture of it: Great things are ſpoken in the word, but there is more to be revealed and to be enjoyed, then is yet revealed in all the Book of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 4. <hi>For ſince the beginning of the world, men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye ſeen, O God, beſides thee, what he hath prepared for him that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for him.</hi> And therefore in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 10. it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe:</hi> Now the cauſe of admiration, it is the ſight of ſomething more then was known before, that was not thought of, and was not underſtood; even <hi>then</hi> at the <hi>firſt coming</hi> of Chriſt, he ſhall appear in ſo much glory, as he ſhall be <hi>admired;</hi> as if the Saints ſhould ſay, We heard much concerning Chriſt and his glory, but we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought that there was ſo much glory in Jeſus Chriſt, as now we finde; and therefore we ſtand ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring at the glory of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all thoſe conſolations, thoſe admirable <note place="margin">3.</note> ſoul-raviſhing comforts that the Saints of God have ever had in this world, have all been but the firſt fruits of thoſe glorious things that are hereafter to to be revealed, they are but as the <hi>Cluſters of grapes</hi> that that bleſſed Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> is ſo full of.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, then all the expreſſions that man can give of thoſe things that are to be hereafter, muſt <note place="margin">4.</note> needs be but dark reſemblances of what ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed hereafter: As the infant in the womb knows not what the light, the glory and beauty of the world is; ſo we, while we are in this darkneſs, know little of the beauty and glory of heaven.

                     <hi>great furnace: Thoſe good things of eternal life are ſo many, that they exceed number; ſo great, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed meaſure; ſo precious, that they are above all eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Auguſtine</hi> in one of his Epiſtles hath this relation, That the very ſame day wherein <hi>Jerome</hi> dyed, he was in his ſtudy, and had got pen, ink and paper to write ſomething of the glory of heaven to <hi>Jerome,</hi> ſuddenly he ſaw a light breaking into his ſtudy, and a ſweet ſwell that came unto him, and this voyce he thought he heard, <hi>O Auguſtine, what doeſt thou? doeſt think to put the ſea into a little veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel?</hi> when the heavens ſhall ceaſe from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual motion, then ſhalt thou be able to underſtand what the glory of heaven is, and not before, except you come to feel it as I now do, this therefore is beyond the expreſſion of man.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, all the deſires of all the ſouls of Gods <note place="margin">5.</note> Saints in the world, they come infinitely ſhort of that which ſhall be hereafter. We are ſtraightned here in our ſpirits, in our deſires; if we could enlarge our deſires in a ſpiritual way, it would hereafter adde much to our glory; our deſires are not onely ſtraighter then that we ſhall have, but the ſtraightneſs of our deſires here hinders much the capacity of the good that hereafter is to be revealed and communicated; and therefore Chriſtians ſhould labor in a ſpiritual way to enlarge their deſires to the utmoſt, to get their hearts to be working after great things here, ſo that they may by them engreaten their hearts, and extend their hearts, to prepare them for the great things that are to be revealed. I may ſay concerning
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:57146:257"/>
our <hi>ſtraight deſires,</hi> as the Prophet did to <hi>Joaſh,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 18, 19. where the Prophet bade him <hi>ſtrike upon the earth,</hi> and he ſtruck thrice; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was angry, and ſaid, <hi>You ſhould have ſtruck five or ſix times, and ſo often ſhouldſt thou have ſmitten thy enemies:</hi> So according to the truth and ſpiritual working of our deſires <hi>here,</hi> ſhall we be made capable of glory <hi>hereafter;</hi> but now if we be ſtraightened in our hearts, and we deſire to be in heaven, and to have ſome good thing there, but our hearts are not after great things, not enlarged in our deſires, it will be in ſome meaſure, in ſome proportion according to our deſires, and therefore it is an evil thing for Chriſtians to have their deſires ſtraightned here. There are glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things to be had in God, and therefore our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſhould be more enlarged then they are. It is an excellent expreſſion of <hi>Baſil,</hi>

                  <p>Again, they are <hi>beyond</hi> all our <hi>hopes:</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, He believed above hope;</hi> we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve above hope in this ſenſe, that is above the great things that are hoped for, and yet God loves to have his people raiſe their hopes high. <note place="margin">6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea laſtly, it is beyond all <hi>imagination;</hi> if men and Angels ſhould ſet themſelves to imagine what <note place="margin">7.</note> they would have, they would think if ſuch and ſuch things were, <hi>that</hi> would be a glorious condition, this <hi>reward</hi> ſhall be beyond imagination; we may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that which we could not almoſt deſire, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you can invent or imagine, you ſhall have that
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:57146:258"/>
happineſs, or that which is beyond it: ſometime we think, what a ſweet thing will it be in Heaven to meet our <hi>Father,</hi> our <hi>Mother,</hi> our <hi>Brother</hi> or <hi>Siſter,</hi> our <hi>Husband</hi> or <hi>Wife?</hi> theſe relations ſhall ceaſe there; but we may conclude, though we have not that there, we ſhall have that which ſhall be better, and that which we would rather chuſe.</p>
                  <p>But then if it be thus, that all the world be but a dark <hi>ſhadow,</hi> if that which is revealed in the word be but a <hi>glimpſe,</hi> if all the comforts of the Saints here be but the <hi>firſt-fruits,</hi> if all the expreſſions of men come <hi>beneath,</hi> if all our <hi>deſires</hi> come ſhort, if all our hopes reach not to it, if all be above the <hi>imagination</hi> of men and Angels, what is it then? what is that which is thus great? we can tell you ſomewhat of this recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward <hi>negatively,</hi> and ſomewhat <hi>compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> but very little of it <hi>poſitively;</hi> yet ſomewhat that way too.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>negatively:</hi> There ſhall be no evil, there <note place="margin">1.</note> ſhall be ſuch an eſtate of Gods people, wherein <note place="margin">What the <hi>recompence of reward</hi> is.</note> they ſhall be <hi>fully, abſolutely, everlaſtingly</hi> free from all kinde of evil; in this world evil ſticks to every Chriſtian, but there they ſhall be in an eſtate beyond all evil. When the Sun is got to the heighth, there is no ſhadow; ſo when Gods people come to the top of their bleſſedneſs, there ſhall be no ſhadow of any evil at all: that God that is infinite in good, certainly will not ſuffer evil to be always in his people: Freed from all evil of <hi>ſin,</hi> and that is the greateſt evil of all; never troubled with any hard heart any more, never peſtered with an unbelieving ſtraightned heart any more, never dull and heavy in Gods ſervice any more; there ſhall never be
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:57146:258"/>
any more blindeneſs and ignorances, any uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, any miſtake, any wearineſs in Gods ſervice, delivered wholly from ſin; yea, delivered not onely from the ſin that we have, but from the very ſavor of ſin, and from all the remainders of ſin: A man may be delivered out of priſon, but he may ſmell of the priſon; men may be healed of a wound, and yet have a ſcar remain; ſo it is with Gods people here, they are delivered from the guilt and power of their ſin, but they ſmell of their priſon garments, and there are ſome ſcars upon them, but all the ſmells and ſcars of our ſin ſhall be taken from us; yea, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the very poſſibility of ſin: To be in an eſtate without ſin, is a bleſſed eſtate, but to be in an eſtate wherein there ſhall be no poſſibility to ſin, that is a bleſſed condition indeed: It is a kinde of miſery that a godly man counts himſelf to be in, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he <hi>does</hi> ſin, but that he <hi>may</hi> ſin, that he hath a poſſibility to ſin; but to be free from that, that is a bleſſed condition: And this is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God himſelf, that there is no poſſibility that he ſhould do any thing in the leaſt degree to ſin.</p>
                  <p>And as they are delivered from <hi>ſin,</hi> ſo from <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> for that is the immediate conſequent of ſin: <hi>All tears ſhall be wiped from their eyes.</hi> And as from moral evil, ſo from natural evil; from external and internal evil, from all weakneſs of parts, and from all pains, and ſickneſs, and deformities, from all labors, all incumbrances here in the world; freed from the company, and madneſs, and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tyranny, and injuſtice of wicked men; they ſhall be above <hi>Satan,</hi> and above the <hi>men</hi> of

the world. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. It is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt hath given himſelf to deliver us from this preſent evil world;</hi> it is a part of the purchaſe of Chriſt, to be wholly freed from all the evils of this preſent world; and this purchaſe of Chriſt we ſhall have. Under the higheſt regions are the tempeſts and ſtorms, but above there are none; ſo in this world the Saints meet with tempeſts and ſtorms, but above are none. As the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, <hi>In thy light O God we ſhall ſee light:</hi> ſo in the light of God we ſhall ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but light: now when Gods light does ſhine into us, it does diſcover darkneſs; but time will come, though Gods light ſhall ſhine never ſo brightly, we ſhall ſee no darkneſs, but altogether light. We read concerning <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 9. in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration of Chriſt, the Text ſays, They did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer about his deceaſe that ſhould be accompliſhed at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> the Saints of God ſhall meet together, and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and ſhall confer no more about deceaſes, about troubles and ſufferings that ſhall be accompliſhed; all thoſe evils ſhall be done away. We may ſay of evils all, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning the <hi>Egyptians, Thoſe your enemies that now you ſee, you ſhall never ſee any more:</hi> So we may ſay to Gods people that go out of the world to partake of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward; be quiet, be ſtill: thoſe evils of <hi>ſin,</hi> of <hi>ſorrow</hi> that now you ſee, and feel, you ſhall never ſee, never feel any more; that is ſomething though it be <hi>negatively.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, comparatively, and herein are three <note place="margin">2.</note> things. Firſt, to compare the good, the happineſs that ſhall be hereafter, with all the good and happineſs
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:57146:259"/>
that we have here. Secondly, compare it with the condition of <hi>Adam</hi> in the eſtate of innocency. Thirdly, compare it with the happineſs <hi>of the Angels.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. XLII. <hi>The differences between that good we receive</hi> here <hi>from God, and that we ſhall have</hi> hereafter.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt, we will compare that we have <hi>here,</hi> with that we ſhall have <hi>hereafter:</hi> Brethren, though <note place="margin">1.</note> we receive many mercies from God, yet look what difference there is between that cloſe place of the womb, that the infant is in before it be born, and this ſpace of the world that the childe comes into when it is born; ſuch difference is between all this world, and any good and happineſs here, and the world that is to come; this, and much more then this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, here we receive good from <hi>without:</hi> Firſt <note place="margin">1.</note> unto our outward ſenſes, and by them it comes into the <hi>ſoul;</hi> but now hereafter God ſhall firſt let out good unto the ſoul, unto the rational part, and from the redundancy of that good and glory that God ſhall communicate unto the rational ſoul, there ſhall flow glory, and ſweetneſs, and good to the body, and outward ſenſes: whereas here we ſee from without, and ſo it comes in; there ſhall be a ſpring, and a fountain of good within the ſoul; the kingdom of heaven ſhall be within, and more good ſhall be in the heart, and flow from
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:57146:260"/>
thence outwardly, then to be received from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and ſo to come inwardly; for us to receive ſomething in our ſences, and ſo to convey it to the ſoul, this is but a low way; but to have a ſpring and fountain of all good and happineſs to be within the ſoul, and ſo ſpread it ſelf and flow out, this ſhews wonderfully the bleſſedneſs of Gods people, when God ſhall communicate himſelf to them in that way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here the excellency and eminency of an <note place="margin">2.</note> object does deſtroy the faculty, if the faculties of our ſouls be exerciſed about objects, that are very high above us, that are full of excellency and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they deſtroyed the faculty; as now though <hi>light</hi> be the moſt pleaſing to the eye of all things in the world, yet the excellency and glory of light de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the <hi>eye;</hi> ſo <hi>ſound</hi> is the proper object of the <hi>ear,</hi> but if the ſound be too great, it makes one deaf, but it is otherwiſe in heaven, the more excellent the object is, the more perfect will the faculty be; the object ſhall not onely delight the faculty, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſtrengthen the faculty.
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:57146:260"/>
nature as in a glaſs, but thus far, that as we ſee good in the creature now, then we ſhall ſee them by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God himſelf, more then by knowing the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And the reaſon is, becauſe all excellency and good that is in the creature is eminently in God; for all the good of the effects muſt needs be eminently in all the principles, and the good of all principles in the firſt principle: If all good in the creature be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in God, and the ſouls of the bleſſed ſhall come perfectly to know God, ſo far as their created un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings ſhall be capable of, then they muſt needs ſee the excellency of the creature in God. <hi>We ſhall know as we are known,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. Upon this a <hi>learned man</hi> hath this note, <hi>We ſhall know as we are known;</hi> now God knows all his works, <hi>by knowing himſelf,</hi> by knowing <hi>his own power, and will, and nature,</hi> and ſo we ſhall know as we are known, <hi>becauſe we ſhall know the creatures by knowing God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, here the mercies and good that we have from God are ſweetned unto us by the ſenſe of our <hi>wants:</hi> But hereafter we ſhall prize them, and have the ſweetneſs of them in regard of their own ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: not from ſuch a low relation, as our <hi>wants</hi> and our neceſſities; when God would have us prize any mercy <hi>here,</hi> he firſt makes us ſenſible of the want of the mercy, and ſo it comes to be ſweet to us, and ſcarce any mercy comes to be ſweet, unleſs we feel the want of it <hi>firſt,</hi> for elſe we would prize the mercy <hi>at any time,</hi> but in that we do not prize all mercies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways alike, it appears the great commendation of Gods mercy is from our wants: but hereafter the prizings, and the reliſh, and the ſweet of all ſhall be from the fulneſs of the goodneſs that we finde
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:57146:261"/>
in God: Gods goodneſs to us here, is but the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of ſome defect, but hereafter Gods goodneſs ſhall be the glorifying of perfect nature.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, here when we do enjoy any comfort from God, we are much ſenſible of it at the preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, <note place="margin">5.</note> but after we have had it a little while, we grow to be leſs ſenſible, we begin to be cloyed with it: as the moſt beautiful <hi>ſight</hi> that we did admire at firſt, if we ſee it every day, it does not affect us; as who is affected at the ſight of the <hi>Sun,</hi> becauſe he ſees it every day? but ſuppoſe we had lived all our days in a dark dungeon, and this had been the firſt day we were brought out of the dungeon, and now ſee the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the <hi>Earths</hi> and <hi>Seas,</hi> how mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would we be taken with the ſights that we ſee? but now it is not ſo with us, becauſe we have the Sun every day: and ſo the melodious ſound to the <hi>ear,</hi> firſt we are raviſhed with it, but when we are uſed to it, it is nothing: and ſo for the <hi>taſte;</hi> the taſte of ſweet things is mightily pleaſant to us at firſt, but afterward it is no more pleaſing to us, then the taſte of ordinary mean fare is to poor people, who have as much content in their <hi>mean fare,</hi> as rich men in their <hi>delicious fare,</hi> becauſe rich men are uſed to ſuch delicious things; but this is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Gods maner of communication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his people hereafter, they ſhall be to all eternity as exactly and fully ſenſible of the glory of heaven, as they were in the firſt moment they came into it.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth difference between Gods communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">6.</note> of himſelf to us here and hereafter, is, here we have much good from God, but much good is in the <hi>habits,</hi>
                     <pb n="505" facs="tcp:57146:261"/>
and is not always in <hi>action:</hi> there are many habits of grace, that are <hi>not</hi> always acting <hi>fully,</hi> but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the act of one habit is called forth, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the act of another; but here is the bleſſedneſs of Gods people, there ſhall be no habits lying ſtill no inſtant, but every minute to all eternity, they ſhall act to the utmoſt of them, ſo far as may any way conduce to their happineſs; for the end of the <hi>habit</hi> it is <hi>action,</hi> and in the enjoyment of our happineſs we ſhall ever be enjoying to the full the higheſt and laſt ends; and therefore there ſhall always be the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt activity of the habits of grace: There is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity here of ceſſation of actions, becauſe we grow weary quickly of any action, though it be a gracious action, we muſt unſtring our bows and ceaſe, that ſome actions may give way to others, for the heart to be always up, it is not able to bear it, but then there ſhall be no need of any ceſſation any moment.</p>
                  <p>Again, here we are not able to exerciſe our ſelves in the works of God without ſome <hi>difficulty:</hi> there is <note place="margin">7.</note> difficulty in raiſing our hearts unto any thing that is good, and to keep our hearts up; but hereafter there ſhall be that communication of God unto his people, that they ſhall be exerciſed about the higheſt things, in the higheſt maner, without any difficulty, but as freely, and readily, and fully as the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhines: the Sun does ſhine without any difficulty, and the fiſh draws in water without difficulty; ſo there ſhall be that perfect working of the ſoul about the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt object, without any difficulty or labor.</p>
                  <p>Again, here in this world there cannot be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in one faculty, but it does hinder the intention <note place="margin">8.</note> in another; as if man ſpeak to me, and I be intent
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:57146:262"/>
in looking upon an object, I do not hear him that ſpeaketh: and ſo in all faculties, the intention of one faculty does hinder the intention of another; but in Heaven, all the faculties of the ſoul ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſ'd to the higheſt intention, and the intention of the one ſhall not hinder the intention of the other.</p>
                  <p>Again, the good we receive here is in the <hi>root,</hi> in <note place="margin">9.</note> the promiſe, in election in great part, but that we ſhall have hereafter ſhall be in the <hi>fruit,</hi> in the actual communication of God: as before all our actings ſhall be acted upon God, ſo all the good ſhall not be contained in the root of his electing love, or in the promiſe; but ſhall be in actual communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>Again, here we receive many mercies from God, <note place="margin">10.</note> that we do not underſtand our ſelves, that we know but little of, we do not ſee into the large extent of the mercy that we have from God: but there we ſhall have no mercy from God but we ſhall know it fully, in all the circumſtances of it, in all the principles of it, and in all the appertainances that do any way concern the mercy we have, and we ſhall know the iſſue of it, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Again, here we receive great mercies from God, and we know not how to manage them; Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies <note place="margin">11.</note> lie and ſowre in us, we turn our mercies many times into afflictions for want of skill: but hereafter we ſhall have the full improvement of all mercy that we receive from God.</p>
                  <p>Again, here we ſee and deſire many good things <note place="margin">12.</note> that we do not enjoy and poſſeſs; but hereafter we ſhall ſee no good, nor deſire any good, nor will any good, but we ſhall have it: And as God
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:57146:262"/>
ſaid concerning the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> unto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 24. <hi>Every place whereon the ſoles of your feet ſhall tread, ſhall be yours;</hi> ſo in heaven, whatſoever the Saints ſee they ſhall have: Here we may will a thing, and will it lawfully, and yet it may be croſs unto Gods ſecret will, and it ſhall never come to paſs; the reaſon is, becauſe the rule of our wills is Gods Commandment, and not his <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret will;</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did will to build God a houſe, and God commends him for it, and yet God did not will it: And a childe may will the life of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and yet God may will his parent ſhall not live, and yet he is not to be blamed, becauſe he wills ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule; but hereafter God ſhall ſo far reveal his will to us, and our wills ſhall be ſo fully united to God, that there ſhall not be the leaſt croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing between any thing that we will, and that God wills.</p>
                  <p>Again, here it is one eſpecial excellency of the <note place="margin">13.</note> work of grace, for us to keep in our hearts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to reſtrain them that they be not let out too far in that we do enjoy: but hereafter when we come to the recompence of reward, we ſhall not need keep in our hearts, we ſhall have liberty to let them out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But we may not let out our hearts too much upon the Saints, to love them above God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ. Then</hi> we ſhall love nothing but <hi>in God,</hi> all ſhall be ſwallowed up in God himſelf, that we ſhal not need fear the letting out of our hearts to the utmoſt: Though I may love the creature, yet I may let out my heart fully upon it, becauſe I love it onely in God.</p>
                  <p>Here many times a thing is more prized before we
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:57146:263"/>
have it, and when we come to enjoy it, we do not ſee ſo much excellency upon it, and ſo do leſs prize it; but though we may ſet a prize upon Heaven, and ſay, O the bleſſed time, when we come there, we ſhall infinitely more prize it and rejoyce in it then we can here.</p>
                  <p>Yet further, here we can enjoy nothing that we <note place="margin">15.</note> can be ſo certain of, but that we can loſe it wholly, or in ſome part; but the Saints of God hereafter ſhall be ſo certain of that they have in enjoyment, that they ſhall not loſe any thing of it in the leaſt degree.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, that we have from God here, is <hi>mediately</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">16.</note> conveyed through many Channels, through the Pipes of <hi>Creatures</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> but that we ſhall have hereafter, ſhall be let out immediately from God; and this is indeed the ſpecial difference of all, from whence flow many excellent conſequences, which would even require a particular of it ſelf: I may hereafter enlarge my ſelf in this, in ſome other Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>And thus you may ſee the bleſſed condition of Gods people, when they come to <hi>the recompence of reward.</hi> We have ſomething here, and we rejoyce in it, and bleſs God for it; but thoſe ways that God hath to communicate himſelf to his people hereafter, are glorious ways. O that our hearts were raiſed to look after that communication of God that we ſhall have hereafter! O thoſe baſe and droſſie ſpirits that we have! Becauſe we receive ſome goodneſs of God here, we are ready to be quieted here, and reſt here, as if God had nothing to communicate to the Children of men, but that we have here. See the
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:57146:263"/>
vileneſs of our hearts, we are here ready to reſt upon the loweſt things that God communicates, and do not ſo much as riſe in our hearts to the higheſt things that are communicated here; but a chriſtian heart ſhould riſe higher then the moſt excellent things that are here in the world; namely, to the moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed things that are hereafter; let us ſhew our ſelves that we are men of hopes to enjoy God after another maner then here.</p>
                  <p>Many do not deſire enjoyment of God; let them have the creature, they never think of any communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of God ſo much as through the creature, whereas a true Chriſtian that hath grace, he receives nothing in the world, but he thinks with himſelf, <hi>how have I God here?</hi> how does God communicate himſelf to me in meat and drink, and cloathes, and friends, and the like? it is well if you go thus far, but you muſt go higher; are there not choyce mercies? O yes, there are bleſſed things communicated through the ordinances, through prayer, and the word, and ſacraments, there are bleſſed things; few mens hearts look ſo high as to look to the communication of Gods choyce mercies in this world; but a gracious heart riſes higher, &amp; does as it were bathe it ſelf with thoſe refreſhments that are to come: through Gods mercy I have the creature, and the communication of God through that; and I have the <hi>ordinances,</hi> and Gods choyce mercies communicated through them; but there are glorious things to be communicated hereafter, and thoſe my ſoul rejoyces in. Now God does communicate himſelf onely in that way which is ſuitable to our condition; now we are but narrow veſſels, and have but narrow mouthes, and are not
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:57146:264"/>
capable of that greatneſs of Gods communication; but time will come when as God will communicate himſelf in a more glorious maner, and in that I bleſs my ſelf; and therefore I will not regard any of Gods communication of himſelf to me here, but in order unto that glorious communication of God to me hereafter. And thus we have ſeen ſomething of the recompence of reward, comparing it with what we have here. Now ſecondly, we are to compare it with the condition of <hi>Adam</hi> in the eſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
                  <p>As for the eſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, it was a <note place="margin">2.</note> bleſſed condition, yet far under the happineſs of the Saints in the <hi>recompence of the reward.</hi> For <hi>Adams</hi> body was but natural, and his Paradiſe was but a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Paradiſe; and a poſſibility there was he might loſe his happineſs: and if he ſhould have ſtood, there ſhould not have been that glorious diſtinct working of the three Perſons of the Trinity about mans happineſs, that there now is: and therein eſpecially lies the difference.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, compare it with the <hi>Angels,</hi> and you ſhall <note place="margin">3.</note> finde in Scripture ſome expreſſions of the happineſs of the Saints, beyond the happineſs of the bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelves. For the union that the Saints ſhall have with the <hi>Deity,</hi> is a nearer union in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, then the union that the Angels have with the Deity: and the righteouſneſs wherewith the Saints ſtand righteous before the Lord, is an higher righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, then <hi>Adam</hi> or the Angels ſhould have been in.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the union that the Saints have with the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <note place="margin">1.</note> is a nearer union then that of the Angels. Firſt,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:57146:264"/>
the humane nature in general, that is advanced to an higher dignity then all the glory of the Angels put together: Becauſe there is an Hypoſtatical union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the humane Nature and the Divine in Chriſt. Again, we have many expreſſions in Scripture of the union of Saints with the Deity; whereby it appears, their union is nearer then the union of the Angels: They are called the <hi>friends of Chriſt;</hi> They are ſaid to have <hi>fellowſhip with Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. They are the <hi>Brethren</hi> of Chriſt, They are <hi>Co-heirs</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt; There are no ſuch expreſſions of the Angels. And yet, there are nearer expreſſions of their union; they are the <hi>Spouſe</hi> of Chriſt, the Bride; the Angels are but as the <hi>ſervants.</hi> They are the <hi>members</hi> of Chriſt, and are made one with Chriſt: They are thoſe that are to be <hi>one with the Father,</hi> as the Father and the Son are one: <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 21. Chriſt there prays, <hi>As thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us:</hi> he never prayed ſo for the Angels. Laſtly, they are ſaid to be <hi>loved</hi> of the Father, with the very ſame love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he loved the Son: now though God loves the Angels, yet it is not ſaid that he loved them with the <hi>ſame</hi> love that he loved his Son: Theſe are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions we finde in Scripture, concerning the near union that the Saints have with the Deity in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects beyond the Angels; but of the union of the Saints with the Deity, we ſhall ſpeak of more when we come to ſpeak of the reward poſitively. And then the righteouſneſs wherewith they ſtand righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, is greater then the righteouſneſs of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, or the Angels; becauſe it is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity; and that
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:57146:265"/>
is of an higher nature, and a more glorious righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, then the righteouſneſs of any meer creature. Now the righteouſneſs of the Angels, though it be perfect in its kinde, yet it is not a righteouſneſs of ſuch an high nature, as that righteouſneſs which is the Son of God. And thus of this recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comparatively.</p>

                  <p>NOw thirdly, let us conſider it poſitively; now in this poſitive conſideration, theſe things are to be followed: Firſt, the perfection of their natures that they ſhall be raiſed to: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the glory that ſhall be put upon them at the day of Judgement: Thirdly, the poſſeſſion of Heaven: Fourthly, the having God to be their Portion: Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their bleſſed communion with Jeſus Chriſt: Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their communion with the Saints and Angels: Laſtly, the eternal Sabbath that they are to keep in Heaven. Under theſe ſeven heads, all that we have to ſay concerning the poſitive reward of the Saints, may be contained; Firſt, the perfection that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhall be raiſed unto; and in that conſider theſe three things: Firſt, the perfection of their <hi>bodies:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the perfection of their <hi>ſouls:</hi> Thirdly, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the <hi>whole man.</hi> Firſt, the perfection of the bodies of the Saints is no little matter; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo long as we are in the fleſh and live by ſenſe,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:57146:265"/>
they are bodily things that do affect us; therefore I will ſhew a little the perfection of the bodies of the Saints: they ſhall have much of <hi>the recompence of the reward</hi> in their bodies. In the general, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <hi>ſhall be made like the glorious body of Jeſus Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3. 21. Certainly the body of Chriſt is very glorious; in the transfiguration of Chriſt, which was but a little glimpſe of his glory, how glorious was the body of Chriſt? In <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. Saint <hi>John</hi> had a little glimpſe of the repreſentation of Chriſt, and how glorious is it ſet forth? the body of the meaneſt Saint ſhall be like the glorious body of Chriſt: What is that? I will go no further then that I finde in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42, 43, 44. and there are four things that ſet forth the glory of the bodies of the Saints, when they come to attain the recompence of reward: Firſt, it is raiſed <hi>in incorruption:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is raiſed <hi>in glory:</hi> Thirdly, it is raiſed <hi>in power:</hi> Fourthly, it is raiſed a <hi>ſpiritual body.</hi> Firſt, every Saint of God ſhall have an <hi>incorruptible body,</hi> there ſhall be no more death: it ſhall be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible in regard of that fulneſs of the preſence of God with it: If ſpices, &amp; enbalming of dead bodies can keep them ſo long as they do ſometime from ſmelling; ſurely the glorious preſence of God with the body, ſhall have infinite more power to keep the bodies of the Saints incorruptible. What would we give if a Phyſitian were able to give us a potion to make our bodies incorruptible, that they ſhould never dye? yet as they are now, it is hardly worth the deſiring to have them incorruptible; but when they ſhall be glorified, and incorruptible too, that is glorious. They ſhall be incorruptible, not ſubject

to any ſuffering: as God is able to binde up the active power of a creature that it ſhall not be able to act, ſo he can binde up the corruptible power, that it ſhall not work to corruption: as in fire God can binde up the power of fire, that it cannot burn; ſo God can binde up the power of any creature that hath any corruptible power, that there ſhould not be the leaſt paſſion that tends to corruption. <note n="*" place="margin">

be in the bodies of the Saints; if we could extract all the beauty of all the men and women in the world, and put them into one, it were but as a deformed thing in regard of the meaneſt of the bodies of the Saints in Heaven; and much of the beauty will be not onely from their exact temper and comelineſs that God ſhall put upon them; but likewiſe from the excellency of their ſouls within them, and from the unſpeakable joy, and cheerfulneſs of the heart; And then the <hi>ſplendor</hi> and the luſtre of their <hi>bodies,</hi> ſays <note place="margin">2.</note> the Scripture, <hi>They ſhall ſhine as the ſtars in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament:</hi> look what ſplendor is in the ſtars, ſuch ſhall be in theſe clay bodies of ours, <hi>Daniel</hi> 12. 3. Yea, they ſhall be in greater ſplendor then the ſtars, they ſhall be as the Sun, <hi>Matthew</hi> 13. 43. <hi>He that hath ears to hear let him hear,</hi> and believe this, that it ſhall be ſo, that the bodies of the Saints ſhall ſhine more glorious then the Sun in its ſtrength. You will ſay, How is it poſſible that this ſhould be? yes, this is but according to that expreſſion in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Who ſhall change our vile bodies, that it may be faſhioned according to his glorious body, according to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereby he is able to ſubdue all things unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> It does not require a greater power to raiſe from the leaſt degree of glory to the higheſt poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as it is to make a thing out of nothing; and therefore the making of the leaſt creature out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, will argue more power, then making the bodies of the Saints to ſhine brighter then <hi>the Sun in the Firmament.</hi> Now certainly, God in the glorifying of the Saints, will manifeſt that power that he did in the creating of the world; and if it does not require ſo much power to raiſe their bodies into ſuch a glorious
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:57146:267"/>
condition, as to create a creature out of nothing; then there is no reaſon why we ſhould not believe this. We know when <hi>Moſes</hi> had been but forty days on the Mount with God, when he came down among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> his face <hi>did ſo ſhine,</hi> that <hi>they were not able to behold it:</hi> ſurely the glorified bodies of the Saints, being eternally preſent with God, ſhall ſhine far more gloriouſly then <hi>Moſes</hi> face did: and that is for the ſplendor of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is ſown in weakneſs, and raiſed in power: now the ſtrength and power of them appears in theſe <note place="margin">3.</note> four things: Firſt, in that the body ſhall be able for to attend the ſoul in the moſt high operations; <note place="margin">1.</note> here if the ſoul be exerciſed about any high and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious object, the body preſently fails: as in the extaſies of the Prophet, when God revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf extraordinarily to <hi>Daniel,</hi> his body failed; <hi>He fainted, and was many days ſick, Dan.</hi> 8. 27. But there ſhall be that power in the body, as it ſhall be ſerviceable to the ſoul in the moſt high and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous operations that it ſhall have, when God ſhall manifeſt himſelf in the fulleſt way that poſſibly can be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that it it ſhall every moment to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, without any intermiſſion, be exerciſed in the <note place="margin">2.</note> higheſt things that a body can be in, without any wearineſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there muſt be a great deal of power to be able to bear the weight of glory that ſhall be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">3.</note> them: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding, and eternal weight of glory;</hi> ſuch a <hi>weight,</hi> as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if the body were not by the power of God
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:57146:267"/>
upheld, it were impoſſible it ſhould bear it: here we finde, when there is great joy in the heart, the body is not able to bear it; but then there ſhall be a power to bear the weight of glory they ſhall have.</p>
                  <p>And the laſt, is that which I finde expreſſed in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> namely, <hi>The bodies of the Saints ſhall have</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>that power, as to toſs the greateſt mountains in the world like a Ball.</hi> And I finde it in an expreſſion of <hi>Anſelem, It ſhall be ſuch power, as they ſhall be able</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>In futuro ſeculo ſic juſtus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis erit, ut etiam ſi ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit, terram commovere poſſit; et ſic è converſo injuſtus imbecillis ut nec etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vermes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movere queat ab occulis ſuis</hi> Anſel. li. de ſimil. cap. 52.</note> 
                     <hi>to ſhake the whole earth at their pleaſure:</hi> and we cannot think this incredible upon that ground that was named before: there is not ſo much difference between the raiſing a thing from the loweſt degree of power, to the higheſt poſſibility; as in raiſing a thing from nothing to the loweſt degree of power. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a creature had but ſo much power now, as to ſtir the leaſt mote that is in the Sun; to raiſe this power ſo high as to ſtir the whole earth, does not require ſo much power as to make a thing out of nothing: and if God do intend to manifeſt his power in glorifying the Saints, and in making of them powerful; why ſhould we not think, that God will extend that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of power that is in the body to that heighth? certainly, glorious ſhall be the power of the bodies of the Saints: and that is the third thing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is ſowen a <hi>natural body,</hi> and it ſhall be raiſed a <hi>ſpiritual body;</hi> not that it ſhall be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">4.</note> a <hi>ſpirit:</hi> It ſhall remain a body; but the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alneſs conſiſts in three particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that it ſhall be in a ſpiritual condition; they ſhall have no more need of meat, or drink, or clothes, <note place="margin">1.</note> or marriage, or the like, that now the body ſtands in need of: the Angels themſelves ſhall have as
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:57146:268"/>
much need of meat, and drink, and clothes as their bodies ſhall: ſo ſays Chriſt; <hi>They ſhall not be marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor given in marriage, but they ſhall be as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſpiritualneſs of the body conſiſts <note place="margin">2.</note> in the abſolute ſubjection of the body to the ſpirit, as to be fully and abſolutely ſerviceable to the ſpirits of the Saints, which here they are not. Here many times is a ſtrife between the ſpirit and the fleſh; the ſpirit is willing, when the fleſh is not; but then there ſhall be an abſolute ſubjection of the body to the ſpirit: As here the ſpirit of a carnal man is called fleſh, becauſe his ſoul is ſerviceable to the fleſh, to make proviſion for the ſins of the fleſh, his ſoul is counted carnal, the wiſdom of the fleſh is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God: As the ſoul now is as it were carnal, becauſe it is ſerviceable to the fleſh, ſo the body ſhall be ſpiritual, becauſe it ſhall be ſerviceable to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for you to have ſuch a body as to be ſerviceable to your ſouls, as you would deſire, it were a great bleſſing, time will come when it ſhall be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the ſpiritualneſs of the body conſiſts in <note place="margin">3.</note> the agility of the body; the ability it ſhall have to move up and down which way it will, and that ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly; they ſhall move in the Heavens, as the birds do in the ayr. I remember an expreſſion that <hi>Luther</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ubi velit spiritus ibi protinus crit corpus</hi> Aug. li. 22. de Civit. cap. ult.</note> hath, that <hi>the body ſhall move up and down like a thought.</hi> And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>They ſhall move to any place they will, as ſoon as they will.</hi> Theſe words we do not finde in Scripture; but lay this for a ground, that whatſoever we can expect for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of a body, it is that we ſpeak of, or beyond it; and then we have a great deal of liberty to invent
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:57146:268"/>
what expreſſions we can for our comfort: certainly there ſhall be that happineſs of the body that ſhall come to that we ſpeak of, or to more.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, ſome make the ſpiritualneſs of the body to conſiſt in the tranſparency of it; <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſays, <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>It ſhall be ſo clear and tranſparent, that all the veins,</hi>

                  <p>Now brethren, the reaſons why God will reward the Saints in this part, are, Firſt, becauſe humane bodies, as well as humane ſouls, have an hypoſtatical union with the ſecond perſon of the Trinity; and therefore God rejoyces to raiſe humane bodies, as well as humane ſouls unto happineſs. Secondly, Chriſt ſuffered ſo much in his body; therefore God will glorifie the bodies of the Saints. Thirdly, our bodies are part of the members of Chriſt; our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are joyned in a myſtical union with Jeſus Chriſt. Fourthly, our bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghoſt, and God will glorifie his own temples. Fifthly, our bodies are in part ſanctified as well as our ſouls, and therefore ſhall alſo be glorified. Laſtly, our bodies ſhall be glorified, for the further terror and <note place="margin">4.</note> confuſion of the damned; becauſe they in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <note place="margin">5.</note> ſhall ſee the glory of the Saints, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. <note place="margin">6.</note> Here you ſee a way to get your bodies in a bleſſed condition: here is a ſtir for clothing of our bodies, but there ſhall be a cloathing with immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: you that have ſickly and weak bodies, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this, you ſhall one day receive your bodies in another maner then you have them now. <hi>Euſebius</hi> tels us of one of the children of the <hi>Macchabees</hi> that were put to death for the profeſſion of the truth; <hi>when they</hi>
                     <pb n="520" facs="tcp:57146:269"/>
                     <hi>cut off his members,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have received theſe from Heaven, and now I do give them unto the God of Heaven, and I hope I ſhall have them again:</hi> Let us be willing to put our bodies to pain; if our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſuffer hunger, or thirſt, or nakedneſs, or be tyred, or ſuffer Impriſonment, or any violence be offered to our bodies in the cauſe of God, What great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Ne vincat caro iu ſua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perditione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, el vinca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam.</note> is it? we ſhall receive our bodies in another maner. The overcoming of the fleſh is the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, but the overcoming the fleſh, is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it.</p>
                  <p>When we ſpeak of the happineſs of our ſouls, we are not ſo capable of it; but when we ſpeak of the happineſs of our bodies, we are ſenſible of that. Now certainly, there ſhall be much more for our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, here is a way to provide for your bodies: <hi>Lay up proviſion for your fleſh,</hi> is ſpoken as an argument of a carnal heart, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them, <hi>not to make proviſion for the fleſh, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the luſts thereof:</hi> but there is a way of laying up proviſion for the fleſh that is lawful, and that this day I exhort you too. If you love your bodies, be godly: if you did believe theſe things were ſo, would not theſe make you love godlineſs? if I ſhould come unto you, and ſhew you how you might get ſome good for your bodies, then I ſhould prevail with you: give ſome credit to that we ſay now, if you will not believe theſe things, I may ſay unto you as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaid unto the Noble man that would not believe there could be great plenty, ſays he, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee the great plenty with thine eyes, but thou ſhalt not eat of it;</hi> ſo if you will not believe the great things that the Miniſters of God ſpeak of in his name to you,
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:57146:269"/>
your eyes ſhall one day ſee thoſe deſpicable, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible bodies of the Saints in this glory, though you ſhall not be partakers of any of it.</p>
                  <p>Now for the perfection of the ſoul: As the ſoul is of a far larger extent then the body, ſo it is more <note place="margin">2.</note> capable of happineſs then the body is; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper ſeat of godlineſs, ſo it ſhall be the more rewarded: <hi>What ſplendor ſhall the ſoul have</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Qualis erit ſplendor a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nimarum cum ſolis ſplendorem habebit lux <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orporum?</note> (ſays <hi>Bernard) when the body ſhall ſhine gloriouſly as the Sun?</hi> All that we can ſay for the ſoul for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, becauſe we underſtand ſo little of the ſoul, is, That the ſoul ſhall not depend upon the body, as it does now for its operation. And the ſoul ſhall no way be hindred by the body, as now it is hindred here. And all the faculties of the ſoul ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the utmoſt: Now if an infinite power can extend the leaſt degree of power to ſuch an heighth in the members of the body; much more can an infinite power extend the faculties of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul, that is capable of a great deal more power then the body is. Beſides, as the faculties are extended, ſo all the graces of Gods Spirit, that the Saints of God have here, ſhall be extended to the heighth, and they are capable of a higher exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then any thing that is natural; for the more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual a thing is, the more capable it is of extention. As the plant is more capable to be drawn out to an higher excellency then a ſtone, and the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive creature to an higher excellency then the plant; and the rational creature to an higher excellency then the ſenſitive, and grace, which is ſupernatural, can be extended to an higher excellency then the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: Beſides, what increated excellency we might
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:57146:270"/>
imagine could poſſibly be put upon it ſhall be; who could have thought that the humane nature ſhould have had an hypoſtatical union with the body of Chriſt? and as God hath done for the bodies of men, more then all the Angels could have invented: ſo there is to be communicated to the ſoul more then can be invented.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the perfection of body and ſoul, does conſiſt in the majeſty of the perſon being united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: you know when Chriſt was here in the fleſh, in the eſtate of his humility, when he did let out but one beam of his majeſty, thoſe who came to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him were not able to ſtand, but fell backward; if Chriſt by letting out ſome ſmall beams of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, could make men fall backward, how glorious muſt he needs be, when thoſe full beams of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhall be let out? the majeſty of the Saints ſhall have ſome proportion with his, and that very great, which muſt needs follow from that which hath been ſaid. We read of <hi>Stephen,</hi> that when he ſtood before the Councel arraigned as a malefactor, it is ſaid, <hi>They looked upon his countenance, and it was as the face of an Angel:</hi> O what majeſty will appear in the countenances of the Saints here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after! And as in <hi>Adam</hi> in the eſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, there was ſuch majeſty in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that all the beaſts were afraid of him, what will be the majeſty of God in his Saints then, as they ſhall be hereafter? It is ſaid of <hi>Baſil,</hi> when he was ſent for to be taken by his Perſecutors, being in holy exerciſes, there appeared ſuch a majeſty in his countenance, that thoſe that came to take him, were not able to ſtand before him. There is a majeſty in
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:57146:270"/>
the countenance of Gods people, when they walk cloſe with God; but how much more will there be majeſty in their countenances hereafter? So that you ſee Gods people ſhall not onely be glorious within, <hi>as the Kings daughter is glorious within;</hi> but <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.</note> they ſhall be glorious outwardly. And ſo much for the firſt thing, The perfection of the natures of the Saints.</p>

                  <p>SEcondly, the glory that ſhall be put upon them at the day of Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the glory of the <hi>day</hi> it ſelf ſhall be <hi>their</hi> glory; for it ſhall be nothing elſe, but the ſolemnity of the marriage of the <hi>Lamb:</hi> Here there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract between the <hi>Lamb</hi> and his <hi>Bride,</hi> but the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the marriage is reſerved to that great day, and all the glory of the day ſhall be to ſet out the ſolemnity of it; and God himſelf ſhall appear in his glory to make the <hi>day</hi> glorious. As the Parents upon the marriage day, appear in as much glory as they can, that they may honor the day; ſo God ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his glory in the ſolemnizing of the marriage between Chriſt and his Spouſe: And as the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom comes forth in his glory, ſo Chriſt will come in his glory, with all his Angels in their glory. As all the ſervants of the Bridegroom put on their beſt array upon the marriage day, ſo all the Angels ſhall
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:57146:271"/>
appear in their luſtre and beauty; and this ſets out the wonderful glory of the Saints that ſhall be at that day, notwithſtanding all the glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Chriſt, and the Angels that ſhall be then, yet they ſhall not loſe their glory. The Stars loſe their ſhining luſtre when the Sun riſes, becauſe their light is nothing in compariſon of the great light; but the luſtre of the Saints ſhall be bright ſhining and glorious, even in the preſence of the glory of the Father, and of Jeſus Chriſt, and of all the bleſſed Angels.</p>
                  <p>Great things will be done that day; there will be the <hi>Great Supper</hi> that God will make for the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing of the <hi>Marriage,</hi> and the great meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Saints with Chriſt: O what ſalutations can you imagine will there be between Chriſt and his members! and being met, the ſentence of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution</hi> ſhall be pronounced before men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: Chriſt ſhall honor the Saints before all the world, and ſay, <hi>Theſe are they, theſe are the men for whom the eternal counſels of my Father did work to make them glorious; theſe are they for whom I came into the world, and ſhed my blood, and laid down my life; theſe are they in whom I am to be glorified for ever.</hi> Again, the glory of the day ſhall be in ſetting of the Saints with Chriſt upon thrones, in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to judge the whole world, the <hi>Monarchs</hi> and great ones of the earth; and ſo to be honored in the eyes of thoſe that were their enemies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, and reproached them, and vilified them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and likewiſe their glory ſhall be in this, to rejoyce in the execution of the ſentence that is pronounced upon thoſe that are condemned. Laſtly, their glory
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:57146:271"/>
ſhall be in their glorious aſcenſion with Chriſt into the higheſt heavens, ranked in their comely order, with triumph and joy, ſinging, <hi>Stand open ye gates, and be ye open ye everlaſting doors, that the King of glory and all his redeemed ones may come in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the poſſeſſion of heaven, the Kingdom of heaven ſhall be theirs, the heaven of heavens; great <note place="margin">3.</note> things are ſpoken of that; there are theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is <hi>the third heaven;</hi> there is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that is the ſpace between the viſible firmament <note place="margin">1.</note> and the earth; the ſecond heaven is the Orbes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Sun, and Moon, and Stars are; and then there is an heaven above them, which is the ſeat of the bleſſed, which is of an infinite heighth above all: now it as a ſweet confideration for the people of God, when you are going out in the evening, and ſeeing the firmament ſpangled with the Stars, to have ſuch thoughts as theſe, What ſhall one day this body of mine be lifted up beyond yonder place? Though <note place="margin">A deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of of heaven</note> now you lie low in ſome dark hole, there is a time when God ſhall lift you up to be above that ſpangled firmament; that ſpangled firmament is but the pavement of your Fathers houſe, it is but the outſide; and if the outſide and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool of Gods houſe be ſo glorious, how glorious is it within? how glorions is the preſence Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? This world is made for Dogs, for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God, and thoſe that are more vile then any creatures: he does not think much to have ſwine live here, but you do not ſuffer ſwine to come into the preſence Chamber, or into the Dining-room:
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:57146:272"/>
now heaven is the preſence Chamber and Dining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, for that eternal feaſt to be ſolemnized in, and that muſt needs be glorious.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is called <hi>our Fathers houſe:</hi> This is <note place="margin">2.</note> not our Fathers houſe; though we ſhould be caught up where the Stars are, that is not our Father houſe, that is but the out-room: Says Chriſt, <hi>In my Fathers houſe there are many Manſions:</hi> God was from all eternity a heaven to himſelf, before the world was; then he created the higheſt heavens to be the place of his preſence, not that he is comprehended there, but that he would have a place for his glory more fully to ſhine in.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is a place <hi>prepared from the beginning of the world,</hi> and Chriſt is gone to prepare it <hi>for us:</hi> If <note place="margin">3.</note> there were ſuch a building here, that all the men of the world had been building from the beginning of the world, and they had all the pearls and jewels of the world to ſet into it, and all the inventions and ſtrength of men and Angels to help them to build, it would be glorious, but in compariſon it is but a dungeon to this. The brightneſs of this is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glorious, ſays <hi>Chryſoſtom;</hi> when you ſee a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous pallace, you look upon it, and are taken with it, but it is but as a dungeon to your Fathers houſe.</p>
                  <p>The light of <hi>that</hi> ſhall be of another nature then <note place="margin">4.</note> the light of the world; the light that we have here is a material light, but the whole body of heaven is of an higher nature then the body of the Sun; and there ſhal be ſuch a glorious preſence of God, as there ſhall need no <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> to enlighten it; and then with the brightneſs of the body of
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:57146:272"/>
Chriſt, and the brightneſs of the bodies of the Saints, there ſhall be a glorious luſtre.</p>
                  <p>And for the large extent of it: the loweſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens <note place="margin">5.</note> are but as a prick of the center, in compariſon to the ſtarry heaven; and the ſtarry heaven is but as a prick of the center, to the higheſt heaven. Men boaſt here, if they have but a few clods of land; as <hi>Socrates</hi> put a ſcorn upon <hi>Alcebiades</hi> that boaſted of his lands, he brought him to the Map of the whole world, and prayed him to ſhew them there, and there was not one prick vouchſafed for them in it: What is a little <hi>land</hi> to a countrey? and what is a <hi>countrey</hi> to the world? and the <hi>world</hi> is but as a prick to the loweſt heaven, and the <hi>loweſt heaven</hi> is but as a prick to the ſtarry heaven, and <hi>the ſtarry heaven</hi> is but as a prick to the higheſt heaven, and the Saints ſhall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs all that. You that have no poſſeſſions here, know there is a poſſeſſion hereafter, that is more then if you had all the Lands in the world.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is of an incorruptible nature, it is <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>incorruptible:</hi> The reaſon why the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and ſo the ſoul is incorruptible, is becauſe it is not made out of pre-exiſting principles; it was made out of nothing, and nothing but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power can annihilate a thing, as well as make a thing out of nothing. Much is ſaid of that place for the deſcription of it, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was but a Type of it, and the <hi>Land of Canaan</hi> was but a Type of it, and <hi>Paradiſe</hi> was but a Type of this glorious place, that is provided for the Saints of God. Let us therefore raiſe up our hearts to conſider of this. And as we read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 14, 15. where God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Abraham the Land of Canaan,</hi> ſays God,
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:57146:273"/>
                     <hi>look Northward, and Southward, and Eaſtward, and Weſtward; for all the land which thou ſeeſt, to thee will I give it, and to thy ſeed:</hi> So conſider the vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Heavens, and the exceeding extent of them, and conſider this is the Inheritance of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>We know we have an abiding, eternal inheritance; our bodies ſhall abide eternally, and the Heavens themſelves are eternal: this ſhould quiet our hearts, when we finde any diſcontent in our habitations: it is no matter in what Countrey we are here, there is a glorious Countrey we are going to; Chriſt our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother is already gone, and hath taken poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Heaven for us: as if ſo be there were ſome great inheritance did befal you here, and you cannot go to poſſeſs it; and if you hear one is there for you, who hath taken quiet poſſeſſion for you, and you ſhall be ſent for in time convenient; will you not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? So we are not fitted for Heaven, but Chriſt is gone before to take poſſeſſion; and within a while we ſhall go and live with him. The earth is too mean a place for the Saints, and yet the world is not worthy of the Saints of God in a mean condition; then the world ſhall not be worthy of the Saints in their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious condition; and therefore there muſt be a place above the world.</p>
                  <p>Yet know, Heaven is not enough for the Saints: the Saints of God are of ſuch ſpiritual raiſed ſpirits, as that they cannot be ſatisfied with any thing, but God himſelf. Suppoſe God ſhould cauſe all the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> of the world, to come and caſt down their Crowns before the Saints, and ſay, <hi>All theſe are yours:</hi> An heart that is truly raiſed, would
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:57146:273"/>
ſay, <hi>This is not enough,</hi> this is not <hi>God himſelf.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God ſhould bring all the ſplendors of all the creatures in heaven and earth, and they ſhould be caſt at the feet of the Saints, they would ſay, <hi>This is not enough,</hi> for <hi>this is not God.</hi> Suppoſe God ſhould cauſe all the glory of heaven, not onely of <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> but of the higheſt heaven, to be laid before the Saints, they would ſay, <hi>This is not enough, this is not God.</hi> If all the Angels ſhould come, and ſay, We are ſent to put all our glory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, they would ſay, <hi>This is not enough, this is not God;</hi> and therefore when God hath given them heaven, he muſt give them himſelf to, or elſe they are not happy: And that is the fourth thing.</p>

                  <p>For the firſt, the preſence of God, that glorious preſence that the Saints ſhal have of God in Heaven, is a great part of their happineſs: Heaven, it were not Heaven without the preſence of God: The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in the moſt miſerable place that can be, were a greater happineſs then the abſence of God in the moſt glorious place that can be. <hi>David</hi> would not be afraid, <hi>though he walked in the valley of the ſhadow of death,</hi> ſo that <hi>God were with him, Pſal.</hi> 23. <hi>Luther</hi> would rather be in Hell with Gods preſence, <note place="margin">

                     </note> then in Heaven God being abſent. If the preſence of God takes away the dread of the ſhadow of the valley of death, and makes Hell to be more deſired then Heaven, what will the preſence of God make Heaven to be? The three Children in the fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace with Gods preſence were happy? how happy then are the Saints with Gods preſence in Heaven? The Saints deſire Gods preſence even when he is angry, they are loth to be out of his preſence then. It is very obſervable that we have recorded of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. he cryes to God to <hi>hide his face from his ſins,</hi> for Gods face was then an angry face againſt him: yet <hi>ver.</hi> 11. he cryes again, <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence;</hi> he was not willing to be out of Gods preſence howſoever, upon which St. <hi>Augu</hi>

                     <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet he could not be ſatisfied without the preſence of God: <hi>If thy preſence be not with us, bring us not hence.</hi> And the Apoſtle, when he would ſet out the miſery of thoſe that are damned, in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 9. ſays the Text, <hi>They ſhall be puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord;</hi> now the preſence of God muſt needs be the happineſs of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe this muſt needs draw out all their <note place="margin">1.</note> graces, in all the ſweet ſavor of them, <hi>Cant</hi> 1. 12. <hi>While the King ſitteth at his table, my ſpikenard ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth the ſmell thereof:</hi> As it is with the Sun, it draws forth all the vertue that there is in the plant, and makes a ſweet ſavor in things; ſo the preſence of God muſt much more draw forth the fragrancy of all the graces of his Spirit, in the ſouls of his Saints.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the preſence of God muſt needs quicken <note place="margin">2.</note> all the comforts of the ſouls of his people, and keep them always in vigor and activity; for as we know, the Sun it does quicken things that lay dead; ſo the preſence of God hath a wonderful quickning power, it keeps the comforts of Gods people freſh, ſo long as we have the preſence of God, all our comforts are green and lively. The Saints in heaven have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the preſence of God, and therefore their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are always vigorous and lively. When they ſhall be preſented faultleſs before the preſence of his glory, it ſhall cauſe <hi>exceeding joy, Jude</hi> 24. the word there ſignifies, <hi>leaping, ſpringing, exalting joy.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the preſence of God in heaven ſhall be <note place="margin">3.</note>
                     <pb n="533" facs="tcp:57146:275"/>
the accompliſhing of all that ſweet and good that ever they have had in Gods preſence in this world; they have had by pieces, many ſweet manifeſtations of God unto them; but often God hath been abſent, and they have been fain to ſeek for their Beloved; but now all thoſe pieces (as we may ſo ſpeak) which they have had, ſome at one time, and ſome at another, ſhall be all joyned together; and they ſhall have the accompliſhment of all in one, and the perfection of all in one, and ſo for ever enjoy it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the preſence of God muſt needs fill their ſouls and bodies with glory, for it fills the heaven <note place="margin">4.</note> with glory; much more it muſt needs fill an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul with glory, becauſe that is more capable of glory then the heaven: If the Sun can put a glory upon theſe poor dark creatures here below, much more can the preſence of God put glory upon the glorified bodies and ſouls of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Further, the preſence of God muſt needs be very glorious unto the ſouls of the Saints, in regard of <note place="margin">5.</note> the maner of the bringing into Gods preſence, for they ſhall be brought into it by the hand of Chriſt the Bridegroom; he ſhall, as it were, take the Saints by the hand, and lead them to the Father; he ſhall ſay, Come now, I will ſhew you my Father that I have ſpoken ſo much of to you before, to that end that the Father may delight in you. As ſuppoſe the Prince were married to one, and upon their marriage he takes his Spouſe by the hand to lead her unto his father, to that end his father may take notice of her, and manifeſt reſpect unto her; ſo this coming into the preſence of God ſhall be by the hand of Chriſt. There is a glorious leading
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:57146:276"/>
of our ſouls into the preſence of God in this world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſs and acceſs;</hi> the word ſignifies, <hi>A leading by the hand:</hi> and in <hi>Canticles</hi> 1. 4. it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>That he brings the Spouſe into the Chambers:</hi> He brings the <hi>Church,</hi> the ſouls of his people into the Preſence-Chamber, and that makes the preſence of God ſweet unto the Church: but hereafter there ſhall be a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous leading of the Saints unto God by Chriſt, how much more ſhall the preſence of God be ſweet unto them then?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, what a bleſſed ſecurity muſt there needs <note place="margin">6.</note> be to the ſouls of the Saints in the preſence of God: To be under the ſhadow of the Almighty is a ſecure condition, to be hid in the ſecrets of Gods preſence is a ſecure condition, but to be in the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Almighty, as it ſhall be in heaven, O the happy ſecurity then! A childe when it is gotten into the preſence of his father or mother, thinks it ſelf ſafe; the Saints then that ſhall always be in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, muſt needs be in an happy ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, hence will follow an holy boldneſs: the Saints of God ſhall ſtand in the preſence of God <note place="margin">7.</note> with an holy boldneſs, they ſhall have nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they ſhall be aſhamed: though the light of God ſhall ſhine moſt gloriouſly upon them, yet it ſhall not diſcover any thing in them that ſhall cauſe any ſhame or fear in them. It is the promiſe of God to the diligent, <hi>They ſhall ſtand before Kings:</hi> Thoſe that are now diligent in making their calling and election ſure, in providing for their eternal eſtate, this is the bleſſing of them, they ſhal ſtand before the King of glory, before the King of heaven with an holy

The glory of this may appear in theſe particulars:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to ſee God as the <hi>firſt being of all,</hi> or the principle of all good, is a moſt bleſſed thing, to ſee <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt father, or <hi>Eve</hi> the firſt mother of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, or for a childe to ſee his father, or mother, out of whoſe loyns and bowels he came, whom he hath
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:57146:277"/>
not ſeen in many years, this is a joy and comfort; but to ſee the Creator, the firſt Principle of all things, that muſt be a great, an infinite contentment; and to ſee him that hath done all the good in the world, hath much ſatisfaction in it. We would rejoyce to ſee a man that hath been an inſtrument to do great things in ſome Countrey, as the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> or the like; but to ſee God that hath done all the great things in the world, what a bleſſed joy and contentment will that be? The rational creature does naturally deſire to know the cauſes and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of things, no other creature looks at the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and cauſes of things, but the rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If other creatures may have that which is ſuitable to ſenſe, they look no farther; but a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal creature cannot be ſatisfied in whatſoever it hath, unleſs it knows ſomething of the principles and cauſes of the thing it hath, and when it knows the cauſe of one thing, it would know the cauſe of that, and nothing will quiet it till it comes to ſee the cauſe of all; and when it comes to know that, it hath full contentment: <hi>Shew us the Father, and it ſufficeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, they ſhall ſee God in his <hi>unity;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now we underſtand God onely according to his <note place="margin">2.</note> ſeveral Attributes, as the manifeſtation of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Simple:</hi> Firſt, being in one way we call Power, in another way we call Mercy and Bounty, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way Juſtice, and ſo we apprehend God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the ſeveral Attributes that God hath manifeſted himſelf in; whereas there are not many things in God, but all thoſe ſeveral Attributes that we apprehend diverſly, are but one excellency in God:
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:57146:277"/>
as one beam of the Sun ſhining through a red glaſs, cauſes a red reflection; and the ſame Sun ſhining through a blue glaſs, cauſes a blue reflection; and ſo the ſame excellency of God ſhining one way, and working after one maner, we call by one name; and the ſame excellency of God working another way, we call by another name, and yet it is all one in God; and though we cannot apprehend it now, yet we ſhall ſee God in his unity afterward.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we ſhall ſee God in the <hi>Trinity:</hi> though <note place="margin">3.</note> there be but one God, yet there are divers perſons: to ſee how the Father begot the Son, and how the Spirit did proceed from the Father and the Son, and the difference between the proceſſion of the Spirit, and the generation of the Son; the ſight of God in the myſtery of the Trinity, is a moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we ſhall ſee God in his <hi>glory,</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. <note place="margin">4.</note> 17. there is a promiſe, <hi>They ſhall ſee the King in his beauty,</hi> or in his glory; there is a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between ſeeing the King at an ordinary time, and ſeeing of him when he is in his Robes, with his Crown upon his head, and his Scepter in his hand, and ſet upon his Throne, with all his Nobles about him in all his glory: ſo God does manifeſt himſelf a little now, but this is not all that he does intend: and for to ſee God now as he does manifeſt himſelf, is ſomewhat, but to ſee God in his greateſt glory that ever he ſhall manifeſt himſelf in, that muſt be a great happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, to ſee God in his <hi>eminency;</hi> that is, they <note place="margin">5.</note> ſhall ſee how all excellencies that are in the creature are eminently contained in the abſolute perfection
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:57146:278"/>
of the Divine nature; all the good that is in the effect, is in the cauſes, and the good of thoſe cauſes in their cauſes, and ſo at length they come to the firſt principle: ſo all the good that we can ſee in all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that give content, we may ſee all eminently in God, and ſee God in all. The latitude of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of mans underſtanding, is ſuch, as it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all beauty, all excellency, all truth in it, and therefore cannot be ſatisfied till it ſees into all; in God it findes all united, and therefore in him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it findes bleſſedneſs: it is eternal life to know him.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, they ſhall ſee God as he is, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 2. now there is a great deal in that to ſee God as he is; <note place="margin">6.</note> and for explication of that, there are theſe five branches.</p>
                  <p>That is firſt not to ſee him onely negatively, that is, not to ſee him as he is: the moſt that we ſee of <note place="margin">1.</note> God now, is by way of negation, rather then any poſitive ſight; when we ſay of God he is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, that is, he is ſuch a God as cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, that's but negation: when we ſay of God that he is infinite, that is, ſuch a God as hath no bounds of his being, this is ſtil a negation, to ſay what God is not: and when we ſay God is a ſpirit, though the expreſſion ſeem to have an affirmation in it, yet it is but the apprehenſion of God rather by negation, that is, that God hath no bodily ſubſtance in him; for to ſpeak properly, God is not a Spirit; but only that is the moſt excellent thing that we can conceive of, and by way of negation, that he is no body, and is inviſible, one that we cannot ſee, and feel, and the like: when we ſay he is holy, he hath no ſpot of ſin,
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:57146:278"/>
this is by way of negation, but now in Heaven we ſhall not ſee God onely by negation, but we ſhall ſee that poſitive excellency of God, we ſhall ſee him as he is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we ſee God much by relation unto other <note place="margin">2.</note> things; as when we ſpeak of God, and would open the excellency of God, we ſay, God is the King of Heaven and Earth, and our Father, and the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and Creator and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of all things, and theſe are but relative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and a great part of our knowledge of God is by way of relation; but hereafter we ſhall ſee him as he is.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, you ſhall ſee God as he is, not by framing <note place="margin">3.</note> any repreſentations of him in our mindes; there ſhall be that immediate preſence of God to the minde, that there ſhall not need be any repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we now form in our mindes; as in the ſenſe of Seeing, the object of the eye being abſent from it, there muſt be a ſpecies to repreſent it: ſo there are ſome kinde of repreſentations of God to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings here; but there ſhall be that immediate union with God in the underſtanding, that there ſhall need no kinde of repreſentation of God, but we ſhall ſee him as he is.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we ſhall ſee him, not in his effects in the creature; the greateſt part that we ſee of God now, <note place="margin">4.</note> is in his effects, and not as he is in himſelf, we do not ſee the face of God, but his back parts. We look upon the Sun, and there we ſee ſomewhat of the power of God, but it is but the effect of Gods power, and not Gods power it ſelf; and when we look upon the world, we ſee much of Gods wiſdom,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:57146:279"/>
we ſee the effect of Gods wiſdom, and not the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, we ſhall ſee God as he is diſtinguiſhed <note place="margin">5.</note> from all creatures; here now we ſee almoſt nothing of God, diſtinguiſhed from created things. Say what you will of God, that he is a Spirit, that he is a created thing, that he is wiſe, or holy, or juſt, or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, there is ſomewhat of all theſe in the creature, onely he is infinitely above all, and that is by way of negation. But we do not ſee him in that poſitive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency which does difference him from all created things; but now it will be a bleſſed thing to ſee God, as he is differenced from all created things, to ſee him as he is.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, the Saints ſhall ſee the counſels of God, <note place="margin">6.</note> and all the ways of God, what have been, and what ſhall be to all eternity about election; what his counſels were about creating of things, before they were created, and what the workings of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were about the ſeveral ways of his providence, before there was any manifeſtation of them in his creature; and ſo all his counſels about rejection of ſo many thouſands of men and Angels. It is an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> We ſhall ſee the reaſon why one is reprobate, and one elected; why one is rich, and one is poor: we do not ſee the reaſon now, but by ſeeing God we ſhall ſee all things that may make for our happineſs: we ſhall know all the works that ever God did, and that ever he will do to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. It is a great thing for a man to know what is done in his generation: but to know all the ways of God ſince the beginning of the world, muſt be a glorious ſight. It is not yet Six thouſand years
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:57146:279"/>
ſince God did any thing out of himſelf, and what is ſix thouſand years to eternity? and if God have done ſuch great things in <hi>Six thouſand years,</hi> what may God do in the next Six thouſand years, and ſo in the next, who now can tell? A Workman doth his meaneſt works at firſt, and this world is but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Gods works, and for a creature to ſee what God ſhall thus work for ever, is an infinite bleſſed thing.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh thing, wherein this bleſſed viſion of the Saints appears, is, that they ſhall look upon all <note place="margin">7.</note> the ways and works of God, as to ſee their happineſs conſiſting in them: there is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in ſeeing an object that is excellent in its ſelf, and to ſee an object that is excellent, wherein conſiſts my happineſs. As in riding over a Land, one that is a Stranger rides over it, another that is an Heir; the Stranger rides over it, and takes delight to ſee the Trees, and Fruit to grow; but the Heir looks upon it after another maner, as the Land for which my Father laid out much, and all to enrich me, as the Land that is mine Inheritance: ſo, were it that we were but admitted to this glorious ſight of God, meerly to have the view of God, it were a great priviledge to the Creature, but to ſee all the ſhine, and all that excellency that is in God, is to make me happy; and all the counſels and ways of God are working for my happineſs and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this is bleſſedneſs indeed. There is difference between a <hi>Stranger</hi> looking upon the King, and the <hi>Queens</hi> looking upon a King. A Stranger may ſee Beauty and Majeſty in the King; but the <hi>Queen</hi> looks upon the King, and his Beauty and
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:57146:280"/>
majeſty, as her own; and ſo the ſouls of the Saints ſhall ſee all in God as their own, to make them happy.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, the bleſſedneſs of the ſight of God conſiſts in this, that it ſhall be a transforming ſight, <note place="margin">8.</note> ſuch a ſight of God, as ſhall be a transforming, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ſight, not onely a perfect ſight, but a perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, transforming ſight: The light that ſhall come from God upon the minde, ſhall perfect the minde, and transform the minde into the ſame likeneſs with God: It ſhall not be a meer notional ſight; as men may ſpeak much of God, and have a notional viſion of God; but there is a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the notional viſion of God, and the Deifical viſion of God; for it is not only beatifical, but Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical, for it does transform a man into the likeneſs of God. A deformed man may ſee a beautiful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and that ſight ſhall not make him like that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful object; but the ſight of God ſhall make the ſoul glorious, as God is glorious, as you ſhall have it in 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 2. <hi>We ſhall be like him:</hi> what is the ground? We ſhall ſee him as he is.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, the ſight of God will be a full ſight, a ſight whereby the minde ſhal be raiſed to that heighth <note place="margin">9.</note> of excellency, as it ſhall be able to ſee God in his excellency: we cannot look upon the Sun now in its excellency, if we will ſee the Sun, we muſt ſee in its reflection; but the underſtanding of the Saints ſhal be raiſed to that heighth, that they ſhall be able to look full upon the face of God, and this will be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſpecially of Faith; for thoſe that are godly do believe above reaſon. Now becauſe the Saints are willing to fear God ſo far, as to captivate their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:57146:280"/>
and to believe upon bare teſtimony above rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; therefore hereafter God will give them this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reward, to ſee things fully, and the reaſon of things.</p>
                  <p>Again, it ſhall be ſuch a ſight of God, as ſhall be <note place="margin">10.</note> without any diſcourſe, or labor, but there ſhall be the preſent viſion of God, at the opening of the eye. We are glad if we can come to underſtand the creature with labor; but to come to underſtand God the Creator without labor, is a great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Again, to have the ſight of God ſo, as never to loſe it, that addes much to the happineſs of the <note place="margin">11.</note> Saints: To have but one glimpſe of the face of God, though it were gone preſently, it were a great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, beyond all that the world affords, but God ſhall not onely paſs by, but ſtand ſtill: ſo as the ſoul ſhall never loſe the ſight of God, but it ſhall have it to all eternity, and the eyes of the ſoul ſhall be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally opened to ſee God. If a man looks upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful object, he is loth to have the eye drawn from it; you ſhall never have your eye drawn from God.</p>
                  <p>Further, in the ſight of God you ſhall ſee all things that do any way concern your ſelves in ordering of <note place="margin">12.</note> you to all eternity: and this is made by ſome the ground, why it is impoſſible for the Saints in Heaven in the leaſt degree to fall there; becauſe they ſhall have a continual view of God, and in him ſee fully all circumſtances of all actions, and all things that any way do or ſhall concern them to all eternity. For there is no falling, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining from God, but it comes at firſt from ſome

It was the deſire of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher to ſee the nature of the Sun, though it were to be burnt by it, he could be content; ſo if God ſhould grant us this happineſs, <hi>You ſhall come to ſee me, but the ſight of me ſhall deſtroy you,</hi> this were a deſireable thing; but to have a ſight of God that is a perfecting ſight, and ſuch an excellent and glorious ſight, in which our happineſs ſhall conſiſt for ever, how glorious muſt this needs be?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, to ſee God in our ſelves: It is an happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſee God in the Creature, but much more to ſee God in our ſelves: the chiefeſt of the glory of God, next to that which appears in Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall appear in the Saints, and the chief excellency of God that the Saints ſhall ſee, ſhall be within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: they ſhall ſee more of the glory of God within themſelves, then in all the Heavens beſides. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are glorious now, the Sun, Moon, and Stars are glorious; but to ſee the higheſt Heaven, that were more glorious. But the meaneſt Saint of God in Heaven, ſhall ſee more of God, and of his glory in himſelf, then does appear in all the Heavens beſide, and then much more then does appear in all the World. We might make it out, there is more of the glory of God in one Saint, then in all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth beſides; for the Heavens and the
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:57146:281"/>
Earth are but Gods foot-ſtool, not his image, but the Saints of God are are his image, and this ſhall be their happineſs, to ſee the glory of God in themſelves. A man may delight to ſee beautiful colours, but you take more delight, if you can by looking in a glaſs ſee your ſelves beautiful, and ſee thoſe beautiful colours in your own clothes; but if we could have the glory of the Sun, and the Moon, and all the creatures in heaven ſhining within our bodies, that would be counted glorious indeed; but to ſee the divine excellency, and the top of the divine excellency of the infinite God ſhining within us, this will be a mighty happineſs. Baſe ſenſual car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hearts think there is no content but in ſatisfying the fleſh. What ſweet and content have many, but in their eating and drinking? and their pallate is pleaſed, and in that their other ſenſes are ſatisfied, and they think this is the excellency of man: But take a ſchollar, that hath but the exerciſe of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to finde out truths, and thoſe things that are ſuitable to the rational part, and he ſees more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency there, then in any ſenſual thing, and he can ſcorn ſenſual delights. If there be ſo much content to the minde in viewing the things here, what content will there be to the minde in beholding God, and his glory? There are two reaſons of content in ſeeing things; In regard of the <note n="*" place="margin">

Let the object be what it will, there is delight in the act of ſeeing and underſtanding: For a man to underſtand that which is evil, it gives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to the minde, and it is one of the perfections of God that he underſtands evil as well as good, ſo that there is content and delight in the act
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:57146:282"/>
of ſeeing, though there be no delight in the object: but when the object is pleaſing too, that addes much to comfort and delight, therefore content in the ſight of God muſt be the higheſt content, becauſe there is the higheſt act of underſtanding, and the higheſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſee that can be.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have endeavored to open unto you the ſecond bleſſed thing that the Saints ſhall have in Gods being their portion, they ſhall ſee God. <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>That you ſee thoſe things that you ſee; and bleſſed are your ears, that heard thoſe things you hear:</hi> So, bleſſed are the eyes of Gods people that do ſee any thing of God here, and hear any thing of God here; but bleſſed are the eyes that ſhall ſee God hereafter. That which I labor for in preſſing theſe things, is to take off your hearts from theſe things below, and that you may ſee what you are capable of; and if your hearts be mad upon your ſins, and you will periſh, you ſhall know what you loſe: me-thinks if men did know what they loſe by their ſin, they would caſt it off with indignation, and therefore when your ſin comes and tempts you, ſay, What, ſhall I loſe all this for ſuch a way of ſin?</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THirdly, they ſhall have <hi>union</hi> with God. Sight is higher then preſence, and <hi>union</hi> is higher <note place="margin">3.</note> then ſight. <hi>John</hi> 17. 21. Chriſt prays to his Father, <hi>That they may be one in us, as thou art in me, and I in thee.</hi> For the opening of this union with God, you are to know that there is firſt an union that God hath with all creatures in general. Secondly, an union that he hath with the humane nature of Chriſt. Thirdly, the union that he hath with the Saints. Firſt, the union that God hath with all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in general, and that union is twofold: An uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">1.</note> of dependance; or an union of his immenſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: Of dependance, becauſe all creatures in the world depend upon God for their being, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of their being every moment, therefore there muſt be an union of God with them; for if the union of dependance were broke, evey creature would fall to nothing. As the beams of the Sun have an union with the Sun, and the beams could not continue if they were not united to the Sun; ſo all the creatures have an union of dependance with God, without which they cannot continue. And then the union of immenſe preſence, that muſt be, becauſe God is in every thing, and every where; there is not the leaſt ſpire of graſs or ſtone, but there is a way of Gods immenſe preſence in that. Secondly, there is another kinde of union that God hath with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <note place="margin">2.</note> nature of Chriſt, and that we call an hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal union: for the humane nature, and the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:57146:283"/>
to be united in one perſon, this is that the Saints and Angels of God ſhall be adoring God for to all eternity; that ever there ſhould be ſuch an union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Deity and the Creature, that if it were not revealed to us in the word, it were impoſſible to be imagined by any creature. It is a great work of God to unite an immortal ſoul with ſuch a baſe creature as our fleſh is into one perſon; I do not know any one work of God in creation ſo great as this, and this is to be admired at: but if this be ſo great a work to unite a rational immortal ſoul into one perſon, with a corruptible piece of fleſh, then to unite mans nature into one perſon with the ſecond perſon in Trinity, this is a great work.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is an union of God with the Saints, <note place="margin">3.</note> and that is in this World, or in Heaven. In the World, there is a fourfold union that God hath with the Saints. Firſt, there is an union of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation <note place="margin">1.</note> of the Spirit; for the Saints of God in this World, are the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, and the Spirit of God is ſaid to dwell in them; and ſo there is a glorious union by the inhabitation of the Holy Ghoſt in them. The ſecond union that the Saints of God have in this world, is the union <note place="margin">2.</note> of ſimilitude; the Saints are like God here in ſome meaſure, they have the image of God ſtamped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, God ſees his face in the Saints. The brighteſt glaſs in the world to ſhew Gods face, is the ſouls of the Saints; and there is not onely ſome likeneſs of God in the Saints, but the likeneſs of God in his very life. A glaſs may repreſent my image, but that image hath not that life that I have, but the image of God in the Saints, does not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:57146:283"/>
God, but they have the life of God: thoſe that are converted live the life of God, and by ſin we are eſtranged from the life of God: they work as God works, God underſtands himſelf the higheſt and infinite good; and God wills himſelf as the higheſt and infinite good; theſe are the chief actions of Gods life. Now the Saints of God live this life, they in their meaſure do here underſtand God, as the higheſt and infinite good, and do will God as the higheſt and infinite good. A third union that the Saints have with God, is a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love; love is an uniting grace, and there is a moſt entire love between God and every Saint, and ſo their hearts are cloſe united, and mingled by love.</p>
                  <p>Again, in this life there is a <hi>myſtical Union,</hi> and that is an union higher then any other; an union with Chriſt, being made members of the Son of God, and ſo they come to have union with the Son of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that expreſſion, in 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us; and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> There is a myſtical union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and Chriſt, and ſo we come to have union with God the Father alſo, and to be joyned to the Lord, we are one Spirit with him. <note n="*" place="margin">

Sect 1.</note> Now for the union that the Saints have with God in Heaven, there are many intricate notions that ſome of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have about this; as, that the ſoul ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſame <hi>Idea</hi> that God made it of; and that there ſhall be an <hi>Illapſus</hi> of God into the ſoul; but we muſt know there can be no union with God,
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:57146:284"/>
but it muſt be by vertue of the influence of ſome good from God; for ſpeak of what union you will, God cannot in his Eſſence be more preſent with the creature then he is here, but onely in regard of ſome manifeſtation, or communication of himſelf, in ſome gift or good thing; but certainly, there will be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful glorious union between God and the ſoul in Heaven, and that upon theſe four grounds.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is not ſuch diſtance between God and the ſoul, but that it is capable of union with God. One would think how is it poſſible that God ſhould be ſo united to the ſoul, being there is ſuch an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſtance between God and it: but there is not ſuch an infinite diſtance between God and the ſoul of man, as that there ſhould not be a glorious union between them: there is a great deal of likeneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the ſoul; Firſt, in the ſpirituality, <note place="margin">1.</note> God is a Spirit, the ſoul is a Spirit. Secondly, in <note place="margin">2.</note> immortality, God is immortal, the ſoul is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. <note place="margin">3.</note> Thirdly, in the high excellency of God, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and will, the ſoul is endued with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and will; the perfection of God as we can conceive, is his underſtanding and will; and ſo it is in the ſoul. Fourthly, in the ſeveral operations <note place="margin">4.</note> that the ſoul hath; and herein there is more likeneſs between God and mans ſoul, then is between God and Angels, in that one rational ſoul ſhould perform ſo many works, as the ſame God, the ſame Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, working upon the creature, works in one thing one way, and in another thing another way; ſo the ſoul repreſents God in this, in that one rational ſoul hath ſuch variety of workings in the body, for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, for ſenſe, for vegetation, which Angels
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:57146:284"/>
have not. Again, the ſoul reſembles God in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs; the ſoul is not onely infinite in duration, but in regard of the infiniteneſs of the working of it: and here is a mighty difference between the ſoul of man, between rational creatures, and all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for the ſenſitive creature that onely works a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome particular thing that concerns its own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and its own good within its narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, but the object of mans ſoul is univerſal, infinite: it is not any particular truth, that will ſatisfie the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, let there be never ſo many truths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, yet the underſtanding deſires infinitely more; if there be any truth that is not revealed, it would have that. Let <note n="*" place="margin">

Secondly, there may well be a glorious union between God and and the ſouls of the Saints, becauſe God ſhall ſee nothing but himſelf in the ſouls of the Saints: now when God ſhall ſee nothing
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:57146:285"/>
but his own in ſuch a creature, this is a full ground of Gods near and moſt glorious union with it: as when a man comes to ſee in another much of his own, his heart is united to him; things that are of a like nature do unite: Bring an hot fire-brand to the fire, and it does unite preſently, becauſe the fire does finde ſomething of it ſelf there; if there were ſome moiſture in the brand, it would not ſo fully unite: And ſo here we cannot have full union with God, becauſe though God ſees ſomewhat of his own in us, yet there is a great deal in us, that is not Gods: but when we ſhall be wholly free from ſin, and God ſhall ſee nothing but his own in us, that muſt needs be a ground of a moſt glorious union.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in Heaven there ſhall be nothing in God, but ſhall be ſuitable to the nature of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <note place="margin">3.</note> Saint, and ſuitableneſs is the cauſe of union: if there be not a ſuitableneſs, there cannot be union. There cannot be ſuitableneſs between God and other creatures; but between a glorified Saint and God, there ſhall be an infinite ſuitableneſs, and therefore an infinite glorious union. Again, there ſhall be an infinite inflamed love; here is an union of love, but <note place="margin">4.</note> in Heaven there will be a further degree of love, and love being enflamed, there muſt needs be a moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious union.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if you conſider what the bond of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion <note place="margin">5.</note> of the ſoul and God together is, namely, the mediation of the Son, the ſecond perſon of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, there muſt needs be an infinite cloſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious union of the Saints with God. This viſion and union with God, is enough to cauſe the ſouls of
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:57146:285"/>
Gods people to be ſo ſatisfied, as to ſay, Let all things be taken from me, it is enough; I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Gods preſence here, but I ſhall have the glorious preſence and viſion of God, and union with God hereafter; and though my eyes ſhould never ſee good day after, or never ſee comfortable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the world, this is enough, I ſhall ſee God, and have full union with God: Though there be a ſeparation between me and all temporal comforts in the world, though God ſhould rend this creature or that creature, the deareſt husband, or the deareſt wife, or the deareſt comfort in the world, and thoſe things that my ſoul do moſt cleave to here, from me; yet it is enough that God and my ſoul are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what united, and that God and my ſoul ſhall have a glorious union hereafter. O that God would raiſe our hearts to theſe things, that we may know what is the buſineſs we have to do in the world: If you do not know theſe things ſhall be your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, never give ſatisfaction to your ſelves in the fleſh, till your know theſe things ſhall be your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XLVIII. <hi>The bleſſedneſs of communion with God.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>NOw we come to the fourth thing, <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God,</hi> and this is more then the other three things. Union is the ground of communion; communion is that which riſeth from both parts being united, and the Saints ſhall have a glorious communion with God and the Trinity; in this life there is a communion that the Scripture ſpeaks of, that we have with God the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Our fellowſhip is with the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>The communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle; ſo that there is a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Father and the Son, and communion with the Holy Ghoſt; but certainly, it ſhall be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maner of communion that the Saints ſhall have with God in the world to come. Now this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it ſtands either in regard of the work of God, upon and towards the Saints, or the work of the Saints upon and towards God; for communion is on both ſides, and that in theſe four things: Firſt, in the delight they have one in another. Secondly, in wiſhing all good to one another. Thirdly, in the communication of themſelves one to another. Fourthly, in the bleſſed familiar converſe that they have one with another.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, communion conſiſts in the delight they have <note place="margin">1.</note> in one another: There is a full, actual, mutual, everlaſting delight between God and the Saints in heaven: Firſt, there is a delight: Secondly, full:
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:57146:286"/>
Thirdly, actual: Fourthly, mutual: Fifthly, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is a delight: God here rejoyces in them, the Scripture ſays, <hi>He rejoyces in the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts of the earth, and his delight is with the ſons of men, Prov.</hi> 8. 31. why does God delight in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable parts of the earth? there are other glorious works of God that are not in the habitable parts of the world; but God delights in the habitable parts of the world, becauſe there are rational creatures there; but he hath more delight in his Church in this world, then in any other part of the habitable parts of the world; as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19. 25. <hi>Aſſyria is the work of Gods hands, but Iſrael is his inheritance;</hi> but there will be a delight far higher: The delight that God hath in heaven it ſelf, is in regard of the Saints that are there, without which heaven were not heaven. Firſt, it is delight in their perſons, God takes infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite delight and content in the perſons of the Saints; <note place="margin">1.</note> howſoever their perſons are mean here, yet as they ſhall be hereafter, God will take an infinite delight in them. Secondly, he delights in conferring bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon his people; there is much delight in the <note place="margin">2.</note> communication of good, as well as in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it: what good hath a man who hath a great eſtate more then another, but that he may commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate more good then another. Thirdly, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the glory that he hath conferred upon <note place="margin">3.</note> them: As thoſe that have true communion one with another, delight in any good that one another hath, God delights in the glory that is in his Saints, and takes much pleaſure in it, his ſoul is ſatisfied in the glory that he ſees upon his own people, and that
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:57146:287"/>
becauſe he loves them: The former aroſe from the pleaſure in himſelf in the act of communicating; this from the love to his people, to ſee their good. Fourthly, God delights in their preſence to have <note place="margin">4.</note> them with him, and by him, as the Father delights in the preſence of his Children to have them round about him. Fifthly, God delights in their love, that he hath theſe creatures to love: as a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights <note place="margin">5.</note> to have love from others; What pleaſure could a man have in all the world, if none loved him? If he ſhould live in a Family or Town, and none loved him, he could have no pleaſure in his life; but if a man live where he is loved, it makes up a great many wants, ſo God is not contented in any thing elſe he hath to delight himſelf in, but that which muſt make up all, in that he hath his people to love him. Sixthly, God delights the more in his own <note place="margin">6.</note> glory, becauſe his Saints are partakers of it; it is ſo much the more ſweet unto him, becauſe they have a ſhare in it; thus it is between entire friends, who have intimate communion one with another, their own happineſs pleaſes them the more, becauſe the other hath a part in it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a full delight that God takes in his people: It is ſaid of his people in this world, in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 17. 3. <note place="margin">2.</note> he will rejoyce over them with joy and with ſinging; the delight that God hath with his people in Heaven muſt needs be full: Firſt, in regard of the near relation that his people have to his Son, and becauſe he takes ſuch infinite delight in the Son; and they being one with him, thence flows that full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Secondly, becauſe he ſhall ſee ſo much of his own Image; now that is infinitely delightful:
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:57146:287"/>
that is the reaſon why the father or mother does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in their children, becauſe they ſee themſelves in them: ſo God ſhall ſee himſelf in his people, and that will cauſe full delight. Thirdly, becauſe of the glorious works of God upon the ſouls of his people, becauſe he ſhall ſee his own handy-work to be ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and full in them. As a man that makes a work that is very curious and glorious, he takes abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of delight to look upon it; and if the work be full and perfect, then his delight is full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Now the great work of God is in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Saints: God loves to look back to the creatures, therefore when he had made the world, he looked upon what he had made, and ſaw it was good: As a workman when he hath brought his work to ſome perfection, he will look upon it: Now when God ſhall ſee what he hath done, in raiſing ſuch a poor worm to ſuch high excellency, God will take full delight in viewing this full work he hath done. And this is more then all the former; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the delight in the act of communication and delight, becauſe of the love to thoſe to whom good is communicated: This is the delight in his own work, done in the beholding the beauty and glory of it. Fourthly, the delight of God muſt be full, becauſe in them God attains his higheſt end, the <note place="margin">4.</note> higheſt end of his greateſt deſign, the higheſt end of his deepeſt councels, the higheſt end of his moſt glorious work: It is a great delight to a man when he goes about a work, if he have his end; though a man have ſome benefit by his work, yet if he be croſt in his laſt end, all his joy is taken away; and this is the evil of ſin, ſin ſeeks to
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:57146:288"/>
croſs God in his higheſt end that he aims at, but the Saints in heaven ſhall give God his full end: God ſhall have the higheſt end that he did aim at, he ſhall ſee it accompliſhed and fulfilled in them; now thoſe objects in which Gods higheſt end is fulfilled, he muſt needs take delight in, and that ſhall be in the Saints. Again, the delight of God muſt be full, becauſe God hath no other object, but rational <note place="margin">5.</note> creatures, Angels and Saints to let out his delight to; if God does take any delight in any creature here, it is in order to the Angels and the Saints: Now when God hath no other object to himſelf, and his Son, and his Spirit, to let out his delight unto, but the rational Creatures, Saints and Angels, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one (for the Lord Chriſt ſhall be the head of the Saints and Angels) ſurely his delight in them ſhall be full.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this delight ſhall be actual; and that is neceſſary to communion; for though there be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, <note place="margin">3.</note> yet if it ſhould lie dead in the habits, there is no communion: If two friends have habitual delight one in another, they are not ſaid to have communion, but when it is actual, ſo this delight ſhall be actual; the nature of delight is to be lively and active, even in us, though it be but an affection in us; but God being a pure act, there will be an infinite activity in his delight, and it is always vigorous and freſh, ſo as God ſhall make the ſouls of his people to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the activity of his delight. Fourthly, this delight ſhall be mutual, it ſhall be on the Saints part, <note place="margin">4.</note> as well as on Gods part. As God delights in the perſons of the Saints, ſo they delight in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not in that they receive from God, but their
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:57146:288"/>
greateſt delight is in the being of God himſelf; and as God delights in their glory, ſo they do delight in all the glory of God, in eſſential glory that they ſee in God, and in all the glory that is reflected upon God by his creatures; and they delight in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in being with him, and in his love, and in that they can give any glory to him; they delight in all they have, more becauſe God hath glory by it, then in that themſelves are bleſſed in it. And it is full likewiſe; the delight of the Saints of God is full, as <note place="margin">5.</note> well as the delight of God in the Saints is full; and that for the very ſame grounds that the delight of God in them is full; namely, The fulneſs of Gods delight in them is their relation to Chriſt; ſo the ground of their full delight in God is, becauſe God is <hi>the Father of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and becauſe they ſee their likeneſs in God; what ever excellency they have in themſelves, they ſee it to be infinitely in God; and as God delights in them, becauſe of his works he ſees in them, ſo the Saints ſhall ſee all the good that ever they have done, does redound to the glory of God; howſoever, the works of Gods people for the preſent ſeem to be mean, yet it ſhall appear, all the gracious works of the people of God ſhall be the moſt glorious things in the world: For God ſhall own them for the ſetting out of his glory, as the greateſt things in the world; and this ſhould be an infinite encouragement to us, to be abundant in good works, becauſe God will glorifie our good works: and as the fulneſs of the delight of God in the Saints is, becauſe God attains his end in them, how full muſt the delight of the Saints in God be, becauſe the Saints do attain their end in God, the
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:57146:289"/>
end of all their thoughts, and ways, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances? and they ſhall have no other object to let out their delight to, but onely God: here, though we have ſome grace, yet the ſtream is divided, we let out ſo much to one creature, and ſo much to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; the children ſo much to the Parents, and the Parents ſo much to the children; and husband ſo much to the wife, and the wife ſo much to the husband, and ſo much to our friends, that the ſtream we let out to God is but little: but when all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that we let out to the creatures, ſhall be taken away, and God ſhall be the onely object of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, then our delight muſt be full.</p>
                  <p>And as this delight is mutual, ſo it ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual: for being withdrawn from all other objects, <note place="margin">5.</note> it will work upon that, both of them, Gods delight in the Saints, and the delight of the Saints in God, ſhall be for ever: the Saints ſhall be an eternal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, in which God ſhall delight, and God ſhall be an eternal excellency in which they delight, they ſhall be always keeping that feaſt of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> We read of <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> he kept a glorious feaſt, and the gloriouſneſs of it is ſet forth by the continuance of it, <hi>Eſther</hi> 1. 4, 5. it is obſervable, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the feaſt that he made with his Nobles, and the feaſt that he made with the common people, and that may lively ſet out the difference of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God that he lets out to his own people, and that he lets out to other common people; he made a feaſt of a hundred and fourſcore days to his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and but ſeven days to the common people: ſo when God comes to make a feaſt of joy to his people, it ſhall be everlaſting. Men in the world
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:57146:289"/>
have ſome content, but it is but for a little time; but the comfort and joy that is to be between God and the Saints in Heaven, is to be eternal, becauſe it is ſuch a feaſt as is made to his Nobles, and to ſhew the riches of his glorious Kingdom, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in communion there is a mutual wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">2.</note> and willing of good to one another; now God ſhall will all good to the Saints, and they wiſh all good to God: It is true, that God from all eternity did will all good unto his people, but here his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not of a capacity to receive much; there is a great deal of difference in willing and determining good to them, before they were in being, or before they were capable of receiving this good, and willing good to them when they ſhall be made veſſels fit to receive good; the bodies and ſouls either of the Saints or the wicked being united after the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſhall be veſſels infinitely enlarged, capable of abundantly more then they are here, and then to have God will good to them, is far better then to have good willed to them here: The men of the world would fain have good here, while their hearts are narrow, and they cannot receive much from God; but the Saints look for good hereafter, when their hearts ſhall be enlarged; when as the wicked, when their ſouls ſhall be enlarged, they ſhall have nothing but miſery. There is a twofold love, when one <note place="margin">Amor ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citiae, Amor bene volentiae.</note> ſhall will onely good to himſelf by another, or will good to another; now the love of good will is moſt glorious in God, and it is mutual; God ſhall will his good to the creature, and the Saints ſhall will all good to God: What good can they will to God?
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:57146:290"/>
It is true, there can be no addition to the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial goodneſs of God, but they can will that this his goodneſs be honored and praiſed; and this ſhall be in the bleſſed communion between God and his Saints in the mutual working of their wills.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in communion, there is the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what one have unto another; where there is <note place="margin">3.</note> right communion, there is a communication on both parts; if on receive good, and the other do not labor to communicate, it is not communion. Now there is a glorious communication on Gods part: Firſt, immediate: Secondly, full: Thirdly, free: Fourthly, everlaſting. Firſt, immediate; whereas here God communicates himſelf through creatures, or through ordinances, there are conduits of conveyance; for there is ſuch diſtance between God and us, that we cannot expect that immediate conveyance of Gods goodneſs, and of himſelf to us here, as we ſhall have in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the fulneſs of Gods communication: <note place="margin">2.</note> Suppoſe that God ſhould draw out all that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſweetneſs, goodneſs, and power that he hath communicated in all creatures in the world, and bring the quinteſſence of all, and communicate that unto the ſoul of one Saint, certainly it would not ſerve the turn, for the happineſs of one Saint, there muſt be a greater communication: But conceive, if we ſee one creature have ſo much power in it by its influence upon the dunghil, as to produce ſuch a glorious creature as life, which is the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing that ever God did make. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſays, <hi>There is more glory in the life of a</hi>
                     <pb n="563" facs="tcp:57146:290"/>
                     <hi>flie, then in the Sun in the Firmament:</hi> Now if the Sun have ſuch power to produce life from a piece of dirt, what power ſhall the influence of an infinite God have upon a glorified ſoul? No marvel though the Scripture ſays. <hi>That eye hath not ſeen, neither ear hath heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man, to conceive what God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is free, as free as the Sun lets out its <note place="margin">3.</note> beams: It is natural to a good thing to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, much more for goodneſs it ſelf: certainly, God being goodneſs in the abſtract, his communication muſt needs be free.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is everlaſting; the letting out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <note place="margin">4.</note> to the Saints, ſhall preſerve their ſtrength, that he may let out himſelf unto them; as if there were that power in ſome excellent liquor that is let out into a veſſel, not onely to ſweeten it, but perpetually to preſerve it, that it may be letting out it ſelf into it; ſo God does everlaſtingly in communicating himſelf unto his people, preſerve them that he may communicate himſelf. And then the Saints of God do communicate to God in the ſame way that God does to them. They are always worſhipping God immediately, not through ordinances; as they ſhall not receive any thing of God through ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, ſo they ſhall not worſhip God through ordinances; but as they receive immediately, ſo they ſhall worſhip God immediately, and their communication ſhall be full: but as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not will any eſſential good to God, ſo they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not communicate any eſſential good, but they ſhall communicate themſelves, and all that they are
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:57146:291"/>
or have to God; or if they were able to make a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand worlds, they would make them all for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God; but becauſe that is beyond the power of any creature, therefore they communicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and all that they are, or have, or can do to God: as a drop of water is let out into an infinite Ocean, ſo they are let out unto God, as into an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Ocean: And then the communication is free, having the divine nature made perfect in them, that do flow to God, when they ſee his divine nature: and this communication ſhall be everlaſting, God letting out himſelf to them, and they letting out themſelves to God: This is the reward of the Righteous, and this is that which <hi>Moſes</hi> had an eye unto, and all Gods people that have an eye beyond the vail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it with infinite ſoul-ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in communion with God, there is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar <note place="margin">4.</note> converſe between God and the Saints: And herein are theſe particulars:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God manifeſting himſelf in a ſuitable way to the conditions of his people, ſo as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending <note place="margin">1.</note> to their condition, that though his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty be infinite, yet it ſhall no way be a terror unto them: Here if a Saint of God ſees but an Angel, he is amazed; but becauſe God would have his people enjoy holy familiarity with himſelf, therefore he will manifeſt himſelf ſo, as though there be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite glory, yet there ſhall be no amazement; but that they ſhall be able familiarly to converſe with him, as one friend does with another. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks of the familiar converſe that God hath with his people here, that they are called friends: <hi>Abraham</hi> was called <hi>The friend of God,</hi> and the

Diſciples were called friends, but hereafter the friendſhip ſhall be much more full and ſweet; <hi>Job</hi> ſhall have his deſire, <hi>O that the terror of God may not fall upon me:</hi> Here when God ſpake by himſelf, many of the deareſt of his Saints have been afraid; but when we come to be made partakers of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Recompence of reward, all ſuch fear ſhall be done away.</p>
                  <p>Again, another thing in familiar converſe, is the <note place="margin">2.</note> mutual opening of themſelves one to another; much is ſaid of Gods opening of himſelf to his people here, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 14. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 32. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>John</hi> 15. 15. and that is the reaſon why they are brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chamber ſpoken of in <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. becauſe their ſecrets are diſcovered; as they ſaid to the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> concerning the Prophet, <hi>The Prophet that is in Iſrael, does reveal whatſoever thou doeſt in thy bed-chamber,</hi> becauſe in them Kings reveal their ſecrets: The myſteries of the Kingdom are reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Saints here, much more in heaven, there are many ſecret things that God hath to tell his people, when they come to have familiarity with him. When a man comes to a woman a ſtranger, he does not tell her his ſecrets; but when ſhe is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to him, then he tells her his ſecrets; ſo in heaven, God will reveal his ſecrets, and they ſhall not onely ſee his face, but they ſhall ſee Gods heart. And they ſhall open their hearts to God, for they ſhall have nothing in their hearts that they ſhall be aſhamed of. As the Sun-flower, when the Sun ſhines, the flower is open, but when the Sun is down, it ſhuts: So here when Gods face ſhines, their hearts are open to God,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:57146:292"/>
but often they loſe the ſhine of Gods face, but in Heaven Gods ſhine ſhall be always upon them, and their hearts ſhall always be open to God.</p>
                  <p>Again, in converſe there is diſcourſing one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, <note place="margin">3.</note> it is much here, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them:</hi> walks of friends are for diſcourſe, in <hi>Canticles</hi> 7. 5. <hi>The King is held in the Galleries:</hi> Galleries are made for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and walking; ſo the Church is compared to the Galleries in which Chriſt is held: There is converſe with God here, but much more in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And then in familiarity there is abundance of delight, not onely in one another, but in receiving <note place="margin">4.</note> one from another; when men do converſe, they delight in being receiving, and being uſeful to one onother; ſo God will rejoyce in any thing that they ſhall be able to give him, as they ſhall rejoyce in what God does give them. And the ground of all, is becauſe they live the ſame life of God; as now there cannot be a converſe between plants and beaſts, becauſe they do not live the ſame life; but between one beaſt and another, there may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, becauſe they live the ſame life; and ſo there cannot be converſe between beaſts and men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not live the ſame life; nor between God and man, unleſs they live the ſame life; but there ſhall be a glorious life hereafter, fitting the ſouls of the Saints for converſe with God: no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of converſe with God, but the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creature, becauſe no creature can live the life of God, but the rational creature: and the ground
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:57146:292"/>
the converſe that the Saints have with God, is from the near familiarity that God hath with Chriſt. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>Awake, O Sword, againſt my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and againſt the man that is my fellow;</hi> it is the voice of God concerning Chriſt: now becauſe there is this familiarity between Chriſt and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this is the ground why the Father hath ſuch a ſweet familiar converſe with the Saints. And from all this communion that is between the Saints of God, and God himſelf; hence it is that the Saints are carried to God, as the univerſal latitude of good; it is as natural for the will to will good in general, as it is for the fire to burn, or for the Sun to ſhine; but here is the miſtake, ſome miſtake good, they will good in general, but they look for good in this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and that creature, or in this luſt or that luſt: but here is the happineſs of the Saints; as it is natural for their wills to will good, ſo it ſhall be as natural for their wills to will God as an univerſal good! this is the bleſſed communion that the Saints ſhall have with God, and this is the accompliſhment and iſſue of all the communion we have with God here.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XLIX. <hi>The happineſs of the Saints in their</hi> fruition <hi>of God, and their perfect</hi> reſt <hi>in him.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe fifth thing in the Saints having God to be their portion, is <hi>fruition</hi> of God, enjoyment <note place="margin">5.</note> of God: Gods people ſhall not onely be in his <hi>preſence,</hi> and <hi>ſee</hi> him, and have <hi>union</hi> with him, and <hi>communion</hi> with him, but they ſhall have <hi>fruition</hi> and enjoyment of him: The <hi>fruition</hi> of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in theſe four things.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, The reflect act of the ſoul, whereby it comes to know what it hath; it hath a God, and it <note place="margin">1.</note> knows it, by a reflect act; and upon this it is, that there is no creature can be ſaid to enjoy a thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but the rational creature; the beaſts and plants have many things communicated to them, but they have no reflect act to know what they have, this is proper to the rational creature. If one have never ſo great a good, if he were ignorant of it, and did not know it, he could not be ſaid to enjoy it: As one that hath an inheritance given him, if he knows not of it, he is far enough from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it. This will adde much to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Gods people, they ſhall be filled with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and glory, filled with God, and they ſhall know all their happineſs: There are many excellencies that other creatures have, but they know not of their excellency; and many of Gods people have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of mercy from God, God communicates much to them here, but they cannot be ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to enjoy it, becauſe they do not know it; but
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:57146:293"/>
time will come, though God lets out himſelf fully, yet he ſhall let out himſelf no further then we ſhall know him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is in fruition the having uſe of all <note place="margin">2.</note>; if a man be never ſo rich, and have never ſo great poſſeſſions, if he have not the actual uſe of what <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Videbit Deum ad volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit ad vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptatem, fruetur ad jucundita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> Ber. Serm. de Tripl. Gen. Bon.</note> he hath, he cannot be ſaid to enjoy them; a man may have right to a thing, and yet for the preſent not enjoy the uſe of it. But now the people of God, as they ſhall have God to be their portion, ſo they ſhall enjoy God fully, to have what uſe they will of all the Attributes of God, and all that is in God: And this is an infinite good and happineſs to the people of God, that they ſhall have as much uſe of Gods infinite wiſdom, of the infinite power of God, and of the infinite mercy of God as they will; and they cannot will it ſo ſoon, but they ſhall have it, nor ſo eaſily, as they may enjoy it: Then we do enjoy the benefit of friendſhip, when one friend ſays to another, Make uſe of all I have as your own, as you will: So God ſhall come to his people, and bid them make uſe of all his riches, and glory, and excellency as they will: Hence it is, that God is not onely the happineſs of his Saints, cauſally or effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, but he is formally the happineſs of the Saints: He is not cauſally the happineſs of the Saints; that is, That he ſhould cauſe ſome good to come from him to the Saints; but he is formally the happineſs of the Saints, becauſe they have God himſelf to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and have the uſe of himſelf. The Sun is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally great good to the world, it cauſeth the herbs and plants to grow; but it is not formally the good of the creature here below: But God is not
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:57146:294"/>
onely cauſually good to the Saints, but formally: God is theirs, to be uſed unto the utmoſt that they are capable of.</p>
                  <p>The third thing in fruition, is to have the ſweet and comfort of all that we do uſe, or elſe we do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy <note place="margin">3.</note> that we have. If a man ſhould have the uſe of his eſtate, and meat, and drink, if he have not the ſweet and comfort of it, he cannot be ſaid to enjoy it; but when the comfort is let out, that the ſoul is ſenſible of it, then he may be ſaid to enjoy it: And hence it is that God is ſaid to give all things to us richly to enjoy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. There is no creature can give us to enjoy another; another may give a man ſuch and ſuch things in which may be comfort, but he cannot give him comfort in the thing, it muſt be God that muſt give to enjoy; no creature can properly give the enjoyment of another, becauſe though it gives the thing, it cannot give the comfort with it, but God gives the thing, and he gives the comfort with it, and ſo a man is ſaid to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is ſuch an enjoyment, as the having of it does perfect that which does enjoy it, and by <note place="margin">4.</note> that we ſhall underſtand the difference between other creatures attaining to their end, and the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal creature attaining his end; the other creatures, when they attain their end they periſh, ſo as they cannot be ſaid to enjoy their end; the plants and beaſts that God hath made for the uſe of man, when man comes to have the uſe of them, then they come to have their end, but they do not enjoy their end, becauſe in having their end, they are deſtroyed; but the rational creature, when he comes to have his end,
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:57146:294"/>
then he comes to have the higheſt perfection; and ſo he may be ſaid to enjoy it, becauſe when he comes to have his end, he is made the more perfect; ſo take theſe four together, and you may know what I mean by fruition of God: and that is the fifth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſixth particular, in having God to be their <note place="margin">6.</note> portion, is the <hi>Reſt</hi> that the foul hath in God: The term of all motion is reſt, every thing that moves, moves that it may have reſt: Now here in this world the creature is altogether in motion, and eſpecially man, becauſe he is not here in his proper place; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing moves to its center, till it comes to its place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 10. <hi>My heart panteth;</hi> the word in the Original ſignifies, ſuch a kinde of motion, running up and down, as Merchants run up and down, from one Countrey to another; and it is obſervable, there is the two laſt radical letters double; and that is to <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> note, That it is more then an ordinary ſtirring and motion of the ſpirit, becauſe it is not come to its reſt; but when the foul comes to the term unto which it moves, then it comes to have reſt. God hath let out good things to other creatures, and they never return back again directly to him; but the good that God lets out to mankinde, and to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it returns back again to God: The Saints are made by God, and they come and return to the firſt fountain from whence they came, whereas other creatures do not: As the wicked, they come from God, but do not return to God again as their reſt: And therefore it is an expreſſion of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Thoſe that ſeek onely after the ſatisfying of their ſenſes, they go out from God like unto rivers that run from
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:57146:295"/>
the fountain, but there is no regreſs of them, they do not return back again; but the godly come from God, and have their returns back again unto God, unto their fountain, there to reſt, and to have their happineſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>The wicked walk on every ſide;</hi> the wicked move up and down in a circle, but never unto the center, onely keep their round from one creature to another, but never have any direct mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto God, to come to him as their center, and ſo to finde true reſt in him: <hi>Return, O my ſoul, unto thy reſt, Pſal.</hi> 116. 7. The word tranſlated <hi>Reſt,</hi> is in the plural number, <hi>Return, O my ſoul, unto thy reſts:</hi> God is the reſt of the ſouls of the Saints. Reſt and glory ſeldom meets in this world; they who are in glory have not the quieteſt life, and they who have moſt reſt, are furtheſt off from being glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: <hi>Iſſachars</hi> condition likes ſome, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 14. Reſt was good to him, though under burthens; and if a man will have a name amongſt the great ones of the earth, farewel reſt; but in heaven reſt and glory do both happily and perfectly meet together.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rabbies</hi> have a note from the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that all the letters of that name are <hi>quieſcentes,</hi> and they ſay, There is a myſtery in it, to ſhew that all our reſt is in God. Some creatures God hath made ſo, as there is no other good they are capable of, but to continue in their beings; and therefore they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeek for their place, and no more, and there they reſt; as the Fire, and Ayr, and the Earth, theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have no other good, but to continue in their beings: and you ſhall obſerve, if they be out of their places, with what violence will they move to their proper place: As if there be fire or ayr got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:57146:295"/>
the earth, it cauſeth earthquakes, it moves there with that violence, that it ſhakes the whole earth, that it may come to its proper place, becauſe it hath no other good but that. Then I would reaſon thus; If thoſe creatures that have no other good, but onely to be in their proper place, if they be out, to get that good ſhall move with ſuch violence; then conſidering what a good mans ſoul is capable of, if he have not obtained that good, with what violence ſhould he move? how ſhould the kingdom of heaven ſuffer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? how ſhould we work toward God, who is our proper place and center, in whom is ſo much good? But there are other creatures that have an higher good then being in their place; as the plants have a Vegetative place, and therefore they grow to it, and if they have attained that there, they reſt; then the ſenſitive creature hath an higher good, and that moves till it hath got its end; namely, to all things that are agreeable to ſenſe, and they go no further. The rational creature looks to that which is ſuitable to reaſon. And where there is grace, grace looks to attain that which is the proper perfection of the life <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Domine fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſti nos pro te, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietum eſt cor noſtrum donec ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat ad te.</hi> Auguſt.</note> of grace, and there it reſts, and never elſe: Therefore it is the expreſſion of an Ancient: O Lord, thou haſt made us for thee, and our hearts are unquiet till they come to enjoy thee; and when the ſoul comes to reſt in God, that is glorious, and that is the Saints happineſs to attain the end of their motion, and the more glorious is the reſt, when the end is attained: and the glory of the end may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered much, by the glory of the means that tend to it: As if a man will beſtow a great deal of Coſt and Charges to get his Health,
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:57146:296"/>
then he accounts health worth all thoſe charges; and the greater charges are laid out for health, argues his greater eſteem of it; and ſo if a man be at great charge about a Voyage, it is becauſe he accounts much of the excellency of the end of his Voyage: and if this be ſo, how excellent is the end of Gods people, if we conſider the moſt glorious means that are uſed to attain this end and reſt? as namely, the work of God in ſending the ſecond perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to take mans nature upon him; and all the works of God in Election, in Redemption, in Adoption, in Juſtification, in Sanctification; yea, all the works of God in creation, in providence, the deſigning the Holy Ghoſt to that office he is deſigned to, and all the Ordinances of God; look what preciouſneſs is in all theſe works of God and means, it ſets out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the preciouſneſs, and excellency, and glory that there is in the laſt end, whereunto Gods people ſhall attain, and that reſt they ſhall have.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh and laſt thing in having God to be their portion, is <hi>the enjoyment of</hi> themſelves in <hi>God:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7.</note> as they ſhall enjoy <hi>God,</hi> and God in <hi>themſelves;</hi> ſo they ſhall enjoy themſelves <hi>in</hi> God, living in God continually: the fiſh does not more truly live in the water, and move in the water, then the ſouls of the Saints ſhall live in God, and move in God: <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Your life is hid with Chriſt in God:</hi> the life of Saints here is an hidden life, and it is hidden in God, but then it ſhall be a revealed life, and revealed in God, and enjoyed in God. Hence is that Phraſe, <hi>Enter into your maſters joy;</hi> that <hi>enters not into you,</hi> but <hi>you muſt enter into it:</hi> it is your <hi>maſters joy,</hi> not onely that joy that your maſter <hi>gives,</hi> but the ſame joy
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:57146:296"/>
your maſter hath, that you ſhall enter into and live in. It is ſaid of Saint <hi>John,</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. that he was on the Lords day in the Spirit; it is not ſaid that the Spirit was in him, but it is ſaid, he was in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that was as a beginning of the glorious condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saints of God, that they ſhall be in the Spirit of God, not onely God in them, but they in God, as a drop of water in the Sea, ſwallowed up in it. Put a drop of wine into the Sea, it is changed into the nature of the Sea; and ſo though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be changed into the Divine Nature, yet we ſhall be ſwallowed up in God, ſo as we ſhal not any further minde our ſelves, our own good as a created thing, nor our ſelves as creatures, but altogether God: our mindes ſhall be ſo wholly upon God, as if they were wholly emptyed of any created good, and had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but with an increated good; it ſhall not will any thing to it ſelf, nor to any other creature, but all to God, and ſo wholly taken upon with God, and upon that ground, becauſe they have that likeneſs unto God, and partake of the Divine Nature: Here we do good to others, becauſe of their likeneſs to our ſelves; But the Saints ſhall will all good to God, not becauſe God is like them, but becauſe they are like to God, ſo that they ſhall love themſelves for God.</p>
                  <p>There are three degrees of love to God, loving <note place="margin">The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of our <hi>love</hi> to God.</note> of God for <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and loving God for <hi>himſelf,</hi> and loving our ſelves <hi>for God:</hi> the one is but a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> love, the ſecond is a <hi>gracious</hi> love, the third is a love of the <hi>glorified</hi> Saints: <hi>Firſt,</hi> to love God for <hi>our ſelves,</hi> ſo an hypocrite may love God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath gifts and many bleſſings from God,
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:57146:297"/>
this is but a natural love. But <hi>grace</hi> goes further then nature, that is to love God for himſelf; though we ſhould never have any thing, yet if we be gracious, we love God for <hi>himſelf:</hi> but the glorified Saints go further then grace, and that is to love themſelves for God, whereas heretofore we did onely love God for <hi>our ſelves,</hi> or for <hi>himſelf,</hi> now we come to love our ſelves <hi>for God:</hi> and in this kinde of love of God, and enjoyment of our ſelves in him, the ſoul ſhall be raviſhed with God, and be in a kinde of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie eternally.</p>
                  <p>Now there is a twofold extaſie, one that is through the weakneſs of the inferior faculties of the ſoul; when the minde of a man is taken up about an high object ſeriouſly, the other faculties being weak they fail, and ſo men come to be in a trance and extaſie; many have had great joy, that they have even dyed <note place="margin">Spiritual <hi>extaſic,</hi> how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</note> with it; the heart hath ſo dilated it ſelf, as the vital ſpirits have flown out. But there is an extaſie comes from the excellency of the object, that the minde is buſied about, but without any wearineſs of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior faculty. If then we put all together, that hath been ſaid about God, and the enjoyment of God, and having God to be the portion of the Saints, you ſee the principal part of Heaven, and the ſpiritual part of the glory of the Saints. Here is <hi>faith</hi> called for, and why ſhould not our faith go beyond <hi>reaſon</hi> to rectifie reaſon, as reaſon rectifies ſenſe? theſe things be high, and great myſteries. When as <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſays, <hi>How can this be?</hi> as when Chriſt was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the new birth, ſays <hi>Nicodemus, How can this be?</hi> let but <hi>faith</hi> get as far above <hi>reaſon,</hi> as reaſon hath got above <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and we may eaſily ſee how they can be by <hi>ſenſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="577" facs="tcp:57146:297"/>
If a man look up to the Firmament, and ſee the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhine, he would think it were little bigger then a Buſhel, or the like, now reaſon will tell men other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; reaſon that tells men that this creature, that appears to be but in this bigneſs, it is many hundred times bigger then the Earth; now if reaſon can rectifie ſenſe ſo far, Why ſhould not faith go beyond reaſon as far? Now reaſon will tell us of much happineſs that may be had: We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by reaſon, by underſtanding, that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creature is capable of abundance of glory: but when you hear things delivered by the word, which are more then reaſon can conceive, let us get <hi>faith</hi> to rectifie <hi>reaſon,</hi> and we ſhall not call thoſe truths into queſtion, and yet know that our glory will be beyond our faith, as our faith is beyond our reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Here you may ſee that moſt people in the world <note place="margin">The great miſtake of Heaven, &amp; whence it ariſes.</note> miſtake Heaven, and look at Heaven in a ſenſual maner: when we ſpeak of Heaven, where have we a man or woman that looks at Heaven, in theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual excellencies, about enjoying God in this maner? As the <hi>Jews</hi> looked for a carnal <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whoſe Kingdom ſhould be in the earth, and whoſe glory ſhould be external, not conſidering the Spiritual Kingdom of Chriſt: ſo moſt in the world look but for a carnal Heaven. It is a good evidence of the truth of grace, if you can look to Heaven with a right eye, in a right maner, to look at the ſpiritual part, and ſpiritual excellency in Heaven. But that which makes people to call theſe things in queſtion, is; firſt, becauſe they are not acquainted with God, but are ſenſual, their hearts are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:57146:298"/>
with nothing but ſenſual and earthly things, and therefore their hearts are not raiſed to theſe things, but they look at them as notions; but that ſoul that is acquainted with God, and the counſels of God, and knows the minde of God, that ſoul can know how to ſavor theſe things, and know the reality of them. Again, another reaſon why theſe things are above the reach of moſt people, is, becauſe <note place="margin">2.</note> they are not acquainted with the myſteries of the Goſpel, and what in them is revealed concerning man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: If we were acquainted with the myſteries of the Goſpel, we would not think theſe things ſtrange that are revealed. Thirdly, becauſe mens hearts are not enlarged with Gods image for the preſent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">3.</note> they cannot ſavor any thing, but that which hath ſome ſavor of the creature. Fourthly, becauſe they are not acquainted with the <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; <note place="margin">4.</note> whereas thoſe that are godly, have ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of eternal life wrought in them here, and upon that, theſe things are not ſo ſtrange to them, their hearts can cloſe with them, and ſuck out abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of comfort from them. And thus we have finiſhed the fourth thing of the reward, namely, To have God for their portion.</p>

                  <p>NOw the fifth particular in the reward of the Saints, is the communion that they ſhall have <note place="margin">5.</note> with Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man:</hi> there are divers things in which the happineſs of the Saints conſiſts in having communion with Chriſt, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> It was one of Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> three wiſhes, <hi>To ſee Chriſt in the fleſh:</hi> It would be a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to you to ſee Chriſt in the fleſh. Many make much of the Picture of Chriſt, and if they had it right, they would make more of it; but if Chriſt ſhould come to any of your houſes, as he did when he lived upon the Earth, in his mean condition, would it not greatly delight you? but when we come to enjoy communion with Chriſt in Heaven, it will be another maner of communion, then that upon Earth: We accounted the Apoſtles bleſſed men, that lived with Chriſt upon the Earth; what a bleſſed condition will it be, to live with Chriſt in Heaven? If there were ſuch vertue in Chriſt upon Earth, that there came ſuch vertue <hi>from the hem of his garment,</hi> what glory will there be in Chriſt, in his full glory? If Chriſt were ſo glorious when he was in his transfiguration, how glorious is he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glorified before men and Angels eternally in Heaven, <hi>With the glory that he had with his Father,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 17.</note> 
                     <hi>before the beginning of the World!</hi> If there was ſo much vertue in the Apoſtles of Chriſt, in regard of the reference they had to Chriſt, as from the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Napkins that were taken from
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:57146:299"/>
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> body, there was ſuch power as to heal diſeaſes, what vertue muſt needs come from Chriſt, when we ſhall come to enjoy him, when we come to ſee Chriſt that was the author of all our good? We read of the poor Cripple, when he was healed by the two Diſciples, he ran and catched hold on them, and was loth to go from them, who had been the inſtruments of ſo great good to him; but for the Saints to come and be with Chriſt, who hath been the inſtrument of ſo great good to them, as Chriſt hath been, what an infinite happineſs will this be? we read of many that would go long journeys, to ſee thoſe men that had any excellency in them; as ſome would go from the utmoſt parts of <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſee <hi>Livie, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles:</hi> to ſee Chriſt then, in whom is ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, will be glorious. And then to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him: it is he in whom God the Father takes full ſatisfaction; ſurely he muſt be the full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Saints: this is that which Chriſt prays for; Firſt, he prays for his <hi>own glory,</hi> and then he prays for the Diſciples, and all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>That they might be with him to ſee his glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O to ſee the Lord Jeſus glorified as he ſhall be glorified, muſt be a glorious thing! As to ſee his glory in regard of the luſtre of his Divinity, through his humanity; when Chriſt pleaſed to let out any luſtre of his Divinity, through his humanity here, men were not able to bear it; as thoſe that came to apprehend him, when he ſaid, <hi>I am he,</hi> they fell down backward: now in Heaven the luſtre of Chriſts Divinity, ſhall ſhine mightily through his humanity; ſo in him our bodily eyes ſhall come to
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:57146:299"/>
ſee God as much as it is poſſible for any creature to ſee him; becauſe God ſhall be let out through the humanity of Chriſt, as much as it is poſſible for the Divinity to appear in any corporeal ſubſtance, or in any creature: <hi>We ſhall ſee him with theſe our eyes,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> ſays. We ſhall ſee how the power of an infinite God can convey the luſtre of a Deity into a creature. Certainly, Angels and men will be continually view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, he ſhall come to be admired of the Saints, he ſhall be admired at the day of Judgement in the Saints, but in Heaven they ſhall ſee ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in Chriſt, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> as they ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring at him to all eternity, as much as they did at the firſt moment; here if we ſee any thing that is excellent, we admire at firſt, but after a while we do not ſo: but there will be ſo much excellency in Chriſt, as we ſhall ſo admire at it, to all eternity, as we did at the firſt moment; for there ſhall be no abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our being taken with the glory of the ſight of Chriſt. <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>that ſee thoſe things you ſee;</hi> and <hi>bleſſed are your ears that hear thoſe things you hear:</hi> It is a bleſſed thing to ſee the things we may ſee here; but to ſee the Divinity ſhine through the humanity, this will be a great bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>And we ſhall ſee him in the glory that the Father will put upon him; Certainly, God will put an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite glory upon his Son, becauſe the Lord was ſo infinitely well pleaſed with the ſatisfaction of his Son: Becauſe he ſubjected himſelf to the death of the Croſs, therefore <hi>He hath given him a name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all names.</hi> And we ſhall ſee the glory of Chriſt, when all the Angels ſhall be worſhipping of him, and all the Saints ſhall be ſinging with Praiſes and
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:57146:300"/>
                     <hi>Hallalujahs</hi> to him. And this ſhall be the buſineſs in Heaven, eternally to be admiring Chriſt, and praiſing God for Chriſt. And then we ſhall ſee him in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry triumphing over all his enemies, in bringing them down; and in his glory when he ſhall have brought to perfection that great work that he did undertake: Now to ſee Chriſt thus glorified, and for us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy communion with Chriſt thus in his glory, this will be a glorious reward for Gods people. This glory of Chriſt, will be made the glory of the Saints: as a <hi>Queen</hi> that ſees the Prince in his glory, ſhe delights in it, becauſe it is her glory: and ſo the <hi>Church,</hi> when ſhe ſhall ſee Chriſt her husband in his glory, ſhe ſhall rejoyce in it, becauſe ſhe looks upon it as her own, I ſpeak of the Triumphant Church: The Angels ſhall admire at it; O that theſe poor worms ſhould be raiſed from this low eſtate to ſuch a glorious condition! they pry into the myſtery of Salvation. Then the love of Chriſt ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed to his people, that love which cauſed him to plead with God for his people from all eternity, that cauſed him to undertake this great work for his people; from this love, there will be moſt glorious embracements. If at one ſalutation of the mother of our Lord, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſprings in the Womb for joy, how ſhall the heart of a glorified Saint ſpring at the glorious embracements of Chriſt himſelf, when he is in his glory? And when we ſhall be in ſuch a condition as we ſhall be fitted for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him, we ſhall be able to underſtand Chriſt in another way; we ſhall know the hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical union of his two natures, and know Chriſt fully, and be fitter to entertain the manifeſtation of
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:57146:300"/>
his love, whereas here we are not able to entertain much; Chriſt looks through the latteſs, and we have but ſome few drops of his love, but then when his love ſhall be enflamed and fully let out, we ſhall be fitted for it.</p>
                  <p>And it ſhall be ſuch a communion with Chriſt, as we ſhall never leave, <hi>but follow the Lamb whereſoever</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>he goes:</hi> There ſhall be no moment to all eternity, wherein Chriſt ſhall be out of the ſight of ſo many thouſand thouſands of Saints: And though that Text in the <hi>Revelations</hi> be meant of the Church in this world, and the following of Chriſt whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he goeth <hi>here,</hi> following of him in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; but if it be an happineſs here <hi>to follow the Lamb whereſoever he goes,</hi> much more in heaven: You that are willing to ſuffer any thing, to follow the <hi>Lamb</hi> in his ordinances here, know there is enough to pay for all, you ſhall be always following the <hi>Lamb</hi> in heaven, and you ſhall always be in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Chriſt; and this is the fifth particular, namely, <hi>The communion that the ſouls of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall have with Chriſt.</hi> There are yet two things to be opened in this branch, to ſhew what the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward of Gods people is; and they are the enjoyment of communion with the Angels and Saints, and the keeping a perpetual Sabbath in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The enjoyment of communion with the Angels and Saints: The Angels and Saints are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <note place="margin">6.</note> under one head; the <hi>Angels</hi> rejoyce here in being <hi>miniſtring ſpirits unto the Saints;</hi> O what rejoycing will there be then in communion with them! the Saints of God ſhall enjoy communion
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:57146:301"/>
with the Angels in a familiar way, they ſhall be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for communion with God and Chriſt himſelf, much more fitted for communion with Angels; yea, the Angels ſhall account it part of their happineſs to have communion with the Saints: The ſight of an Angel to us now in the fleſh, though he comes to bring good tidings, is a great amazement; but then the ſight of the Angels ſhall be no amazement, but we ſhall look upon them as our fellow creatures, to have communion with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. <hi>Ye are come vnto Mount Sion, and to the City of the living God, the heavenly Jeruſalem, and to the company of innumerable Angels:</hi> This is ſpoken of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> before by the <hi>Law</hi> there was nothing but terror, that made <hi>Moſes</hi> to fear and quake; now we are not to come to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but to Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> and unto <hi>the City of the living God:</hi> Before, without Chriſt we were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds, wandring up and down in the wilderneſs of the Word, but by Chriſt we are gathered unto the City of the living God, and the heavenly <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> there were nothing but troubles before, but now they are gathered to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> into peace, and to an innumerable company of Angels: Before the Angels were as Gods Hoſt, ready to revenge the quarrel of God upon us, but now we are come to the innumerable company of Angels, who are miniſtring ſpirits to us here, and we ſhall enjoy communion with them: The Angels are full of wiſdom, and therefore when the Scripture would ſet forth the excellency of wiſdom, it ſets it forth by the wiſdom of the Angels. Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> rejoyced that he came into priſon with
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:57146:301"/>
Maſter <hi>Bradford,</hi> that <hi>Angel Bradford,</hi> though he was but one that had the <hi>likeneſs</hi> of an Angel, and in priſon, yet he rejoyced in being with him: What rejoycing will there be to be with all the Angels that are Angels <hi>indeed,</hi> and that in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe? The way and maner of the converſe of Saints with Angels is very obſcure; how ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits do converſe one with another, we know but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; we converſe one with another by ſpeaking, there can be no ſuch way of converſe with Spirits. The Schoolmen ſay, By the act of their wills, they come to make known what is in their mindes, but we ſhall know more of the maner of converſe with them afterwards.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>BUt it is more familiar to us, to know our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in the converſe with the Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. <hi>To the general Aſſembly, and Church of the firſt-born, which are written in heaven, &amp;c.</hi> To enjoy communion with the Saints here is ſweet, to enjoy communion with all the Saints, with all the <hi>Patriarchs, Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> and all the good <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the good <hi>Kings,</hi> and all <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and Worthies of the Lord: If to have communion with one or two be ſweet, then to have communion with all at once muſt needs be ſweet; it is worth the enduring much
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:57146:302"/>
to get to heaven, if it were onely to have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to have communion with none but them: to have communion with the Saints is ſweet, <note place="margin">2.</note> though we are forced to have communion with the world, but to have communion with the choiceſt of Gods ſervants, &amp; with none elſe, that is ſweet indeed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to have communion with them <hi>made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</hi> The beſt <hi>now</hi> have many weakneſſes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">3.</note> frampold moods, and offenſive carriages, that there muſt be a great deal born in communion with the beſt; but then we ſhall be delivered from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, there ſhall be no ignorance, but we ſhall have communion with thoſe that are knowing, and perfectly glorified. <hi>The life of my Lord ſhall be bound up in the bundle of life;</hi> it is the bleſſing of <hi>Abigail</hi> to <hi>David:</hi> Now Interpreters expound it thus, It is a Metaphor, taken from binding up of yong plants that are removed from one place to be ſet in another: Now there is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a bundle of plants laid in the water, to preſerve them till they be ſet in the garden, and thoſe plants growing and flouriſhing in the garden: It is a great bleſſing to be bound up amongſt Gods people here, that are plants that have life; but we are here but as plants, bound up and laid in water, reſerved till we ſhall come to be planted in Heaven, and there to flouriſh: There is much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gods people, what they are here, and what they ſhall be in Heaven, as there is between a plant that is bound up, and laid in water to be kept alive, and when it is in the Orchard, green and flouriſhing, and bringing forth fruit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="587" facs="tcp:57146:302"/>
Fourthly, to have communion with them, when we ſhall know one another perfectly: It is an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">4.</note> of <hi>Thomas,</hi> as you heard, <hi>That the bodies of the Saints ſhall be ſo tranſparent, that they ſhall be able to ſee through one anothers bodies, as through a glaſs:</hi> Howſoever that be, yet the ſouls of one another, and the graces, and goodneſs of one another, ſhall be fully made known to one another: If now we did converſe with a company of people, that we knew certainly had all true grace, and were all elected from all eternity, what an admirable comfort would this be? our communion is comfortable, becauſe we have ſome hopes of their election, and we ſee ſome ſigns of grace; but if we were certain of this, if God ſhould ſpeak from Heaven concerning the pooreſt member of a Church, and ſay, <hi>This man,</hi> or <hi>woman,</hi> is the man or woman that <hi>I have had thoughts upon from all eternity, and have elected to everlaſting glory;</hi> would we not prize ſuch a one, and rejoyce to have ſuch a one in our families and houſes? Now when we come to Heaven, we ſhall certainly know every one was elected from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſo ſhall live with us to eternity; we ſhall never have any fears or ſuſpitions of them, leſt they ſhould be hypocrites, as there are fears and ſuſpitions given of one another now.</p>
                  <p>And then to have communion with them, when <note place="margin">5.</note> there ſhall be perfect love and union of heart to one another, that one ſhall love another as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and rejoyce in the glory and proſperity of one another, as well as his own: If one have more glory then another, he that hath leaſt glory, ſhall rejoyce in him that hath more glory, as if it were his
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:57146:303"/>
own, and therefore there ſhall not be any want of glory to any; ſays <hi>Anſelm, Every Saint ſhall love</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iuſti dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt Deum pluſquam ſeipſos, &amp; anvicem tanquam ſeipſos &amp; Deus illos pluſquam illi ſeipſos, quia illi illum, &amp; ſe, &amp; invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem per il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, &amp; ille ſe &amp; illos per ſeipſum,</hi> Anſelm. in proſol. c. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>God above himſelf, and love one another as himſelf, and God ſhall love them all, more then they either love themſelves or one another;</hi> and he gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, ſays he, <hi>They love both themſelves and one another for God, and by God, and God loves himſelf and them for himſelf, and by himſelf;</hi> and therefore as they ſhall love God above themſelves, ſo they ſhall love one another like themſelves, and rejoyce in the happineſs of another, as in their own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: Now what an heaven upon earth is it to have brethren live together in unity? if it be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily communion, or in Church communion, to have entire love without any breaches, this is a bleſſing; but howſoever, while we are in this world, there will be breaches, yet there is an heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> coming, where we ſhall live without breaches.</p>
                  <p>And then likewiſe to have communion one with another always in holy exerciſes: To have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion one with another in our civil converſe, to eat, and drink at one anothers tables, and in recreating our ſelves, this is ſweet; but communion in holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and holy duties, that is ſweeteſt. Men love communion and ſociety here, that they may play together, and eat and drink together; indeed, if it be in a moderate Chriſtian way, there may be ſome delight in it; but know, it is an evident ſign of a carnal heart, when as thy chief affections ſhall be let out in the exerciſing thy ſelf that way: If the chief joy of your hearts be not in exerciſing your ſelves in holy duties, your hearts are carnal: There is a great deal of difference between that day, in
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:57146:303"/>
which a company of gracious men have communion with one another in recreating themſelves, and that day wherein they ſhall have communion with one another in exerciſing themſelves in holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, in praying together, and hearing the Word together; and therefore examine whether you finde a day of communion with Gods people in holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, better then a day of communion in outward ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is ſuch a communion as we ſhall never <note place="margin">7.</note> part with, ſuch a communion as we ſhall always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy: Here we have communion, but it is often dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe we are often in our dumps, and many times there is an occaſion of ſorrow given; but to have communion where there ſhall be always joy, continual being at the feaſt, the ſupper of the Lamb, that muſt needs be ſweet. Therefore that Text you have of <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom, ſets out the continual feaſt of the Lamb that the Saints ſhall have, becauſe that was the maner of the <hi>Jews</hi> feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to lean in the boſom of one another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>John</hi> when he ſate to eat with Chriſt, he leaned in his boſom, noting that the Saints ſhall be always as the children of the Bride-Chamber: There is a queſtion made by ſome, of the knowing of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>another in heaven. It is reported of <hi>Luther,</hi> the night before he dyed, he was reaſonable well, and ſate with his friends at the Table, and the matter of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was, Whether they ſhould know one another in heaven or no, whether the father ſhould know the childe, or the childe the father? <hi>Luther</hi> held it affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively; and this was one reaſon he gave, As it was with <hi>Adam,</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw <hi>Eve,</hi> he knew what
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:57146:304"/>
                     <hi>Eve</hi> was, not by diſcourſe, but by the Spirit of God, telling him what ſhe was; and ſo we being filled with the Spirit of God, we ſhall come to know one another, we ſhall ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> we ſhall have communion with them, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as godly men, but as with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and if with them, why not with others? This we have in Scripture, that ſpiritual relations ſhall adde much to the glory of the people of God in Heaven, though natural relations ſhall be taken away; as the <hi>Father,</hi> if he know the childe, there ſhall not be that natural affection to the childe as is now; yet the Scripture ſeems to ſpeak of ſpiritual relations, that they ſhall continue even in Heaven for the glory of the Saints; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to the <hi>Philippians, You are our crown, and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the day of Chriſt:</hi> It ſhall be known, who were converted by ſuch a Miniſtery, and it ſhall be a crown to a Miniſter, that ſuch were converted, and edified, and built up by him.</p>
                  <p>But we need not trouble our ſelves about this queſtion, becauſe we have one thing that will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us, about all queſtions that are not clear: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall have all that happineſs we do think in our thoughts, or can think, or elſe we ſhall have that (we being our own judges and chooſers) that ſhall be as good or better: ſo that if a Parent thinks what an happineſs were it for me to ſee my childe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and the childe ſhall think, what an happineſs were it for me to ſee my Parents in Heaven, you think ſo here: We gueſs at things thus childiſhly, but yet either this ſhall be, or that which is as good or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then this. As ſuppoſe I ſhould think, how glad
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:57146:304"/>
ſhould I be if ſuch a one would give me a ſhilling, if after I come to know he will give me this, or a Twenty ſhilling piece, I do not trouble my ſelf to know whether he will give me a ſhilling or no. And ſo much for <hi>Communion with the Angels and Saints.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, they ſhall be exerciſed in the higheſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments <note place="margin">1.</note> that any creature can be exerciſed in, or that they are capable to be exerciſed in: The happineſs of a creature conſiſts much in that which it is exerciſed in; as there is a great deal of difference
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:57146:305"/>
between the happineſs of a Noble-man in Court, and the happineſs of one that is employed onely in cleanſing channels, and the meaneſt employment that is, becauſe their exerciſe is different; the one is exerciſed about buſineſs that concerns a King, and a <hi>State,</hi> and the other is imployed about mean things; therefore according as the exerciſe is, that any creature is raiſed to, ſo is the dignity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of that creature: Now we are exerciſed in mean things here, in compariſon of what we ſhall be hereafter, and yet our buſineſs here in making proviſion for the fleſh, in getting meat, and drink, and clothes, and money, is ſweet; but though out of obedience to God, we ought to go on comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in our callings and places wherein God hath ſet us, becauſe God calls us to theſe low mean things, yet we are to account them a mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in regard of that which our natures are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, it is but a ſore travel that is laid upon man, and this ſhall not ſatisfie us, as if we were capable of no higher things; but when we ſhall be raiſed to be buſied about the higheſt employments that a created ſubſtance is capable to be buſied about, <hi>that</hi> muſt be comfortable; as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>The high</hi>

redemption, from all his works in Heaven, and the higheſt glory, that he hath from all the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of himſelf to the Saints in Heaven, in his praiſes that they ſhall be exerciſed in: all the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that we have from God here, is a way of ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency unto the actual praiſing of God; there what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God communicates to his creature, the top of all is not that the creature ſhould have it, but that it ſhould reflect the praiſe of all upon God. The end of all that God does in the world is his glory that he ſhall have in Heaven, and the end of all he does in Heaven, is the actual working of the ſouls of his Saints upon himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the happineſs of the <hi>perpetual Sabbath,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> may be expreſſed in this, in that the ſouls of Gods people ſhall be always up, and fit for theſe high works: God calls us many times to moſt excellent things, to be exerciſed about himſelf, but our hearts are not fit for theſe exerciſes; ſometimes we finde our hearts enlarged, and when our hearts are up, we take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in holy exerciſes; but at other times, how hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are we drawn to them? and we are weary in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and count it a ſlavery, thoſe exerciſes are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to us; but there is a time coming, when our hearts ſhall be always up, never to ſeek, but ſhall be always upon the higheſt pin, enflamed with heat continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: as it is an heavy curſe for a mans heart to be ſuitable and fitted for temptation, when a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall come; ſo it is a wonderful bleſſing to be fitted for any holy employment, when we are called to it; this there ſhal be always in the Saints in heaven, in keeping this their perpetual Sabbath. It is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Anſelm,</hi> as he was walking out of his houſe,
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:57146:306"/>
he ſaw a bird, that was fluttering to fly up, and could not get up, but fell down, and looking upon it wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſaw a ſtring tyed to the leg, and a ſtone at the end; upon this his heart broke, and he bemoaned himſelf, <hi>This is my condition,</hi> ſays he, <hi>though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I would fain get up in holy exerciſes with God, O but this burthen of ſin, and weight of ſin, is like a ſtone, and preſſes me down, when I am got up a little way, I am pull'd down again, my heart is ſeldom fitted for holy exerciſes:</hi> So it is with us uſually, though through Gods grace there are ſome wings to move up a little, yet this weight and burthen of ſins preſſes us down, and makes us unfit for holy duties; let us go humbly a while under that ſore burthen, but know we ſhall be freed from it ere long.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the happineſs of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> conſiſts in this, there ſhall be no intermiſſion, but they ſhall continue <note place="margin">3.</note> day and night (though there ſhall be no night) then we ſhall not go to duty and break off again, and go again, and break off again, no, there ſhall be no other imployment; though the duties of Gods worſhip here be of an excellent nature, yet we are not to ſpend all our time in them; but then there ſhall be nothing elſe to ſpend one moment of time in to all eternity.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there ſhall be no wearineſs; though we do ſpend ſome time in holy exerciſes here, we are <note place="margin">4.</note> quickly weary before we have done, <hi>Though the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be willing, the fleſh is weak;</hi> but when we ſhall have been praiſing of God millions of years, we ſhall be as freſh at the end of them, as at the firſt moment; when we are exerciſed in holy duties with others, it is good to conſider of their weakneſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be able to hold out, and joyn with us; but
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:57146:306"/>
there we ſhall not need fear wearineſs in our ſelves, or any others.</p>
                  <p>Again, we ſhall ſee nothing elſe done by no body elſe: Here we get together, and <hi>ſing,</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> and <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>hear</hi> the Word, and this is comfortable; but we ſee the Sabbath broken by <hi>others,</hi> and that damps our hearts; but there is a Sabbath coming ſhall be ſo kept, as we ſhall ſee none break it, but every one we have to deal withal ſhall keep it: But yet by the way, it is better in a place where it is not altogether ſo well kept, and is in a riſing way, then in a place where it is better kept for the preſent, but is in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining way; but though it be a grief to us to ſee the Sabbath broken, yet know, there is a Sabbath coming that we ſhall keep, and none ſhall break it.</p>
                  <p>Again, the happineſs of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> conſiſts in this, to keep this Sabbath in theſe high exerciſes, <note place="margin">6.</note> when ſo many thouſands ſhall be yelling and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the wrath of an infinite God; they ſhall conſider, we are now in the preſence of God, keeping a Sabbath unto him, as the children of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, ſinging ſongs of triumph to him that ſits upon the throne for ever; whereas others are caſt out from God, and are roaring and yelling under the burthen of the wrath of an infinite God, and that might have been our portion: This addes to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Saints; and therefore the Scripture hath this expreſſion, <hi>Without ſhall be dogs:</hi> That expreſſion is taken from the maner of the <hi>Iews</hi> marriages, uſually they were in the night, and the Bridegroom and his Bride and their company were taken in with torches and delight into the Bride-chamber, others were <hi>without</hi> without light, &amp; not taken into the chamber:
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:57146:307"/>
ſo in Heaven, ſome ſhall be taken to be exerciſed in theſe glorious things, and others are caſt out: as would it not adde much to ones happineſs, to think thus with ones ſelf; I am now going into a place where I ſhall have abundance of mirth and joy with my friends; and others in the mean time lie in the cold, ſtarving in the dungeon, and I might have been there as well as they: if a man ſhould go along with the <hi>King</hi> in triumph, and be at the right hand of the King in glory, and as he goes by, he ſhould hear a company of poor wretches out of a dungeon, crying, yelling, this ſets out his glory: ſo to be at that time, thus exerciſed in thoſe heavenly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when as others ſhall be curſing themſelves, and the time that they were born, and blaſpheme the name of God: it is a comfort to a company of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hearts when they are got together in holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, to think there are others in the Tavern, drinking and ſwilling, and blaſpheming: what difference is between our condition this day, and their condition? this does mightily refreſh ones heart, and enlarge it to praiſe God for his mercy; and ſo in Heaven the Saints ſhall know every inſtant when they are keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Sabbath; others are howling under the wrath of God, and curſing the time they were born.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this <hi>Sabbath</hi> is to be kept in our <hi>Fathers houſe:</hi> we ſhall not ſing the ſongs of <hi>Zion in a ſtrange Land,</hi> but in our Fathers houſe. Thoſe godly perſons in the times of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> accounted themſelves happy, that they might worſhip and ſerve God though in the Dens, and Caves of the Earth; it will be more happineſs to ſerve God in Heaven, and in our Fathers Houſe. I remember I read of one
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:57146:307"/>
                     <hi>Marcellus</hi> a godly man, being caſt into a ſtinking place, he did make that his Temple to God, and perfumed it with his prayers, and after the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans built a Temple in that place; and ſo we may make a filthy dungeon a Temple; but if it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to be exerciſed in holy duties in the moſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and vile places, much more comfortable ſhall it be when we come to Heaven, in our Fathers houſe. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. we read of thoſe that ſung the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they ſtood upon the ſea of glaſs mingled with fire; to ſing the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> though it be upon the ſea of glaſs, this uncertain life of ours full of trouble, it is comfortable, but to ſing it in our Fathers houſe, will be comfortable indeed; though we do meet with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles here, yet if we can enjoy the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our ſelves, but we ſhall have a better Sabbath then theſe, even a perpetual Sabbath in our Fathers houſe; put theſe together, and you ſhall ſee what this perpetual Sabbath is that Gods people ſhall have <note place="margin">
                        <hi>O gaudium ſuper gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens omne gaudium, extra quod non eſt gau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dium,</hi> Aug. Sol c 35.</note> in heaven. Now put all together that we have ſaid negatively, comparatively and poſitively, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their natures, their bodies, and ſouls, and whole perſons; their glory at the day of judgement, their poſſeſſion of heaven, their having God to be their portion, their communion with Chriſt, their communion with the Angels and Saints, and this perpetual Sabbath that they ſhall keep, and do but apprehend what infinite joy muſt flow from all theſe; theſe are as the ſeveral ſtreams of this Paradiſe of God. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. we read of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> that God made for <hi>Adam,</hi> and there were four ſtreams that were to water it; this Paradiſe of Heaven have theſe ſeven ſtreams to water it, to make the Saints happy; do
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:57146:308"/>
but conſider what infinite joy muſt flow from all theſe put together; every one does cauſe joy, but put <note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Saints <hi>joy</hi> in heaven.</note> them all together, and the joy that comes from hence is a moſt <hi>pure</hi> joy, and a moſt <hi>ſpiritual</hi> joy, and a <hi>full</hi> joy, and a <hi>divine</hi> joy.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>pure;</hi> that is, not onely free from any mixture <note place="margin">1. <hi>Uſque adcò nulia cſt ſincera vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lupts, Sc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitumque aliquid lae tis interve ait.</hi>
                     </note> of ſorrow, but without any thing that ſhould ſully it, without any ſin: Here all our pleaſures are mixed.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>ſpiritual:</hi> If it were to rejoyce in the good that our bodies ſhall have, it were admirable joy, but the joy ſhall not be ſo much in regard of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our bodies, but in regard that God is our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ſhall be ſpiritual; yea, the happineſs of our <note place="margin">2.</note> bodies ſhall be ſpiritual and ſupernatural.</p>
                  <p>And it ſhall be <hi>full:</hi> How full muſt it needs be, <note place="margin">3.</note> they ſhall enter into their joy, becauſe the joy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into them: <hi>We rejoyce in believing with joy unſpeakable and glorious: If the ſeed time be ſo glorious, how glorious will the harveſt be?</hi> ſays <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Non guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt, ſed ſatiabuntur &amp; imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buntur.</note> 
                     <hi>They ſhall not taſte, but they ſhall be abundantly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe:</hi> The fatneſs of Gods houſe in the world does abundantly ſatisfie the ſouls of Gods people, but the fatneſs of Gods houſe hereafter, how will that ſatisfie them? The people of God ſhall have ſuch objects to rejoyce in, as is the eſſential glory of God, and all the glory that is put upon him by all his creatures, and all the good they have by Gods communication of himſelf to them, and all the glory of one another: Look how many Saints ſhall be in heaven, they ſhall rejoyce in every ones happineſs as in their own; their own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs will cauſe joy, but ſo many Saints as ſhall be happy, ſo many times ſhall their joy be double, and
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:57146:308"/>
therefore it muſt be <hi>full</hi> joy: Comfort proceeds from the ſuitableneſs between the faculty and the object; now here is the greateſt ſuitableneſs between the faculty and the object that can be, becauſe here is not onely good in the Concreat, but goodneſs in the Abſtract; and union with goodneſs it ſelf, is more then union with a good thing. Surely the joys of heaven muſt needs be great, becauſe a little taſte of them here that the <hi>Martyrs</hi> have had, hath made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite tortures, grievous and dreadful pains, not onely tolerable, but comfortable.</p>
                  <p>And it is <hi>Divine</hi> joy: It may be ſaid to be Divine in three reſpects: Firſt, it comes <hi>from</hi> God: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">4.</note> it is <hi>in</hi> God: Thirdly, it is <hi>with</hi> God. Firſt, it comes from God, being cauſed <hi>by</hi> the Spirit of God, <note place="margin">1.</note> and that is another maner of joy then the men of the world have. Secondly, it is <hi>in</hi> God, rejoycing in <note place="margin">2.</note> God, and that is other maner of joy then rejoycing in meat and drink: Look what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the excellency that is in God, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency that there is in meat, and drink, and idle ſports, ſo much difference is between the joy that Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have in God, and the joy that wicked men have in the creature: And it is divine, in regard that it is joy <hi>with</hi> God, it is the ſame joy that God himſelf hath; <note place="margin">3.</note> carnal hearts rejoyce one with another in ſenſual things, but God does not rejoyce in thoſe things you rejoyce in, but the Saints in heaven ſhall be exerciſed in the ſame joy that God himſelf hath, and rejoyce in the ſame things that God ſhall rejoyce in; to have the beams of our joy mingle with the beams of Gods joy, and ſo to have Gods joy and ours put into one, that muſt needs be admirable joy. Notwithſtanding this
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:57146:309"/>
joy of the Saints ſhall be thus glorious, yet the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt happineſs of man conſiſts not in it; though joy be a neceſſary concomitant to mans bleſſedneſs, yet mans bleſſedneſs conſiſts not in it. We do not ſeek <note place="margin">

                  <p>And beſides all this, there are ſome circumſtances that ſerve to ſet out all that I have ſaid yet further, and to make the happineſs of Gods people yet more glorious.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is a prepared happineſs, that happineſs that God hath had his thoughts upon from all eternity, and laid the ground of it from all eternity, God hath been working from all eternity to provide this.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that it comes to the people of God, by ſuch a glorious way, as the purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt, that I have it, and that I have it by ſuch a glorious way, that will be exceeding comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that we who are ſo vile, and ſo wretched, and ſo abominable as we are in our ſelves, that we who by nature are but firebrands of hell and fuel for eternal wrath, that we ſhould be raiſed to ſuch a height of happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that we are ſo few: <hi>Not many wiſe, nor rich, nor noble, but the mean ones of the world,</hi> that there ſhould be ſo many of the world, and the great ones of
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:57146:309"/>
the world caſt out, and a handful of poor contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible people ſhould be raiſed to this glory, this is a mighty aggravation of the happineſs of Gods people.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, that this ſhould be a reward for that which <note place="margin">5.</note> we owe in a way of obedience; we owe all our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in a way of obedience to God, and we may ſay, <hi>When we have done all, we are unprofitable Servants;</hi> and that we do, we are bound to do as creatures, and yet that God ſhould reward that which we owe to him in a way of obedience, this aggravates the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Saints: as if a Maſter ſhould give his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant all his eſtate for doing that which he is bound to do: We have more then wages here, then how much more is that we ſhall have hereafter?</p>
                  <p>Again, that which God is pleaſed to reward, it is <note place="margin">6.</note> but poor mixt ſervice: take our duties at the beſt, they are ſuch as deſerve Hell; there is no one act, but if God ſhould obſerve what is amiſs, you deſerve to be caſt from God for ever for it; now when we rather deſerve that God ſhould caſt us down to Hell, yet that God ſhould reward us with all this glory, what a glorious thing is this?</p>
                  <p>Again, that the Lord is pleaſed to make this ſure to us: if God had left it to uncertainty, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <note place="margin">7.</note> us work, it might be well with us, and may be he will think of us, this might have been a comfort to us: but that God is pleaſed to binde himſelf thus, and to make all ſure: As if a King ſhould make his Crown &amp; Kingdom ſure to a poor wretch, in the way of reward for a poor ſervice; ſo does God, he makes this glory ours by reward, in a way of Covenant and Teſtament; by Covenant, ſuch a Covenant as he does not only cauſe to be written in his word, but in our
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:57146:310"/>
hearts; &amp; we have witneſs of this in heaven and earth, three bear witneſs in heaven, and three in earth; and he gives us ſeals to confirm this Covenant, and he confirms it by an Oath, he ſwears by himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no greater to ſwear by; and he makes it ſure by way of Teſtament: Covenant we think we may break, but that which is given by Teſtament, and confirmed by the death of the Teſtator, that is ſure, and thus hath God made it ſure unto us.</p>
                  <p>Again, all things that do befal us in this world, <note place="margin">8.</note> and all the ways of Gods providence, do but tend to the furtherance of us to our reward, and to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our reward, and that is the wonderful hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Gods people, this ſhould ſweeten all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: If I be in a meaner condition then another, yet this is in order to my reward, and this is more then if I had a Kingdom in the world, if it were not in order to that; but whatſoever I have in the world, though never ſo hard to fleſh and blood, it is in order to <hi>this,</hi> this ſatisfies.</p>
                  <p>Again, this reward is near, we ſhall not ſtay long <note place="margin">9.</note> for it: If God required of us to be burning a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, and then to have it, we had yet cauſe to rejoyce; but it is at hand, and nearer at hand to us in this latter age of the world, then to our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; God hath but a few things to do in the world, to gather but a few more of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and his own people the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to pull down <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and then all is done: <hi>The time is ſhort,</hi> ſays the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; the word that is tranſlated <hi>ſhort,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29. is a Metaphor taken from a piece of cloth that is <note place="margin">

<pb n="603" facs="tcp:57146:310"/>
the end, and then all this glory ſhall appear; the frame of Heaven and earth does but ſtand till that time, and if that time were come, the frame of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth ſhould preſently be diſſolved, and the ways of Gods providence in this world ſhould be at an end, the Heavens and earth groan for this time. It is ſaid of Doctor <hi>Taylor,</hi> when he was near at the ſtake, he fetch'd a leap, and ſaid, <hi>I have but two ſtiles to my Fathers houſe.</hi> We in our way here are as Travellers, ſome ride it may be a little faſter, and get to the Inn firſt, and then another comes a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or half an hour after, but it is but a ſhort time in compariſon; he hath promiſed, and he will come quickly, with the glory of his Father, and all the glory of Heaven with him.</p>
                  <p>And then this ſhall be after all our troubles: As Painters firſt draw all black, and then the other <note place="margin">10.</note> beautiful colours; ſo all our troubles here are but as the black ground-work, to make our glory the more <note place="margin">Italiam, Italia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus concla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat Acha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Italiam ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cii laeto clamore ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutant.</note> beautiful hereafter: To ſee land after a long and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous voyage, how joyful is it?

                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, all theſe things are eternal; this puts an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs of worth upon every particular: How was <hi>Haman</hi> puffed up by <hi>Eſthers</hi> inviting of him to one Banquet?

was bleſſed in having the Ark but three moneths in his houſe, how bleſſed they who ſhall have Gods not onely gracious but glorious preſence eternally? And ſo I come to the fourth particular, which was propounded in the handling of this point; namely,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Wherein lies the power of the conſideration of the recompence of reward to help a man through ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</hi> Much hath been ſaid, but more may be ſaid, to ſhew that there is a mighty power in it to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the heart to ſuffer any thing for God; it is that which hath mightily wrought upon the Saints of God heretofore: That is an obſervable place that we have concerning Chriſts Transfiguration, and Chriſts Agony: when he was transfigured upon the Mount, and his glory was ſhewed, even a glimpſe of the glory of Heaven; Chriſt took with him onely three Diſciples, <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> afterward when Chriſt was to come to his Agony, when his ſoul was heavy to death, and he ſweat clods of blood, he onely took thoſe three Diſciples that had ſeen him in his glory, to ſee him in his ſufferings; to ſhew, that thoſe that know what the glory of Chriſt means, thoſe are the fitteſt to joyn with Chriſt in his Agony, and to endure the greateſt ſufferings that they can meet withal. See in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of a cruel Tyrant that ſhould make War with the Saints, and ſhould perſecute Gods people, that devoured and brake in pieces, yet there were ſome that ſhould bear out all, that ſhould have the Kingdom given them, and God ſhould reward them gloriouſly; Who are they? at the 22 verſe, <hi>The Saints of the moſt high:</hi> ſo you read it, or, <hi>The</hi>

                  <p>So thoſe that ſhould hold out in the time of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> and ſhould not worſhip the <hi>Beaſt, Rev.</hi> 13. 6, 7, 8. were ſuch as dwelt in Heaven. He opened his mouth in blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his Name, and his Tabernacle, and them that dwelt in Heaven: in many places of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> Heaven is taken for the Church of God, and the People of God, and ſo Interpreters take it here: And it was given to him to war with the Saints, and to overcome them: but though he prevailed againſt the Saints to kill them, yet he could not prevail againſt them that dwelt in <hi>Heaven</hi> to worſhip him: but all that dwell upon the <hi>Earth</hi> ſhall worſhip him; all that know no higher good then the Earth, they ſhall follow Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and worſhip him. Here we ſee the reaſon why people will not endure the ſufferings inflicted by the Beaſt, but follow the Beaſt, &amp; have <hi>his mark either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their foreheads</hi> openly, or in their hands ſecretly, becauſe they do not apprehend the glory of Heaven; but if they can come to ſee thoſe glorious things of Heaven, though <hi>Antichriſt</hi> do perſecute them, they would not worſhip him: in theſe latter times of the world Antichriſt will prevail to get many to worſhip him, but the ſight of theſe glorious things will keep us we ſhall not worſhip him. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. the Church who is compared to a <hi>Woman</hi> that was cloathed with the

to be nothing, that muſt needs have a great deal of power to enable the heart to part with any thing in the world in the cauſe of God: thoſe who by the eye of faith are able to behold the reality and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of thoſe glorious things, they look upon all things below as poor, mean, ſlight, contemptible things: As we know the glory of the light of the <hi>Sun,</hi> darkens the glory of the light of a candle; the light of a candle is comfortable in the night, in the dark, but when the light of the <hi>Sun</hi> riſeth, that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: So long as the men of the world are in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the light and comfort of the creature is a great matter to them; but when God lets the glory of the things of his Kingdom appear to them, then the comfort of the creature is nothing. A Glow-worm gliſters in the dark, but when the day comes, the brightneſs and the gliſtering of the Glow-worm is not ſeen: ſo all the brightneſs and gliſtering of the creature that takes the hearts of men, is gone when God lifts up his light upon them, and ſhews them the greatneſs of his Kingdom.</p>

greater glory diminiſheth that which is leſs. So that we may apply that the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning the compariſon of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> with the <hi>Law,</hi> to this we are ſpeaking of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. That which was made glorious, had no glory in this reſpect, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the glory that excelleth; though there was ſome glory in the adminiſtration of the Law, yet it is no glory in compariſon of that which excelleth: So though there may be glory in the outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the world, yet there is no glory in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that glory which excelleth, in compariſon of that glory which hath been opened; and that is the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the glory of the world is darkned by <note place="margin">2.</note> having reſpect to this glorious <hi>recompence of reward,</hi> ſo all the evils of the world are wonderfully leſſened: You know what the Apoſtle ſays, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. <note place="margin">

                     <hi>That the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us:</hi> As we uſe to ſay, It is not to be named the ſame day, not to be reckoned with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us: A <hi>Father</hi> upon that place hath a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gloſs, ſays he, <hi>Sufferings are not to be compared &amp; looked upon, in reſpect, first of the puniſhment that we have deſerved, which is paſſed by, and pardoned; and then not to be compared and reckoned with the preſent grace and comfort that Gods people have here:</hi> But then much leſs is to be compared and reckoned with the weight of glory that is to come, that is promiſed to us. And ſo in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17, 18. <hi>While we look at things that are eternal, not tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, this light affliction;</hi> all is but light, and nothing in compariſon: What is it for one to have a rainy

day, who is going to take poſſeſſion of a Crown? there is no man would be much ſenſible of a little cold in his head, if it were uncovered a while to have a Crown of gold put on. I have read of a fooliſh woman that was afraid her Son ſhould get cold by putting off his night-cap to have a Crown ſet upon his head; but no wiſe man would much conſider the cold he ſhould get in his head upon that ground: Great things ſwallow up ſmall things, and great joys will ſwallow up ſmall evils; there is no compariſon between the evil we ſuffer here, and the glory that is to come; What is a drop of vinegar put into an Ocean of ſweet wine? it is not ſo much as taken notice of; here when a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a great good, he is not affected with leſſer evils: As for example in <hi>Saul,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> had the Kingdom, ſome did deſpiſe him, 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 10. 27. but <hi>Saul</hi> held his peace; he was not troubled at that, though he was a man afterward froward enough; he thought, this good of the Kingdom is enough to take away the apprehenſion of any evil in being deſpiſed; what though a company of poor people deſpiſe me, and ſpeak againſt me when as I have the Kingdom, and am anointed of God, and have this dignity put upon me? A man that knows any thing of his own worth, and that God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed much upon him; this takes off any other evil, that appears to be in others prating of him; but now when men do not underſtand any great good in themſelves, then they account the evil of the world deſpiſing them a great evil: Many men judge of themſelves rather by the eſteem other men have of them, then by any good they know
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:57146:314"/>
in themſelves, and no marvel though theſe men be ſo much troubled at other mens deſpiſing of them. If a Merchant have a Ship come home la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with many thouſand pounds worth of rich Commodities, though his Servant ſhould do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſs that day, he would not be froward at it, but paſs it by, becauſe he hath ſuch great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and good coming in; ſo the evils of the world are nothing in compariſon to that ſoul that knows the great things of the Kingdom of God to be its own.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is a mighty deal of power in it; becauſe this reſpect unto the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, does ſo much take up the faculties of the ſoul, the intention of the minde being taken up about ſo great an object, other things are not minded in compariſon; and this is the reaſon why thoſe that are in a phrenſie, are inſenſible of what you do unto them; becauſe their mindes are taken up about that which they apprehend ſo ſtrongly, as nothing elſe is minded by them; and if there was any object made known to take up the minde of man, it muſt be ſuch great things as theſe, made certain and real to the ſoul by faith. It is a property peculiar to God, that though he hath many glorious things that he exerciſes his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom about, yet he does minde the leaſt thing, the leaſt creature in the world, as much as if there were nothing elſe to minde; but no creature can do ſo, no creature can minde great things with intention of minde, and yet minde inferior things with any ſtrength of intention too, but if he mindes great things with intention, other things muſt be lightly
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:57146:315"/>
minded. An Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorian tells us of the Chriſtians they did ſo minde the glory of God, and the glory of Heaven, as that the pains they ſuffered were as in the bodies of other men, and not in their own bodies. It is reported of <hi>Archimides,</hi> who was a great <hi>Mathematician,</hi> that when the City was taken wherein he was, and the Warlike inſtruments of death clattering about his ears, and all was in a tumult, yet he was ſo buſie about drawing his lines, that he did not know there was any danger, and heard no noiſe: If ſuch objects as theſe can take up the intention of the minde, ſo as not to minde other things, then much more ſuch an object as eternal life, and eternal glory and happineſs. And therefore that place is very obſervable, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>We faint not in our ſufferings, becauſe we look not at things that are ſeen, but at things that are not ſeen:</hi> We are ſo intenſe about Heaven, and the glory of God, that we do not give a look at things that are ſeen. So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 15, 16. They were not ſo much as minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of that Countrey from whence they came, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>

Hom. de Barlua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Martyr.</note> 
                     <hi>they ſought a Countrey that was better,</hi> and heavenly. It is a notable expreſſion that <hi>Baſil</hi> hath concerning the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> ſays he, <hi>They do not look at the danger they are in, but at the crown:</hi> And again he ſays, <hi>They do not look at the Officers, and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners that are whipping of them, but they look to the Angels that are giving acclamations, and that are encouraging of them.</hi> As a carnal heart, a man that mindes earthly things, his minde is ſo taken up about them, becauſe they are an object ſuitable to him; as when all the glory of God, and of Chriſt, and of Heaven is ſet before him, he lets it paſs without
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:57146:315"/>
any minding; ſo a gracious heart that by faith can ſee into the reality of the glory of Heaven, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life ſo taken up with them, as not to minde earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things; and that is the third particular.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the reſpect unto the recompence of the reward hath a mighty power to carry on the ſoul in <note place="margin">4.</note> a way of ſuffering, becauſe the ſoul by this comes to ſee how infinitely well pleaſed God is with it, and with that it undertakes for his names ſake, in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing in his cauſe; and this does mightily prevail with a gracious heart. If God does but give his command to do a thing, this might be enough to ſhew Gods good pleaſure in that action; but when with command God reveals ſuch infinite glorious things that he will reward that action withal, this diſcovers more of the infinite good pleaſure of God; ſo that the ſoul in this does not onely ſee its own happineſs, but ſees the infinite good pleaſure of God in it; and reaſons thus, How hath God ſet his heart upon me? And what infinite good pleaſure is it that he takes, in that I poor worm ſhall ſuffer for his names ſake, when he does not onely tell me it is according to his will, but he hath ſuch infinite glorious things to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that I do, except his heart were much upon it, &amp; taken with it, there would never ſuch great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things have been for the rewarding of it; but in that theſe things are ſo revealed, and I in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſee them, I cannot but think God takes infinite delight in theſe ſufferings, for his names ſake, &amp; God forbid that any thing in the world ſhould take off my heart from that which I ſee God takes ſuch infinite pleaſure in: when a gracious heart ſhall ſee God holding forth a crown to ſet on his head in ſuffering,
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:57146:316"/>
it ſets the ſoul on fire in ſuffering for God; if thou hadſt onely given forth thy command, it had been enough to make all creatures obedient to thee; but that thou ſhouldeſt manifeſt thy ſelf thus to crown them with this glory, and to lay up theſe treaſures of the riches of thy glory for them, Who would not do and ſuffer any thing in thy cauſe, O bleſſed God!</p>
                  <p>The fifth particular, wherein the power of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſts, is the abundance of ſweet that there is <note place="margin">5.</note> in the <hi>hope of this reward,</hi> to fill the heart with joy and peace; the more joy and peace the heart is filled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, the more certainly it is able to do great things. So <hi>Nehemiah</hi> tells the people when he would have them rejoyce, <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength, Neh.</hi> 8. 10. When as the heart is ſtrengthned with joy, it is able to do mighty things; now the hope of theſe glorious things do mightily fill the heart with joy, and ſo ſtrengthens the heart: A man that hath his body ſtrong, he can endure cold, and bear great burthens that a weak body cannot bear; and nothing ſtrengthens the heart more then this <hi>joy of the Lord,</hi> where the heart is filled with it. Veſſels that are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty will ſoon be broke with the heat of the fire, which they will not be if they be full: this hope of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reward fills the heart with precious liquor, that you may ſet it by the fire, and put it into troubles, it will not break. As a Gyant refreſhed with wine, hath great ſtrength to undertake any thing, ſo the ſoul that is filled with this comfort of the hope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and glory, can go forth as a Gyant refreſhed with wine, and make nothing of thoſe things that others make great matters of. When the heart is filled with joy &amp; hope of believing, and ſo filled with light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:57146:316"/>
whatſoever darkneſs is abroad it cares not. As <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius</hi> when he was to dye, and they ſpoke of the light without, ſays he, <hi>What is the light without?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hic ſat lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis:</hi> Clapping his hand upon his breaſt.</note> 
                     <hi>I have light enough within;</hi> And ſo a gracious heart ſays, there is enough within to ſtrengthen me, let there be without what there will. When <hi>Alexander</hi> gave away great things, almoſt all he had, one of his Officers aked him what he would have left for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſays he, <hi>Hope:</hi> ſo ſays a gracious heart, though all things be gone, yet it is enough to fill my heart with joy, that I have <hi>hope</hi> of the glory that is to be reveald.</p>
                  <p>A natural chearful ſpirit can be able to undergo great things, that one that is naturally timorous can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Spirit of a man ſhall ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain his infirmities:</hi> A man that hath a natural chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpirit, is able to ſuſtain many infirmities that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cannot; As for melancholy ſpirits, every thing that comes croſs to them is ready to ſink them, and they cannot undergo. thoſe troubles which a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpirit can, becauſe they want the ſweetneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; What ſtrength is there then in the filling the heart with joy in believing of theſe things? As a man that hath his bones filled with marrow, and hath abundance of good blood, and freſh ſpirits in his body, he can endure to go with leſs cloathes then another, becauſe he is well lined within; ſo it is with a heart that hath a great deal of fat and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, joy and peace within, though ſuch a one hath not many cloathes, and outward comforts to ſtrengthen him, he will go through troubles well enough; <hi>Proverbs</hi> 14. 14. <hi>A good man is ſatisfied from himſelf:</hi> And it is enough for good men to know within themſelves that they have an enduring
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:57146:317"/>
ſubſtance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. A tree that hath a great deal of ſap within, can bear great weights and burthens that others cannot; and that is the fifth ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the hope of theſe things does fill the heart with joy, and ſo ſtrengthens the heart.</p>
                  <p>A ſixth thing wherein the power of having reſpect to the recompence of reward appears, is in that it <note place="margin">6.</note> hath a great deal of power to reſiſt any temptation of Satan, and to quench the fiery darts of Satan. In <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. where the ſpiritual armor is ſpoken of, the <hi>helmet,</hi> the <hi>armor</hi> that is for the head, and keeps that from being hurt with any ſtroke, is the hope of ſalvation, and the hope of glory; ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever temptations of the Devil comes, by this helmet they are kept off, that they do not ſo much as take the judgement: As we might inſtance in the ſeveral temptations that the Devil hath to keep one from ſufferings; as when he comes and ſays, <hi>Why will you undo your ſelves in ſuch a way as this?</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the <hi>hope of ſalvation</hi> is held up, and the ſoul anſwers, It is ſo far from undoing of me, that it is the onely way to provide for my ſelf; <hi>He that will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, and he that will loſe his life for my ſake, ſhall ſave it.</hi> If the Devil comes with this temptation, <hi>Surely God does not require ſuch things of his people, to be brought into ſuch ſtraits, and ſuffer ſuch hard things:</hi> The ſoul that hath the hope of his glory, holds it up, and makes this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; <hi>Why, ſeeing the Lord hath laid up ſuch glorious things hereafter, why ſhould I not think that God may require hard things for the preſent?</hi> If he comes with this temptation, <hi>Why will you go on in a ſingular way from others?</hi> A gracious heart upon this argument,

anſwers, <hi>I expect choice and ſingular mercies from God, and why ſhould I think much to go on in a way that is ſingular? though others do otherwiſe, it may be they ſhal never be partakers of ſuch ſingular things.</hi> If the Devil comes and ſay, <hi>Surely God does not love you, if he did, he would not ſuffer ſuch great calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſore troubles to befal you, and if it were his cauſe, he would aſſiſt you in it:</hi> the ſoul anſwers, <hi>Hath the Lord laid up ſuch glorious things for me hereafter, and ſhall I call Gods love in question, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am deprived of theſe mean things, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ſuch afflictions as theſe?</hi> certainly thoſe things that God hath laid up for me ſhall ſo uphold my heart, as that I ſhall never call in queſtion Gods love, though I ſuffer never ſo much here; and that is the ſixth particular.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, there is a great deal of power in this argument to help on the ſoul in a way of ſuffering, <note place="margin">7.</note> becauſe by looking at this <hi>recompence of reward,</hi> the ſoul comes to ſee what glorious things ſufferings do prepare for, haſten unto, and work to the encreaſe of. Firſt, what glorious things ſufferings prepare for: As it is a notable expreſſion Mr. <hi>Hawks</hi> hath in a Letter he writ to encourage Mr. <hi>Philpot,</hi> being caſt into the <hi>Biſhops Cole-houſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>This Biſhops Cole-houſe is but to ſcour you, and make you bright, and to fit you to be ſet up upon the high ſhelf,</hi> meaning <hi>Heaven;</hi> as when you would ſet up veſſels of braſs, or iron, you firſt take cinders or aſhes and ſcour them, and by rubbing them with ſuch things, they are fit to be ſet up; ſo all ſufferings are but the means that God uſes to ſcour his people to make them bright, to ſet them up on high; God will not ſet up his ſervants

                  <p>Eighthly, there is a great deal of power in this to carry on the ſoul in a way of ſuffering, becauſe it does mightily enflame the ſoul with love to God, and Jeſus Chriſt; it ſeeing that the bottom and ground of all this glorious recompence of reward is in the free and eternal love of God in Jeſus Chriſt, that did work about this before the foundation of the world was laid; this does mightily enflame the heart with love to God, and therefore it wiſhes as that <hi>Martyr</hi> did, <hi>O that I had as many lives as I have hairs on my head to lay down for Chriſt.</hi> And it is ſorry that it hath no other opportunity to teſtifie its love to God, the ſoul ſays, <hi>I have but this little time to teſtifie my love to God, and I can but teſtifie little in doing:</hi> O what a happineſs is it, that that which I want of teſtifying my love in doing, I have it in teſtifying my love in ſuffering!

but a few crums or bones from his Maſter, be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to venture his life in defence of his Maſter; and ſhall not a gracious heart, that expects not crums and bones, but Crowns, and unconceiveable glory in Heaven, be willing to venture life for God in the cauſe of God?</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, there is a great deal of power in having <note place="margin">9.</note> reſpect to the recompence of reward to carry on a ſoul in ſuffering: becauſe according to the things that are apprehended, there is the like impreſſion left upon the ſpirit: As a gracious heart apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy things is made holy, and apprehending ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, is made ſpiritual, and apprehending great things, is made great, thee is a holy gracious magnanimity put into the heart: A man that is lift up on high upon a high Tower, or a high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he looks upon things below as little things: The apprehenſion of this glory lifts the ſoul on high, and puts an impreſſion of greatneſs and glory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart, and ſo cauſeth an heroical ſpirit in the heart, to look upon all things below as ſmall: as the Martyrs, though they were weak ſpirits by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even women and children, yet apprehending ſuch great things, they had heroical magnanimious ſpirits, and looked upon their ſufferings as ſmall things, becauſe they had an impreſſion of the object they beheld left upon their ſpirits, and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure were made like it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there is a mighty deal of power in looking <note place="margin">10.</note> to the recompence of reward to help in ſufferings, becauſe it hath much power to cleanſe the heart: every one that hath this hope purgeth himſelf, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. And hence the Chriſtians in the Primitive times

fering. Thoſe that write the ſtories of <hi>Egypt,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that there is no country in which there are more venemous Creatures then in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and alſo they write, there is no Country hath ſo many Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes to help againſt poyſon: ſo godlineſs brings with it many troubles and ſufferings, but then god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs hath much in it to help againſt troubles and ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hence we come to ſee the reaſon why ſo many are overcome in a way of ſuffering, and do <note place="margin">3.</note> yield, and ſo baſely Apoſtatize, rather then they will go on in a way of ſuffering for God: they have not an eye to look up to Heaven, and to ſee all the glory that is revealed: they do not know within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that there are ſuch things, as it is ſaid of thoſe in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. They knew within themſelves what they had in Heaven; they look upon theſe things as conceits and imaginations. In <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks of ſome <hi>that were enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> but what were they? <hi>They were men that minded earthly things:</hi> but ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Our converſation is in Heaven.</hi> What was the reaſon that <hi>Demas</hi> forſook <hi>Paul?</hi> It was for <hi>this preſent world;</hi> he was not acquainted with the powers of the world to come, and therefore <hi>he forſook Paul,</hi> rather then he would ſuffer in the cauſe of God with <hi>Paul.</hi> Certainly, thoſe that fall off in the time of ſuffering, are ſuch as never had a taſte of the powers to come, or have loſt it: this dew of Heaven hath not faln upon their hearts to moiſten them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every ſuffering does ſcorch up the root: If the root be kept moiſt, though ſcorching heat come, it does not dry up the plant, but it is green and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:57146:320"/>
ſo able to ſuffer, becauſe they had their hearts ſo <hi>purged by faith, Acts</hi> 15. 9. Take a man that was ſtrong, if he have many ill humors in his body, all his ſtrength is gone, but if the Phiſitian gives him ſomething to purge out his ill humors, though hee have no Cordials given him to ſtrengthen him, yet he is ſtrong, and he is able to endure, and to do more then before: So thoſe ſpirits that are full of diſtempered humors, that are unſound, they can bear nothing, undergo no difficulty, but when there is any thing to purge the heart and make it clean, then it is able to do or ſuffer more: ſin lies rotting at the heart, and by rotting does weaken; a rotten rag hath no ſtrength to bear any thing, ſo thoſe that have old ſins lie rotting, they can bear nothing: <hi>The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of power, and of a ſound minde</hi> is put together, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7. now the hope of this glorious reward purges the heart, and makes it ſound, and ſo carries it on in power. Now put all theſe together, and no marvel that <hi>Moſes</hi> by having an eye to the <hi>recompence of reward</hi> could ſuffer ſo much: many are afraid of ſuffering hard things in the cauſe of Chriſt; but you ſee what will enable you to endure all. Now I ſhould apply this in many particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If there be ſuch power in this to help to <note place="margin">1.</note> ſuffering, then ſurely there is power in this to help to ſervice: you that know what theſe things mean, be aſhamed to complain of any difficulty in any ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hence we ſee cauſe much to bleſs God that reveals ſuch things to us, to carry us through <note place="margin">2.</note> ſufferings; though godlineſs brings much ſuffering, yet it brings that which will ſtrengthen againſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:57146:321"/>
ſtill: It is the dew of Heaven, the hope of the glory of Heaven that keeps our root moiſt, and ſo we ſhall hold out in the time of ſuffering: It is given as the cauſe of the ſeed in the ſtony ground not come to perfection, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Becauſe it wanted moiſture;</hi> many froward people in Religion prove like the ſtony ground, they have not moiſture, this dew of Heaven lies not at their hearts: And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why many do not hold out, is becauſe they want the Anchor of hope: In a tempeſt if there be not an Anchor well faſtened, the ſhip will be carried up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rocks or the ſands: Now Hope is the Anchor that muſt hold the ſoul in all affliction, if that hold, let ſtorms and winds be never ſo loud, yet the heart will be kept from being ſplit upon the rocks, and ſwallowed up in the ſands: but many have but a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Anchor, a conceited hope, not a ſtrong hope faſtned upon the infallibility of God in his word and promiſes, and therefore they cannot hold out in the time of danger. To conclude all, we ſee what will do it, what will carry us through ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>Let us make uſe of this argument, and not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the greatneſs of our ſufferings, to think my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are greater then others, but rather let us look up on high to our God, and the greater things that are prepared for us. As St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Noli atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere quam poenam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gello, ſed quem locam in teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> Auguſt. in Pſ. 102.</note> a Chriſtian that was to ſuffer, <hi>Do not ſo much attend what puniſhment thou haſt, what ſhare thou haſt in the whip, or in correction, but what thou haſt in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, in Gods Word, what is revealed there for tby encouragement.</hi> And labor to have the light within you, or elſe all will never do; though many things have been revealed to your eyes, and ſo you may have
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:57146:321"/>
light outwardly; yet if you have not the <hi>inward</hi> light, this outward light will never ſtrengthen you to hold out: And labor for <hi>faith</hi> to put life in all theſe arguments that have been ſpoken of; unleſs faith come and breathe the breath of life upon them, they will all lie dead. Labor that nothing be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your eye and Heaven, and if any thing of the world, or vain reaſonings ſhall come between your eye and Heaven, labor to remove it, keep all clear, that upon the turning of your eye you may ſee beyond the vail; and be not onely thinking of theſe things, and make them lively by faith, but <hi>let your converſation be much in heaven,</hi> ſending up your ſpirits to heaven, and opening your hearts to receive the influence of heaven, and then you will be able to endure what God calls you to: Who knows what God will call us to? God is ſtirring in the world, as if he intended to do ſome great things in the world, and therefore we had need of ſtrong arguments to keep our hearts cloſe to him, when many thouſand hypocrites ſhall fall. And thus we have finiſhed four things in the opening of this point: Firſt, that there is a reward for Gods people. Secondly, how far they may have reſpect to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Thirdly, what the reward is. Fourthly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the power of having reſpect to this reward lay to undergo any ſuffering. Now the fifth thing that remains, is, the Application of all that hath been ſaid.</p>
                  <p>And if there be ſuch a glorious reward for the people of God, then in the firſt place the offence of the <hi>croſs</hi> is taken away; let us be aſhamed ever to be hindred in the way of God, becauſe of the <hi>croſs,</hi>
                     <pb n="624" facs="tcp:57146:322"/>
becauſe of any thing we ſhall ſuffer in the way of God, when as there is ſuch a glorious reward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>No ſtorm of the raging Sea ſhould terrifie us,</hi>

                     <hi>conſidering that everlaſting calm that is a coming,</hi> ſays <hi>Jerome:</hi> Let no man ſpeak hardly of Gods ways any more. I remember I read of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> before his converſion, he ſaid he was convinced of the ways of God, but ſays he, <hi>I did not like to go through thoſe ſtraits:</hi> He found the ways of God difficult, and that he was like to ſuffer much, and that hindred him; and ſo it does many, they ſee ſtraits, they muſt deny themſelves, and ſuffer hard things, and upon this they are hindred; but let us never be hindred more by this, ſeeing there are ſuch great things revealed of the reward of Gods people hereafter: Why ſhould we be ſo ſhy of the way, afflictions that lead thither; is not here enough to pay for all? <hi>God will not,</hi> ſays <hi>Lactantius, have the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Noluit De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us hominem ad immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talem illam beatitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato itinere pervenire,</hi> Lactant. de Officio Dei. c. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>path that leads to this immortal bleſſedneſs, be a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate path.</hi> Certainly, if any of you ſhould be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from the ways of God by any hardſhip you are like to meet withal, how will this confound you, when God ſhall come and ſay, Did not I ſhew unto you thoſe glorious things I intended for my people? and was not all that ſufficient to draw your hearts over theſe difficulties?</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> the offence of the <hi>croſs</hi> was taken away, after once they came to be enlightned in ſuch glorious things as theſe; in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 32. <hi>Call to remembrance the former days, in which after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;</hi> before they were not able to indure that fight of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, but after they were illuminated they were;
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:57146:322"/>
ſo howſoever you might have ſome hard thoughts of the ways of God before, yet now being illuminated, having the light of this bleſſed truth of the reward that is to come, revealed to you, be willing to endure any fight of afflictions; do not look at this ſtumbling block, look up to Heaven, and that wil keep you from ſtumbling. When men walk upon the earth, if they look upward, they may ſtumble upon ſtones &amp; blocks; but it is otherwiſe in our walking in Religion, our looking upwards to heaven does keep us from ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling: Wiſdom is on high; the way of the righteous is a high way, he is lifted above all ſtumbling blocks by looking at this recompence of reward. St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he had his thoughts about this, ſays he, <hi>Neither life, nor death, principalities, nor powers, nor any thing ſhould be able to ſeparate him from the love of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, if there be ſuch a glorious reward, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 2.</note>, that this is a mighty aggravation of the evil of ſin, that when God hath revealed himſelf ſo gracious, as to lay up ſuch glorious things for thoſe that walk in the way of obedience, for any after this yet to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ways of ſin, muſt needs aggravate the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and deſperate wickedneſs of mans heart: There is evil enough in ſin, though we ſhould loſe nothing by it, that it is a diſobedience to God, a breach of the Law, and going againſt the minde of God; but for men to venture upon the ways of ſin, although they know they ſhall loſe ſuch an infinite good as this is, here is not onely deſperate wickedneſs, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate folly; it is a ſign that mans heart is deſperately ſet upon ſin, that he wil go on in ſin, though it be with the loſs of all this glory, and theſe bleſſed things. I remember <hi>Ambroſe</hi> reports of one <hi>Theotimus,</hi>
                     <pb n="626" facs="tcp:57146:323"/>
that having a diſeaſe upon his body, and the Phyſitian told him, Except he did abſtain from intemperance, <hi>drunkenneſs or uncleanneſs,</hi> he was like to loſe his eyes; his heart was deſperately fet upon his ſin, that he ſaid, <hi>Farewel ſweet light then;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <note place="margin">Vale lumen amicum</note> I muſt have my pleaſure in that ſin, if I muſt loſe my eyes, then farewel eyes, <hi>farewel the light.</hi> I ſuppoſe there is none of you dare reaſon thus deſperately, when we come to you in the name of God, and ſpeak of ſome particular ſin that your conſciences tell you you are guilty of, and profeſs unto you as in the name of God, that that way you take cannot ſtand with eternal life, that you muſt eternally periſh, and loſe all that happineſs that God hath prepared for the Saints, perhaps none dare ſay, <hi>Farewel God, and Chriſt, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, and all, I muſt have my ſin:</hi> Though you do not ſay ſo directly, yet if after you have heard all <hi>this,</hi> you go on in a ſinful way, you do in effect ſay ſo; for the Scripture ſays, <hi>Know you not that no drunkard, nor whoremonger, nor covetous, nor unclean perſon, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner, and the like, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of God:</hi> You know this, it is not poſſible that any ſhould be ſo ignorant, but he knows ſuch ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of God; you going on then in ſuch a way, you do as it were ſay, <hi>Farewel God, and heaven, and farewel all that Chriſt hath purchaſed by his blood, rather then I will loſe my ſin:</hi> How will this confound you another day? how will <hi>conſcience</hi> accuſe you? when it ſhall tell you what you have heard, and what you might have had, and you have loſt all for your luſt: God ſhall ſay, <hi>I revealed to you what my ways and counſels were concerning man, that this was the great work and deſign, that I intended to make</hi>

                     <hi>wretched man happy, to bring vile duſt into glory; and was that my great maſter-piece, that I intended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in your eyes, but muſt it be deſpiſed for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of your luſts?</hi> Chriſt ſhall plead againſt you, <hi>Was I content to leave the boſom of my Father, and to be in the form of a ſervant, and to be made a curſe, &amp; to loſe my precious blood, &amp; my life, to purchaſe glory for man, and muſt this be ſlighted for your baſe luſts?</hi> How will the Spirit of God plead againſt you? <hi>What, was not I in the mouth of my Miniſters to reveal theſe glorious things, and deep things of God, that now in the Goſpel are made known, and muſt all that work of mine be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and ſlighted for your baſe luſts?</hi> Yea, how may all the creatures in the earth come to plead againſt you? <hi>Lord, thou didſt not make us capable of any ſuch happineſs as thou didſt the children of men, and yet we did honor and ſerve thee in our order, but thou madeſt this creature capable of eternal happineſs, and yet all is deſpiſed for the ſatisfying of their baſe luſts.</hi> Yea, how may the Devils come and plead againſt thee? <hi>Lord, when we were once fallen, thou wouldſt never enter into covenant with us, to give us any hope of any mercy at all, much leſs hope to receive any ſuch great things; there was hope for theſe wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be eternally happy, and yet they neglected all for their luſts, &amp; therefore ſhal their puniſhment be no more then ours? ſhall their fire be no hotter then ours?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things that I have delivered, though they be comfortable to the people of God, they will be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things to the wicked, and will be a dreadful ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation to ſin, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. <hi>Of how much ſorer puniſhment do you think thoſe worthy of, that in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of theſe things do even tread under foot the blood</hi>

of the Son of God, as <hi>cap.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> If the ſalvation that we ſpeak of were not <hi>great ſalvation,</hi> it would not deſerve ſuch great puniſhment for the neglect of it: See how great the mercy of God is in revealing ſuch great ſalvation, ſo great ſhall the puniſhment be of thoſe that neglect ſuch great ſalvation: We uſe to ſay to ſome that will be bold to venture upon ſuch ways as others will not, They may ſay and do what they will, they have nothing to loſe, but if a man have any thing to loſe he is more wary; it is true, if we had nothing to loſe, it were not ſo much for us to go on boldly and careleſly in our way, but know we are capable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of glory, that we are in danger to loſe if we go on careleſly: Conſider what you are like to loſe, and let that raiſe your heart againſt the ways of ſin, nothing can make it up. For one to do any thing that ſhall prejudice the right to a Crown, this is counted a great offence, and is not paſt by without blood: Sin ſeeks to deprive us of a Crown, of Heaven, of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; O the miſchief that is in ſin! let our hearts riſe againſt it with hatred to death: when any temptation comes, let us uſe this argument as a help to anſwer temptation, O in this temptation there is that will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of all my hope of heaven, &amp; of glory, and of my crown, and of all my good, if I take not heed; and therefore <hi>now</hi> ſhal I ſin? will any ſin do you that good as will countervail the cutting you off the hope of all this glory? will it make you amends for this evil?</p>
                  <p>If a man might have a whole world given him for to loſe his eyes, no wiſe man would loſe the benefit of his fight for the whole world; wilt thou venture the loſs of the ſight of God, and of Chriſt, and of
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:57146:324"/>
all communion to be had with them for a luſt, and for a baſe pleaſure? what worth is in it to make thee ſo venturous? When a temptation to ſin comes, make uſe of this argument, as <hi>Saul</hi> did to his men, <hi>What, can the ſon of Jeſſe give you vineyards, and oliveyards?</hi> So you may ſay to every temptation, to the ways of ſin, What, can my ſin give me Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and glory, and immortality? can my ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me as God will reward me if I walk in his way? If a Chapman ſhould come to you who are Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and offer you for a commodity twenty times leſs then it is worth, your hearts will riſe againſt him, in diſdain and contempt of him: Now when ſin comes to offer any pleaſure or content to the fleſh, let your hearts riſe in diſdain againſt it, it offers you infinitely to your loſs, baſe momentary pleaſure for Heaven, and all the glory that hath been opened to you. As one ſaid when a <hi>Harlot</hi> askt a great price for pleaſure with her one night, <hi>I will not buy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Non tanti emam Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitere.</note> 
                     <hi>at ſuch a rate:</hi> And ſo when ſin comes, ſay, <hi>I will not buy pleaſure at ſuch a rate.</hi> It was an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſin of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they would return into <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was ſo good a Land; So it argues baſe hearts in people to deſpiſe all that is in Heaven, and the glory of it for to turn to <hi>Egypt,</hi> to ſome baſe luſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if there be ſuch a glorious reward for the Saints, this rebukes all baſe worldly droſſie ſpirits <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 3.</note>, that ſeek for no higher good then meerly to enjoy the uſe and comforts of the creature, and content to their fleſh for a while: How many are there in the world that would bleſs themſelves in theſe things? <hi>Might I have but ſuch an eſtate, and ſuch content in the</hi>
                     <pb n="630" facs="tcp:57146:325"/>
                     <hi>world, it were enough, they ſhould think themſelves happy.</hi> As that <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Burbone</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> if he might have his Palace in <hi>Paris,</hi> he would not change it for <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> A company of baſe droſſie ſpirits that could be content to have the things of this world for their portion, it argues you have low thoughts of an immortal ſoul; you know not what an immortal ſoul is capable of, who can think your ſelves ſatisfied in any creature. You have but low thoughts of God; are there no richer treaſures in God then onely a few outward <hi>delights, meat,</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> and <hi>ſports</hi> here? Hath God nothing elſe to communicate to the creature? what mean thoughts haſt thou of Chriſt, and of all the purchaſe of the blood of Chriſt? What, hath Chriſt come and laid down his blood to purchaſe nothing but this, to have content in the creature? Certainly <hi>the God of this world hath blinded thine eyes,</hi> that thou ſhouldſt not ſee into the glorious things of eternal life that are in the Goſpel, and in the Word: How many would frame to themſelves a kinde of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven here, an imaginary Heaven? As I have read of a King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that he would have an imaginary Heaven, and therefore he made a brave Palace, and in the top he made the heavens, and painted <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> and underneath <hi>Clouds,</hi> that with Art moved up and down, and diſtilled rain, and made thunder, and he had a brave Throne gliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above thoſe clouds, this might be ſufficient for a <hi>Heathen;</hi> and yet how many Chriſtians are guilty of this, to imagine Heaven to themſelves? If they had but <hi>this</hi> and <hi>this,</hi> that were Heaven. Certainly thou wilt finde the loſs of theſe things a hell, if there
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:57146:325"/>
were no pain; but know, thou canſt not loſe Heaven, but thou muſt of neceſſity be plunged into hell; you cannot loſe all this glory, but you muſt of neceſſity be under that miſery which is contrary to this glory; whoſoever loſes the one, though that be ill enough, he muſt be under the miſery of the other.</p>
                  <p>And know, whatſoever thy heart is ſet upon in this world, if it be not in order to this reward, it is curſed to thee, for the bleſſing of all comfort does conſiſt in order to this laſt end. O that men were throughly principled in this one principle, namely, That the <note place="margin">The good of all things <hi>here</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme good <hi>herc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter.</hi>
                     </note> good of all things in the world, conſiſts in the ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination they have unto the higheſt and laſt end for which they were made: Now whatſoever a man hath, if there be not a ſubordination of it unto the laſt end, it is all curſed: O know thy folly, that haſt ſought to ſatisfie thy ſelf in the things of the world! Know thy folly, that thou haſt in this, like a Swine ſought to take contentment in ſwill and husks, when as you hear there is bread enough in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe. Mark what the Pſalmiſt ſays in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>How long will you turn my glory into ſhame? how long will you love vanity and ſeek after lyes?</hi> By your loving vanity, and ſeeking after lyes, you turn the glory of God into ſhame; ſo all carnal hearts that ſeek for their portion in this world, put a ſhame upon all that glory that God hath opened to you in this recompence of reward: O be not guilty of this, when as you have heard of theſe glorious things <hi>in the recompence of reward,</hi> do not you caſt ſhame and filth upon them, as if they were all imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Know thoſe things that you eſteem to be real and ſubſtantial, are vanities and imaginations, and all
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:57146:326"/>
ſubſtances and realities are in this recompence of reward.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if there be ſuch a glorious recompence of reward for the Saints, thoſe alſo are to be rebuked <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 4.</note> who ſeem to go on in thoſe ways that might bring this reward, and yet through the wickedneſs of their hearts do deprive themſelves of this reward, and theſe are hypocrites. There are three ſorts of theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſuch as though they go on in the hearts ſame ways that Gods people go in, yet there are ſo baſe and vile therein, as they ſeek no greater things in them then their own baſe ends, and ſo loſe all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſuch as go on in the ways that tend to this reward, and yet periſh at laſt for ſome one baſe luſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſuch as go on in thoſe ways, and are in a good forwardneſs, and yet prove to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and ſo loſe all their labor, and all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſuch as go on in the ways that lead to this <note place="margin">1.</note> reward, the ways of Religion and godlineſs, they do the ſame things that Gods people do for this reward, but onely this, their ends are different; they pray as much, hear as much, and receive Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, make a great profeſſion in Religion, and their hearts ſeem to be mightily up in duty; yea, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they ſuffer much in the ways of God, and are reſolute in the ways of godlineſs, and yet loſe all in the concluſion upon this ground, becauſe though they be in the ways that lead to this reward, yet their <hi>ends</hi> are ſo baſe and low, they do not look at
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:57146:326"/>
the glorious reward in theſe actions, but look at ſome under thing; as to give content to men, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of men; and to be accounted ſome body in the place where they live, and to gain ſome outward reſpect from ſuch and ſuch, and this is the higheſt pitch their hearts riſe unto in the duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: If ever there were any ſottiſh deſperate deluſion of heart, this is it, to undertake to do that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do, that come to enjoy all this glorious reward; and though you do as much as they, and take as much pains as they, yet you in the concluſion miſs of all, and loſe all upon your baſe ends: you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt as others do, but a gracious heart fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Chriſt <hi>for</hi> Chriſt, but you follow him only that <note place="margin">A graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart follows Chriſt, <hi>for</hi> Chriſt.</note> your own mindes and wills may be ſatisfied, it may be you know not how to live: and this is that you aym at in following Chriſt, and in prayer, and in ſpeaking of good things, all that you aym at, is that you may be accounted thoſe that have <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>gifts;</hi> and in giving of alms, you onely look upon ſome low and baſe ends which you ſhall attain, and this is like to be all your reward, ſo ſays Chriſt, <hi>Wo to you hypocrites, you have your reward:</hi> And wo indeed when this ſhall be ſaid, You are forward in Religion, to gain to your ſelves ſuch baſe things, you ſhall have them, ſays God, and this is all the reward you ſhall have. O be aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in your own hearts, that you ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the duties of Religion, and take ſuch pains in the ways of God, that do lead to ſuch glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, and yet your ends are ſo low; by having ſuch low ends in religious duties, you make Earth your throne, and Heaven your footſtool, whereas
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:57146:327"/>
God ſays, <hi>Heaven is my Throne, and Earth is my footstool;</hi> Why ſhould you be ſo croſs to God in the fooliſh ways of your vile hearts?</p>
                  <p>Some there are that perform theſe duties to ſatisfie <hi>natural conſcience,</hi> and ſo they may be unſound, and <note place="margin">Natural conſcience a ſpur to duty.</note> their conſciences not accuſe them; but theſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are the baſeſt that can be, their conſciences cannot but accuſe them, that they undertake the ways of Religion, to employ them for no more then for the attaining ſuch low ends. Yea, many that are now in Heaven, and have this glorious reward, did not finde ſo much difficulty in the ways of Religion as many Hypocrites do. There are three Reaſons for it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>that</hi> they do is by their own ſtrength, and <note place="margin">1.</note> when one comes to perform the duties of Religion by his own ſtrength, they are hard to him; a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart hath ſtrength from Heaven, and from Chriſt; now when a man hath received ſtrength, he can do that with eaſe that was difficult before: A man that hath a baſe unclean heart, the ways of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion muſt be tedious to ſuch a one; as a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being corrupted, whatſoever he does is tedious to him, if he were ſound it would not be ſo tedious; and ſo the ways of Religion are tedious to an hypocrite, becauſe he does all in his own ſtrength, and his ſoul is corrupted.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the ways of Religion are not ſuitable to his principles, but he is fain to force himſelf to them, <note place="margin">2.</note> and all forced things are tedious; but a gracious heart goes on in the ways of Religion as ſuitable to his principles.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, an Hypocrite hath not thoſe comforts as <note place="margin">3.</note>
                     <pb n="635" facs="tcp:57146:327"/>
thoſe that are gracious have in their ways, they have the aſſurance of Gods acceptance, and the light of God ſhining upon them, which Hypocrites have not; ſo that the ways of God are more difficult to Hypocrites, then to the godly; and yet they get nothing by them but ſome baſe ends, and the godly that do not endure ſo much difficulty, get Heaven, and immortality, and a Crown of glory, and all becauſe their ends are different: O be ſure your ends be right, you ſee what vaſt difference mens ends may make!</p>
                  <p>As if two ſhould go to ſea, it may be they go out both together, and one endures as much tempeſt and ſtorm as the other, and they are at the like charge; perhaps yet the one comes home richly laden, and the other brings nothing but Cockle ſhells, and a little gravel; when he that brought home the Cockle ſhells and the gravel, ſhall ſee the difference between him and the other, when as they were at like charge, and endured the ſame difficulty, how will he be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed? This is the difference between a gracious heart and an hypocrite, both go out in Religion, the one makes as much ſtir as the other, and ſuffers as much diſgrace and contempt as the other; the one enjoys all the riches of the Kingdom of God; the other, what does all his profeſſion come to? he gains a little reſpect <hi>from ſome,</hi> that this body or that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſays, <hi>He is a man of good parts,</hi> and here is all. O miſerable voyage that ſuch as theſe are have made, when all their profeſſion comes but to this! Yea, it may be they do not ſo much as gain reſpect from thoſe that are wiſe and judicious, but onely from a company of pratlers, that will ſpeak well of you
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:57146:328"/>
when you pleaſe them, and when you do not pleaſe them, they will ſpeak as ill of you: like a great blaze that a little fire will make in ſtraw for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and when it is paſt, you ſee nothing but a few black aſhes; ſo many Profeſſors make a great blaze, and a great noiſe and ſhew, and all that it comes to, is, that they get a little eſteem in the world; or, like Kites they will flutter up a little, but their eye is upon the carrion; ſo many ſeem to be above in the ayr in the profeſſion of Religion, and yet their eyes are upon the carrion, they make things below their aym.</p>
                  <p>What diſhonor is this unto the ways of godlineſs? thoſe ways that are the moſt precious things in the world, all the world is nothing to the profeſſion of godlineſs; and thoſe ways that God hath appointed to lead to ſuch glorious things as theſe are, how are they vilified and abaſed? you do not onely vilifie your ſelves, but you vilifie Gods ways, when as they tend to ſuch a glorious end, you put them under your baſe ends: If a man were a Nobleman by birth, what greater diſhonor could be done to him, then to make him ſerviceable to a drudge? So the ways of God that are ſo glorious, to make them ſerviceable to your baſe ends, what diſhonor is put upon the ways of God in this? Certainly God cannot take it well at your hands; to make the meaneſt creature of God, our own civil actions ſerviceable to our luſts, is a great ſin; but to make Prayer, and the Word, and the Sacraments, and the ways of godlineſs to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to our luſts, this is moſt horrible impiety. Again, how do you pollute that which is holy? The way of God is a holy thing, and take heed of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting of it, by having ſuch low ends in it. Again,
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:57146:328"/>
conſider how you do take the name of God in vain; the name of God is in the ways of Religion, and for you to have no higher ends in Religion, but ſuch baſe ones, you take Gods name <hi>in vain,</hi> and God will not hold you guiltleſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two men, <hi>a gracious heart,</hi> and a <hi>hypocrite,</hi> may be compared to two men that follow the King; one that follows the King for ſome Dukedom, and place of Office, to obtain ſome great thing from the King; and a begger that knows not the King, but runs after him for an alms, and if he may have ſix pence or a ſhilling, he goes away quieted: So in the ways of Religion, both ſeem to follow God, a gracious heart follows God, and knows what God is, he knows that God is a bleſſed God, a glorious God, and that there are wonderful great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things to be communicated from God to the ſouls of his people, and therefore he follows God for great things, for heaven, and eternity, and glory, and immortality; an hypocrite, he knows little of God, and he follows God that he may have a little credit and content for a while, and he looks no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: O baſe ignoble ſpirits, that have no higher thoughts in the ways of God! though we muſt take heed of high thoughts of our ſelves, yet in the ways of God we muſt lift up our ſelves, and have high thoughts, and high ayms. O what difference is there between an hypocrite and a true gracious heart! A gracious heart hath high ends for God in the meaneſt actions, in eating, and drinking, and an hypocrite hath low ends in his higheſt actions, in the moſt ſolemn duties of divine worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thoſe hypocrites are to be rebuked <note place="margin">2.</note>
                     <pb n="638" facs="tcp:57146:329"/>
that go on fairly in the profeſſion of Religion, and make conſcience of ſecret ſins, and not onely in ſhews, but really are eſcaped many pollutions of the world, and yet at laſt loſe all for cleaving to ſome one ſin: but there is a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a real eſcaping, and true ſanctifying eſcaping; many may really forſake many pollutions, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins, and yet at laſt loſe all this reward for cloſing with ſome ſecret ſin. O take heed leſt this be any of your portions, you have been vile, and you have reformed your ways in many things, and are not guilty of ſuch and ſuch ſins as you were before; but look to your ſelves that you do not loſe all this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for ſome one ſin at laſt: let them do what they will in profeſſion, if their hearts do not come off from every ſin, it is all nothing; not but that there may be ſome remainders of ſin, and yet the heart be taken off from every ſin; but if there be any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret cloſing with any ſin, all your profeſſion, and the leaving of all the other is to no purpoſe, it will never bring you to this reward: As ſuppoſe a wife ſhould be very ſerviceable to her husband in many things, and forſake many lovers, yet if ſhe entertain but any one lover beſides her husband, her husband does not care for all her ſervice and reſpect; and ſo it is with thoſe that make profeſſion: Look that there be no one ſecret ſin lodge in your hearts, if there be you will loſe all. It was a vexation to <hi>Lyſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus a King,</hi> that his ſtaying to drink <hi>one draught of water, loſt him his Kingdom:</hi> And ſo it will be a vexation to any that have gone on in the ways of godlineſs, that he hath loſt Heaven for one ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="639" facs="tcp:57146:329"/>
It was a grievous affliction upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he came towards <hi>Canaan</hi> within the ſight of it, and yet for one ſin, not ſanctifying Gods name at the water of <hi>Meribah,</hi> he was deprived of it, it went to his heart; and ſo it will be a grievous thing when you ſhall come towards Heaven, and for one ſin, not ſanctifying Gods name as you ought, you ſhall be deprived of heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> Many Prodigals have an inheritance, and at one caſt of the Dice loſe it; to loſe this Inheritance at one caſt, is a grievous thing. A man may ſcape many wounds, and ſhots in the Wars, and yet may be killed at laſt with the wound of a Pen-knife, or the wound of a pin or needle: ſo many that have eſcaped many groſs ſins, may by ſome little ſecret luſt be deprived of the glory of heaven. You that are going on in this way, that tend to the reward, take heed you do not loſe all for ſome one ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thoſe that apoſtatize are to be rebuked; <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>Apoſtates</hi> go far, and loſe all this reward, becauſe they do not endure to the end, but go back and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline: You were once in a bleſſed way, and had a bleſſed gale, and you were going on apace to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and now you are turned back again; O what have you done! it may be you were near your end, as Chriſt ſaid to the yong man, <hi>He is not far from the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few days journey of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and yet loſt it; ſo many, though they be near in their profeſſion, and have had as it were the taſte of heaven, yet turning back again, they loſe all. As if a man were going a rich Voyage, and juſt as he was entring into the Haven, there ſhould come a guſt of wind and blow
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:57146:330"/>
him home again, how does it grieve him? I was juſt at the Haven, and if I had entred I had been enriched for ever: So many have gone on in the profeſſion of Religion, if they had continued, who knows but that they might have had all this reward? but for want of continuance they have loſt all, and they are come ſhort of the glory of God. We may ſay to them, as the Angel ſaid to <hi>Hagar; Hagar, from whence comeſt thou, and whither goeſt thou?</hi> So it may be ſaid to an <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> Poor creature, from whence comeſt thou, and whither goeſt thou? Thou comeſt from heaven and eternal life, and thou art going to hell and eternal death. You know how earneſt the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was with the <hi>Galatians,</hi> when they had once received the faith, and drew back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſays he, <hi>Who hath bewitched you?</hi> Was there ever ſuch wickedneſs like this? to receive that faith that brings ſuch happineſs, and after you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it to turn back again; <hi>Who hath bewitched you?</hi> And this is the fourth Uſe.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if there be ſuch a glorious <hi>recompence of reward</hi> for the people of God; this ſhould then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 5.</note> ſuch as are looking towards, and ſuch as are walking in the ways of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it may encourage to begin betimes in Gods <note place="margin">1.</note> ways: It is your wiſdom to begin to work at the firſt hour, ſeeing God will reward ſo richly. If you were to work for another, and you knew he would give you a great ſum of money for every hour you wrought, you would be ſure to be betimes at work that day: You that are yong, you are deferring, and putting off your repentance; what a ſottiſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion is this? What do you loſe, you loſe a great
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:57146:330"/>
deal of the reward you might have: Therefore you little ones, as ſoon you come to know any thing of the ways of God, embrace them, for you ſhall be rewarded abundantly for every minute of an hour: Therefore the loſing the time of youth, yea, the loſing of any opportunity of doing any gracious action, is an eternal loſs: for if God reward every one according to his works, then the loſs of an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do a good work, is an eternal loſs; they that have neglected opportunities, let them conſider what they have loſt, and you that have your time before you, begin betimes; if a man were working, and knew not when he ſhould be paid, or how he ſhould get his wages, he would come late to work, and would be negligent, but God would not have you come into his vineyard upon thoſe terms, but promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he will reward you, and therefore begin betimes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is an incouragement to Gods <note place="margin">2.</note> people to be ſtrict, if we look for ſuch a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we had need be accurate; many cry out, What need men be ſo ſtrict? Indeed if they had no higher ends then your baſe ends, you might ſay ſo; a baſe hypocrite what need he be ſo ſtrict? but for a gracious heart, that hath ſuch high, and noble, and glorious ends as theſe are in his work, as a crown, and glory, and the like, he had need be ſtrict and preciſe. In ordinary pieces of work, by which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do not expect much, they are not ſo ſtrict and exact; but if a man be about ſome curious work, that he expects ſome great matter for, then he will be very ſtrict: and ſo becauſe Gods people do expect ſuch great matters for Religion, no wonder that they are ſo ſtrict and preciſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="642" facs="tcp:57146:331"/>
Thirdly, if there be ſuch a glorious reward, here is an encouragement to be very fervent and zealous <note place="margin">3.</note> in the ways of God, becauſe they ſerve ſuch a God, and ſhall have ſuch reward, ſays the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Be fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Do you know whom you ſerve? <hi>You ſerve the Lord,</hi> the high, and mighty, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and infinite God; and therefore you had need <hi>be fervent in ſpirit;</hi> do that you do with all your might and power, for it is for that God that will do ſuch great things for you. As <hi>David</hi> when he danced before the Ark, he did it with all his might: <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol</hi> not knowing his meaning, ſcorned him in her heart; but ſays he, <hi>It was before the Lord that choſe me before your Fathers houſe,</hi> that hath beſtowed ſuch mercies upon me, and will beſtow more mercies, and <hi>if this be to be vile, I will be more vile.</hi> Carnal hearts cannot endure earneſtneſs, and fervency in Gods ſervice; as the wilde beaſts cannot endure fire, ſo beaſtly carnal ſpirits cannot endure fire, fervency, and zeal in Gods ways; but ſuppoſe they ſhould oppoſe you for fervency in Gods ways, you might anſwer them, <hi>If this be to be vile, I will be more vile;</hi> It is for that God that hath done great things for me, and that I hope to receive great things from hereafter eternally.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if there be ſuch a glorious reward, be <note place="margin">4.</note> encouraged to be abundant in Gods ſervice; this is the Argument of the Apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58. <hi>Be ye ſtedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as you know your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> By that which hath been ſaid, you may know your labor is not in vain
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:57146:331"/>
with the Lord; be abundant in ſervice, there ſhall not be one tear, nor one ſigh, nor one prayer loſt; many ſay, Why do you ſo much, will not leſs ſerve? The godly do not onely aym at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that will require abundance, but they would have the heigth of the reward, and therefore they think they never have done enough. It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> If a man ſhould ſerve the Lord a thouſand years, it would not deſerve an hour of the reward in Heaven, much leſs an eternity: Though it is true, the grace of the Lord is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and he does accept of his grace, as the moſt glorious thing in the world, yet conſidering what our actions are, how much corruption is mingled with them, it would not deſerve a moment in Heaven, and therefore we had need do as much as we can. 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Seeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what maner of perſons ought ye to be in all maner of holy converſation and godlineſs?</hi> We ſhould be aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in our thoughts that we can do no more; and if there ſhould be ſhame in Heaven, when the Saints ſhall ſee and enjoy ſo much there, would they not be aſhamed that they have done no more for that God ſo glorious in his bounty &amp; goodneſs here?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if there be ſuch a glorious <hi>recompence of reward,</hi> then let us labor to be faithful with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">5.</note> we have ſuch a good Maſter, that is ſo good and gracious to us. Princes make account they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the hearts of their ſubjects that are about them, to be faithful with them by their great rewards, and by keeping of them in expectation of great things: The great things that God hath prepared for us,
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:57146:332"/>
do lay more engagements upon our hearts to be faithful with him: Let us not be falſe to ſuch a God as this is; God expects we ſhould be faithful upon this ground, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 63. 7, 8. There are large expreſſions of the goodneſs of the Lord unto his people; and what follows, <hi>Surely they are my people, children that will not lye:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Theſe are a people that I expect ſhould be ſatisfied with me. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 5. there God joyns his mercy and his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs both together: As Gods mercies and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs are joyned together, ſo let the hope of Gods mercies to us, and our faithfulneſs unto God, be joyned together. It was an argument of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abraham, I am God All-ſufficient, and I am your exceeding great reward, walk before me, and be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, You need not go and ſhark unto any other creature, you have reward enough in me, therefore walk before me, and be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: So by all that which God hath revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you concerning this glorious reward of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, God ſays, You need not go and ſeek any thing elſe, you need not be ſharking up and down after the creature, Is there not enough in me to ſatisfie any creature living? The ground why any depart from God in a way of unfaithfulneſs, is becauſe they have diſtruſtful thoughts, and think there is not enough to be had in God, but they had need ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves another way: If we underſtand this glorious reward, and our hearts cloſe with it, this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could not have power to draw our hearts from it: Therefore God is ſo plentiful in the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his goodneſs, becauſe his people ſhould not have any ſhifting thoughts; there is enough in God,
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:57146:332"/>
and in the treaſures of his grace to make up all.</p>
                  <p>Now by that which hath been ſaid, be encouraged to go on in thoſe ways in which you have no preſent encouragement; there are many ways in which you have no encouragement from God or men; you pray, and hear, and perform duties, and do not finde God come in that way, let the reward that is to come be enough to encourage you. You do many good things, and men are ungrateful, and will not requite them; well, let this quiet you, There is a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to come. I remember a ſpeech of <hi>Luther,</hi> That ſervitude to men, though it be to ungrateful men, does pleaſe God, and God, ſays he, wil abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you for it, and that ſhould be more ſweet to us then all the treaſures in the world. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 4. ſays the Prophet, <hi>I have labored in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought and in vain; yet truly my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is with the Lord, and my work with my God.</hi> It is a ſpeech of <hi>Latimer,</hi> ſpeaking of Miniſters that would leave their flock becauſe they did no good; ſays he, <hi>It is very naughtily done, we muſt look to that which God commands us, and leave the iſſue to God:</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Follow</hi> me, <hi>me, me,</hi> (three times he hath it) and <hi>not your own luſts;</hi> let us do our own work, and leave the reward with God: Though it be a ſweet encouragement for the Miniſters of God to ſee ſomething of their labor, yet if they do not, it is enough to make them go on in a way of obedience for the preſent, becauſe God commands it though there were no reward, but when we do obey God, and pleaſe God for the preſent, and it ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded ſo gloriouſly hereafter, let not this be any excuſe, We can do no good: if you be convinced of a
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:57146:333"/>
duty, whether there be good or no good come of it, whether there be preſent encouragement or not, it is enough that it ſhall be gloriouſly rewarded hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, if there be ſuch a glorious reward, ſuch <note place="margin">6.</note> bleſſed things as theſe reſerved for the people of God: hence then let us dwell a little in admiring at the goodneſs of God, at the infinite treaſures of the riches of the glory of the grace of God towards the children of men: Certainly, Brethren, great are the thoughts of God towards mankinde, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful are his ways to this poor creature of his: <hi>What is man,</hi> ſays the <hi>Pſalmiſt, nay, what is man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed?</hi> when as we conſider what God hath done for him. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 31. after the Apoſtle had ſpoke of glorification, and of the bleſſed eſtate of Gods people hereafter, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>What ſhall we ſay to theſe things?</hi> So ſeeing theſe things are ſo that are revealed, <hi>What ſhall we ſay to theſe things?</hi> O the heighth, and length, and depth, and breadth of the loving kindeneſs of the Lord! how unſearchable are his judgements! ſhall we ſay, How unſearchable are his mercies? and his mercies paſt finding out. <hi>O how great is thy goodneſs which thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee, which thou haſt wrought before the ſons of men! Pſal.</hi> 31. 19. If ever God wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any thing, it was about the communication of his goodneſs to mankinde; yea, how great is it before the ſons of men, before us that have but a little made known to us? How great is it before Angels then, and before God himſelf? In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. 6. it is ſaid, God humbleth to behold things that are done in heaven: It is much that God ſhould vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:57146:333"/>
to behold any thing in heaven; but now that God ſhould vouchſafe to behold ſuch a poor wretched creature as man is here upon earth, and not to behold him onely, but to work thus gloriouſly for him, and that from all eternity, to make it his great work to communicate himſelf to man; O how does God humble himſelf here, and how is his mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be admired and adored by the ſons of men! God is to be praiſed for the leaſt of his mercies here, but he is to be admired in the glory of his rich grace in heaven. We read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. God is praiſed twenty five times for his mercies, but the concluſion of all is, <hi>Praiſe the God of Heaven, for his mercies endure for ever;</hi> his mercies, as he is the God of heaven, they are the glorious mercies indeed. When the Scripture would ſet forth the excellency of a thing, it expreſſeth it by heaven, as the excellency of Chriſt, <hi>He is the Lord from heaven,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of God, the God of heaven, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1. 9. It is made the top of Chriſts glory, that he is made higher then the heavens, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. When Chriſt would ſhew the excellency of the bread of life, he ſays, <hi>It is bread from heaven;</hi> the excellency of ſpiritual bleſſings is ſet out in this, that they are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in heavenly places, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. Becauſe gold is the moſt precious mettal, therefore we lay it over other things, not onely wood and cloth, but ſilver it ſelf: ſo becauſe heaven is ſo excellent, the Lord gilds as it were his choiceſt bleſſings with this adjunct, and all to ſhew the wonderful excellency there is in heaven it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Brethren, God hath therefore revealed theſe things to us, to that end that the glory of his grace
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:57146:334"/>
might be great in the world: God would have us have high, and honorable, and glorious thoughts of his goodneſs; God would have the high praiſes of his grace to be in the hearts and in the mouthes of his Saints; it is a great evil to have low and mean apprehenſions of the glorious grace of God to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde; you do not know what diſhonor you bring to God in it: If your hearts be not raiſed on high, and enlarged in the thoughts of the free and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grace of God to mankinde, it is an exceeding diſhonor to him. To ſee the riches of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious grace to the children of men, it is a mighty work of faith, and ſuch a work as the ſoul is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to do onely by a mighty and glorious work of the holy Ghoſt in it; indeed there is in the world a baſe, and poor, and mean apprehenſion of the grace of God in Chriſt, ſuch as does not work at all to raiſe, and enlarge, and glorifie the heart of a man, but the true ſight of the riches of Gods glorious grace, it hath a mighty power to raiſe, and enlarge, and glorifie the hearts of the children of men while they are here; as mark the expreſſions of the Apoſtle in his Prayer for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 17. 18. <hi>That the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of glory, may give unto you the Spirit of wiſdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; The eyes of your underſtanding being enlightned, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints:</hi> not the inheritance of the Saints, but the inheritance <hi>in</hi> the Saints, and the <hi>glory</hi> of the inheritance, and the <hi>riches</hi> of the glory, and they muſt not onely have underſtanding to know this, <hi>but the eyes of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:57146:334"/>
muſt be enlightened,</hi> and this muſt come from <hi>the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> from the Spirit of wiſdom and Revelation, and from the Father of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The ſight of the excellency and riches of Gods grace here, it is that that is the work of God ſhining into the heart, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>For God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> The unſearchable truths of the Goſpel are in <hi>that</hi> which hath been revealed ſo far as we are able to wade into them. The ſight of Gods rich glory, is that which the Princes of the world have not known, it is that which requires a work of the Spirit of God, <hi>Of that Spirit which ſearcheth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>the deep things of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O brethren, if you had a true ſpiritual ſight of the richneſs of the goodneſs of God in the way of his communication of happineſs and glory to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, then you ſee into the great deſign of God, into the deep counſels of his wiſdom, then God hath laid open his heart unto you, God hath brought you into the treaſures of his riches, and given you a view of them; the very ſecrets of Gods ſoul are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to you, and bleſſed are your eyes that have ſeen theſe things: if the ſight of Gods glory in his grace towards mankinde be ſeen in true beauty and height, and glory indeed, there is no fear that they ſhould do hurt to any ſoul; it is true, the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the grace of God in a natural way, is the cauſe of ſecurity or preſumption in many, but there was never any in the world that was furthered in a way of ſecurity and preſumption upon the ſpiritual
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:57146:335"/>
ſight and view they have had of the heighth and depth of the riches of the glory of the grace of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt: That ſight of Gods grace that is the cauſe of ſecurity in people, is that which is grounded meerly upon a natural light, which hath no efficacy to raiſe, and enlarge, and to purge the heart: But this true ſpiritual ſight of Gods grace, it hath a mighty efficacy, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, to raiſe, and enlarge, and purge the heart. In 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3. 18. ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>We beholding the glory of the Lord as in a mirror:</hi> What then, are we ſecure and preſumptuous upon this? No, <hi>We are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory.</hi> What was that glory that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle did behold? the glory of God in the mirror of the Goſpel, the glory of God in the riches of his grace towards the Saints: Now ſays he, <hi>While we behold, as in a mirror, this glory of God,</hi> this is the fruit of it, <hi>We are changed from glory to glory.</hi> People talk of Gods mercy, but how few ever had a ſpiritual ſight of Gods mercy? they would have Miniſters preach much of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but if people had eyes to behold it in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it, how would it change their hearts? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then, I beſeech you, labor to have more then a natural ſight of Gods mercy and goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mankinde. A man by a low apprehenſion of Gods mercy and goodneſs may think thus: So long as I ſerve God, it ſhall be well with me, God will bleſs me, and be merciful to me; but that ſpiritual and ſupernatural ſight of the riches of the glory of Gods mercy, is this, for a ſoul though it ſees it ſelf a baſe vile wretched worm, a lump of filth,
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:57146:335"/>
and ſees it ſelf ſtanding guilty before the Lord, and God ſeems to look with an angry face up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and conſcience within it accuſes it, and the threats of the fiery Law come out againſt it; yet for a ſoul to be able to look into the deep bowels of Gods infinite compaſſion that are in Chriſt, and in them to look upon it ſelf for all this as an heir of glory and eternal life, ſo as to have the ſoul raiſed, and enlarged, and devoted to the magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, praiſing and adoring the riches of Gods grace, and to venture all upon this, this is more then a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſight of Gods grace, and of his mercy towards mankinde.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, We could admire Gods grace and <note place="margin">Object.</note> mercy towards mankinde, and praiſe him, and bleſs him for it, and our hearts would be enlarged, <hi>If we were ſure theſe things did belong to us, and that we had any intereſt in them;</hi> there is enough in them to enlarge and raiſe our hearts, but this is that which hinders, <hi>We do not know that we have an intereſt therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To that I anſwer, That this very work of God it <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> ſelf, that gives this ſight of his grace to raiſe up the heart to cloſe with it, and to make the ſoul venture all upon it, that does bring the ſoul to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote it ſelf to the praiſe and honor of it; this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work of it ſelf does intereſt your ſouls in it, therefore do not ſay, <hi>If I were intereſted in theſe things, then I could praiſe and magnifie God for them:</hi> If you can do this, you are intereſted in them, for this is an immediate work of faith, and it is from a divine principle to be able to do this, and therefore though you know no good at all in
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:57146:336"/>
your ſelves before, and you had no arguments to encourage you before, and you had no preparation in your own apprehenſions before, yet if you have but this work of grace, it does intereſt your ſouls in all that which hath been revealed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the recompence of reward of the Saints of God.</p>
                  <p>But may we not preſume to think that ſuch great <note place="margin">Object.</note> things belong to us?</p>
                  <p>To that I anſwer, Where ever preſumption is, <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> it is built upon a natural ſight of Gods grace, and that is a poor low flat dead thing, that hath no ſuch efficacy to raiſe the heart to ſuch a glorious work as this is, and therefore if the heart be raiſed to ſuch a glorious work as this, by the appprehenſion of the riches of the grace and goodneſs of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mankinde, that is not preſumption: And this is the ſixth Uſe.</p>

                  <p>SEventhly, if there be ſuch bleſſed things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <note place="margin">7.</note> for the people of God: Hence let us look upon all the ſervants of God as honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in our eyes, and let them be honored in our thoughts, for great are the thoughts of God upon them and towards them, and therefore great and honorable ſhould be our thoughts of them, though they be never ſo poor and mean in the world. We uſe to look upon great heirs with admiring thoughts, and bleſſing of them every time we look upon them. Do you ſee one walking in the ways of God? what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he be for his outwards, let your hearts bleſs him, and ſay, <hi>Here is one indeed born to great things, other maner of things then any the world affords.</hi> Did we know what were the things that the people of God ſhould be poſſeſſed of within a while, we would ſay in our hearts, <hi>O bleſſed that ever they were born, bleſſed is the womb that bare them, and bleſſed are the paps that gave them ſuck:</hi> Did we with a ſpiritual believing eye behold what things they ſhould have, and ſaw them as now poſſeſſed of them, we would ſee cauſe to fall down and kiſs the ground upon which they tread: The bleſſed Angels look upon them as great ones, as the glory of the world, and therefore do joyfully miniſter unto them, becauſe they know they are the great heirs of Heaven, for whom ſuch great things are prepared: <hi>Great things are ſpoken of thee, O thou City of God,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt; <hi>Great things are ſpoken of you, O ye Saints</hi>
                     <pb n="654" facs="tcp:57146:337"/>
of God. If Heaven muſt be ſo glorious to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Saints, how glorious are thoſe for whom heaven is prepared? Says <hi>Ahaſuerus, What ſhall be done to the man whom the King will honor?</hi> O what ſhall be done to thoſe whom an infinite God hath ſet his heart upon to raiſe to honor, and to manifeſt to Angels, and to all the world, what his infinite power is able to do in raiſing of a creature to glory: In the Saints there is a meeting, as it were of the beams of Gods grace and goodneſs as in a center, and that muſt needs be very warm and hot indeed. The beams of the Sun in the circumference ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ayr, are warm; but in a glaſs, where they are united together as it were in a center, there they warm after another maner, there they burn; ſo all the works of Gods grace abroad in the world, they are as the beams of the Sun in the circumference, that are ſcattered abroad; but in his people there is the center where they are united together, and there they burn, and are glorious indeed, and therefore high and honorable thoughts you ought to have of the Saints. It is a great argument to ſhew Gods greatneſs, that all the creatures in the world are his, and for him. What an argument then is it to ſet forth the greatneſs of a Chriſtian, that Heaven, and God, and Chriſt, and all are his and for him? and this hath been ſhewn in this glorious <hi>recompence of reward:</hi> How great and honorable then ſhould they be in our eyes?</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, if there be ſuch a glorious reward, and <note place="margin">8.</note> great things prepared for Gods people, then what love is due to Chriſt, and to the Goſpel, and to the ways of godlineſs?</p>

It is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, from whom all this comes, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reward was due to us, we were wretched guilty creatures, fire-brands of hell, children of perdition, caſt out unto an eternal curſe; but the Lord Chriſt, who was the wiſdom of the Father, ſet his heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and ſpake for us from all eternity, and would not ſatisfie himſelf in delivering of mankinde from that miſerable and loſt condition in which they were, but ſo ſet his heart upon them, as he intended to make it his great work for the manifeſtation of the riches of his grace, to raiſe this poor wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to a height of happineſs and glory, that it might appear to Angels, to the world, yea to the bleſſed Trinity it ſelf, what the Son of God is able to do, to raiſe a creature from miſery unto glory; and ſo his heart was ſet upon mankinde, that though it muſt coſt him the eclipſing of his own glory, though he muſt come to be made a prey to the world, and if a man, a man of ſorrows, yea, made a curſe it ſelf in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract, that man might have this glory and happineſs, and yet he was content with all; and at laſt this is all he prays for as a fruit of his ſufferings and merits, <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, If I can but have this, I am well, I have enough for all the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings

that I did endure. This indeed is called <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> but it is the reward of another maner of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs then our own; were it that there were no other righteouſneſs but our own, though our own ſhould be true righteouſneſs, the reward would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to this height; but this is firſt the reward of the merit, of the death, of the blood, and of the perfect righteouſneſs of the Son of God, and ſo in him it comes to be our reward, therefore it is Chriſt that is our life, and happineſs, and glory. O let us joyn with thoſe bleſſed Elders in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 8, 9. <hi>that fell down before the Lamb, having all harps in their hands, and golden vials full of odours, and ſung, Worthy art thou who waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us unto God by thy blood, to receive honor, and bleſsing, and glory;</hi> and that we might joyn in that bleſſed melody that St. <hi>John</hi> heard in that Chapter, in Verſe 13. <hi>He heard all creatures in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and in the Sea, ſaying, Bleſsing, honor, glory and power, be unto him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever;</hi> that we might ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to this. If any man wiſh good to us, we count it worthy of love; but the Lord Chriſt having wrought ſuch infinite good for us as this, how ſhould our hearts be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed to him, and that none ſhould be dear to us, and prized of us in compariſon of Chriſt: Let us cry out with that bleſſed Martyr, <hi>None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, how ſhould our ſouls love the Goſpel, and prize the Goſpel, that hath revealed all this to us? In 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. it is ſaid, <hi>Life and immortality is brought to light by the Goſpel:</hi> Theſe are the things that
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:57146:338"/>
in compariſon were kept hid from the beginning of the world, before the manifeſtation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but now they are revealed: O bleſſed be God that we had the preaching of the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, to open the treaſures of grace to us in this maner. What poor low thoughts ſhould we have had of the happineſs of mankinde, had not God made known theſe glorious things in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpel? Many wiſe men by the light of nature have riſen high in the contemplations of happineſs, that mans nature is capable of, but how far beneath theſe things have their higheſt thoughts been? It is a great part of the glory of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that it ſets out unto us theſe high and glorious things.</p>
                  <p>And then the ways of godlineſs, thoſe we ſhould <note place="margin">3.</note> love, becauſe thoſe are the ways that lead and tend <note place="margin">How we ſhould love the <hi>ways</hi> of godlineſs.</note> to all this; godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life to come, as well as the promiſe of this life annexed to it: Were the ways of godlineſs never ſo hard and rough, never ſo difficult, yet they are glorious ways, and to be loved, becauſe of the glorious end they tend unto: Great is the gain of godlineſs, if theſe things be believed. You that are Merchants love and prize trading and merchandizing that brings in great gain; as ſome in a way of trading and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing, by a bargain in a morning will bring in a hundred pounds, when as many other poor people are fain to work hard to get a ſhilling or eighteen pence a day; now you prize that trade that with a few words can get in ſo much: O prize the trade of godlineſs <hi>then,</hi> there is gain to be had. I may compare all the works of <hi>morality,</hi> and
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:57146:339"/>
                     <hi>common grace,</hi> to the poor mean trade of the labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, that is fain to work hard for a ſhilling or eight pence a day, they work, and get but ſome few outward bleſſings from God, but <hi>godlineſs</hi> is the trade of merchandiſing, that brings in hundreds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and that our hearts ſhould be upon; God would have our hearts to be after great and glorious things. It is an expreſſion of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to <hi>Marcus Antonius, It is not for you to be fiſhing for Gudgeons, but for Towns, and Forts, and Caſtles:</hi> And ſo thoſe that are acquainted with the ways of godlineſs, it is not for them to be trading for poor things, but for eternal life, glory and immortality.</p>
                  <p>The ninth Uſe, is an Uſe of Examination, to know who thoſe are that have intereſt in theſe glorious <note place="margin">9.</note> things, to the anſwering of that queſtion in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 15. <hi>Who ſhall abide in thy Tabernable? who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill?</hi> I confeſs that <hi>Pſalm</hi> does princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally aim at communion with the Church of God; ſuch as are fit for communion with a Church, are fit for heaven, and therefore the queſtion may be true, <hi>Who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill?</hi> who ſhall be partakers of theſe things? <hi>Bleſſed are they that ſhall eat bread in the Kingdom of God;</hi> But who are they? It is neceſſary you ſhould labor to make this ſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a matter ſo great, and ſo glorious, and not to lay the weight of that which is of infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, upon poor, weak, ſlight, and ſandy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; certainly we do not know what the grace of God towards mankinde <hi>is,</hi> if we content our ſelves with ſlight hopes; but if God hath enlightned your ſouls to know the reality and glory of them, they wil never be at reſt, till you have got certain and
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:57146:339"/>
infallible grounds for them. In things of ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence we are content with ſlight evidences, but if a man have to deal in any buſineſs upon which his whole eſtate depends, he would not have any man think it ill if he does make ſure, if he will have bonds and ſeals: ſo we ſhould make ſure of heaven, and of glory, becauſe it is ſuch a great matter.</p>
                  <p>Some I ſuppoſe, that meerly upon the hearing of the greatneſs of theſe things, cannot but have ſome miſgiving thoughts; If theſe things be ſo great, ſurely they concern not me, they belong not to me; Can I think in my conſcience that I am that man or woman that God ſhould have ſuch great thoughts upon, and ſhould look upon me, ſo as to make it the greateſt deſign that he hath to glorifie the riches of his mercy upon me? What work of Gods grace have I ever had upon me? I would not have thoſe that are affected with the greatneſs of Gods grace to mankinde, think that theſe things do not belong to them becauſe they are great. But thoſe that never had their hearts affected with the excellency and glory of Gods grace toward man, when they hear of the greatneſs and glory of thoſe things that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the Saints, they may juſtly have their conſciences miſgive them, and think ſurely they do not belong to them. Canſt thou that art a baſe drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, that prizeſt nothing but a little drink, and ſome outward things, think that God ſhould make it the greateſt work that he hath in the world, for to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the riches of his grace and goodneſs unto thee? The greatneſs of theſe things may be enough to caſt thee off; As it is with a Beggar, a Beggar comes and asks an alms, if a man put his hand in
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:57146:340"/>
his pocket, and take out a peny or two pence, he hath hope to have that; but if he take out a piece of gold, he hath no hope of that, becauſe it is ſo much: So when men have but natural thoughts of heaven and happineſs hereafter, you think you might have that, but when you come to have heaven opened to you, and you ſee it is ſuch a great and glorious thing, your hearts may juſtly think it is not for us. Caſt a bone to a Dog, he falls to it preſently, but ſet a joynt of meat before him well dreſt, in a large diſh, and he goes away, he dares not venture upon that: So for theſe things in the world, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary favors of God, theſe bones that God caſts to Dogs, you may fall upon them, and think theſe are for you; but when you come to the dainties, and infinite treaſures of God, can ſuch a ſwiniſh heart, ſuch a baſe, filthy, unclean ſpirit as yours is, that never minded nothing but the ſatisfying of your baſe luſts, think that theſe are for you? you cannot but have miſgiving thoughts, and think either theſe things are but notions, or elſe I have no part in them.</p>

                  <p>BUt how may any know that they ſhall have <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> this glorious reward?</p>
                  <p>Carnal and ſenſual hearts, becauſe they have <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> no principles of Gods grace, to ſhew them the great things of God, and the minde of God, they think no man can know; we muſt have hopes, and hope

well, but who can know what God hath in heaven for us? Thoſe that are acquainted with the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God in the Goſpel, they know what Gods minde hath been from all eternity concerning them, and what God will do for them to all eternity. How do they know?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, would you know whether you ſhall have this <note place="margin">1.</note> Recompence of reward? Have you made <hi>Moſes Choice?</hi> Certainly, thoſe that have made <hi>Moſes Choice,</hi> ſhall have <hi>Moſes Reward:</hi> What <hi>Moſes Choice</hi> was you have heard, <hi>Moſes choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon: Moſes</hi> might have had honor and eſteem enough in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted afflictions with the people of God, in Gods ways a great deal better; <hi>He eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater riches then all;</hi> ſo I may have Chriſt and communion with his people, let me be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and contemned, and deſpiſed, I care not. Now do you finde this? Though there was a time my heart was taken with the glittering ſhews of things here, and I ſaw no excellency in the ways of God, they were but notions to me; at length God wrought mightily upon my ſoul, and ſhewed me the vanity of all things that I accounted for glorious things, and ſhewed me a beauty in Gods people, and began to knit my heart to them, ſo as I was willing to part with any thing to have communion with them, and to venture all upon the bare word and promiſe of God, for thoſe glorious things that are revealed in it, and <hi>this choice</hi> I have made, and my ſoul is ſetled in it, whatſoever befals me in this world; hath there been ſuch a work upon your ſouls, that you have
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:57146:341"/>
made <hi>Moſes Choice?</hi> then you ſhall have <hi>Moſes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, are you begotten unto the hope of <note place="margin">2.</note> theſe glorious things? Whoſoever ſhall be partaker of this glorious reward, muſt be one that is born to it. There are ſome dignities in the world that are got no way, except they be born to them; ſo if you have this reward, you muſt be born to it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who according to his abundant mercy hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten us unto a lively hope:</hi> Whoſoever hath the true hope of Heaven, it is one that is <hi>begotten</hi> to it, that is, There muſt be a mighty work of God upon your hearts, a new birth, a regeneration in you, otherwiſe there is nothing you have done or can do that can get this reward. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 28. ſays Chriſt unto his Diſciples, after <hi>Peter</hi> had ſpoken what they had left for him, <hi>Ye that have followed me in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, when the Son of man ſhall ſit in the throne of his glory, ye ſhall alſo ſit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael:</hi> As if Chriſt ſhould ſay, <hi>Peter,</hi> you have forſaken all and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, but know, the bare forſaking is not enough, but you who have felt the work of God <hi>regenerating your ſouls,</hi> upon which you have followed me, you ſhall ſit upon twelve thrones: Some do interpret this place <hi>Regeneration,</hi> the eſtate of the Goſpel, and ſo make it not to be the work of God upon the ſoul, but the work of God upon the world, to make a new world; as the glorious eſtate of the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel is called <hi>a new heaven, and a new earth,</hi> and ſo take it, <hi>Ye that have followed me in this new world, ye ſhall ſit upon twelve thrones, &amp;c.</hi> but I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:57146:341"/>
take it the other way, not wholly excluding this, they are onely thoſe that follow Chriſt in the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that ſhall have this reward.</p>
                  <p>It is called the <hi>new birth,</hi> becauſe there is ſuch a ſtrange change; there is a <hi>new ſpirit,</hi> and a <hi>new life</hi> put into a man: Suppoſe a rational ſoul were put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a beaſt, what a change would be in that creature? Suppoſe an Angelical nature were put upon us, what a change would there be? By the change that is wrought <hi>in regeneration</hi> there is a greater difference; the higheſt degree of glory in heaven is not ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the loweſt degree of grace here, as the loweſt degree of grace here is different from the higheſt excellency of nature, becauſe the difference between the higheſt degree of the glory of heaven from the loweſt degree of grace, is but a gradual difference, but the difference that is between the loweſt degree of grace, and the higheſt excellency of nature, is a ſpecifical difference. Therefore you that hope for glory, know there muſt be <hi>a regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that work of God upon your ſouls that muſt cauſe a greater difference in you from that you were by nature, then there is in the glorified Saints, that have the higheſt degree of glory, from the meaneſt Saint in the world; as the reward is a mighty glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing, ſo the work of God in preparing a ſoul for this reward is a mighty glorious work. And therefore do not content your ſelves in every poor ſlight thought of heaven, know heaven lies upon that which is a mighty work of God in you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if you ever come to Heaven, there is a principle of heaven put into your ſouls here, that is, <note place="margin">3.</note> a heavenly principle that carries you heavenward,
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:57146:342"/>
I mean the work of God, cauſing you to have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mindes, and heavenly hearts; <hi>Our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3. ul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>is in heaven,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle. In <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 6. the Church is compared <hi>to pillars of ſmoke that aſcend upward to heaven;</hi> Though the Church be black and dark in regard of her infirmities, yet it hath a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to carry it upward to heaven. The Saints are compared to <hi>Eagles</hi> that fly aloft towards heaven, though their bodies are not there, their hearts and ſouls are there; <hi>if our treaſures be in heaven, our hearts are there already.</hi> I read of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, who had a mighty deſire to go to the holy Land, to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and becauſe he was hindred, and could not get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he gave his <hi>Son</hi> a charge upon his death-bed to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fox</hi> Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, <hi>de Edvar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do primo.</hi>
                     </note> carry his <hi>heart</hi> thither; and he prepared Two and thirty thouſand pound to carry his heart thither: So the Saints, though they have not their bodies in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, their hearts are there, and they take much pains, and are at great charges to get their hearts thither.</p>
                  <p>All things in nature have a principle to carry them to their proper place; becauſe the place of fire is on high, therefore fire hath a principle to carry it on high; and becauſe the place of earth is below, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore earth hath a principle to carry it downward: So if the place and center of the heart be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then certainly it hath a principle to move na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally thither, to move upward to heaven; and therefore that ſoul that hath nothing but a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to carry it downward to the earth, and to the luſts of it to theſe things below, heaven is not the proper place for ſuch a ſoul, and when the ſoul goes out of the body, it wil not go to Heaven: Take earth, and cloſe it in a veſſel, and take fire, and put into
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:57146:342"/>
a veſſel, open the veſſels, and let them out, and they go both to their places; ſo the ſouls of men when they are gone out of the body, they go to the place whither they had a principle to carry them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not think the principle ſhall be put into them when you dye, but you muſt have a principle before: if your hearts be preſt down by earthly things, when you dye they will fall down; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerve which way your ſouls work: Can you ſay, as in the preſence of God, My ſoul works hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venward, though I have weights of corruption that would weigh me down, yet I have a principle that does work to Heaven? But the conſciences of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tell them their ſouls work downward, to vanity and ſenſuality, and you have no other principle, and therefore when your ſouls depart, they fall down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, what ſoul ſoever hath an intereſt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, heaven is in that ſoul already: <hi>The kingdom of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>God is in them,</hi> and they have taken hold of eternal life, now eternal life abides in them; <hi>Whom he hath juſtified, he hath glorified already,</hi> they have the glory of heaven begun; you heard what that was. In hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there is the perfection of our natures, the image of God ſhall be renewed; now is the image of God begun? hath God marked you, and ſet the ſtamp of his image upon you? There is no ſoul that God does intend to put glory upon, but he marks that ſoul, and ſtamps his image upon it in the work of converſion, and ſays, Here is a ſoul I ſet the ſtamp of my image upon, becauſe I mark it out to glory: if ever you come to Heaven, God muſt ſee his own Image and Superſcription upon you. As the Beaſt ſet his
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:57146:343"/>
mark upon men, and would ſuffer none to trade but thoſe that had his mark: ſo God will ſet his mark upon his people, and none ſhall come into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom but thoſe that have his mark: now a mans Image is upon a thing, when by beholding of it I am put in minde of him that it is an Image of; ſo if you have this Image and ſtamp of God, a man that knows God, as ſoon as he looks upon you, as ſoon as he beholds your converſation, he is put in minde of God, and he ſays, I have heard and read much of God, of the holineſs and righteouſneſs of God, and by this mans converſation I am put in minde of that holineſs and righteouſneſs of God, the brightneſs of which I ſee ſhining here.</p>
                  <p>Again, in Heaven you know God himſelf is the portion of the Saints, they have the preſence of God: What preſence of God do you enjoy here? Were your ſouls ever acquainted with the preſence of God in the Ordinances? What bleſſed viſion have you of God here? Thoſe who come to Heaven, God gives a ſight of himſelf here. And what union have you with God? What union of grace? What my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical union between God and your ſouls? And what fruition have you of God? Is it God that you enjoy in the creature? and God in all things? God in the Ordinances? and what reſt do your ſouls finde in God? though you be toſt up and down in regard of the uncertainty of the creature, yet is God your reſt: yea, do you enjoy your ſelves in God? the beginning of all theſe are now for the preſent. And likewiſe for communion with Jeſus Chriſt, what communion and converſe is there between your ſouls and Jeſus Chriſt? Is it not a riddle to you? Are
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:57146:343"/>
you delighted in the communion of the Saints? Are the Sabbaths your delight, as a beginning of the eternal Sabbath you ſhall keep in Heaven? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now do you ask, <hi>Who ſhall have Heaven?</hi> and, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into the Mount?</hi> Thoſe whom the Mount <hi>now</hi> comes down unto. Many hope they ſhall have God when they dye, but ſurely if God be not ſo merciful as to give you ſpiritual mercies for the preſent, he will not be ſo merciful as to give you eternal mercies hereafter; if he do not give you mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of grace here, he will not give you mercies of glory hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, what are the apprehenſions that you have <note place="margin">5.</note> of this reward? there may be a ſpecial note drawn from thence, whereby you may ſee whether this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall be yours or no. What is it that you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be the heighth and excellency of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and glory that you expect? Is it that ſpiritual and ſupernatural good that is in Heaven? Do you not apprehend Heaven after a carnal and natural way, when you hear ſpeaking of Crowns, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and happineſs, and glory, and the like? but hath God ſhewed you that the heighth and top of all conſiſts in thoſe ſpiritual and ſupernatural things, in the image of God, and in communion with God, and thoſe things that have been opened? are your hearts more after theſe then after any thing elſe? then it is like that Heaven is for you, for theſe things are kept hid from thoſe that Heaven is <note place="margin">6.</note> not for. <note place="margin">How to diſcern <hi>the truth of our hopes</hi> for heaven 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, conſider what your hopes are for this <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, where hopes are true, they are ſuch as
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:57146:344"/>
are wrought by the power of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are purging hopes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they are ſuch hopes as are wrought by the <note place="margin">1.</note> power of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. Certainly, hopes of ſuch great things as theſe, muſt be raiſed by a great power, they are hopes that could never be raiſed by any natural apprehenſions, by any work of Reaſon: you have hopes of Heaven, and of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reward; How came you by them? What al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power of the holy Ghoſt have you felt that hath raiſed theſe hopes? If you have no other hopes but thoſe that may ſpring out of nature, natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and apprehenſions, you are far ſhort of this <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward:</hi> but <hi>this</hi> recompence of reward being glorious, it hath a glorious principle to raiſe hopes, ſuch hopes as can bear down ſtrong difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that ſhall oppoſe them: the holy Ghoſt does ſtretch out the hopes of the ſoul beyond that which nature can do. In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> that word that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>hope,</hi> ſignifies a <hi>line,</hi> becauſe by hope the heart is ſtretched out as in a line to the thing it hopes for: now the hopes that nature raiſes is but in a ſhort line, and they ſtretch out the heart but a little way, but the hopes that are wrought by the power of the holy Ghoſt, are ſuch hopes as the heart is ſtretched out very far by them; and there muſt be a mighty ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the heart, and that by a mighty power, to make it hope for ſuch great things as theſe, that God ſhould bring ſuch a poor worm to ſuch high things as theſe are: Ordinary baſe droſſie hopes that have nothing in them, they are not ſtretched out to theſe things, they have ſome confuſed apprehenſions, and ſlight opinions about heaven, &amp; they are loth to
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:57146:344"/>
think they ſhould be damned for ever, and caſt from God, and therefore they will have ſome conceits it ſhall be well with them, and they hope well; but to have their hearts ſtretched out to expect theſe bleſſed things as the happineſs of their ſouls, and as the real, ſubſtantial, and onely good, this is by the mighty power of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are <hi>purging hopes;</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>And every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf even as he is pure:</hi> It is a lively working hope, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Bleſſed be God who hath begotten us again to a lively hope.</hi> As a fountain that hath dirt caſt into it, it being a living fountain, it works, and works, and never leaves till it hath got the dirt out; caſt dirt into a puddle, and it lies there, and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies: And this is the difference between the ſin of one that is <hi>natural,</hi> and one that hath hope of <hi>eternal life:</hi> When ſin comes into a carnal natural heart, it lies there and putrifies; but where ſin comes into a gracious heart, that hath hope of eternal life, ſuch a heart by theſe hopes are as a living fountain, that will never leave working till it be pure again: Such a ſoul as apprehends it ſelf a veſſel of ſuch rich and glorious mercies as theſe, do labor to cleanſe it ſelf to the utmoſt: if you have a veſſel that you put or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary water into, you care not though there be ſome duſt in the bottom, but if you will put in ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious liquor, you will cleanſe it again, and again, and will not ſuffer any duſt to be there: So carnal hearts that do not know what great things God hath laid up for his people, that are not veſſels of mercy, but onely look for ſome common things, they can ſuffer their hearts to filled with noyſom luſts, but where
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:57146:345"/>
the ſoul does apprehend it ſelf a veſſel of mercy, ſuch a one as God will fill with theſe glorious things, it would not have any filth and corruption abiding in it. In 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 21. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of two ſorts of veſſels that are in Gods Houſe, that is, in the Church, <hi>Veſſels of honor,</hi> and <hi>Veſſels of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor;</hi> But how ſhall we know we are veſſels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or of diſhonor? if therefore a man <hi>purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> from theſe, he ſhall be <hi>a veſſel of honor;</hi> a veſſel of diſhonor is an unclean veſſel, a veſſel of honor is a clean veſſel: If therefore your hopes be ſuch as can ſtand with any beloved ſin againſt knowledge, you are veſſels of diſhonor: And here is the liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this hope; if thou haſt a hope to be a veſſel of honor, it purges you from filth, and by that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging from filth, there comes to be a readineſs and preparation to every good work, here is ſuch a one as ſhall aſcend up into the holy Hill of God. This is the ſixth note.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, examine what thy claim is, whether <note place="margin">7.</note> thy claim to Heaven, and eternal life, and this <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward</hi> do lie right in the point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or no? If you look at nothing but the works that you do, though they be never ſo glorious and good, &amp; do not lay your claim firſt right in the point of Juſtification, you will miſtake and miſcarry, and be diſappointed of all this <hi>recompence of reward.</hi> Therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. ſays, <hi>Whom he hath juſtified, them he alſo glorified;</hi> ſo that <hi>Glorification</hi> does depend upon <hi>Juſtification:</hi> Now then the firſt thing that a ſoul is to look after for the aſſurance of its portion in this <hi>recompence of reward,</hi> is to make ſure in the point of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> for there lies the

claim to heaven, and all the reſt comes but as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of this. Now the laying our claim right in the point of Juſtification conſiſts in this, When a ſoul comes to apprehend the infinite need it hath of a perfect righteouſneſs of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and looks upon that righteouſneſs of the Mediator as well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, as ſufficient to abſolve it from former ſins, and to diſcharge it from former guiltineſs, whereby another reward was due to it, and by faith applies this righteouſneſs, whereby it comes to be perfect before God, and lays the weight of all its confidence of Heaven, and of glory upon this; then you may hope to have intereſt in this <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward:</hi> but if your claim come in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way then this, it does not give you any intereſt to heaven; and therefore look much to the point of <hi>Justification,</hi> and be ſure that your hearts have laid the claim and intereſt it hath to heaven and eternal life right <hi>there,</hi> and then there may be great hope of the recompence of reward, though afterward there be many failings in your works and ſervices: And if you will look at any work whereby you ſhould have the reward, eſpecially look at the work of believing, cloſing with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt in the apprehenſion of your own unworthineſs; This is the greateſt work that any man is able to do, that ſhall have the greateſt reward in heaven.</p>
                  <p>You think if you were able to perform duties, and do ſuch and ſuch things, to keep your hearts up for God, you ſhould have this reward; but the greateſt work of God that ever any creature did, is when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends its own unworthineſs, to venture upon the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; if you were able to perform
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:57146:346"/>
full obedience to every particular of the Moral Law, it were not ſo great a work, not ſo accepted of God, not ſo well pleaſing in his eyes, nor ſhould not be ſo gloriouſly rewarded in Heaven, as this one work of believing in his Son. God takes ſuch infinite delight in his Son, as he looks more at that work of the ſouls believing in his Son, and venturing it ſelf and its eternal eſtate upon his Son, then he does upon all works beſides: and therefore look upon the point of <hi>Justification</hi> by faith <hi>firſt,</hi> and if that be right, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the reward will come in: divers objections will riſe, that can never be anſwered, till the heart be ſetled in the point of Juſtification. All the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that riſe from our weakneſs and ſinful infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty comes from this, becauſe we do not ſettle our ſelves well in the claim we make to the recompence of reward in the point of Juſtification, in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt by faith.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, examine what your works are, ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſuch as ſhall attain to this <hi>recompence of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">8.</note> 
                     <hi>reward:</hi> If all the excellencies of all the moralities of all the men in the world were put into one, theſe could never reach to this reward; it is a ſupernatural thing, and therefore if you would know whether you ſhall have it, there muſt be ſomething ſupernatural in you.</p>
                  <p>But when is a work ſupernatural, ſo as I muſt have ſome comfortable hope, that it ſhall reach unto this <note place="margin">Quest.</note> ſupernatural reward?</p>
                  <p>A ſupernatural work hath, Firſt, ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principles. Secondly, it hath ſupernatural <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ends. Thirdly, it is performed in a ſupernatural maner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="693" facs="tcp:57146:346"/>
Firſt, the principles are ſupernatural; firſt, they are above nature; and ſecondly, they are fetched from a fountain that nature hath no skill of. For the firſt, there is ſomething above nature, that puts you upon duties; you do not onely go on in the ways of godlineſs, becauſe you know you are bound to them, you cannot be ſaved elſe, but becauſe you finde a new light let out by God from heaven, that ſhews an infinite excellency and beauty that is in the way <note place="margin">What <hi>a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural work</hi> is.</note> of godlineſs. And you finde a principle of Divine nature put into you, that makes the ways of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs agreeable to you; and the more Spiritual and Divine they are, the more ſuitableneſs you finde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your ſouls and thoſe ways.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, do you finde that you draw your principles that enables you to any good work from a <hi>Mediator?</hi> The natural principles come at higheſt but from reaſon, it ſees reaſon for ſuch and ſuch things to be done; but a ſupernatural principle is drawn from a Mediator, from God-Man, from God in Chriſt, and by vertue of the promiſe, and ſo it comes to be an Evangelical obedience.</p>
                  <p>And it hath ſupernatural <hi>ends,</hi> beyond ſelf, and all <note place="margin">2.</note> ſelf, and creature reſpects: That work that is natural riſes no higher then nature in its ends; as the water aſcends no higher then from the place it deſcends: ſo all natural works have ſome ſelf or creature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, but when you finde your hearts are raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſelf and creature reſpects in your obedience to God, there is a ſupernatural end.</p>
                  <p>And then they are performed in a ſupernatural <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>maner. Seneca</hi> hath this expreſſion of deſires; <hi>You may know it is not a natural deſire when it riſes beyond</hi>
                     <pb n="694" facs="tcp:57146:347"/>
                     <hi>bounds:</hi> He applies it to evil deſires, when a man deſires things without bounds, <hi>that</hi> is no natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: Now that which he applyes to the corruption of nature, we may rather apply to the perfection of nature. All the deſires of nature are ſuch as are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in a narrow compaſs; no natural man in the world does go on in the ways of obedience with an infinite deſire to dilate himſelf infinitely as far as he is capable, but is always limited in a little narrow compaſs, ſo far he will go, and no further; but when the ſoul comes to walk with God in a way of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural obedience, it comes to be without bounds, all thoſe bounds that did limit the ſoul are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and there is a letting out of the heart to God in the ways of godlineſs in an infinite maner; and this is a moſt clear evidence of a ſupernatural work, that will go for currant in Heaven, and ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded there; there is the impreſſion of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs upon the heart in every work that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; examine whether your works be not like thoſe that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15. where he ſpeaks of the works that <hi>ſhall burn;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us conſider whether our works be ſuch as when they come to the tryal, ſhall be found to be ſtubble, and burn.</p>
                  <p>There are a great many whoſe works are like to burn, and themſelves too: Many of the works of Gods people are like to burn, but look too your ſelves for your main and principal works, whether they will hold when they are examined by the rule of heaven, and ſhall be rewarded: It is nothing what your works are before men, the people of God may highly eſteem of your works, but when they come
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:57146:347"/>
to be examined in heaven, they ſhall be examined ſtrictly, and unleſs God ſee a ſupernatural ſtamp up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they will burn; and therefore look to your works, ſee whether they be ſupernatural in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in the ends, and in the maner of doing of them: and examine by theſe rules the aſſurance of this reward. Mr. <hi>Latimer</hi> ſays, the aſſurance of heaven, is the ſweet meats of the feaſt of a good conſcience: In great feaſts there are good meats and banquets: There are other dainty diſhes in this feaſt, and the aſſurance of heaven is the ſweet meats and the banquet. Now that we may have the feaſt of a good conſcience made full, let us take pains in examining whether this recompence of reward be ours: if we did but apprehend this reward to be ours, it would make us go on with power in our way, whereas now every little thing is ready to turn us aſide.</p>
                  <p>Again, if upon examining by theſe arguments <note place="margin">10.</note> you finde ſome comfortable hope that <hi>the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward</hi> is yours, what concerns you, but patience to wait for it; and in the mean time to live as thoſe that ſhall have theſe things, and labor to dye ſo?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, patiently to wait; St. <hi>Iames</hi> ſays, <hi>The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman waits for the precious ſeed till the harvest</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>

We muſt work in the vineyard of the Lord, and endure
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:57146:348"/>
the heat of the day, and not expect our peny till night. Mark how the Apoſtle would have thoſe to walk who have the hope of heaven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>To them, who by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory, and honor, and immortality, and eternal life.</hi> Great things are to be expected and waited for; If a man have a great venture at Sea, that he expects ſome mighty profit by, he is content to wait two or three years, becauſe he thinks it will make amends for all: So in your way of merchandizing, if a man go and buy a commodity of five or ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, he lays down preſent money, but if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity come to a great ſum of many hundred pounds, he does but give ſomething in earneſt, the great pay is to come many moneths after: ſo when men will bargain with God for their obedience to have <hi>credit</hi> and <hi>eſteem</hi> in the world, yea, thoſe men that aſpire after the greateſt things in the world, theſe are poor trifling matters, and God gives them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently: but becauſe the Covenant that is between God and Chriſt, &amp; ſo between Chriſt and us, is about great matters, and God intends to reward his people with glorious things eternally in the Heavens, they have but the <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> of them for the preſent, and they muſt not expect the fulneſs of them ſuddenly.</p>
                  <p>Great men have two kinde of Servants uſually, ſome ſervants that they hire by the day, or the moneth, or the year, that they ſhall have ſo much wages, and ſo their wages is paid them, it may be every night, or every week; other ſervants have not their wages preſently, but that which they ſerve for, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſome great office or living that their Lord ſhould give to them after many years ſervice,
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:57146:348"/>
and therefore they go on in their ſervice, though nothing come preſently. Here is the difference between the men of the world and others, I ſpeak of thoſe who live the beſt lives who are not truly gracious; they in ſome meaſure are the ſervants of God, they do God ſome ſervice, onely ſuch ſervice as poor laboring men do that are hired in a great mans Houſe, that have their pay every week, or day; ſo you have your pay every day, you have meat and drink, and the comfort of the creatures; but God hath other greater Servants, godly people, Chriſtians, and though they have not ſo much pay preſently, as wicked men have, yet there are reverſions, and ſome glorious things that they expect hereafter, and therefore they go on patiently, though for the preſent they have not ſo much as others. And you have no cauſe to envy others: If there be two Servants in a great mans Houſe, the one ſees the poor laboring man have his ſhilling given him, ſhall he envy him, and ſay, I have ſerved many years, and have not had a ſhilling? No, he does not envy him, becauſe he expects ſome great things: And ſo when you ſee the men of the world have the great things of the world, do not envy them, becauſe you ſerve God for greater things.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſhe envyed the milk-maid <hi>when ſhe was in priſon,</hi> but if ſhe had known what a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reign ſhe ſhould have had for four and forty years, ſhe would not have envyed her. Wait there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore patiently, becauſe the things are great, and the longer you wait, the greater they will be: as it was the ſpeech of the Son of an <hi>Emperor,</hi> ſays he,
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:57146:349"/>
                     <hi>The longer the Cooks are preparing the meat, there will be the better chear,</hi> meaning, <hi>The longer he ſtaid for the</hi> Empire, <hi>the greater it would be;</hi> ſo go on in your way, wait patiently, the longer you wait, the better it will be at the laſt: and it is ſure enough, Chriſt is gone before to take poſſeſſion, and God never ſo wrought to make any thing ſure, as he hath wrought for the aſſuring of the good in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace. Yet long after it and deſire it. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 21. it is ſaid, <hi>The creature groaneth to be delivered from the bondage of corruption, to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the glorious liberty of the children of God;</hi> and therefore we our ſelves ſhould much more deſire it, and pant after that time, we ſhould cry out with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> though with patience, <hi>When ſhall I appear before God, the living God?</hi>

<pb n="699" facs="tcp:57146:349"/>
that they would <hi>walk worthy of God, who hath called them unto his kingdom and glory:</hi> it is a great charge <hi>to walk worthy of God,</hi> but to walk worthy of God <hi>who hath called us to his kingdom and glory,</hi> this is great, but the life of a Chriſtian muſt be thus. Now conſider, what life have I? Is my life ſuch as may be ſaid to be worthy of God, and that God that hath called me unto his kingdom and glory? Surely great things muſt be in the lives of Gods people: people talk much of ſtrictneſs, and preciſeneſs, that they may be too preciſe; what do you think muſt this life be that muſt be worthy of God who hath called us to his kingdom and glory?</p>
                  <p>It muſt not be a dead-hearted life, go on with a holy and heavenly chearfulneſs and courage in Gods ways: It becomes the children of the Bride-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be joyful: ſee that in any caſe you rejoyce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; comfort your ſelves and one another by theſe ſayings. We belye the truth of God, if we do not walk joyfully: <hi>Rejoyce</hi> in this, <hi>that your names are written in the Book of life;</hi> ſays Chriſt, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced that the <hi>Devils fell down before them:</hi> If there were any thing in the world to be rejoyced in, one would think they might rejoyce in <hi>that,</hi> but Chriſt would not have them rejoyce in that, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of this. <hi>Caeſar</hi> when he was ſad, he ſaid to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Think thou art Caeſar,</hi> that <hi>that</hi> might take away <note place="margin">Cogita te Caeſarum eſſe.</note> his ſadneſs; and ſo ſay I to a Chriſtian, <hi>Think of your Crown and glory,</hi> let your lives be ſuch as may make it appear you have your portion in theſe things.

                  <p>Beſides, thoſe that have hopes of Heaven, they <note place="margin">3.</note> ſhould labor to have their lives like to Heaven: It is that we pray for, that <hi>the will of God may be done in earth as it is done in heaven:</hi> How is it done in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?

whenſoever God ſhall call you to ſuch a glorious <hi>recompence of reward</hi> as this is. It is ſaid of <hi>Daniel,</hi> though he was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> he opened his windows towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he kept his heart in a readineſs to go: So you ſhould do, keep your hearts in a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly frame ready for heaven, waiting upon the Bridegroom with your lamps burning, that when he comes you may open immediately to him. There is a difference between a wife that hath been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to her husband, and waits for his coming home, and another that hath been unfaithful to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and hath other lovers in the houſe when her husband knocks; if her husband knocks, ſhe doth not go immediately, but there is ſhuffling up and down, and ſhe delays the time, till ſhe have got the other out of the houſe; but a faithful wife, ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately opens; it is true, though the wife be not unfaithful, yet if the houſe be not handſom, and things be not prepared, ſhe is loth to open: So Chriſtians they have been dallying with their luſts, and their hearts are out of frame, and they are loth to open to Chriſt; but we ſhould keep our hearts in ſuch a readineſs, as immediately to open to Chriſt, and to be willing to dye.</p>
                  <p>And when <hi>we dye,</hi> to dye as <hi>heirs</hi> of ſuch things, not to reſpect things below, houſe or lands, or any thing here. We read of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> when he was to dye, he laments his condition, becauſe he was to leave all his delights and pompous vanities, and cryes out, <hi>O my ſoul, whither goeſt thou? thou ſhalt never be merry more;</hi> he was loth to leave theſe things, becauſe he did not know whither he went; but a ſoul that knows what inheritance it ſhall have
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:57146:351"/>
hereafter, it is not loth to go hence: Many are loth to dye, becauſe they have treaſures in the world, as thoſe <hi>ten men</hi> ſaid, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 8. <hi>Slay us not, for we have treaſures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oyl;</hi> but a godly man is willing to dye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath treaſures in Heaven. Keep open the eye of faith, exerciſe faith to ſee God that is now ſending for his childe home: And look upon Chriſt as having that prayer granted, <hi>Father, I will that thoſe whom thou haſt given me be where I am:</hi> by faith you ſhall ſee Heaven opened, and the crown prepared, and ſee God in his glory, that you may expreſs chearfulneſs of heart in going to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that glorious recompence of reward; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Angels of God coming to take you up into Heaven. It was an expreſſion of the honor of one <hi>Hugh Biſhop of Lincoln,</hi> that <hi>King</hi> John <hi>and his Nobles would carry him to the grave;</hi> more honor ſhall the Saints have, for God to ſend his <hi>Angels</hi> to convey them to that place of glory.</p>
                  <p>And further, let you ſpirits work mightily after Heaven; now when they draw near to it, as the nearer any thing is to the center, the more ſtrongly and ſwiftly it moves; As a ſtone that falls down from a high place, it moves more ſwiftly when it is nearer the ground, then when it was higher; ſo at death, the ſoul is nearer its center, grace is changing to glory, and when grace and glory is to meet, there muſt need be a mighty working of heart, and mighty ſhouts: As it is reported of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bulloin</hi> and his company, when they went to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as ſoon as his company ſaw the high Turrets, they gave <hi>a mighty ſhout, that the earth</hi>

                     <hi>rang:</hi> and ſo when the ſoul ſees the turrets of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and when you ſee your ſelves ready to go and poſſeſs it, what mighty workings and ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of your heart will there be?</p>
                  <p>And when you are to dye, ſpeak well of God, and of the ways of godlineſs to all that are about you. Chriſtians ſhould now labor ſo to live, as there may appear a mighty difference between their deaths, and the death of others; whereas ordinarily ſuch is the vanity and droſſineſs of the hearts of Chriſtians in their lives, as when they come to dye, they are ſo heavy and ſad, as if no ſuch things were prepared for them. In 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. the Apoſtle having exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them before to adde one grace to another, and to <hi>give all diligence to make their calling and election ſure,</hi> ſays he, <hi>So an entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto you abundantly, into the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Chriſtians ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor ſo to live, as when they come to dye, they may not onely have <hi>an entrance</hi> into the everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Lord adminiſtred unto them, but that they may have an entrance <hi>adminiſtred unto them abundantly:</hi> Many make ſhift to get to heaven, but they have not an entrance adminiſtred <hi>abundantly.</hi> As a Ship may make ſhift to get into harbor, but with the Anchors loſt, and Cables rent, and Sayls torn, and the Maſts broke; another Ship comes in with the Sayls up, and the Flags up, and Trumpets ſounding, and comes bravely into Haven; ſo much difference is ſometime between true Chriſtians; ſome through careleſneſs, and unbelief, and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſullenneſs of Spirit, although they make ſhift with much ado to get into Heaven, yet ſo as
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:57146:352"/>
their anchor of hope was even gone, and they had little or no comfort at all; but thoſe that have added one vertue to another, and have been <hi>diligent to make their calling and election ſure,</hi> they come to Heaven with much glory and joy, and that ſhould be our care ſo to live in adding one grace to another, that when we dye our deaths may be glorious.</p>
                  <p>Yet further, from the conſideration of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> 11.</note> revealed, which God hath prepared for his Saints, we are to draw this meditation, If Heaven be ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, then we had need fill up the comfort of our lives by doing and getting as much good as we can while we live here, that we may as much as poſſibly we can recompence that which we ſuffer in the ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the poſſeſſion of ſuch glorious things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for us; when we hear of ſuch things as theſe are, we cannot but think in our ſelves, it were better for us many ways to be in Heaven, this life is but a bondage to us while we are abſent from ſuch things, and therefore we had need have ſomething to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence this bondage; we had need do much good, and get much good, while we live, to pay the charges of our lives; what a tedious thing is it to us to live ſo much to ſenſe as we muſt neceſſarily do here, when we are heirs of ſuch glorious things? if we do not do much good, and get much good here, what have we to ſweeten and recompence this tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? If a man be from home, and by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſuffers much loſs of what he might have had at home, he is the more diligent and careful in his journey to get ſomething that may recompence this loſs; ſo it ſhould be with us: It coſts us dear (as I may ſo ſpeak) to live in the world, for it coſts
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:57146:353"/>
us the forbearance of ſuch glorious things; if we fill not up our lives with ſervice for God, what have we to pay our charges to countervail this that our lives here coſt us?</p>

                     <hi>violence:</hi> Surely there is ſtrength enough in that which hath been ſaid to draw forth the heart with <hi>violence</hi> after it. I remember <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports in <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fugiendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt ad cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſsimam patriam ibi pater, ibi omnia</hi> Plotinus. apud Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. lib. de Civit. 9. c. 16.</note> the life of <hi>Camillus</hi> of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> that after they had once a taſte of the ſweet wine of the grapes that grew in <hi>Italy,</hi> they inquired in what Countrey ſuch ſweet wine was, and after they underſtood where the grape of that wine grew, they would never be at reſt till they got to that Countrey where ſuch ſweet and pleaſant things grew. I have endeavored in the opening of this point, to bring unto you ſome of the Cluſters of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſome of that wine which is to be drunk in the Kingdom of Heaven; now if you account it to be ſweet and good, let not your hearts be at reſt till you come at that Countrey, till you come to enjoy the ſweet and good of that Countrey.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of one <hi>Adrianus,</hi> who ſeeing the <hi>Martyrs</hi> ſuffer ſuch grievous things in the cauſe of Chriſt, he asked what was that which cauſed them to ſuffer ſuch things; and one of them named that Text, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear hath not heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive what is laid up for thoſe that love God;</hi> and the naming of that <hi>Text</hi> converted him, and had ſuch an effect as made him to profeſs Religion, and ſo to profeſs it, as to be a <hi>Martyr</hi> for it: You have not onely <hi>one</hi> Text named, but <hi>many</hi> have been uſed about this argument, let not all be in vain. We read in <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 17. <hi>of a yong man</hi> that came running, and kneeled before Chriſt, and asked him, <hi>Good Maſter, what ſhall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</hi> O that God would move the hearts now of ſome yong ones,
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:57146:354"/>
that hearing what eternal life means, they may now come running to get part in it, that that activity and vigor of their youth may be exerciſed and ſpent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this, <hi>What may I do that I likewiſe may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of eternal life, and of theſe glorious and bleſſed truths that are here revealed?</hi> You that are in a poor condition in the world, that have little here, here are great things for your hearts to make after, here are glorious things that are as obvious for you ac for the greateſt in the world; you cannot expect to have great matters in the earth, but here you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have great matters. You that are old likewiſe, though you have not been acquainted with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Kingdom of God, now bleſs God that you may yet further know more concerning it. If a man come to know more of an inheritance that did befal him, or of any outward gain then before, he is glad that he lived to that time; ſo bleſs God that you may know yet more concerning eternal life before this life be at an end. What is it that your hearts are ſet upon? There are none but their hearts are ſet upon ſome good that they apprehend to be good; Now what is that good? Certainly there is an eminency of all good contained in this.</p>
                  <p>It was a charge of God unto <hi>Baruch,</hi> that we read of in <hi>Jer.</hi> 45. <hi>ult. Seekeſt thou great things for thy ſelf? Seek them not, for I will bring evil upon all fleſh, and that which I have planted I will pluck up:</hi> The argument runs thus, <hi>Seekeſt thou great things for thy ſelf</hi> in any outward matter? <hi>do not ſeek them,</hi> for I am about to bring evil upon my people, the time of publique calamity is coming, and doeſt thou ſeek great things for thy ſelf? But when we are
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:57146:354"/>
about this argument, the glory of the Kingdom of God, <hi>Doeſt thou ſeek great things for thy ſelf?</hi> We cannot ſay, <hi>Seek them not:</hi> God would have his people ſeek glorious things for themſelves, ſeek them to the utmoſt that poſſibly you can: So follow theſe things as not to be ſatisfied with any thing under theſe.</p>
                  <p>God would have his ſervants to be of ſuch ſpirits, as though content with the leaſt mercies they do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, <note place="margin">Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with no worldly good for their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to acknowledge themſelves unworthy of them, yet not to be ſatisfied with the greateſt things in the world for their portion. What, will a reprobates portion ſerve you? Certainly, the glory of the world, if you had it all, it were but the portion of a reprobate. What, will a Dogs portion ſatisfie you?

                  <p>It may be ſome of your hearts when you hear

much of the wrath of God againſt ſin, and the dreadfulneſs of Gods diſpleaſure, your hearts are ready to riſe, and belk, and theſe are hard things, and hard ſayings, and who can bear them? but now you have not heard ſo much concerning that, but you have heard of the goodneſs of God, and of the glory of God, and of the riches of the grace of God, and of the wonderful thoughts that God hath for the everlaſting good of mankinde, how do your hearts work now? Shall your hearts ſtir when you hear Gods wrath, and when you hear of Gods grace ſhall not your hearts ſtir then? If God does intend good to any ſoul, he will cauſe that ſoul to ſee into the reality and excellency of theſe things, and that all things ſhould be neglected (in compariſon) in ſeeking after theſe.</p>
                  <p>Conſider that God hath given unto you natures capable of theſe glorious things; God might have made you <hi>worms</hi> or bruit <hi>beaſts,</hi> and there would have been an end of you preſently, you had not been any way capable of theſe things; but God hath made you of ſuch a nature, ſuch creatures, as ye are capable of the higheſt excellency that ever any creature that God made was capable of, and therefore being of ſuch a nature, of ſuch a large extent, it concerns you to ſeek after thoſe things which might fill it; they are not little things that can fill large capacities, now mans nature an immortal ſoul, is of a large capacity; and when the time ſhall come that God ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to any ſoul what it was capable of, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely will it be confounded in it ſelf, when it ſhall know what poor things it ſought after and minded? Men live here in the world as though they were
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:57146:355"/>
capable of no other happineſs but meat, and drink, and clothes, and ſuch kinde of things, as if there were no higher things that concerned the ſouls of men. Heathens were mighty inquiſitive what ſhould be the true happineſs of man, they did think ſurely man was made for higher things then thoſe that are here, and there were mighty diſputes about it what it ſhould be, there were fourſcore Opinions that were amongſt them about the happineſs of man; they did but beat the buſh, God hath given us Chriſtians the bird, and we have the Goſpel that reveals glory, and immortality, and happineſs unto us.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Heathens</hi> would have counted it a great good to have known <hi>wherein the true happineſs of man did conſiſt:</hi> And thoſe who had moſt wiſdom did come near that wherein we ſeek happineſs, and yet wavered in their thoughts, but we are aſſured of it, we have God himſelf revealing from Heaven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our true and utmoſt high good conſiſts, and therefore if we ſhould not ſeek after that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which God tells us is happineſs, but ſhould follow our own ways ſtill, how juſt will our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation be.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>this</hi> is not the <hi>time</hi> that God will commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate much of himſelf in, and therefore we muſt look beyond this life. It is a witty elegant ſpeech <hi>Bernard</hi> hath, <hi>God reſerves his new and beſt wine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til afterward.</hi> Amongſt the <hi>Latins</hi> they call proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <note place="margin">Res ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae.</note> things <hi>ſecond things,</hi> becauſe they are to be had <hi>hereafter,</hi> they are not the <hi>firſt things.</hi> So true proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is not to be expected <hi>here</hi> in the <hi>firſt way</hi> of Gods communication of himſelf to the creature, but in the <hi>ſecond way,</hi> in the life that is to come: If a man have
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:57146:356"/>
good wine, he reſerves it till the laſt; ſo God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the riches of his grace, and the treaſures of his goodneſs, his beſt wine, till they ſhall come and drink with him in his own preſence before him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</p>
                  <p>And know further, that Chriſt hath wrought hard to provide happineſs for mankinde; and ſhall we neglect it? In his working for the glory of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and this happineſs of the children of men, he ſweat at it, and ſo ſweat, <hi>as clods of blood trickled down his fleſh</hi> in the garden, though it were in the winter time, and a cold night, and he lay upon the ground, and ſhall it now be neglected by us? You that have neglected this all this while, who might juſtly have had your reward amongſt thoſe creatures that are caſt out from the preſence of God: yet know there is a poſſibility for that tongue of thine that hath been guilty of ſo many blaſphemies, to be ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Allelujahs to the Lord, and to the Lamb that ſits upon the throne for ever.</hi> Who knows but that body of thine that hath been ſo intemperate, and but a ſink of filthy luſts, may be made glorious like the body of Chriſt? and what is it that God requires of you for all this? Nothing but onely to work his own work in you, and it is not a diſhonorable work, but a glorious work, that in which there is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency then in any thing in the world: were it that there were no reward of godlineſs, the very <hi>excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of godlineſs <hi>it ſelf,</hi> hath more in it then the whole world: but take godlineſs with that excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which it hath in its own nature, and take it with its glorious end, and who would not come into this way? Many men care not what baſe thing they do,
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:57146:356"/>
ſo they may be a little regarded, but now to have the higheſt reward that ever God will communicate to any creature, and that for doing thoſe things which are the higheſt honor for the preſent, this would encourage any living to come into this way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> inviting many to a ſupper, he provided a Crown of a hundred and eighty pound to be given to thoſe that did drink moſt, and in that he did like a <hi>Heathen;</hi> but though it was ſuch a baſe work, and ſo dangerous to themſelves, yet there was one and forty that killed themſelves with drinking to get that Crown: Thus we may ſee the baſeneſs of mens hearts, that to get a little honor in the world, will not onely do ſomewhat that is baſe, but the baſeſt things of all, and that although they be dangerous too. What ſhame and confuſion will this be, that any ſhould do more for the things of the world, yea more for a luſt, then we ſhall do for Heaven? How ſhall we ever think to get Heaven, when this may be ſaid, <hi>You do not ſo much for Heaven and Glory, as many will do for their luſts, for their filthy ſins.</hi> I have read of the <hi>Panther,</hi> that it does love the dung of man ſo much, as if it be hanged a height from it, it will skip and leap up, and never leave till it have burſt it ſelf in pieces for to get it, and that is the way they get that creature: we may apply it to the filthy baſe luſts of mens hearts which are like dung, &amp; yet ſo are many men ſet upon them, that they wil venture all for them, and labor after them, though they burſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and damn themſelves eternally for them: what an infinite ſhame is this, that men ſhould be content to labor, and ſuffer ſo much for their luſts, and that we ſhould do no more for glory? If men do ſo much
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:57146:357"/>
for the things of the world, why ſhould we be backward in doing for Heaven? How will men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the cutting off the members, and much pain for health and life, and yet for this reward, and this inheritance, how little is done in the world?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sorun,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>that you may obtain,</hi> not <hi>a corruptible,</hi> but an <hi>incorruptible crown:</hi> Thoſe that run a race for a corruptible crown will be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and deny themſelves in their diet, <hi>But we,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>ſtrive for an incorruptible crown;</hi> therefore let all our ways be ſuch as it may appear to all the world that we are ſtriving for an incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crown, and that God hath ſhewn us glory and ſalvation to draw our hearts more then any thing in the world; and <hi>ſtrive,</hi> for now by ſtriving you may come to the reward, but if you ſtay but a while, you muſt be eternally receiving the reward of ſin, then though you would do a thouſand times more, God will not care for it; if then you ſhould ſay, <hi>Now Lord I will ſeek thy face, and do any thing thou wilt have me to do,</hi> God will not then regard it. As one <hi>Lamachus</hi> a Commander ſaid to one of his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that was brought before him for a misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior, who pleaded, <hi>He would do ſo no more;</hi> ſays he, <hi>No man muſt offend twice in war:</hi> So God will <note place="margin">Non licet in bello his peccare.</note> not ſuffer men twice to neglect the day of grace; if it be neglected once, it is neglected for ever, if you loſe this reward here, you loſe it eternally; and therefore now look about you to attain this here, that you may not cry out in the anguiſh of your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits hereafter, That God, and Chriſt, and Heaven are eternally gone.</p>

                  <p>I anſwer, Are your hearts ſerious in asking <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> this queſtion? Do your ſouls ask this queſtion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the earneſtneſs of them? as they did, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> ſo as to be willing to yield to whatſoever God ſhall reveal: If you have ſuch a reſolution, know this comes from Heaven, and if it be followed to purpoſe, it will bring you to Heaven: But for direction, if you would make your ſelves partakers of this reward,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, conſider the infinite diſtance that is between <note place="margin">I.</note> you and Heaven naturally. That bleſſed <hi>Martyr</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooper,</hi> though he was a gracious man, yet he cryed out, <hi>Lord, thou art Heaven, and I am hell;</hi> If he cryed out ſo, how much more may many of you, whoſe conſciences may accuſe you, <hi>Lord, thou art heaven,</hi> but <hi>I am one</hi> not onely that deſerve hell, but <hi>that am hell it ſelf?</hi> What ever wickedneſs is in hell, is in every mans heart naturally; when as any are caſt into hell, certainly hell puts no new ſin into them, there is but the venting of that ſin which was there before, and all the wickedneſs of mens hearts that was reſtrained, is now let open: Now look what infinite diſtance is between hell, and all this glory, and the glorious thoughts of God for the ſalvation of a poor creature, the ſame difference is between this glory and that condition a man is
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:57146:358"/>
in naturally: O labor to ſee this, and be convinced of this, and work this upon your hearts, what is that reward that you do deſerve, make your hearts truly ſenſible of that.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it concerns us much, if we would not <note place="margin">2.</note> miſcarry here, to acquaint our ſelves with the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>the Covenant of Grace,</hi> for it is upon that your eternal eſtate depends more then any thing elſe; onely in the Covenant of Grace is revealed the counſels of God concerning bringing mankinde to eternal happineſs, and how he will bring about this glory, and without ſome knowledge of the Covenant of Life and Grace in Chriſt, all that can be done in the world, can never bring any ſoul to Heaven; and that ſoul is in a very good forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to eternal life, that is acquainted with the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider what is the <hi>ſpecial ſin</hi> that your <note place="margin">3.</note> heart is naturally moſt inclined unto, and you finde the corruption of your hearts vent it ſelf moſt in, and look to that, take heed that be not your bane in the concluſion, let there be a renouncing of that, or elſe all is to no purpoſe, all your ſerving of God is nothing.

If you will not labor after heaven as one that beats the ayr, beat down your bodies; if you do not beat down your bodies, there is little hope of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of your ſouls: it was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> care, let it be yours.</p>

It is a ſpeech that I have read of one <hi>Demades,</hi> when the Emperor ſent to his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Athens,</hi> to give him Divine honor, and they were loth to yield unto it, but conſulted about

                  </p>
                  <p>I have read of <hi>Antipater</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> that when one preſented him a Book treating of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, his anſwer was, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>I have no leiſure;</hi> you have been preſented with Sermons, and now with a <hi>Book</hi> treating of heavens happineſs, take heed that no earthly entanglements ſo take your heart, that you ſhould put off all with ſuch a thought, <hi>I muſt minde and follow my occaſions;</hi> let no other things take up your heads or hearts, that you ſhould have no liberty to your ſpirits to ſeek after theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things, or at leaſt not ſo to ſeek after them as becomes things of ſuch a high and glorious nature as theſe are.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 19. ſays, <hi>They that will be rich, fall into a temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition:</hi> they that ſet their hearts upon the creature, <hi>they muſt have</hi> ſo much of <hi>the creature,</hi> they drown themſelves in the creature. As a man when he is drowning, he catcheth hold of any thing that is next him, and by faſtening upon that which is next him, he loſes faſtening upon that which might ſave his life: So thoſe that have their hearts engaged to the creature, and reſolve they muſt have ſo much of the creature, they are <hi>drowning in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and they catch hold upon that which is next
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:57146:359"/>
them, ſome preſent content and pleaſure; and though ſomething be caſt to deliver them, they let that go: We in the Goſpel caſt forth a line to you to help you from drowning, (for every man naturally is ſinking in perdition) but becauſe your hearts are ſet upon the creature, and engaged there, you falling down to the ground, catch hold upon that which <hi>is next you,</hi> ſome contentment in the creature, and that drowns you in perdition, and all our preaching is not avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuch a ſoul that hath faſtened it ſelf upon any creature contentment here, you take not hold on our line that we throw out to you, and ſo you drown in eternal perdition, take heed therefore of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture earthly engagements. <note place="margin">5.</note>

                  <p>Again, if you will obtain this <hi>recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> follow that Scripture, and make much uſe of it, in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 73. 24. <hi>Guide me with thy counſel, and afterward receive me to glory:</hi> Would you be brought to glory? Be willing to <hi>be guided by the counſels of God:</hi> What do you think in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are the counſels of God concerning you? Take heed it be not ſaid of you, as it was of the <hi>Phariſees., They rejected the counſels of God:</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver talk of hoping and truſting in Gods mercy, if you neglect the counſels of God revealed in his word: thoſe counſels of his which were in his heart from all eternity, that ſhould be the way of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to happineſs. It is all one with that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 17. 15. <hi>As for me, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy face in righteouſneſs, I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, I look to receive ſatisfaction from the likeneſs of God, by beholding his face in righteouſneſs. Now I appeal
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:57146:360"/>
to thee, <hi>Canſt thou behold the face of God in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?</hi> Are they ſuch righteous ways as thou walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in, as thou canſt look upon his face, and behold him with comfort? this is the way to come to this <hi>recompence of reward,</hi> for ſo the Scripture ſays, <hi>God hath called us to glory and vertue;</hi> if you would come to glory, go on in the way of vertue.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, be willing to endure any difficulty, any <note place="margin">6.</note> hardſhip in the world; The ſtone will fall down to come to its own place, though it breaks it ſelf in pieces: ſo we, that we may get to our center which is upward, though it be to break our ſouls in pieces, that ſhould ſuffice us. It is ſaid of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> one day he ſet his Soldiers to hew wood, and to do hard work; the next day he feaſted them, with a great deal of delight and pleaſure, then he asked them, which day they had rather have? they ſaid, the latter: he ſays to them, <hi>If you would always have ſuch days, you muſt be willing for a while to ſtrive with your enemies, and then you ſhall have the ſpoil, and always have ſuch merry days:</hi> and this he did to put heart into them. Shall <hi>eating,</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> and a little pleaſure here, put heart into men to ſuffer hardſhips, to endure difficulties? How much more ſhould the obtaining of this glorious <hi>recompence of reward,</hi> put heart into us to endure any difficulty? We read of the Devil, he came to Chriſt, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him <hi>all the glory of the world,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Fall down and worſhip me, and all this will I give thee:</hi> but here is another maner of invitation to worſhip God; God ſays to every man and woman, <hi>Fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me, and all the glory of heaven will I give thee:</hi> It was but the glory of <hi>the world</hi> that the Devil
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:57146:360"/>
ſhewed, and he could not give it him; it was but the Devil that offered it, and it was by worſhiping of the Devil to get it; but it is the God of glory that hath all glory at his diſpoſe, that calls to you this day to worſhip him, that is ſo infinitely worthy of all worſhip; <hi>fall down and worſhip me,</hi> and not onely the glory of this <hi>world,</hi> but the <hi>glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and of an incorruptible crown, <hi>will I give unto you, I will make it ſure to you.</hi> God does out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all the world: when <hi>ſin</hi> and temptation comes to offerany thing to you, know that God out-bids them, they cannot give that which will reach this. If a chapman come and bids for a commodity, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man comes and out-bids him, he carries it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: Hath any <hi>temptation</hi> come to draw away your hearts from God? God comes and out-bids all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations in the world, to that end you may come and fall down and worſhip the Lord. O do not ſtick in the droſs and mire of your filthineſs ſtill. I have met with a Text in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 23. which one interprets to be meant of the baſeneſs of people, that regard baſe things, rather then joyning in Church-communion with Gods people, God ſpeaks of them in away of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, <hi>Theſe were the potters, &amp; thoſe that dwelt,</hi> &amp;c. When the people of God ſhould return to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they would ſtill dwell with the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and live amongſt their <hi>pots,</hi> ſo they might have mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, rather then return to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> where the true worſhip of God was, their own country, and a type of heaven, theſe are thoſe baſe ſpirits. It may be applyed to many, if they live in places where they may follow their callings, make <hi>pots</hi> ſo as to get a livelihood for themſelves, and their families, rather then they would
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:57146:361"/>
venture any thing to joyn with the people of God, they would ſtay there. But how much more baſe is it, for people ſtill to ſtick in the mire and droſs, rather then to ſeek after theſe glorious things?</p>
                  <p>Wherefore for concluſion of the Exhortation; as St. <hi>John preached,</hi> and ſo Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Repent, repent, the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand:</hi> So ſay I; Repent, repent, break off ſin, reform, for the kingdom of heaven, not onely <hi>the kingdom of the Goſpel,</hi> and of <hi>grace,</hi> but the kingdom <hi>of glory</hi> is at hand. And therefore what remains, but as we read in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the glory of heaven, ſays, <hi>There is glory to be revealed in us.</hi> We have had in the opening of this Point, the glory of heaven revealed to us; the Lord grant that the glory of heaven may be revealed in us. And thus we have finiſhed the Application of the glorious recompence of the reward of Gods people; the great argument that encouraged, that ſtrengthned, that confirmed <hi>Moſes</hi> in this his bleſſed choice.</p>
