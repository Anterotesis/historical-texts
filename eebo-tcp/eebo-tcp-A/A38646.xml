            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THe Lords here preſent, together with divers other Peers of the Realm, taking notice that by your late Proclamation, your Majeſty has declared an intention of calling a <hi>Parliament,</hi> at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and obſerving from Hiſtory and Records how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate many ſuch aſſemblies have bin, when called at a Place remote from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City; as particularly the Congreſs in Henry the Seconds time at <hi>Clarindon;</hi> Three ſeveral Parliaments at <hi>Oxford</hi> in Henry the thirds time; and at <hi>Coventry</hi> in Henry the Sixths time; With divers others which have proved very fatal to thoſe Kings, and have been followed with great miſchief on the whole Kingdom: and conſidering the preſent poſture of affairs, the many jealouſies and diſcontents, which are amongſt the People, we have great cauſe to apprehend that the conſequences of the ſitting of a Parliament now at <hi>Oxford</hi> may be as fatal to your Majeſty and the Nation, as thoſe others menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned have bin to the then Reigning Kings; and therefore we do conceive that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer it to God, to your Majeſty, or to the People, If we, being Peers of the Realm, ſhould not on ſo Important an Occaſion humbly offer our advice to your Majeſty; that if poſſible. Your Majeſty may be prevailed with, to alter this (as we apprehend) unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Reſolution. The Grounds and Reaſons of our Opinion, are contained in this our Petition, which We humbly Preſent to Your Majeſty.</p>
            <div type="petition">
               <head>To the <hi>KING</hi>'s moſt Excellent Majeſty. The Humble Petition and Advice of the Lords under-named, PEERS of the REALM.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Humbly Sheweth,</hi>
                  <lb/>
THat whereas Your Majeſty hath been pleaſed, by divers Speeches, and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to Your Houſes of Parliament, rightly to repreſent to them the Dangers that Threatned Your Majeſties Perſon, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from the Miſchievous, and wicked Plots of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the ſuddain Growth of a Forreign-Power, unto which, no Stop or Remedy could be Provided, unleſs it were by Parliament, and an Union of Your Majeſties <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Subjects, in one Mind, and one Intereſt.</p>
               <p>And the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> in Purſuance of Your Majeſties Commands, having more at large Demonſtrated the ſaid Dangers to be as great, as we in the midſt of our Fears could Imagine them: And ſo preſſing, that our Liberties, Religion, Lives, and the whole Kingdom would be certainly Loſt, if a ſpeedy Proviſion were not made againſt them.</p>
               <p>And your Majeſty, on the 21. of <hi>April,</hi> 1679, Having called unto your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, many Honorable and Worthy Perſons, and declared to them and the whole Kingdom, That being ſenſible of the evil Effects of a ſingle Miniſtry, or private Advice, or Forreign Committee, for the General Direction of your Affaires; Your Majeſty would for the Future Refer all things unto that Council, and by the conſtant Advice of them, together with the frequent uſe of your great Council, the <hi>Parliament,</hi> Your Majeſty was hereafter Reſolved to Govern the Kingdoms; We began to hope we ſhould ſee an end of our Miſeryes.</p>
               <p>But to our Unſpeakable Grief and Sorrow, we ſoon found our Expectations Fruſtrated. The <hi>Parliament,</hi> then ſubſiſting, was Prorogued and Diſſolved before it could perfect what was intended for our Relief and Security: and though ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was thereupon called, yet by many Prorogations it was put off, till the 21. of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51897:2"/>
                  <hi>Octob.</hi> paſt; and notwithſtanding your Majeſty was then again pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that neither Your Perſon, nor Your Kingdom could be ſafe, till the matter of the Plot was gone thorow, It was unexpectedly Prorogued on the 10th. of this <hi>Month,</hi> before any ſufficient Order could be taken therein: All their Juſt and Pious Endeavors to ſave the Nation were overthrown; the good Bills they had been Induſtriouſly preparing to Unite all Your Majeſties <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects brought to nought; The diſcovery of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Plot ſtifled; The witneſſes that came in frequently more fully to declare that, both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> diſcouraged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thoſe Forreign Kingdoms and States, who by a happy conjunction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with us might give a Check to the French Powers, Diſheartned, even to ſuch a Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of their own Security againſt the growing greatneſs of that Monarch, As we fear may induce them to take new Reſolutions, and perhaps ſuch as may be fatal to us: The Strength and Courage of our Enemyes both at Home and Abroad increaſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And our ſelves left in the utmoſt danger of ſeeing our Countrey brought into utter Deſolation.</p>
               <p>In theſe Extremities, we had nothing under <hi>God</hi> to Comfort us, but the Hopes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Your Majeſty (being touched with the Groans of Your Periſhing People) would have ſuffered Your Parliament to Meet at the Day unto which it was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued: and that no further Interruption ſhould have been given to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, in order to their Saving of the Nation. But that failed us too; ſo then we heard that Your Majeſty, by the private Suggeſtion of ſome Wicked Perſons, Favourers of Popery, Promoters of French Deſigns, and Enemies to Your M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>jeſty and the Kingdom (without the Advice, and as we have good Reaſon to believe, againſt the Opinion, even of Your <hi>Privy-Councel)</hi> had been prevailed with to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it, &amp; to call another to Meet at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where neither Lords nor Commons can be in Safety; but will be dayly expoſed to the Swords of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and their Adherents of whom too many are crept into Your Majeſties Guards. The Liberty of ſpeaking according to their Conſciences, will be thereby Deſtroyed, and the Validity of all their Acts, and Proceedings conſiſting in it, left Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Straitneſs of the Place, no way admits of ſuch a concourſe of Perſons, as now follows every Parliament; the Witneſſes which are neceſſary to give E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence againſt the Popiſh Lords; ſuch Judges, or others whom the Commons have Impeached, or had Reſolved to Impeach, can neither bear the Charge of going thither, nor truſt themſelves under the Protection of a Parliament, that is it ſelf Evidently under the Power of Guards and Souldiers.</p>
               <p>The Premiſes conſidered, We Your Majeſties Petitioners, out of a Juſt Abhorrence of ſuch a dangerous and pernicious Council (which the Authors have not dared to avow) and the direful Apprehenſions of the Calamities &amp; Miſeries, that may enſue thereupon; do make it our moſt Humble Prayer, and Advice, That the <hi>Parliament</hi> may not Sit at a Place, where it will not be able to Act with that Freedom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is neceſſary; and eſpecially, to Give unto their Acts and Proceedings, that Authority which they ought to have amongſt the People, and have ever had, unleſs Impaired by ſome Awe upon them, (of which there wants not Precedents) and that Your Majeſty would be graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to Order <hi>It</hi> to Sit at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> (it being the uſual Place, and where they may Conſult and Act with Safety and Freedom)</p>
               <closer>And Your Petitioners ſhall ever Pray,
