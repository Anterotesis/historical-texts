            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

whole, haue no neade of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſycian, but thei that art ſycke. For the Phariſees dyd obiecte the ſame to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> diſciples of Chriſt, ſaiyng: Why doeth your maiſter eate with ſinners? furthermore ſeyng that no man liueth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſynne, not as muche, as the infaunt of one daie: we owght not to teache, that men ſhoulde not ſynne at all, but rather to repent daiely and hourely, and to beware of ſinne, as of a ſnake, and that the godly owght not to diſpaire, if thei fall, at any tyme As for the ſinnes, that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted openly, thei are ſo exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitate or rebuked by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the churche. Suche ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritee and extreme grauitee is vſed in rebukyng, that theyr e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies are wont to ſaie alredy, that thei can none other thyng,
<pb facs="tcp:5057:19"/>
but chide and braule. Agayne, touchynge abſtencion or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratyng, we doe not ſee that euer Chriſte did the ſame, as long as there was any hope. We doe not ſeparate our ſelues, leaſt we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like vnto the Phariſees, Luc. xviii.</p>

                  <p>I can not beleue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this deuocion of theirs is without blame, or is ſyncere and pure. For thei diuide the churche, where no neade is. For thou canſt not denaie, but that god, is taught by vs truely and faithfully. And that ſynnes are reprehended and rebuked, with great libertee and conſtauncie. What doe thei therfore, that we doe not, ſaue onely, that thei doe ſeparate them ſelues, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other, and are full of obſtinacie? Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo tranſforme him ſelfe, into an a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gell of light?
<pb facs="tcp:5057:20"/>
What merueill is therfore, if theſe impoſtours or deceitfull perſons, can faine them ſelues, to be ſheapeherdes? Thei that doe fiſſhe, dooe not caſte a bare hooke before the fyſſhes, but doe hyde &amp; couer it, with ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt and ſwete baite. And Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to did ſaie veary well. Whiles the byrder, the byrdes begyleth, The flute alwai ſwetely pipeth. Nor he is not ſo fooliſſhe, as for to ſet or laye his net before the birdes eies. Did not the biſſhop of Rome ſeduce vs ſo many ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, with his peincted hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and with his godly and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne diſſimulacion and fraude? But theſe thynges are gon out of remembraunce, ſythe that we doe, ſo lyghtly addicte or bynde our ſelues, to theſe newe impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, and hipocrites. By what

craftes, did monkes get ſo gret richeſſes, was it not, by flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng, and hypocriſie? Was it not, by a feined ſanctimony, and holyneſſe of lyfe? As for that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei doe reioyce, when thei are taken, &amp; dye gladly, with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng and laudyng god, thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſo exaggerate and extoll it, as though theſe thynges (if thei be done) ſhulde ſhewe and proue that their doctrine is true, and that their deedes are good. If thou canſt proue that, it ſhall folowe, that theft and robbery, be iuſte and good deedes alſo. For whan thei be puniſſhed at the galows, or vpon the whele, thei doe oftentymes ſuffer it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, &amp; moreouer, doe praiſe &amp; laude god. Who is ſo folyſſhe, to thynke, that he maye thus make his argument? This man
<pb facs="tcp:5057:21"/>
is tormented and puniſſhed, &amp; yet not withſtandynge, dooeth gyue thankes: ergo, he is a iuſt man &amp; holy. If any man, ſhulde contende, that this doeth folow, he muſte nedes to graunt alſo, that the religion of the Iues, is moſte holy, yea, that their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion onely is true. For no man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doeth pacientlyer endure, to the very death, for his religion, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iues doe. How many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes were there (thinkeſt thou) which did moſte conſtantly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death, teſtifiyng, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their ou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e blood, that thei had taught the truthe.

                  <p>Now, no man can denaye, but that the ſame euerlaſtyng, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeable, and holy ſpirite, hath inſpyred the holy ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in to holy mens hertes and myndes. Whereby it foloweth neceſſarily, that the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, which ſpeaketh agaynſte the meanyng of the ſpirite, that dooeth ſpeake and expreſſe hym ſelfe in the diuine ſcriptures, is not of god, but rather an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

                  <p>That, we dooe not, as thou doeſt interprete the letter.

And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne what ſpirite ſo euer is contrary to the holy ſcriptures, is of the dyuelle, the father of lyes. Seyng therfore, that the ſpyrite of the Anababtiſtes, wil not bee ruled by the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but preferreth hym ſelfe, to the woorde of god (callynge by crafte, the woorde of god, a bare letterre) yea and ſette

The firſt is, in the .x. chapiter of the Actes, touchyng Cornelius the centurion, which although he was elected by god, yet not withſtandyng, beyng ſo tawght by the angell, did ſende meſſangers, to fetche Peter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he migh heare by hym, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of our ſauiour Ieſu chriſt.

hath ben iudged and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alwais as heretikall. But we will now, corroborate and ſtrength theſe ſaiynges, with ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſcripture. In the epiſt. to the Rom. x. chap. Paule teacheth af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter this maner: who ſo euer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vpon the name of the lorde, ſhalbe ſaued. But how can thei call vpon hym, in whome they haue not belued? and how ſhal thei beleue in hym, of whom thei haue not harde? And how can they heare without a preacher? And agayne how ſhal thei prea: the, except thei be ſent? By theſe wordes of Paule, we maie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that ſendyng is veary ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, whiche doeth not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pertaine vnto all men. For Paule .i. Corin. xii ſaieth, that there be many giftes. And ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the body is one thynge,
<pb facs="tcp:5057:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and hath many lymmes, which lymmes, though thei belong all to one body, yet neuertheleſſe, haue not all owne offyce, in the body, ſo it is in the churche, and miſticall body of Chryſte. God dyd putte and ordeyne ſome, in the churche, to be apoſtels, ſome to bee prophetes and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of ſcriptures, ſome to bee teachers, ſome to bee poteſtates and rulers, ſumme to haue the giftes of healynge, ſumme to miniſter to the poore, ſumme to gouerne, and ſumme agayne to haue the knowledge of ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. If ſo bee, that the offyce of teachyng, ſhulde equally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine vnto al men: Paul would haue ſayed, that god hadde or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned all, to bee prophettes, and teachers, but he ſayeth: he hathe ordeyned ſumme to bee
<pb facs="tcp:5057:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
apoſtels. &amp;c. Why dare then the Anababtiſtes preſume ſo much, as for to ſet them ſelues forthe, by their own autoritee, to prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che &amp; to teach, againſte the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Paule? Hebrues .v. No man (ſaieth he) doeth vſurpe, or preſumptuouſli take that honor vnto hym ſelfe, but he, which is called by god, as Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo chriſt did not glorifie hym ſelfe to bee made biſſhoppe, but he that ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto hym. Thou art my ſonne and to daye haue I begotten the. And in an other place: Thou arte a prieſt for euer, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of Melchyſedecke. After this maner dooeth Iohn Babtiſte, teſtifye of the miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſendynge of Chryſte in the fyrſte, and thyrde chapiter of Iohn. And of his owne ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, doeth he hym ſelfe ſpeake,
<pb facs="tcp:5057:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the .i. cha. of Iohn, ſaiynge: There was a man ſente by god, whoſe name was Iohn when he was alſo aſked, by what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritee he did teache and babtize, he did bryng forthe out of Eſaie and Malachie, a teſtimony and witneſſe of his miſſion and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng. So the Apoſtelles were bothe called and ſent, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, by the x. and .xxviii. of Mathew, by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> laſt of Mar. and .xx. of Io. Paule doeth teſtifie in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> begynnyng of his epiſtels, and ſpecially in the epiſtell to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that he was called. In the .xiii. of the Act. he with Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas, is ſegregated by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt and ſent to preache.

If ſo bee, that thou preferreſt the ſpirite vnto men, &amp; agayne wyll haue the ſaiyng of Paule to be true, I do not perceiue, by what reaſon it can ſtande.

                  <p>Thou dooeſt aſke righte well this queſtion. But it is to be noted, that Paul doeth not here take the ſpirite for the holy ghoſt, whiche is the thyrde perſone in trinitie, but for the gyfte &amp; operacion of the ſpirite of God. The ſenſe and meanyng of this place, is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the gyfte of prophecy, is ſo in the power of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that hath it, that he maye bothe ſpeake, &amp; holde his peace,
<pb facs="tcp:5057:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the congregacion of the ſayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, when, and as long, as it is expedient for the hearers. For they are not ſo inſtructed and moued, with the ſpirit, as mad, and phantaſticall men are, that they ſhoulde all cryout at once, with an vnſemely clamor, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muryng one agaynſt another, with a debatefull contencion &amp; ſtryfe: For ſo, one coulde not vnderſtande another. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God is gentle, treatable. and peaſable, not ſtirrynge or mouyng any man to contencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and debate, but to peace and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nytie.

But circumciſion, was not taught by the falſe prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, as an outwarde thyng, but as a neceſſary &amp; needeful thyng to ſaluacion: which thei dyd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vrgently and inſtantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade, that it ſhoulde bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued &amp; kepte, yea, and all the whole law beſyde.

diſpiſynge richeſſe, none other wyſe, then the Foxe, dyd in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes paſt diſpyſe, the ſweete gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pes, that ſhe could not come by.

If thyne eye be ſimple, and lyghtſome, all the body ſhal be lyghtſome: but if thyne eye be wycked and euyll, all thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhall be darkeneſſe. Mat. vi. Therfore, if a riche ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and godly, the richeſſe that he hathe, be good, and that, by reaſon of the good vſe. If the maſter or owner of the richeſſe, is vnfaythful or an infidell, his richeſſe are nought. Luke .xvi.

                  <p>That Chriſt dyd neuer cauſe tumult, for outwarde thynges, but dyd alwayes ſtudy to peace &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie, we wyl bring the .xvii. of Mathew, where he ſpeaketh to Peter after this maner: Leſt we do offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them (that is to ſay, that do receyue the didragme) go thy waye to the ſea, &amp; caſt in, thy hoke, and the fyrſt fyſh that cometh, open his mouth, &amp; thou ſhalt fynde a ſtater, take it and geue it for the &amp; me. In the. xxii of Math, when he was aſked, of the yearely tribute, that was
<pb facs="tcp:5057:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
payed vnto Ceaſar, he did ſo fly from tumulte, that he dyd iyone bothe god and Ceaſar togither, biddyng them to pay their duty to eche of them. Nor, he dyd not condempne them, that dyd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue. Nor agayne he dyd not ſay: Bleſſed are they, which doo geue. He dyd not ſay: ye owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng by Goddes law, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſt andyng geue: wo be, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym, that dothe receyue. In the .xiii. of Iohn, Chriſt doth ſo teache hys Diſciples: I geue you a new co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, that ye loue eche other, as I haue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued you. By this, ſhall all men know that ye be my Diſciples, if ye loue eche other. And incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent in that long ſermon that he made vnto his Diſciples, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Maundy, he doth chefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeake of the Spirite of the
<pb facs="tcp:5057:68"/>
faythfull. And a lytell afore, he ſhoulde ſende his Apoſtles, he dyd ſaye: Peace vnto you, as my father hathe ſent me, ſo I ſende you. The .xiiii. chap. Rom. Paule ſayeth: The kyngdome of God, is neyther meate nor drinke, but rightouſneſſe, peace and gladneſſe in the holy ghoſt. For, he that ſerueth vnto chriſt in thoſe thyngꝭ, is accepted both before GOD, and before men. Therfore, let vs followe that, whiche belongeth to peace, and edifieng, one towarde another. In the .i. Cor. i. he dothe exhorte the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: I beſeche you, brethren, in the name of oure Lorde Iheſu Chriſt, that ye dooe ſpeake all one thyng, and that there be no diſſencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s among you, but that yee bee one whole bodye, of one
<pb facs="tcp:5057:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mynde &amp; opinion. Let no ſuche contencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be among you, that one ſhoulde ſay: I am Cephas diſciple, another, I am Pauls: an other, I am Chriſtes. Is Chriſt diuided: was Paul cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for you? Or were ye bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, in the name of Paule? When ye do ſay ſo, ar ye not yet carnal? Moreouer, loke, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Paul writeth in the xii. cha. to the Cori. exhortyng them to concorde &amp; charitie, by the exemple of the body and the lymmes. In the .xiiii. he ſayeth apartelye, that God is not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthor of diſcencion, but of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and peace, whiche thyng may be ſene, in the Churches of the faythfull. In the .iiii. to the Epheſians, Paule doeth exhort vs, to behaue oure ſelues, and walke ſo, as it doeth become the
<pb facs="tcp:5057:69"/>
vocacion wherwith, we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, with all obeiſaunce &amp; low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe, with gentlenes of hert, forbearing eche other thorough charitie, and that we ſhoulde ſtudye to kepe the vnitie of the ſpirite by the bounde of peace, beyng (ſayth he) one body &amp; one ſpirite, as yee are called in one hope, of your vocacion. There is but one Lorde, one fayth, one Baptiſme, one God and father of vs all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. In the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ii. chap. to the Philippians, with lyke ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, exhorteth he, the faythfull to be of lyke affection, to haue betwene them ſelfes, loue &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to be of lyke mynde &amp; lyke iudgement, and that nothyng ſhoulde be doone among them, by contencion or vayneglorye. But by humilitie &amp; lowlyneſſe of hearte, euerye man ſhoulde
<pb facs="tcp:5057:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>

trouble the Churche?

                  <p>Lying (ſayth he) for my ſake.

                  <p>Paule ſpeaketh of Chriſt in the ii. chap. to the Colloſſen. after this maner: And you (ſayth he) when yee were dead thoroughe youre ſynnes or in the prepucie or vncircumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of yourfleſh, he hath quykened alſo with him forgyuyng vnto vs all our ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

(ſayth ſaynt Paule) one obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion beynge offered for ſynnes, ſitteth euerlaſti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly on the right hande of God the Father.

If any man dothe ſynne, we haue an aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, before the father, that righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teous Lorde Ieſu Chriſt. And he is the ſatisfaction for oure ſynnes, and not onely for oure ſynnes, but for the ſynnes of all the worlde.

Therfore we ar clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed &amp; purified, with the blood of Chriſt, that was ſhed vpon the croſſe, from the filthines of ſyn, &amp; be all cleane, But it followeth not by this, that we be no more i the fleſh, or that we be no more ſynners. For the dregges of ſyn do remayne in our feete, that is to ſay, in our affections, as long as we liue, &amp; walke in this duſt i and foule way, we are ſoyled &amp; contaminated, with the filthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſynne, which we neade,

Finally chriſt, in the .xv. of Iohn ſaieth: I am the trewe vine, and my father is the huſbande man. He doeth take awaie euery bough in me that bringeth forth no fruite, &amp; euery bowgh y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bryngeth for the fruite, he doeth purge &amp; make cleane, that he mai bryng forth more fruite.

For this thynge beynge ones graunted, al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> epiſtles of Paul ar condemned, as falſe, &amp; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che dyd ſeduce the people. For this is the thyng onely, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paule, with ſuche a zeale did repugn &amp; reſiſt againſt falſe prophetes, whiche did teache,
<pb facs="tcp:5057:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that rightwiſneſſe dyd come of workes: where as ſainte Paul did attribute our rightwiſnes to faithe. That maie eaſily bee ſene by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> epi. to the Ro. and to the Gala. But I wil bring out of them, certaine places, which can not be confuted. In the .iii. cha. to the Romains, Paul ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus: All haue ſynned and ar deſtitute of the glory of god, but are iuſtified freely by his grace, thorowgh the redemcion that is in Chriſt Ieſu. And in the .iiii. Ro. If Abraham were iuſtified by workes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath he wherin to reioice, but not with god, for what ſaieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleued god, &amp; it was counted vnto him, for rightwiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes. To him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worketh is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde not reckened of fauoure but of dutye. To him y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> worketh
<pb facs="tcp:5057:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not, but beleueth in hym, that iuſtifieth, the vngodly, is his faith counted for rightwiſnes. Euen as Dauid deſcribeth the bleſſedfulnes of that man, vnto whom god imputeth righwiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe without dedes. Bleſſed ar thei (ſaieth he) whoſe iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are forgiuen, &amp; whoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are couered. &amp;c. And in the xi. to the. Ro. There is a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt left accordyng to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of grace, if it be of grace then it is not now, of workes. For tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grace is no more grace But if it be of workes, then is it no more grace. For then wer deſeruyng, no more deſeruyng. In the ſeconde to the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: The lyfe, whiche I nowe lyue in the fleſhe, I lyue by the faith, of the ſonne of God, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che loued me, and gaue hym
<pb facs="tcp:5057:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſelfe for me, I deſpiſe not the grace of God. For if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſeneſſe cometh of the lawe, then Chryſte, is dead in vaine. In the thyrde chapiter, he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth argumente and reaſone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner: That no man is iuſtified in the ſight of God, by the lawe, it is euydent. For the iuſte ſhall lyue by faythe. The lawe is not of faythe, but the man, that fulfylleth the thynges, conteyned in the law, ſhall lyue in them. Chryſt hath delyuered vs from the curſe of the lawe, in as muche, as he was made accurſed for vs, that the bleſſing of Abraham might come on the gentilles thorough Theſu Chryſte, and that we myght receaue the promiſe of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſpirit, thorow faith. Brethern, I ſpeake after y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> maner of men.
<pb facs="tcp:5057:98"/>
Though it be, but a mans te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, yet if it be alowed, no man deſpiſeth it, or addeth any thyng ther vnto. To Abraham, and his ſede, was the promiſe made. He ſaieth not, in thy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, as in many, but in thy ſede as of one, which is Chriſt, this I ſaie, that the lawe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne. CCCC and .xxx. yeres after, doeth not diſanulle the teſtament, which was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med afore of God, vnto Chriſt warde, to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſe of no effecte. For if the inheritaunce cometh of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, then it cometh not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſe. But god gaue it, vnto Abraham by promiſe. For if ther had ben a law geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which could had geuen life, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no doubt rightwiſneſſe, ſhoulde haue comed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe.

vnder ſinne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the promiſe, by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> faith of Ieſu Chriſt, might bee geuen vnto them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beleue. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ii. cha. to the Ephe. ye ar ſaued thorow faith, &amp; not of our owne ſelues. It is the gift of god, and cometh not of our dedes or wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes. For we ar his owne work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſhyp, created in Ieſu Chriſt to do good dedes, which he hath prepared for vs to walke in, &amp; in the .iii. to Ti, we wer alſo fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſhe, diſobediente, deceaued, ſeruyng to luſtes and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, liuyng in malice, and enuye, hatefull or odiouſe and hatyng eche other.

                  <p>That is to ſaie, that Iames dooeth not goe about, to proue, that workes iuſtifie, and that fayth iuſtifieth not, but that faithe without workes, is no faithe, but an oppinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and credulitie, or light beleue, which faith can not ſaue.

For they doo neyther denye the Goſpell, nor the Reſurrection of Chriſt.

whiche after that it begynneth ones, can neuer ceaſſe from his operacion and workyng, tyll it be quenched: and that is, when it hathe nothyng, whervpon, it maye ſhew, and exerciſe his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peracion. If thou denyeſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peracion &amp; working of the fier, thou haſt denyed the fyer. The nature of the ſoule is very like, which after, that ſhe is poured in to the body, by god, is a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and working ſpirite, and can neuer ceaſſe nor be at reſt. Wylt thou haue no fyer, take awaye the operacion. If thou denyeſt the Soule, attribute vnto her, ſlepe.

                  <p>The Saduces, dyd teache that ther was no Reſurrection, and by this, dyd denye the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie, and perpetual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng of the ſoule, yea, and alſo Angels, and all maner of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. Act. xiii. The Lorde dyd ſtop their mouthes, with theſe reaſons. Ye erre (ſayth he) not
<pb facs="tcp:5057:115"/>
knowing the ſcriptures, nor the vertue of God. God, after the death of the Fathers, calleth hym ſelfe, the God of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Iſaac and Iacob, which is not the God, of the dead. but of the lyuyng, and that therfore, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, and the other Fathers were a lyue, and not dead. Thei were dead in body, a gret whyle afore, and buryed: Therfore Chriſt ſpeaketh here, of the lyfe of the ſoule. Ergo, the ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng ſeparated from the body, is in her owne kynde, worketh ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely, and ſlepeth not. This ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logyſme and argument, doo I put to all the Anababtiſtes, to anſwer to, that they may cleare them ſelfe frome the hereſye of the Saduces. For thei are lyke vnto the Saduces and Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheans. What ſhoulde I ſay of
<pb facs="tcp:5057:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the wordes of Chriſt, whiche hangyng vpon the Croſſe, doeth comforte, the thiefe with theſe wordes, ſaiyng: To daye thou ſhalte be with me in Paradiſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sy.</speaker>
                  <p>Paradiſe, and the Boſome of Abraham, are all one thyng, to the Anababtiſtes, where thei ſay, that the ſoules doo ſleape.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ioia.</speaker>
                  <p>Thei do affirme this with out ſcriptures, and with an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall ſpirite. Chriſt ſayeth: To day, thou ſhalte be with me in Paradiſe. Ponder euerye worde. If Paradice, is a ſlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng place, Chriſt ſleapeth in it alſo. For he ſayeth: To daye thou ſhalte be. Moreouer, the thiefe prayeth Chriſt, to remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber him, when he ſhoulde come in to hys kyngdome. If the kyngdome of God, is a Dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie or Sleapyng place: what
<pb facs="tcp:5057:116"/>
doo the ſcriptures ſpeake, of the Reſurrection, and Aſcendyng of Chriſt in to heauen? Ye ate obſtacle aſſes, O Anababtiſtes, whiche dare make mention of ſuche ſleapyng, agaynſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt places of the ſcriptures. What ſhall thei ſay, to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Chriſt. Iohn. v.? He that heareth my word, and beleueth in him, that hath ſent me, ſhall not come in to iudgement, but is paſſed frome deathe to lyfe. Whiche woordes are ſo cleare, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can denay them, but heretikes. Let the .xi. of Iohn. and the .xv. of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians. Item the .ii. Cor .ii. be reade, and it ſhal euidently he knowen, that the ſleape of the Anababtiſtes, is a blaſphemy agaynſt the Goſpell and Reſurrection of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>If the matter be better loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon: the Anababtiſtes can not cleare them ſelues, from the crime of ouer boldneſſe &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancye: but they haue not pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all theſe thingꝭ ſo exactly</p>
