         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>VVE Return you our humble thanks for your conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
to us your City-Pamphlets, for though gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
there is neither much wit nor truth in moſt of them,
yet they give us ſome divertiſement to obſerve how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
they are to ſow the Tares of Diſloyalty and Sedition in the
heads and hearts of the People: But, God be thanked, we do not find
that it takes much effect, at leaſt, about us, for we knowing their Deſign,
and having, many of us, ſeen the Cheat acted once before, are not ſo eaſily
prevail'd upon to renounce our Loyalty to the beſt of Kings, and our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
and obedience to the beſt Religion in the World, only to reſcue
a company of furious Zealots from thoſe puniſhments they know their ill
actions have deſerved, and which they think cannot be ſafe but by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
greater.</p>
            <p>As for your <hi>Intelligences</hi> and <hi>Mercuries,</hi> that call themſelves <hi>Proteſtant,</hi>
certainly they are the laſt Effort of the Pope and the Devil to make the
Word odious in the World, and certainly are as great a Scandal to the
true intention of the Word <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> as <hi>Popery</hi> is to <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> And
though the Word it ſelf doth not ſignifie <hi>Religion</hi> (no more than the late
Proteſtation of the Lords at <hi>Oxford</hi> made them one jot the more Religious.)
For the true and proper diſtinction between us and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> is the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
and at this day thoſe whom we call <hi>Proteſtants of France,</hi> ſtile
themſelves <hi>Ceux de la Religion reformée,</hi> and their Church, <hi>l'Egliſe reformée.</hi>
However time and uſe thoſe great Arbitrators of Words, have made the
Word <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> familiar and ſignificative amongſt us, and is not ſo large
as, <hi>No Papiſt,</hi> (as ſome would have it) ſo as to include <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi>
and what not: but hath its ſober ſignification, and with us ſignifies, Thoſe
in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Eſtabliſhed by Law at the
times of the <hi>Reformation</hi> in the Days of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſo continued down to this Day. But as for thoſe <hi>Sham-Proteſtants,</hi>
thoſe <hi>Scribling-Bermicham,</hi> and as they call themſelves <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting-Proteſtants,</hi>
are no more <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the true Notion of the
Word, than one that denies a thing can be ſaid to affirm it, or one that
diſſents can be ſaid to aſſent. And as the Word took its Origin from
thoſe gallant Proteſting Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> againſt the Edict of <hi>Spire:</hi> ſo
it were not much matter if it were laid aſide, when it is uſurped by ſuch
Seditious and Scandalous Perſons, who ſhame the Word.</p>
            <p>Your other Books of <hi>The Hiſtory of the Succeſſion, Character of a Popiſh
Succeſſor,</hi> and ſuch like, What do they but Rake in the Kennels of Hiſtory,
and pick up all the black and unjuſtifiable Actions of ſeveral Ages to make
good their own Seditious Principles, and think themſelves good men, if
they can find any upon Record as bad as themſelves: It being as illogical
from thoſe many Rapes that have been made upon the Legitimate Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Crown, by thoſe ſeveral Bold Uſurpers and Ambitious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
to Royalty through the Aſſiſtance of diſcontented Grandees and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51184:3"/>
Clergy-Men, to prove this an Elective Monarchy, as to prove the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of Robbing upon <hi>Shooters</hi> or <hi>Gads-Hill,</hi> becauſe <hi>de Facto</hi> it hath
often there been put in Execution.</p>
            <p>But it is an eaſie thing to perſuade men that are reſolved upon the
Point; and though we know they would ſtick at no villany to compaſs their
Ends were it once in their power, yet they pleaſe themſelves to ſee how
many Gudgeons they catch, with theſe ſpecious Baits of Precedents and
Hiſtory, which neither they themſelves believe, nor hope they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
upon any thinking men, yet knowing how willingly the Zealous Party
are led by the Noſe, they venture to print any thing, rather than ſeem
to ſtarve their Cauſe, or let their Mad Admirers cool into Soberneſs and
Loyalty. How much more ingenuous aud beneficial to Mankind were
it for theſe Men to have obſerv'd to the World how Funeſt and Tragical
both to Prince and People, moſt of thoſe Uſurpations have been, though
otherwiſe confirmed, as they call it, by Parliaments; What Seas of Blood
have been let out of the Veins of Noble and Simple, what Ruins and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations
have attended the Defence of their ill-obtained Regalities, where
as 'tis ſaid in ill-gotten Goods, <hi>vix gaudet tertius haeres:</hi> ſo in theſe Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Titles they never were of long continuance; but the Reſtleſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
through an innate Loyalty and Secret Love and Acknowledgment of
the Sacred Right of Succeſſion, was alwaies rowling and never quiet, till
the Crown was Fixed upon the True and Legitimate Heir. And how
little Knowledge in Judicial Aſtrology would ſerve the turn to predict the
ſame Effects from the ſame Cauſes? And how eaſie to imagine that they
may at laſt be Cudgell'd into that Loyalty and Obedience, which now
they willingly Forfeit, and after a vaſt Expence of Blood and Treaſure
be glad to return to that bleſſed Peace and Protection we now enjoy,
but do not value.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ay, But the Proteſtant Religion will be deſtroyed under a Popiſh Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor?
And we are under more ſtrong Obligations of Conſcience to defend
our Religion, than we are to defend the Title of any Prince whatſoever:
And it is a greater Offence to God Almighty to introduce Idolatry than to
deſtroy Monarchy:</hi> And ſeveral other pretty Arguments to prepare the
People to Rebel for Conſcience ſake. To theſe and a great many more I
ſhall not trouble my ſelf nor you to make any Remarks upon, as ariſing
rather from miſtaken Zeal, than from Solid Reaſoning: But I ſhall only
touch upon their beloved, darling Querie, over which they hug and tickle
themſelves, and make ſuch an Oration, as if they had gotten ſome ſignal
Victory; <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the admitting of a Popiſh Succeſſor, be the beſt way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the <hi>Proteſtant Religion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if there can be any Rational Account given of this Paradox, or
that any one can make the Queſtion it ſelf conſiſtent with <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
erit mihi magnus Apollo.</hi> But though I ſhall not undertake ſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
difficult a Province, as to Anſwer the Querie, as they term it, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically,
yet you will pardon me if I give you my ſlight thoughts of it.</p>
            <p>And Firſt I muſt diſſect it into parts, <hi>As whether the Admiſſion of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Succeſſor be in our Choice or no?</hi> Or, <hi>Whether God Almighty hath left it
to the Liberty of every People to Chuſe their Prince?</hi> And if ſo, <hi>Which of
the People is to do it?</hi> And if <hi>Religion</hi> hath any influence upon his being
admitted, Then another Querie may be, <hi>Whether the admitting a</hi> Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
<hi>Succeſſor be the beſt way of preſerving the</hi> Proteſtant Religion? And
ſo an <hi>Independent, Anabaptiſt,</hi> or <hi>Quaking</hi> Succeſſor. Then I am to Ask,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51184:3"/>
               <hi>What you mean by</hi> Proteſtant Religion, <hi>whether that Eſtabliſhed by Law,
or ſome other, or all other but that?</hi> For if we may judge by the Querents,
we know there is nothing leſs in their thoughts than being over ſolicitous
to preſerve that <hi>Religion,</hi> which they brand with theſe ridiculous Terms
of <hi>Toriſm, Tantiviſm, Maſqueradiſm,</hi> and ſuch like ingenious Titles: For
which Reaſons the Querie might be, <hi>Whether</hi> Popery <hi>or</hi> Presbytery <hi>is the
readier way to deſtroy the</hi> Proteſtant Religion? And indeed this is a Querie
too hard for me to determine, I know the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have Will enough, but
the <hi>Presbyter</hi> hath conſtantly had the better of them, as having better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
being a ſeeming Friend and ſo leſs ſuſpected; And indeed the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> deſpair of doing any great miſchief but through their ſides, and by
their aſſiſtance. And I do extremely wonder, that Men of Parts, as ſome
of the Faction certainly are, ſhould be ſo gull'd with malicious Zeal againſt
the <hi>Religion</hi> Eſtabliſhed by Law, that they are content once more to be
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Journey-Men and Tools, as they in their Prints confeſs they
were, when they would Divert the Odium of the Late Rebellion, and
Murdering the Late King, of Ever-bleſſed Memory, from themſelves upon
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who they acknowledge inſinuated themſelves into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
to their Armies, their Pulpits, and what not, (I was going to ſay their
very Beds.) So that whilſt the innocent <hi>Presbyter</hi> had no other Ends but
advancing the Kingdom of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and making the King a Glorious
King, according to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> The <hi>Jeſuitical Independents</hi> ſnatched the
King out of their hands (who was their King, by one Title more than any
other Party could pretend, as having bought him of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that
at a great Rate, and ſome of them knew for what End too) and, God
knows much againſt their will, Cut off his Head; while on the other
ſide, the more ingenious Villains of the two, the <hi>Independents,</hi> own the Fact,
but tell them they could never have done it, had not they held him by
the Hair.</p>
            <p>Thus the King was once Murdered, and the <hi>Religion</hi> Deſtroy'd by the
Zeal of the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> under the Conduct of the ſubtle <hi>Jeſuit.</hi> And now
we ſee, Since the great Plot againſt the King and the Church of <hi>England</hi>
hath failed, having been ſo happily and fully Diſcovered, by that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to-be-forgotten
Doctor <hi>Oats,</hi> and the reſt of the concurring Evidence, the
ſly <hi>Jeſuit</hi> hath betaken himſelf to his old ſlights of Plowing with the
zealous <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as the ſaid Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> ſo Prophetically Swore and
Foretold in his firſt Diſcovery, aſſigning the very places and ſtages on
which they were to Act, as he ſaid ſuch and ſuch going for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
mingling themſelves with the diſcontented party there, who no doubt
play'd their parts ſo well, as to ſtir up ſome Zealots to Murther the Late
Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews;</hi> others to the Late Rebellion there, which was ſo
happily Suppreſſed by the Courage and Conduct of his Grace the Duke
of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> But that which is moſt ſtrange is, that it ſeems that the very
Blood which was there drawn from the Rebels, hath by ſome energetick
influence infected ſome of thoſe that drew it; who have ever ſince been
ſuſpected, at leaſt, very much to favour the Party and abett the Principles
of thoſe they chaſtiſed. Myſterious Victory! where on one ſide their
Bodies, on the other their Minds were interchangeably led Captive. Nay
more, That Victory of the Dukes was ſo ill reſented by that Party here
that have a ſecret compaſſion for all inſucceſsful Rebels, (and probably
the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> the Doctor mentioned and theſe were all of a complexion) that
ſome had like to have loſt their Intereſt, for puſhing that Service farther
than was intended they ſhould have done, and deſtroying ſo many of thoſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51184:4"/>
daring and precious Souls they might hereafter have occaſion to make
uſe of.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Tickling Querie, and the little ones in the belly of
it; though indeed it is the moſt diſingenuous thing in the World to make
Queries and lay ſome ſtreſs upon them, which they themſelves know have
no foundation in reaſon or practice. For if it be as clear as the Sun that
in ſuch a Kingdom as we are in, <hi>viz.</hi> an Hereditary Kingdom, where the
Succeſſion hath been continued down for ſo many Ages (ſaving ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions
by Uſurpers, which never laſted long, and coſt the Nation ſo
dear as was before hinted) we are no more concerned in the Qualifications
of a Legitimate Succeſſor, than we are in the Froſty weather in <hi>May,</hi> or
the no Rain in <hi>April:</hi> But if God in his Wiſdom ſhall think fit by ſending
us a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor</hi> (as they call him) for to revenge and puniſh a ſinful
and peeviſh Nation, or for the Tryal of the Faith and Courage of thoſe that
call themſelves <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> what have we to do but receive him, as we
ſhould do all other Chaſtiſements, with all Veneration and Submiſſion,
and beg of him to give us Grace to make the right uſe of thoſe Afflictions,
that is to amend our Lives, and be ſo much the better, by how much the
Times are the worſe.</p>
            <p>As for the Writer of the <hi>Character</hi> he hath taken indeed a great deal of
pains to repreſent his <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor</hi> in all the diſmal and frightful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
that wit or malice could handſomely invent, on purpoſe to
ſcare unwary people out of their wits firſt, and then out of their Loyalty
and Allegiance as well towards the Poſſeſſor as the Succeſſor; for to ſpeak
the plain Truth, the Arguments as well as the Deſign is clearly againſt
both, at leaſt they know there is no plauſible way to prevent the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,
but by uſing the Poſſeſſor ſo ill, that he may be forc'd at laſt to
yield to their importunities, and paſs ſuch Laws as may either totally Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
or ſo modifie and ſhackle the Succeſſor, that it ſhall not be in his
power to do half the harm the <hi>Character</hi> threatens us with. And here
naturally falls in a Queſtion, <hi>Whether a King in poſſeſſion with the Advice
and Conſent of his three Eſtates Aſſembled in Parliament (the Mint and
Fountain of all our Laws) can Legally do the one or the other, that is, either
Exclude or Modifie?</hi> And though it be a dangerous thing to queſtion
what a King ſo fortified may or may not do, yet we ſee every day, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
undertaking and determining the Queſtion on either ſide, and that
poſitively; So that we are left, in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> which ſide to take, as our
Affections and Intereſt moſt incline us. And though I will not be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
on either ſide, I ſhall only put this Querie:</p>
            <p>Whether if it were clear, or granted, That they could not Exclude, whether
then they could not Modifie?</p>
            <p>I know that the Current of Opinions is, That all Modifications are
ineffectual and deluſory, nothing but a total Excluſion will ſerve the
Turn. Now if they would be ingenuous and would Confeſs that they
are of Opinion, That nothing but an Excluſion will ſerve their Turns, I
ſhould be a little of their minds, for being conſcious to themſelves how
far they have provok'd him, they judging by their own Charity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
themſelves unpardonable, and therefore for their own Security muſt
endeavour to wheedle the whole Nation into the ſame degree of Guilt to
ſave them harmleſs. But we hope the Nation is not ſo mad yet, to involve
themſelves in ſo great Sin and Danger only to gratifie or ſecure a few
diſcontented Republican Deſperado's.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51184:4"/>
               <hi>Therefore to leave that Queſtion to them of thoſe Principles, give me
leave to put you a Caſe that on this ſubject was urged by one of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
(and he a very honeſt man too, as we take him at leaſt.</hi>) I would
willingly be ſatisfied, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> why the King in Poſſeſſion with the Advice
and Conſent aforeſaid, foreſeeing that by a Popiſh Succeſſor at any time, it is
more than probable, not only the Religion Eſtabliſhed, but the very Laws and
Government will be in danger of ſuffering ſuch convulſions as may hazard the
Ruin and Downfall of Monarchy and Religion both, whether (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) they
may not make ſuch Laws and Proviſions, as may in humane probability prevent
or alleviate ſuch diſmal conſequences. As for inſtance, without reflecting upon
the D. Y. whether he be a Papiſt or not, nor if he were ſo, whether he be
the worſe (as the Character aſſerts) for being one of the moſt Accompliſhed
Perſons in <hi>Europe:</hi> We are only to enquire, <hi>ſays he,</hi> whether if the Religion
Eſtabliſhed by Law in <hi>England,</hi> be a Religion worth our care, and that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
by all lawful means we may endeavour its Preſervation and continuance
among us, and its conſignation to our Coſterity; And that the Religion in
<hi>England</hi> is ſo implicated and involved with the Laws and Government, that
one cannot be invaded but the other muſt be in danger, and if it be neceſſary
to preſerve either or both, and that it is not conſiſtent with Reaſon to expect
this from a Popiſh Succeſſor at any time; Then whether it be not in the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Power (I will not add, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> the Duty and Obligation) of the King in
Poſſeſſion with the Advice and Conſent aforeſaid, to make and paſs a General
Law by Act of Parliament, That no Papiſt whatſoever ſhall at any time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
be capable of Inheriting the Crown, with ſuch other circumſtances as ſhall
be thought neceſſary for ſuch an Act. And firſt, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> here is no wrong
done to any man (for the D. Y. is not yet convict of being ſo) for if the Modes
and Qualifications be lawfully laid, then 'tis not the Law but you that exclude
your ſelf, and the Subjects are excuſed by a Law (as great as that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
them to take the Oath of Allegiance) from ſubmitting to ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified
Perſon. Now though it is urged by ſome (<hi>continues he</hi>) That in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Succeſſions, no Limitations can be laid by any Power upon Earth to
bar the Inheritance, being founded by a Law paramount to all humane and
poſitive Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> The Law of God and Nature: Yet give me leave, <hi>ſays he,</hi>
to ask theſe Gentlemen, whether the Laws of God and Nature have more
force here in <hi>England,</hi> than in any other part of the World? We know very
well that by the Laws they ſpeak of, Proximity of Blood is only to be regarded,
without any other conſideration, either of Religion, Manners, Sex or Age,
even to Ideots and Madmen. How then comes it to paſs, that in <hi>France</hi> an
Hereditary Monarchy of the firſt Magnitude, the Crown is Limited to the
Heirs Males, for whether the <hi>Salique Law</hi> be as old as <hi>Pharamond,</hi> as they
pretend it is, or whether it were only made to ſerve a Turn to exclude our
<hi>Edward</hi> from his Natural Right to that Crown, in Right of his Mother, it
will not be worth the while to enquire at this time a-day, <hi>de Facto,</hi> it is ſo,
and hath been, to the Excluſion of all Females and their Iſſue to this very
time. And though ſome would ſeem to juſtifie the practice with a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Heaven, becauſe there is ſuch a paſſage in the Scripture, <hi>Lilia nec
nent nec laborant,</hi> yet that will ſcarce paſs with any but ſuch as interpret
Scripture <hi>A la mode de France.</hi> So in <hi>Portugal,</hi> where they admit of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
to Inherit the Crown, yet they are Limited to ſuch as Marry within
that Kingdom, and this upon pretence of the Law of <hi>Lamego;</hi> a freſh inſtance
of which is now upon the Stage in the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who being to Marry
with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> in order to make their Iſſue capable of Inheriting
the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> The States of the Nation were Convened, and their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51184:5"/>
Conſent required, for diſpenſing with that Law for this time, and in that Caſe.
And by vertue of that Law the late Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> (Father to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
King and Prince Regent of <hi>Portugal</hi>) was declared King, having Marryed
<hi>Catherine,</hi> a younger Daughter, yet Marryed within the Kingdom; whilſt
the Iſſue of <hi>Mary</hi> though elder Daughter Marryed to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi>
were Excluded, according to that Law of <hi>Lamego.</hi> In <hi>Poland</hi> (though it be
yet an Elective Kingdom) yet their very Elections are Confin'd and Limited
to one that is a <hi>Roman Catholick.</hi> And ſo in ſeveral Parts of <hi>Germany</hi> their
Chief Magiſtrate muſt be alternatively a <hi>Romaniſt</hi> and a <hi>Lutheran.</hi> Now
if all this be well done in theſe Countries notwithſtanding the Divine, Natural
Right of Succeſſion by proximity of Blood; And if every Nation is bound by
the higheſt Law to take care, <hi>Ne quid detrimenti Reſpublica capiat;</hi> And
we ſee other Countries do and have made Laws which they judge moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for the good of thoſe reſpective Countries even to the Limiting the
Succeſſion; How comes it to paſs that we in <hi>England</hi> are deprived of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
that other Countries take in preſerving themſelves and their Government
entire and unſhaken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Queſtion of this nature and probably as important as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
was urg'd by another Friend,</hi> viz. In Caſe the Wiſdom of a King in
Poſſeſſion by the Advice and Conſent aforeſaid: ſhould make ſuch a Law to
Deprive all <hi>Papiſts</hi> from Inheriting the Crown, and ſhould Declare, That ſuch
and ſuch Overt Acts ſhould be a ſufficient conviction in Law to affect ſuch
Perſons of being ſo, and then Entayling the Crown upon the next <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
Heir in Succeſſion: How then ſhould good Subjects behave themſelves in ſuch
a juncture?</p>
            <p>And ſeveral other Queries incident hereunto we had, which I ſhall
not trouble you with at this time, but intreat you to give us your thoughts
of theſe I have mentioned, as freely as we have imparted ours. And
though theſe ſort of Queſtions ſeem a little to confirm or favour the Tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Querie I mentioned at firſt; give me leave to ſay thus much to this
and all other Queries of this nature?</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Teaches
us no other Doctrine than what was Taught by the Apoſtles themſelves,
that is, <hi>Obedience and Submiſſion to Kings and Governours:</hi> and that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are of this or that <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Perſuaſion</hi> (as they now term it)
but purely and abſtractedly <hi>for Conſcience Sake, It is the Ordinance of God,
and he that reſiſteth ſhall receive to himſelf Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, That we ought continually to bleſs God for, and earneſtly pray
for the long Life of our moſt Gracious Sovereign (never one more truly
termed <hi>the Light of our Eyes and the Breath of our Noſtrils</hi>) and then
theſe captious Queries are needleſs of themſelves.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhould pleaſe God to change the Scene, and ſend us a King of
another Temper, I am ſure that then the beſt way to preſerve the <hi>Proteſtant
Religion</hi> is, to be of the ſame mind ſtill, that is to <hi>Fear God and Honour the
King,</hi> and we need not fear but that the God whom we ſerve, who hath
the hearts of Kings in his hands, will ſo order things, that by our peaceable
Converſation in ſuch a juncture, moſt of thoſe diſmal apprehenſions we
are terrified with, will blow over, or if it ſhould prove a ſtorm, it will
be either not violent or not long. And this is ſo peculiarly the Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that I think I may Challenge all the Churches
of the ſeveral perſuaſions in the World, to ſay and prove they hold this
Doctrine; for certainly if it were ſo, Thoſe deſperate Tenents of Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Princes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would never have been heard of in the World; And
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51184:5"/>
whether the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> or the <hi>Presbyter</hi> be moſt guilty in that particular, both
in Doctrine and Practice, would be a ſubject too long and too odious for
to be comprehended within the compaſs of a Letter. To conclude then
this great Caſe and anſwer this curious Querie as poſitively as I can, I
ſhall be bold to affirm, That if Almighty God in his Providence ſhould
pleaſe to ſend us a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prince, The beſt way to preſerve the <hi>Proteſtant
Religion</hi> in the Purity of her Doctrine, is not only to admit him, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to his juſt Authority in all his Lawful Commands. We know no
Arms but thoſe of the old Chriſtian Martyrs, <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears:</hi> We are
alwaies ready to Fight for, never againſt our Prince. We fear Hell more
than <hi>Smithfield;</hi> And aſſuredly if the Princes of the World would impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
weigh the Purity and Simplicity of the Doctrines of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> the Innocency and Decency of her Ceremonies, the Regularity
and Decorum in her Offices and Adminiſtrations, the Integrity and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of her Principles and Manners, they would not only conclude her
to be the beſt Tranſcript of the Original Copy of Primitive Chriſtianity
that is left in the World, but the beſt ſecurity to Eſtabliſh the Thrones of
Kings, and the beſt Rule for Subjects to learn and practiſe that due Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
they owe to Governours. Oh! that I could add, That the Lives
of her Profeſſors were anſwerable to the Doctrines and Principles of their
Profeſſion. For 'tis ſuch a Paradox, as well as Burthen of Spirit to all True,
Sober Proteſtants, to obſerve that generally thoſe that walk moſt ſtrictly
in their Lives, and pretend to have a degree of Sanctity and Holineſs
above other Men, they have no proportion of Submiſſion and Deference
to their Lawful Superiors both in Church and State, with other Men of
leſs Sanctity or Parts. Whilſt on the other ſide thoſe that pretend to have
the greateſt Loyalty for their Prince, and Obedience to all in Authority
under him, do commonly give themſelves too great a Liberty in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Converſation, and Indulge themſelves too much in their ſenſual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
to the reciprocal ſcandal one of another; for whilſt one ſide takes
advantage and ſays, <hi>Look what Lives theſe Loyaliſts lead:</hi> the other returns,
<hi>Obſerve what Principles theſe Zealots hold,</hi> thereby encouraging and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
each other in their half-Chriſtianity. And without peradventure it
will never be well, till one ſide adorns his Loyalty with a Holy-Life, and
the other crowns his Zeal with Loyalty and Obedience. Then ſhould we be
the happieſt People alive, under whatever Diſpenſations of Providence we
may poſſibly fall. Thus begging your pardon for troubling you with our
Country Conceptions, We kiſs your hands and remain,</p>
