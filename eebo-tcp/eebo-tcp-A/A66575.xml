            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To his Grace
JAMES
Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> &amp;c, Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
On his return to that Government.</head>
            <l>NOt that the Soul of Poesy was flown,</l>
            <l>Or wanted Argument to Work upon;</l>
            <l>Or that the Air was thick, or that the Muse</l>
            <l>Was cramm'd with ease, or bedrid with disuse,</l>
            <l>Has she kept state, or Chamber, all this while,</l>
            <l>Or as 'twas thought by some, forsook the Isle;</l>
            <l>But that she mis't, since your departure hence,</l>
            <l>Her Patron, and his wonted influence.</l>
            <l>Banisht from <hi>Plato</hi>'s Comonwealth, and from</l>
            <l>Saint <hi>Austin</hi>'s City, wanting You at home,</l>
            <l>What could she doe? she rov'd or'e ground vntrod,</l>
            <l>Dark as her Fancie, neither track, nor rode;</l>
            <l>Till tir'd with notions, satisfied with none,</l>
            <l>She fancy'd an Idea of her owne.</l>
            <l>A man, of <hi>Plato</hi>'s grand Nobility,</l>
            <l>An imbred greatness, innate honesty;</l>
            <l>A man, not fram'd of Accidents; And whom,</l>
            <l>Misfortune might oppress, not overcome:</l>
            <l>One, who lov'd vertue for her self; and still</l>
            <l>Was good, not by necessity, but will:</l>
            <l>Who did, but what he ought; what's just, and fit;</l>
            <l>And never biast by an Appetite:</l>
            <l>Who weigh'd himself, not by Opinion,</l>
            <l>But Conscience of a Worthy action:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:37743:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Who, like the Sun, by how much higher, the less</l>
            <l>His shaddow: Who never vs'd power, to oppress:</l>
            <l>A man! who might (in this) with <hi>Caesar</hi> vye,</l>
            <l>Forgetting nothing, but an injury.</l>
            <l>Rap't in that melancholy trance, she heard</l>
            <l>The Name of <hi>Ormond!</hi> At that mighty word,</l>
            <l>She stretcht; and fell to ruminate her dream,</l>
            <l>Not guessing yet, whence she had took the theam;</l>
            <l>'Till calling in her Spirits, at next view</l>
            <l>Found, 'twas no more, than what sh'ad sketcht from You,</l>
            <l>You! than in whom (Great Sir) <hi>Achilles</hi> Shield</l>
            <l>Did not more Multitude, nor Mixture yield,</l>
            <l>Nor better put together: As in Paint,</l>
            <l>'Tis not a single Colour makes the Saint,</l>
            <l>Nor all, if not well mingled; There must be,</l>
            <l>Proportion too, and correspondency:</l>
            <l>Such is Your chain of Vertues; What elsewhere</l>
            <l>Lay loose, and scatter'd, are constellat here;</l>
            <l>And those, so truely linkt, 'tis hard to tell</l>
            <l>What's wanting, or, what vnagreeable.</l>
            <l>What but a soul so fram'd, had ever dar'd</l>
            <l>Stemme the late Torrent, and have not despair'd</l>
            <l>His Masters fortune? What? what but a breast</l>
            <l>Lin'd through with <hi>Cato,</hi> durst have stood the Test?</l>
            <l>Or would not, when the Sun did disappear,</l>
            <l>Have kist his hand unto a Meteor?</l>
            <l>Such too, were You; You! who almost alone.</l>
            <l>Durst grasp a Spear, and vnderprop a Crown;</l>
            <l>Durst, Loyalty (when't was a Crime) retrive,</l>
            <l>And force it back to its forsaken Hive.</l>
            <l>But, what am I, who thus persume to raise</l>
            <l>A Trophy, to Your memory, not praise:</l>
            <l>Your Vrne must bloom; And that last Dust stand safe,</l>
            <l>Which has two Kingdoms for an Epitaph:</l>
            <l>Nor can it, till the Sea gives up its dead,</l>
            <l>But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Ossory,</hi> and <hi>Arran,</hi> must be read:</l>
            <l>Yet—while You fill the Land, Your Sons the Sea;</l>
            <l>Where! where (Alas!) shall the next <hi>Ormond</hi> be?</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:37743:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
He must, like <hi>Sultans,</hi> who themselves allow</l>
            <l>To build no <hi>Mosche,</hi> but what their Swords endow,</l>
            <l>He must enlarge, or sweat for want of roome,</l>
            <l>And croud himself within his Grandsires Tombe.</l>
            <l>Tombe! Let it not be nam'd; The Sound's too Sharp;</l>
            <l>May You, yet live, to tune our jarring Harp;</l>
            <l>Sweeten her strings, and make the World confess</l>
            <l>Discords, make Musick more, but Kingdomes less:</l>
            <l>May Your return, like the encrease of <hi>Nile,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Bode the like happy Omen to this Isle:</l>
            <l>Long may You shine, a Star in CHARLES his Wain,</l>
            <l>And, disarm'd Fortune, make attaques in vain:</l>
            <l>Be, like the vpper Region secur'd;</l>
            <l>Not shook by Thunder, nor by Clouds obscur'd:</l>
            <l>Thus live; Thus shine; Thus, Ages read your story;</l>
            <l>And, to Crown all, Exchange Your Grace, for Glory.</l>
