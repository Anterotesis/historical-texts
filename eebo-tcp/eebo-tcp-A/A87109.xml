            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

their ancient honour, Lawes, Libertie, and Language that now ly

that none of our Kings ſince <hi>William</hi> the pretended

whereof on our Princes their Royall Parents ſeeme purpoſely

with what honour they have continually uſed both the name and

will ſo farre transferre him above the honour and felicity of his

to be called and accounted the naturall father of his Countrey,
then the exotick Lord of the ſame, of which titles the very Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants

Nation having been ſervile ever ſince the time of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi>
and no other their language which wee ſo much honour and
dote upon, then an effect of the Romane Conqueſt over them,
and a teſtimony of their long vaſſalage and ſubjection to that
Empire.</p>
            <p>But if they can reliſh no honour but what muſt ariſe and
fetch life from our ſhame, let them revolve how loath they
would be to be ſerved as ſometime the Romans dealt with
the inſulting Gaules, the Relicks of <hi>Brennus</hi> his Army, whom
they utterly rooted out of <hi>Italy, Nequis ejus gentis ſupereſſet

they will needs continue the Danes Succeeders in inſulting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us, they may alſo remember that wee are the poſterity of
thoſe Engliſh who maſſacred them, and that when they had a
potent Kingdome at hand to revenge it, which theſe others are
to ſeeke for.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, State-policy requires it,<note place="margin">3.</note> it being requiſite to the good
and ſafety of the Kingdome in generall;<note place="margin">Ad Ordines ſeu Procuratores Regni.</note> for if ingenuous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
in the people, and their love to their King, State, Nobility
and Lawes, with their regard to honour, be the cheife ſtrength
of a Realme againſt forraine invaſions (for inſtance and teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
whereof we need looke no further then the Scots) it is
neceſſary that if our State would enjoy that ſtrength, our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
enjoy theſe demands; for how can we love and fight for
thoſe Lawes which are ours only by our enemies introduction,
and are our diſgrace in ſtead of honour, or for that Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Nobility, in whoſe very Titles (as before is related)
we read our Countrey to be already in Captivity, and that the
alteration of the State will be to us, but changing of uſurpant
Maſters? Neither will the recordation of our ancient honour be
any better a provocation to that purpoſe; ſhould the Turke go
about to exhort his Grecian Souldiers to valiantneſſe in his
cauſe and againſt his forraine Enemies, by commemorating
unto them the ancient glory and proweſſe of their Nation,
would not that cohortation merit to be taken as an inſulting irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and ſhould not the firſt effect there of be a vindictive incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114467:14"/>
of them againſt himſelfe as the moſt proper object there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in all reſpects, ſo alſo cannot the remembrance of our anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
glory (if we conſider our ſelves aright) incite us to any
thing more then to the clearing of our ſelves from this inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Conqueſt; as already and long ſince preſſing us with that
diſhonour, which other dangers at moſt but threaten; and as
upon theſe grounds, wee can ſcarce find courage to fight for
the ſafety and preſervation of the State, ſo for the ſame reaſons
have we as little heart to pray or wiſh for the ſame, untill our
Nationall honour be reſtored to a coexiſtence therewith.</p>
            <p>Since therefore theſe things are ſo behoofefull for our Nation
to demand,<note place="margin">Peroratio.</note> and for our State to grant, if after due conſideration
thereof we continue to want the happy fruition of the ſame, it
muſt be aſcribed either to an overgrown baſeneſſe of mind in the
one, or an natural malignity in the other as indulging rather to a
forrain Name then to the Nation wherof the ſaid State is a part
and intruſted with the welfare and honor therof; and in this ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervilizing

to honour or renownedneſſe, but more proper for us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to profeſſe our ſelves of that quality wherein we take up
