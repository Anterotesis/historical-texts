         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Where (by the way, before I paſſe any further) let me only give a touch upon an <hi>error,</hi> then which I do not know any that theſe luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant times have put forth of more dangerous conſequence, <hi>viz. That things indifferent, when commanded, ſhould become unlawful;</hi> ſuch <hi>rocks</hi> the ſhifting of the wind of late hath carried men upon: not long ſince the tenet was; <hi>Things indifferent, when commanded, become neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary:</hi> now on the other hand, <hi>Things indifferent, when commanded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unlawfull,</hi> extreames both, like <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis;</hi> it is not eaſie to ſay whether of the two the more dangerous. I have given a <hi>caveat</hi> touching the one already, let me now do as much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: That <hi>authority by commanding things indifferent ſhould make them unlawfull,</hi> how can this be? if ſo, ſure the ground and reaſon of this unlawfullneſſe, muſt be either in the <hi>authority commanding,</hi> or in the <hi>thing commanded,</hi> or in the <hi>perſon obeying:</hi> now for the former of theſe, the <hi>authority</hi> being lawfull cannot leave ſuch a <hi>taint</hi> upon things, that by touching of them, medling with them, it ſhould make them of <hi>lawfull unlawfull.</hi> As for the ſecond, the <hi>things</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are not changed, the <hi>nature</hi> of them is not altered; if <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 15.</note>they were <hi>indifferent</hi> before, they are <hi>indifferent</hi> ſtill, <hi>viz.</hi> in reference to <hi>conſcience.</hi> As for the third, the <hi>perſons</hi> obeying being <hi>pure,</hi> all <hi>things are pure</hi> to them. How then can it be, that by paſſing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the hands of authority, things ſhould contract ſuch a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne quality,</hi> that of indifferent they ſhould become <hi>unlawfull?</hi> for my own part I muſt profeſſe, that amongſt all the monſtrous and miſhapen conceptions which theſe brooding teeming times have hatched and brought forth, I do not know any more prodigious then this. Certainly the Primitive times were never acquainted with ſuch a Doctrine. The <hi>Decrees</hi> pointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at in the Text, they were

moſtly about things in their own nature <hi>indifferent;</hi> yet the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell impoſeth them, prohibiting the Churches for a time the uſe of things otherwiſe lawfull. Now (ſurely) had they apprehended that their impoſition would have changed the nature of things, ſo as to make them of indifferent unlawful, they would ne'r have had any hand in <hi>commanding,</hi> nor yet the Churches in <hi>obeying.</hi> But I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to reaſon any further againſt that, for which, I ſuppoſe, ſcarce a ſhadow of reaſon can be given: I rather paſſe on to ſome other <hi>Objections</hi> and <hi>Allegations,</hi> which finding them to be but bladders full of wind, I ſhall only prick them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

I remember it is an obſervation of our late pious and reverend Doctor <hi>Preſton</hi> touching the <hi>wayes of God,</hi> that <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. p. 203.</note>

But to imagine, that either the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in <hi>delivering,</hi> or they in <hi>receiving,</hi> required or yeelded a <hi>blinde obedience,</hi> is fouly injurious to both.
